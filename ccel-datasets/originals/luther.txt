PREFATORY NOTE.

   THIS volume has been for some years out of print. After the publication
   of two editions, the opportunity of reprinting passed while my time was
   otherwise occupied. The interest awakened in Luther this summer led me
   to a renewed study of the subject; [1] and I have described more at
   length some points in the career of the great Reformer, and especially
   the many-sidedness of his life and character, as depicted in the
   Tischreden.' The sketch thus enlarged may be welcome to many readers;
   and the contrast presented in the second sketch of the volume between
   the German and Genevan Reformers helps to bring out the characteristics
   of both. Besides the additions made to the chapter on Luther, I have
   carefully revised the volume throughout.

   In some cases I have altered the spelling of the names; but others,
   such as "Wicliffe" and "Huss," I have let alone, although well aware
   that the more approved spelling is now "Wiclif" and "Hus." In a popular
   book it seemed affectation to change such well-known names. For the
   same reason, I have not entered into such minute questions as the exact
   form of Luther's "memorable words" at Worms, and other points regarding
   which discussion has been recently raised. These matters are not
   unimportant; but they do not affect the estimate I have given of
   Luther's career and character.

INTRODUCTION.

   THE Reformation of the sixteenth century can only be fully understood
   when we recognise it as the result of a long preparation. On the first
   view it seems a sudden outburst of spiritual life and intellectual
   freedom, led on by a few great men, whose energy and success appear
   almost miraculous in the face of the obstacles amidst which they
   contend; but, on a nearer and more comprehensive inspection, we discern
   several series of converging forces running through the preceding ages,
   all tending towards the same end,--and whose long-gathering impulse, as
   represented and expressed in the Leaders of the movement, more than
   anything else, precipitates the crisis. These Leaders must always fix
   our main attention: they not only cover the scenes of the actual
   movement by their great figures, but what they said and did forms the
   highest expression of the spiritual and intellectual influences
   previously in operation, and which then reached their highest point of
   development. Yet these men will also be better appreciated, when we
   view the gradual lines of advance which they headed, the "increasing
   purpose" of reform which manifested itself in the earlier centuries,
   and which, continually stifled and interrupted, nevertheless renewed
   itself with a deepening intention and meaning. The great actors on the
   stage become more intelligible and more interesting when we obtain a
   glimpse of the springs which moved them, and the prior and
   long-maturing conditions out of which their teaching and influence
   grew.

   The preparation which led to the great crisis of the sixteenth century,
   may be said to carry us back to the first ages. The light of primitive
   truth was never entirely extinguished. It flickered indeed but feebly
   amid the encroaching darkness, yet we can still trace it here and
   there; and when the earliest Reformers appealed, as they did, to the
   primitive and apostolical character of their teaching in contrast to
   the sacerdotal corruptions and abuses against which they protested,
   there is no reason to doubt that their appeal often rested on a true
   succession of "simpler manners and purer laws," which had never been
   altogether lost. This succession appears especially in the south of
   Europe, along the Mediterranean coast, and in the romantic country
   which separates Italy from what we now call France. From Vigilantius,
   the opponent of Jerome, and the earnest denouncer of the increasing
   licence of monasticism in the fifth century, to Claude of Turin in the
   beginning of the ninth century--who distinguished himself by hostility
   to the idol-worship patronised at Rome, and who declared, as to the
   Pontiff, that "he is not to be called apostolic who merely occupies the
   apostolic seat, but he who fulfils the functions of an apostle,"--there
   were, no doubt, many witnesses to the like truth and faith which they
   defended. The same Alpine valleys which sheltered the last days of
   Vigilantius, saw the rise of Claude, and it is not likely that in the
   interval there should have been an entire lack of the reformatory
   spirit which animated them. There is reason to think, indeed, that the
   spirit which three centuries later broke out with such intrepid
   intensity in these very valleys, had lived on from the very first ages,
   obscure, and often ignorant, but never altogether submissive or
   absorbed in the ecclesiastical life, which spread from Rome, and sought
   to mould everything to its own dictates.

   Rome, however, made a steady advance during all this period. From the
   alleged donation of Constantine to the grants of Pepin, it continued to
   grow in power and in centralised dominion. When, in return for the
   protection and privileges conceded to it, Leo III. placed the imperial
   crown of the West on the brow of Charlemagne (800), the Papacy may be
   said to have been fully consolidated, and to have entered upon the
   career of triumph which, amid all temporary reverses and disgraceful
   pollutions, it maintained for five centuries. From the middle of the
   eleventh to the close of the thirteenth century its career culminated.
   This is the time of its greatest ascendancy, of its proudest
   names--Gregory VII. (Hildebrand), Innocent III., and Boniface VIII. By
   the light of these names, separated from each other by about a century,
   [2] we trace the highest successes of the Roman Pontificate. It reigned
   supreme, not only in the realm of religious thought, and over all the
   movements of ecclesiastical life, but it claimed to be the arbiter
   between contending sovereigns, to exercise feudal as well as spiritual
   supremacy over many kingdoms, and even to dispose of crowns, and award
   empire according to its will.

   The spirit of religious opposition had sunk to its lowest ebb during
   the earliest part of this period. Throughout the tenth and eleventh
   centuries, there is no reforming name which can be said to arrest our
   attention. The following age, however, was destined to be one of
   extraordinary intellectual and religious conflict. While the Papacy
   reached its most scornful height towards the close of the twelfth
   century, and was enthusiastically supported by some of the most
   striking manifestations, both of its thought and activity,--the
   mysticism of Bernard, the scholasticism of Peter Lombard, the fierce
   bigotry of the Crusades--a series of reformatory energies at the same
   time broke out, and assailed it from different sides. Two of these were
   of an especially powerful and interesting character. The one,
   intellectual in its origin, passed into a movement of practical reform,
   directed against the overgrown temporal power of the Pope and the
   clergy generally; the other, spiritual in its beginning, maintained
   throughout an entirely religious character. The former is deeply
   important in its twofold speculative and political aspect the latter
   moves us by the terrible pathos of the sufferings which mark its
   course, and the tragic picturesqueness of its incidents. Abelard and
   Arnold of Brescia are the great names which signalise the one; Peter
   Waldo, the poor men of Lyons, and the peasants of the Cevennes and the
   Val de Sesia are the heroes of the other. Both were crushed beneath the
   heel of the triumphant hierarchical despotism, but both left their
   enduring trace on the mind of Europe.

   It may seem singular to conjoin Abelard and Arnold of Brescia--the
   profound and subtle intellectualist and the stern practical
   reformer--the philosopher and the demagogue but there is no doubt that
   Arnold imbibed his spirit of life and zeal from Abelard, although it
   assumed in him a very different direction from that which distinguished
   it in his great master. When the latter retired from the Abbey of St
   Denis to a lonely priory near Troyes, Arnold was one of the eager and
   enthusiastic students who gathered in crowds around the famous teacher.
   His intellectual independence and ethical ardour kindled in Arnold an
   intense disgust at the worldly lives of the clergy, and led him to
   devote himself to an energetic mission of reform on his return to his
   native country. He appeared as the apostle of a primitive simplicity,
   setting an example, in his own life, of complete self-denial to all the
   pleasures of the world, and calling upon the clergy to renounce their
   secular callings and worldly positions. A secularised church, he held,
   was no longer a true church, and priests and bishops plunged in the
   affairs of the world were no longer the true ministers of Him whose
   kingdom was not of this world. The inspiring idea of all his movements
   was to restore the purity of the early faith, and to renovate the
   spiritual order after the pattern of the apostolic ritual. The
   influence of Arnold extended. widely. Many who did not sympathise with
   his religious sentiments, hailed him as the hero of a political
   emancipation from the Papacy. Expelled from Brescia, he fled for a time
   beyond the Alps and settled in Zurich, where he may have scattered the
   seeds which afterwards ripened into the teaching of Zwingli; but the
   popular spirit which had spread in Italy, very much as the result of
   his teaching, drew him back to Rome in 1145, where he and his party
   established a republic, and for nearly ten years upheld its ascendancy.
   Under the terrors of an interdict, however, he was again expelled. He
   sought shelter in Campania, but was at length seized by order of the
   Emperor, transferred to Rome, and executed with such secrecy and
   despatch, that the mode of his death remains uncertain. Only one thing
   is known, that his ashes were flung into the Tiber, lest the devoted
   populace should pay honour to the remains of the martyr to their
   liberties.

   This abortive but magnanimous movement of Arnold is only one of many
   symptoms of revolt that marked the first half of the twelfth century.
   We have mentioned how it connected itself with the teaching of Abelard
   and Abelard himself, in his inquisitive and rationalistic theology, may
   be said to follow, although he does not appear to have been influenced
   by Berengar of Tours, in the end of the preceding century. Differing in
   many respects, and without any common aim, these three names stand
   forth together as antagonists of Catholicism in the greatness of its
   fame. Nor do they stand alone. In the south of France, where the
   spiritual agitation of the times seems to have been concentrated,
   various disturbing elements may be traced.--some of them the mere
   reflex of the great Manichean schism, casting forth its troubled
   energies from. the East, but others of them of native growth, marking
   the insurrection of the religious principle in behalf of evangelical
   simplicity and practical earnestness.

   The distinction should be carefully observed between these two classes
   of phenomena. Sometimes they may have mingled with and crossed one
   another. The Bogomiles, the Catharists, and the Pasagians, are apt to
   appear confounded with the Petrobrusians and Henricians; but they were
   in reality very different. The former were all offshoots from the
   decaying trunk of Manicheism--expiring fragments of the great Gnostic
   heresy, which, attacking Christianity in the beginning of the second
   century, clung to it with a fatal tenacity through the most varying
   developments. They have no interest in our point of view. They were not
   signs of reviving health. Their opposition to Rome did not spring from
   any new excitement of the religious feeling. They were sects by long
   descent, and dragged out their existence in the midst of persecution
   from the mere lingering strength of the profound but half-forgotten
   principle in which they originated, rather than from any vitality of
   spiritual coherence. The latter were the expressions of a really
   reforming Christian spirit. Occupying in part the same area as the
   others, they have no affinity with them, save in opposition to the
   Papacy. Springing from within the bosom of the Church, they mark an
   awakening spiritual life, and not a decaying intellectual subtlety.

   Peter of Brueys was a preacher of Languedoc, and Henry, a monk of
   Cluny. The restoration of a simple and less worldly religion was the
   aim of both, called forth by the same spectacle of ecclesiastical
   corruption which had moved Arnold of Brescia. Along with this practical
   bent we detect in the former certain theoretical tendencies similar to
   those of the later Anabaptist; but upon the whole a spiritual zeal and
   earnestness for the truth governed both. Both, like Arnold, were
   eminently preachers of righteousness, and not theosophists or
   rationalising mystics. They were the forerunners, in fact, of the great
   spiritual movement which burst forth in the second half of the century,
   and which, as it was more pervading and permanent, has become more
   historical than their comparatively insulated efforts. It absorbed
   these latter, and gathered under a common name the wide-spread
   spiritual excitement which at this time had nearly alienated from the
   Church of Rome the whole of the south of France, the fair region of
   Provençal song and civilisation. It was this, more than any singular
   power in their leader, or any traditionary inheritance of the truth,
   such as has been sometimes arrogated to them, that gave to the
   Waldensian, or, to adopt the still more general name, the Albigensian
   movement, which marks the close of the twelfth and the beginning of the
   thirteenth century, its great significance and most lasting influence.
   The spiritual forces which had been long in action, springing out here
   and there, at length spread themselves into a general stream, which
   drew the attention of the whole Church, and required the most
   consummate efforts of policy and cruelty to counteract and destroy it.

   The special origin of the Waldenses seems clearly settled,
   notwithstanding the controversy which has gathered round the subject.
   Peter Waldo (Pierre de Vault) was a rich citizen of Lyons in the middle
   of the twelfth century. While attending a meeting of his
   fellow-citizens, one of them suddenly fell down and expired. The
   incident made a deep impression upon him, and returning home he
   resolved to give himself to the study and advancement of religion. He
   disposed of his wealth among the poor, assumed himself the garb of
   poverty, and invited others to share with him a life of evangelical
   simplicity and self-denial. In so far, we see in him only the same
   characteristic reaction against clerical worldliness that distinguishes
   all the Reformers of the period; but his love of Scripture, and the
   means which he took to promote its knowledge, give to his labours a
   peculiar and enduring stamp. Unsatisfied with the mere fragments of
   Scripture retailed by the preachers or accessible in the ritual of the
   Church, he employed two persons with competent attainments to translate
   for him the whole of the Gospels, and other portions of the Bible, into
   the Romance language. These he studied with great avidity, and
   multiplied and spread abroad copies among the people. Gradually he had
   the whole or the greater part of Scripture translated and widely
   circulated; and from this source of knowledge and quickening, more than
   from anything else, the movement connected with his name made progress
   and gathered a permanent meaning and influence. This connection with
   Scripture, and the vigorous and unextravagant evangelical life which
   was the consequence, signalise the Waldensian Reformation from the
   similar attempts that mark the age, and enabled it to absorb them,
   thereby warranting the popular idea which brings the Waldensian
   movement more prominently than any that preceded it into connection
   with the Great Reformation.

   Peter Waldo and his followers seem at first to have had no inclination
   to separate from the Church. They desired rather to be recognised
   within the Church--to be allowed to study Scripture and follow their
   self-chosen mission of instructing the ignorant and neglected under its
   highest sanctions. For this purpose, when they were forbidden by the
   Archbishop of Lyons to expound Scripture, they appealed to the Pope,
   Alexander III. They sent delegates to Rome, bearing a copy of their
   Romance version of the Bible, and soliciting the approval of the Holy
   See to their formation into a spiritual society. The knowledge of this
   fact we derive from the account of an English Franciscan monk, [3] who
   was present in Rome at the time, and who has left us a graphic account
   of the external aspect of the poor men of Lyons, as they appeared in
   the streets of the Holy City, but who discovers too plainly, at the
   same time, that he did not understand the spirit that animated them.
   "They go about barefoot, two by two," he says, "in woollen garments,
   possessing nothing, but, like the apostles, having all things in
   common--following naked Him who had not where to lay his head." The
   Pope appointed a commission to converse with the poor men, and inquire
   into their story. The members of the commission, of whom the Franciscan
   monk was one, performed their part ill. When they could find no harm or
   heresy in the men, they sought to cover them with ridicule, and by
   their advice the Pope refused the request of the deputation. It was one
   of those critical moments in the history of the Papacy when its usual
   penetration and policy forsook it, and its very consciousness of
   strength proved a source of weakness. The opportunity once passed, it
   could never be recalled. The Waldenses. had no wish to separate from
   the Church; but the thought of abandoning their mission of Scriptural
   instruction and preaching never entered into the minds of these simple
   men, and the result was, they were driven outside of the Church, to
   which they might have given a new life and strength, throughout the
   south of Europe. Innocent III., with his higher discernment, saw the
   mistake of his predecessors, and sought to correct it by forming the
   now widely spread sect into a church society of Pauperes Catholici, but
   it was then too late. They had by that time learned to look with
   indifference on the sanction of the Church, and assumed somewhat of an
   attitude of hostility to it.

   In the course of thirty years the poor men of Lyons had multiplied into
   the great Albigensian sect, covering the whole of the south of France.
   It was in 1170 that the deputation waited in Rome the decision of the
   Lateran Council in their case; it was in the opening of the thirteenth
   century that a special embassage, headed by no fewer than three papal
   legates, met on its pompous journey a Spanish ecclesiastic, who
   condoled with its members on the almost universal disaffection towards
   the Church of the fair district through which they passed. Something
   more than condolence, however, was already moving the heart of St
   Dominic. He saw far more clearly than his companions the real state of
   matters, and the remedy that was needed. "It is not by the display of a
   pompous procession, by the celebration of worldly dignity and a host of
   retainers," he said, "that the cause of the truth will be advanced
   among these poor and ignorant, but zealous and simple-minded people.
   Zeal like theirs must be met by zeal, humility by humility, preaching
   falsehood by preaching the truth." Such was the great work which he
   undertook amongst them. Now, as later, zeal called forth zeal,
   earnestness without the Church awoke earnestness within it; and
   Dominic, at the head of his black friars, was the historical reaction,
   within the Church of. Rome, of Peter Waldo and his followers without
   it. Dominic, however, or at any rate his followers, soon brought more
   than spiritual weapons to their aid. The Inquisition, with all its
   gloomy horrors, was set up in Toulouse, and its secret and terrible
   power soon reached to every village and family of the suspected
   heretics. Unmoved by friars' preaching, unyielding before the darkest
   tortures, the bloody sword of the Crusader was finally invoked to crush
   the poor peasants of Languedoc. Under the leadership of one of those
   men who live in history, branded by its vilest stigma of religious
   ruffianism--Simon de Montfort--a war of devastation was carried into
   those beautiful provinces. Men, women, and children were massacred or
   driven from their homes to seek a precarious shelter amid the wild
   fastnesses and lonely valleys, whose romance still receives its most
   hallowed charm from the sanctified memory of their faith and the
   pathetic glory of their sufferings.

   Temporarily strengthened by such a bloody triumph and the earnestness
   and zeal everywhere called forth by her new mendicant orders, the
   Church of Rome seemed once more alone in its proud predominance--its
   enemies crushed and its members elated with the fire of a freshly
   kindled energy. During a century and a half longer, it may be said to
   have maintained the unchallenged ascendancy to which the rivalrous zeal
   of Dominican and Franciscan, the tortures of the Inquisition, and the
   sword of the Crusader had once more raised it. This long period,
   indeed, was not without witnesses to the reforming earnestness for
   which Arnold of Brescia and Peter of Brueys had suffered, and the
   simple truth for which the poor men of Lyons had been massacred or
   driven from their homes. Robert Grostête, of Lincoln, by his simple and
   quiet dignity, and blameless holiness of life, withstood the insolent
   pride of Innocent III. in his last years. William of Occam attacked the
   scandals of the Papacy by his withering satire. The Fraticelli and
   Spirituals, as they were called among the Franciscans, and many of the
   Tertiaries or secular fraternity attached to the same body, raised
   their voice against the disorders of the Church; and in a book,
   entitled the Everlasting Gospel,' supposed to be the production of the
   Abbot Joachim, anticipated a reformation destined to come through the
   humble power of the preaching of the Word. The spirit of evangelical
   purity and simple-minded and benevolent zeal which so prominently
   characterised the movements of the twelfth century, continued to live,
   especially in Flanders and Germany, in societies known under various
   names, such as Beghards and Cellites, and the "Vineyard of the Lord."
   Through these different undercurrents the unextinguished Christian life
   of the twelfth century propagated itself onward to the fourteenth
   century, but none of them assumed any historical prominence; in none of
   them did the opposition to Rome rise into any consistent vitality or
   vigour.

   In the course of the fourteenth century, the Papacy, by its own
   weakness, may be said to have invited the extensive movement of
   opposition which then again set in against it. The enforced residence
   of the Popes at Avignon during the first seventy years of the century,
   and the disgraceful schism which followed their return to Rome, and
   lasted for the next forty years, proclaimed the weakness of the great
   power which had hitherto governed Christendom. Not only so, but those
   very orders whose first institution had done so much to reinvigorate
   Catholicism, and before whose preaching and regular organisation no
   less than before the sword of the Crusader and the arm of civil
   authority, the heretics had been crushed and driven out of sight, had
   now yielded almost everywhere to the process of corruption that seemed
   inherent in every species of monasticism. The friars, black and grey,
   had ceased to be the self-sacrificing and earnest preachers that in the
   beginning they had been. Their simplicity and zeal had perished, and
   ignorance and cupidity taken their place. They wandered about from
   country to country, vending relics and disposing of pardons to the
   highest bidders: their sermons had become mere fables--"chronicles of
   the world, and stories from the siege of Troy." The ignorant crowds
   that gathered around them in the villages through which they passed
   were pleasantly deluded by their lies; their letters of fraternity were
   a passport to self-indulgence. It is not to be wondered at that a cry
   of indignation arose against them from many of the regular clergy, as
   well as all in whom there remained any reality of religion.

   It was at such a time that John Wicliffe appeared, the greatest of all
   the "Reformers before the Reformation," and who initiated a movement
   which not only spread throughout England and the south and west of
   Scotland, but also reached to Bohemia, and whose suppressed but
   powerful agitations lasted till the great outbreak of the sixteenth
   century. There are two distinct periods in the reforming career of
   Wicliffe, in the first of which he appears as the great opponent of the
   Mendicants, and the intrepid advocate of national rights and liberties
   against the usurpations of the Papacy--in the second of which he
   assumes the higher character of a doctrinal reformer, denouncing not
   merely the ecclesiastical abuses but the false teaching of the Papacy.
   In both points of view he rises far above all preceding Reformers, if
   not in the consistency and heroism of his character, in the clear and
   thorough comprehension of the principles from which he argued, and in
   the intellectual power and moral dignity with which he maintained them.
   We recognise in him, the more we know of him, a man who was not merely
   moved by a violent hatred of the papistical abuses amidst which he
   lived, and who stood forward in a half-political, half-religious
   attitude against them, but who was moreover animated by the most
   liberal culture of his day, and took a foremost rank among the leaders
   of its thought. He remains undoubtedly the greatest reforming spirit
   that England has produced--the hero, more than any one that has
   followed him, of its democratic religious sympathies--the embodiment,
   in the fourteenth century, of the principles and energies which, in
   every Protestant country more than in England in the sixteenth century,
   brought forth men of heroic mould, reaching far above their
   contemporaries.

   Wicliffe's hostility to the monks was first stimulated by his regard
   for the privileges and interests of the University of Oxford, of which,
   in the course of twenty years of residence, [4] first as a scholar, and
   then as a fellow of Merton College, he had become a distinguished
   member. The Mendicants swarmed in Oxford as in Paris and the other
   universities, and strove zealously to acquire and keep all academic
   influence in their hands. They sought to regulate the degrees according
   to their pleasure, and to facilitate, in defiance of certain statutes,
   the course by which a youth could become one of their number. Parents
   became alarmed, and students rapidly and greatly diminished. The
   university was violently divided; and Wicliffe, not content with
   resistance to them on this particular matter, boldly denounced their
   whole system as an imposture.

   A dispute affecting his own academic position and rights no doubt
   quickened his zeal. He had been appointed to the head of Balliol Hall,
   and almost immediately afterwards to the head of a new college
   instituted by Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, which received the name
   of Canterbury Hall. According to its original constitution, this
   college was to be partly composed of monks and of secular priests; but
   the keen rivalry of the two classes rendered such a constitution
   impracticable. The archbishop accordingly expelled the monks and the
   warden, whom he had set at their head, filled their place with secular
   students, and appointed Wicliffe to be warden; but, having died in the
   following year, the new primate, Langham, himself a monk, restored the
   expelled members and their former warden to their position, and in fact
   converted the new college into a monastic establishment. Wicliffe
   appealed to Rome, although with little hope of receiving justice in
   such a quarter.

   While Wicliffe's own case was still pending at Rome, a question of
   great national importance occurred betwixt the King of England and the
   Papacy. Urban V. had made a demand for the payment of the arrears of
   the one thousand merks which Innocent III. had extorted from King John
   as the annual acknowledgment of the alleged fealty of the kingdom to
   the Roman See. The tax had been intermitted for thirty-three years, and
   the unwise demand for it was encountered on the part of nobles and King
   with proud and high-hearted resistance. "Julius Cæsar exacted tribute
   by force, which can give no perpetual right; let the Pope come and take
   it by force--I am ready to stand up and resist him." Such was the
   spirit that animated not only one of the warlike peers that Edward
   consulted in his council-chamber, but the country. After all that had
   happened, and with the red blood of Cressy and Poictiers still fresh in
   the memories of men who had gloried in the national triumph, it was not
   to be supposed that a French Pope should be quietly permitted to exact
   tribute from England. Wicliffe, who had been advanced to be one of the
   King's chaplains, and who, in this capacity, had been present at the
   debate on the subject in the King's council, was called upon to reply
   to a defence of the papal claim which had been anonymously sent abroad.
   He ingeniously set forth his arguments in the name of the bold barons
   who had resolved to resist the claim; and in this manner, while
   protecting himself as yet from direct conflict with the ecclesiastical
   authorities, he assumed the front, as it were, in a great national
   movement against the pretensions of the Papacy. Occupying such a
   position, it may be imagined that his interests were not likely to
   thrive in Rome; and in 1370, accordingly, decision was pronounced
   against him in reference to the wardenship of Canterbury Hall.

   This result did not seriously affect his position at Oxford. He was
   appointed Doctor and Professor of Divinity; and from this time we may
   date the growing enlightenment of his mind as to the whole subject of
   the Papacy, the unscriptural character of its doctrines, at well as the
   unnational and degrading effects of its worldly pretensions. For some
   time still, however, we merely see him in the capacity of a practical
   reformer, leading on a general national movement supported by the King
   and the Parliament. Great dissatisfaction had long prevailed at the
   papal interference with the royal patronage in the appointment to
   livings, and especially at the number of rich benefices bestowed upon
   foreign prelates, and the constant drain of the national resources in
   consequence toward the papal court. The grievance was of old standing;
   and, in order to avert it, the first statute of Provisors had been
   passed in the reign of Edward I. The abuse, however, had continued, to
   the indignation of the Parliament as well as the King. The most
   determined resolutions were formed to withstand all further
   encroachments of the papal see. The Pope, on his part, complained that
   his apostolic briefs were not allowed to be published in England, and
   that his nuncios were ignominiously prevented from entering the
   country. A commission was appointed to confer with the papal legate at
   Bruges on the disputed point, and Wicliffe was nominated as second in
   the commission. The result of the negotiation was a compromise between
   the contending parties, which removed special difficulties that had
   occurred in the course of the dispute, but which did not attempt to
   deal with the general question, and settle the rights on either side.

   On his return Wicliffe was promoted to a prebend, and received the
   Rectory of Lutterworth, so associated with his last years. He may be
   said to have now stood at the height of his fame--a name of power in
   the country, allied with that of his great friend and protector the
   Duke of Gaunt, the King's brother--a terror to the monks--an
   apprehension to the hierarchy. His brief residence at Bruges, and what
   he learned there in intercourse with the papal legates, had deepened
   his dislike to the system, and at length he hesitated not to attack it
   openly. The Pope had become to him Antichrist,--"the proud worldly
   priest of Rome--the most cursed of clippers and purse-kervers!" The
   extortionate spirit which the Papacy everywhere manifested kindled his
   keenest indignation. "Though our realm had a huge hill of gold," he
   said, "and never another man took therefrom but only this proud worldly
   priest-collector, in process of time the hill would be spent; for he is
   ever taking money out of our land, and rendering nothing back but God's
   curse for his simony, and some accursed clerk of Antichrist to rob the
   land more for wrongful privilege, or else leave to do God's will, which
   men should do without his leave." Looking to the frightful evils which
   had sprung out of the worldly grasping of the clergy, with the Court of
   Rome at their head, Wicliffe was led to adopt views fundamentally at
   variance with all right of Church property and the endowment of the
   Church. The Roman bishop who accepted the endowed protection of
   Constantine, he considered to have introduced ecclesiastical
   corruption, and he boldly and passionately called upon the King and
   Parliament to withdraw the temporal property of the Church, and restore
   it to its primitive condition of evangelical purity and usefulness;
   for, "by reducing the clergy to meekness and useful piety, and ghostly
   travail, as lived Christ and His apostles, sin should be destroyed, and
   holiness of life brought in, and secular law strengthened, and the poor
   communion aided, and good government, both spiritual and temporal, come
   again; and, what is best of all, as Christ's Word would run to and fro
   freely everywhere, many men would wing their way to heaven."

   It was not to be supposed that sentiments such as these should long
   pass unnoticed. The hierarchy were watching their opportunity against
   the Reformer; and, at a meeting of Convocation in the beginning of
   1377, he was summoned to be examined as to his opinions. Courtenay,
   Bishop of London, now, as afterwards when raised to the primacy,
   distinguished himself as his chief opponent. Wicliffe obeyed the
   summons, and on the 19th February attended at St Paul's, the place of
   citation--but not alone. His friend John of Gaunt and Lord Percy, earl
   marshal, accompanied him. An immense and excited crowd had collected,
   whose sympathies appear to have been by no means in favour of reform.
   The popular feeling at the time ran high against the great Duke, who
   was supposed to cherish sinister designs against the young Richard, son
   of the Black Prince, who had been the idol of the nation, and whose
   death, during the previous year, was still deeply mourned. It was the
   outbreak of this feeling, no doubt, that Wicliffe now experienced. With
   difficulty could he and his friends get admittance to the chapel; and
   the wild scene which ensued, when at length they forced their entrance,
   is graphically narrated by the historians. Courtenay and John of Gaunt
   broke out into a violent altercation. As the fierce words of the Duke
   that he would drag the bishop out of the church by the hair of the head
   circulated, an irresistible tumult rose among the multitude outside.
   The assembly was broken up, and Wicliffe escaped under the protection
   of his friends. The popular excitement, however, vented itself against
   the Duke's palace; it was attacked, the arms on it reversed, and the
   palace itself would have been burnt to the ground but for the
   intervention of the bishop.

   Foiled for the time in their aims, the bishops resolved to call in the
   papal authority to their help. Information of Wicliffe's opinions was
   despatched to Avignon, and their condemnation solicited. The Pope,
   Gregory VI., eagerly responded to the call, and replied by five bulls,
   three addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops, one
   to the King, and one to the University of Oxford, commanding an inquest
   into the erroneous doctrines attributed to the Reformer. As the
   consequence of these proceedings, Wicliffe was summoned before the
   prelates at Lambeth. The meeting took place in the spring of 1378, and
   no fewer than eighteen articles were exhibited against him, but none of
   them, as yet, touching any point of doctrine. They mainly concerned his
   principles as to Church property and the validity of Church censures.
   On this occasion he was no longer backed by his noble friends. The
   accession of Richard II. in the interval had changed the tactics of
   John of Gaunt, and withdrawn him at least from open connection with the
   Reformer. He had now, however, a more powerful backing. The popular
   feeling had turned toward him with enthusiasm, and its impatient and
   threatening manifestation awed the Assembly. When it had scarcely
   commenced, it was hurriedly closed by the entrance of Sir John
   Clifford, who, in the name of the Dowager Princess of Wales, commanded
   the bishops to desist from further proceedings. They barely had time to
   lay upon Wicliffe an injunction to refrain from preaching the obnoxious
   doctrines when they dispersed. The Catholic historian, Walsingham,
   contemplates their easy conduct with indignation. "As reeds shaken by
   the wind," he says, "their speech became soft as oil, to their own
   discredit and the degradation of the Church: they were panic-stricken
   as men that hear not, and in whose mouth there is no reproof."

   Wicliffe was now the recognised head of an extensive reaction against
   the hierarchy. His own views became enlarged, and his untiring energies
   sought additional means of influence, and more familiar channels for
   diffusing his opinions. He entered upon his great work of translating
   the Scriptures, and as he progressed in it, he began to question the
   doctrines, as well as the external powers and prerogatives, of the
   Church. He especially attacked the doctrine of transubstantiation, He
   denied that the substance of the bread after consecration was
   destroyed, according to the current view; it was only exalted to a
   nobler substance. It did not cease to be bread although it became the
   body of Christ. The Duke of Lancaster and others warned him that they
   could not follow him in the perilous path on which he had now entered.
   But Wicliffe no longer sought for such encouragement: he was firm in
   his own strong and brightening convictions. By his indefatigable
   exertions the Scriptures were widely circulated, and his opinions
   spread abroad. He had a numerous retinue of poor preachers, who
   itinerated from village to village, carrying copies of parts of the
   Scriptures with them. The common people heard them gladly, and the
   silly sermons of the monks were neglected. Many of the burghers and
   middle class adhered to his views, and lent their countenance in the
   diffusion of the Bible. His influence seemed likely to grow into a
   great schism, which might have alienated the greater part of the nation
   from Rome.

   The time, however, was not yet ripe. A series of popular commotions,
   which, in their origin, had no connection with the dissemination of
   Wicliffe's opinions, but which were easily identified with them in the
   minds of the timid and the prudent, broke forth throughout England. The
   sack of London, the murder of the archbishop, the wild levelling
   doctrines proclaimed by the leaders of the movement, alarmed all the
   friends of order. Now, as in later times, the supporters of religious
   reform were discredited by the apostles of anarchy: all innovation was
   confounded with disorder; and in the minds of many the name of Wicliffe
   became scarcely less opprobrious than that of Wat Tyler or John Ball.

   Under the influence of such suspicions, and with Courtenay elevated to
   the primacy in place of the murdered Sudbury, the clergy resolved to
   proceed more resolutely than they had yet done against the Reformer. He
   was summoned to a synod at the Grey friars in London. As the synod
   convened, an earthquake shook the city, and many were disposed to
   regard it as an unhappy omen; but Courtenay, with great presence of
   mind, said, "It is the earth throwing off its noxious vapours, that the
   Church might appear in her perfect purity." Twenty-four articles were
   exhibited against Wicliffe. After three days' debate ten were condemned
   as heretical, the rest as erroneous. Among the heretical articles,
   prominence was given to his denial of transubstantiation; and many who
   were otherwise inclined to follow him, shrank from his views on this
   head. Every solemnity was given to the promulgation of the decrees of
   this synod, and a preacher sent down to Oxford, the great seat of
   Wicliffe's influence, to uphold the cause of the Church. The Reformer
   himself was prostrated with illness, but nothing daunted in spirit.
   When supposed near to death, he raised himself in his bed, and said, "I
   shall not die but live, and declare the work of the friars."

   In a few months his voice was again heard in reply to the Council of
   the Greyfriars, and in a petition addressed to the King and Parliament,
   in which he claims that he may be allowed to defend the articles
   contained in his writings, as proved by authority or reason to be the
   Christian faith. The Parliament was convened in autumn (1382) at
   Oxford. The Convocation met along with it. The latter body, less
   confident than the synod at the Greyfriars, hesitated to stir the
   question as to the temporal privileges of the hierarchy, while
   Parliament declined to interpose in the matter of doctrine: it had no
   wish to defend any heresy as to transubstantiation. The result was that
   the Reformer was summoned to answer on this single point. He appeared,
   and debated it before his auditory with a profound and perplexing
   subtlety. Master of a homely and rugged speech in addressing the common
   people, he was at the same time a most skilfully trained disputant,
   possessed of the highest scholastic attainments, which he did not
   hesitate to employ to confound and puzzle his adversaries. But though
   confounded, they were resolved. Lancaster strongly counselled him to
   submission; but he would not yield. He was condemned, and his
   condemnation publicly promulgated in the very place where he was
   holding his lecture. No extreme measures, however, followed this step.
   He was permitted to retire to Lutterworth, where, in the quiet labours
   of his parish, and in unremitting zeal for the truth, he spent the two
   remaining years of his life. Worn out by labours and anxieties, the
   paralysis from which he had formerly suffered again attacked him. On
   the last Sunday of the year 1384, while engaged in conducting public
   worship, he was struck down, and, two days afterwards, expired.

   The high character of Wicliffe, the ardour of his faith, the spiritual
   energy of his life, had made a strong impression. He himself asserts
   that a third of the clergy had adopted his views. Knyghton, the
   chronicler, regretfully declares that, "of two persons met on the road,
   one of them was sure to be a Wicliffite." His disciples, known as
   Lollards, abounded everywhere--in the Church, in the castle, on the
   throne--among the poor, the wealthy burghers, and the nobles. The widow
   of the Black Prince was favourable to them, and the good Queen Anne was
   almost an active partisan. To what height Lollardism might have grown
   in England, save for the political mischances which had in some degree
   overtaken it before its founder's death, and which continued to pursue
   it, it is difficult to say. The accession of the Lancasterian family to
   the throne, the support which they gave to the hierarchy, and which the
   hierarchy in return rendered to them, the revolutionary designs
   attributed to the Lollards, and for which their leader, Sir John
   Oldcastle (Lord Cobham), suffered in 1417, all contributed to crush the
   party; while the long wars of the Roses which followed, still further
   served to obscure the light of truth which had been kindled in England.
   As we shall see, however, this light was never entirely extinguished.
   It lived on in faint streaks here and there, until it was swallowed up
   in the dawning glory of the sixteenth century.

   Not in England, but in a country which would seem at first to have
   little connection with it, is the movement of Wicliffe found renewing
   itself, and rising into European prominence. Bohemia stood in many
   respects isolated from. the German states: a Sclavonian kingdom,
   surrounded by Teutonic neighbours, with interests of its own, and a
   population inquiring, earnest, and independent. The University of
   Prague was a centre of attraction to thousands of students from Germany
   and Poland: its halls were as thronged as those of Paris and Oxford,
   and its scholastic reputation scarcely inferior. A spirit of freedom in
   the Church had raised up a succession of men distinguished by reforming
   zeal and practical earnestness--Militz, Conrad of Waldhausen, and
   Matthias of Janow. By the pastoral labours of the first, the most
   wonderful moral change had been wrought among certain classes of the
   brilliant but dissolute city. Conrad was even more distinguished as a
   preacher; the very Jews flocked in crowds to hear him. He inveighed
   against the worldly practices of the Church, and especially the taking
   of money in exchange for spiritual blessings, which he denounced as the
   worst of heresies. He exposed the hypocrisy and pretended poverty of
   the monks. He tried to elevate the popular mind above its idolatry of
   relics, and held forth the supremacy of the spiritual life. "They
   only," he said, "who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
   Dominicans and Franciscans combined against him, and tried to silence
   him. They drew up twenty-nine articles of heresy, drawn from his
   sermons, but at length shrunk from prosecuting them, and he was allowed
   to continue his work in peace till his death in 1369. Matthias of Janow
   was rather a theologian than a preacher. By his writings, however, he
   contributed to a spirit of inquiry even more than Conrad by his
   sermons; and his influence is very visibly impressed upon the movement
   which followed.

   John Huss entered into the religious inheritance of these men. First a
   student, and then a teacher in the University of Prague, of deep
   seriousness of character and unaffected piety, he was naturally drawn
   towards the small but earnest party which, for nearly half a century,
   had been labouring to advance the cause of truth in Bohemia. He became,
   about the close of the fourteenth century, confessor to the queen, and
   preacher in what was called the Bethlehem Chapel, attached to the
   university. At first his denunciations were of a general character, and
   the clergy were among his warm admirers; but he soon began to direct
   his most unsparing attacks against the luxury and licentiousness of the
   Church, and gradually advanced to deeper and more fundamental views of
   reform. The writings of Wicliffe are said to have been mainly
   instrumental in producing this advance in Huss's opinions. They had at
   this time been largely introduced into Bohemia. The marriage of Richard
   II. with Anne, the sister of the King (Wenzel), had established a
   peculiar connection between the two countries. The scholastic renown of
   their great seats of learning helped to strengthen this connection.
   Bohemian students found their way to Oxford, and Oxford scholars to
   Bohemia. In this manner Wicliffe's writings became subjects of lively
   interest in the University of Prague--an interest owing to their
   philosophical no less than to their religious character.

   The long-standing feud between Nominalist and Realist raged in the
   university,--the Germans on the former side, the Bohemians on the
   latter. Wicliffe was known as a distinguished Realist one of his
   earliest writings by which his scholastic reputation had been acquired
   having been on the "Reality of Universal Conceptions." Both in his case
   and in that of Huss, the philosophical bias of reform had entirely and
   "somewhat singularly changed. The Nominalism of Abelard and Occam--the
   philosophy of the turbulent reforming spirits of the Church--had found
   refuge and defence within its bosom; while the traditionary philosophy
   of orthodoxy of Lanfranc, of Anselm, and of Aquinas--was now become the
   watchword of the movement party.

   Wicliffe's Realism greatly contributed to his influence in Prague. It
   was not without its effect upon Huss, but it was the deeper Christian
   spirit of the Englishman's writings that chiefly moved him. "I am drawn
   to them," he said, "by the manner in which they strive to lead all men
   back to Christ." The Bohemian, however, never seems to have clearly
   adopted the advanced views of the English reformer on
   transubstantiation. The bent of Huss's mind was practical rather than
   doctrinal or speculative; and the reform which he courted was, above
   all, a reform of the Christian life. He did not aim, like Wicliffe, to
   reconstruct the whole edifice of the Church.

   Associated with Huss was a young knight, Jerome of Prague,
   distinguished by his intellectual culture and restless ardour. He had
   studied in Oxford and Paris. He had visited Jerusalem, Hungary, and
   even Russia, and everywhere attracted notice by his accomplishments,
   his energy and eloquence. He became an enthusiastic disciple of
   Wicliffitism. "Until now," he said, "we had nothing but the shell of
   science: Wicliffe first laid open the kernel." Huss and Jerome were
   fast friends, and laboured in zealous co-operation; the latter more
   impulsive and enterprising--the former more moderate, self-possessed,
   and gentle in his manners.

   In 1403 the contest in Prague regarding the opinions of Wicliffe came
   to a head. Certain propositions ascribed to the English reformer were
   brought before a meeting of the university. The Bohemians and Germans
   were divided; but the great majority of the German students gave them
   an easy victory. This, far from allaying, only served to increase the
   feeling of bitterness between the two parties. Two years later Pope
   Innocent III. issued a bull, addressed to Archbishop Sbynko, urging him
   to suppress and condemn the Wicliffite heresies spreading in Bohemia.
   Hitherto the archbishop, if not cordial in favour of the Reform
   movement, had not been hostile to it; and even for some time still
   there was no disturbance of the good understanding subsisting between
   him and Huss. A rupture, however, could not in the nature of things be
   long postponed. A royal edict regarding the manner of voting in the
   university, designed to secure the Bohemian students against the
   preponderance in numbers of the Germans and other foreigners, became a
   sort of turning-point in the controversy. Indignant at the edict, the
   German students left Prague in a body. The Bohemian party were left in
   undivided possession of power; and, as a sign of this, Huss was
   immediately elected rector of the university. The rejected students
   spread everywhere abroad the report of heresy against the Bohemians.
   Not merely high-churchmen, but those addicted to the more liberal
   theology and ecclesiasticism of Paris, represented by Gerson and
   D'Ailly, took alarm at the rise of a system that seemed to aim at the
   overthrow of the hierarchy altogether. The archbishop and a majority of
   the clergy began to realise the nature of the crisis, and to place
   themselves in vigorous opposition to the Hussite party.

   Through various alternations this opposition ran its course during the
   next ten years. The writings of Wicliffe were burned by order of the
   archbishop. Huss appealed to the Pope, and was summoned to appear at
   Rome; but the King refused him permission to obey the summons, and sent
   an embassy in his stead. Sentence of excommunication was passed upon
   the Reformer, and an interdict laid upon the city. The popular
   excitement against the clergy became extreme. The archbishop began to
   feel that he had carried matters too far, and showed an eagerness for
   some settlement. A commission was appointed to negotiate the matter,
   and the result was that Huss made a confession of faith designed to
   vindicate his orthodoxy, which the archbishop saw reason to accept;
   while he, on his part, reported to the Pope that his diocese was at
   length purged of heresy.

   But this compromise, which took place in 1411, was too hollow to last,
   even if Rome had not immediately provoked the renewal of the struggle.
   While the embassy from Bohemia still remained in Rome, the vendors of
   the papal indulgences were sent forth into the country--everywhere
   excited by a spirit of reform--and began, with their usual arts, their
   nefarious traffic. Huss was moved to irrepressible indignation, and
   raised his eloquent voice against them. They were subjected to popular
   outrage. The unguarded zeal of Jerome fanned the flame, and the most
   violent commotions ensued. In their attempts to maintain order, the
   magistrates seized some of the rioters, and three young men were
   executed. The populace looked upon them as martyrs. Their dead bodies
   were protected, and, amid songs and prayers, conveyed to the Bethlehem
   Chapel, and interred there. The anti-Hussite party, however, had in the
   interval gathered strength; and, aided in their designs at Rome by a
   crafty priest, Michael de Causis, who had formerly been in the
   employment of the King of Bohemia, they were violently determined to
   uphold their ascendancy. At his instance the Bohemian ambassadors were
   imprisoned; the ban of excommunication launched forth anew against
   Huss; and Prague laid again under an interdict. King Wenzel hesitated
   amid the elements of disorder that raged around him, and Huss withdrew
   from the city--but only by his eloquence and zeal to spread his
   opinions more extensively throughout the country.

   Things were in this excited state when the Council of Constance met. It
   was a great event in the history of the Church. The abuses of
   monasticism, the scandal of a divided Papacy, the growth of heresy, had
   all called for an expression of the public opinion of Christendom, and
   this was at length to be given forth. The Council was to be a reforming
   one in the nature of the case. Its great work was to purify and
   reestablish the Church in undivided strength. Huss, therefore, did not
   require to be urged to attend it. To vindicate his preaching, and raise
   his voice against the prevailing corruptions, in presence of its
   representatives, assembled from every quarter, was, above all, what he
   desired to do. The Emperor Sigismund promised him, in the most solemn
   manner, a safe-conduct. He was to have the opportunity of fully
   explaining his sentiments before the Council; and if he did not accept
   its decision, his safe return to Bohemia was guaranteed.

   Huss accordingly set out for Constance in October 1414. A spirit of
   heroic faith animated him, yet he was not without dark misgivings. He
   left a letter in the hands of one of his disciples, which was only to
   be opened on the certain intelligence of his death, and which contained
   his will, with many pious confessions and exhortations. He reached
   Constance on the 3d of November, a few days after Pope John, whose
   numerous and splendid escort had passed him on the way. All along his
   journey he had received many tokens of sympathy and approval. Like
   Luther, afterwards, in his famous journey to Worms, he travelled in a
   kind of state. Wherever he passed, he professed his willingness to
   explain his views, and to defend himself from the charge of heresy. The
   clergy in many places sought his counsel. The parish priest of Pernau,
   with his vicars, waited upon him at his lodgings, drank to his health
   in a large tankard of wine, and freely conversed with him on matters of
   Christian faith. At Nuremberg the "friends of God" welcomed him; and,
   while he was engaged in church in discussion with them, three Bohemian
   nobles arrived, bearing the Emperor's safe-conduct; and to them was
   intrusted the particular duty of watching over and protecting their
   countryman in his mission.

   All these arrangements, however, were only preliminaries to a base
   betrayal on the part of the Emperor, and a mock trial on the part of
   the Council. For about three weeks after his arrival he was left at
   liberty; and to all who visited him, he freely explained his opinions,
   while he continued to urge his claims to be publicly heard. His
   enemies, in the meantime, were quietly concocting his ruin. Even those
   who otherwise professed the reformation of abused, could only see in
   his aims the overthrow of the Church; and Gerson and D'Ailly joined no
   less rigorously than Pope John and Michael de Causis in his
   condemnation. He was seized and thrown into prison on the 28th of
   December. He and his friends had still a hope in the safe-conduct of
   the Emperor. The Bohemian nobles urgently remonstrated against the
   violation of the Emperor's protection, and he himself, when he first
   heard of Huss's imprisonment, threatened to break open the doors of his
   prison by force. Craft and bigotry, however, were destined to prevail.
   The Emperor, after his arrival, was wrought upon in such a manner as to
   abandon his safe-conduct and leave Huss to his fate. No excuse can be
   made for such an act of perfidy. But Sigismund plainly saw that he must
   either give up Huss or see the Council dissolved, which, after so many
   difficulties, had assembled at his summons. He chose the former
   alternative. Huss was summoned four several times before the assembled
   representatives of the Church, confronted with certain articles from
   his works, and urged to unconditional submission. Amid uproar and
   insult, and the meanest attempts to entangle him in logical subtleties
   on the subject of transubstantiation, he replied to his accusers with
   admirable confidence and self-possession. He would submit when
   convinced, but no other considerations moved him. "Let the lowest in
   the Council convince me, and I will humbly own my error," he said--meek
   but brave words, the day for understanding which, however, had not yet
   come! He was condemned to be degraded from the priestly office, and
   then burned. The sentence was carried out with every circumstance of
   ignominy and cruelty. As they stripped him of his priestly robes, he
   said, "These mockeries I bear with equal mind, for the name and truth
   of Christ!" "We devote thy soul to the devils in hell!" cried his
   enemies. "And I commend my soul to the most merciful Lord Jesus!" he
   calmly replied. Thus perished John Huss, the Bohemian Reformer, like
   his great Master, amid the curses of a triumphant hierarchy.

   Jerome of Prague, who had come with rash confidence to be near his
   friend, and who had also been seized and imprisoned, was next summoned
   before the Council. Worn out by his miserable imprisonment, his spirits
   broken and his health feeble, he was induced to make a recantation of
   his errors; but with time for reflection, he regained his vigour of
   mind, and professed his determination to maintain to the death the
   doctrines of Wicliffe and John Huss. His condemnation followed; and, as
   if to make up for his temporary weakness, he died with the most
   cheerful intrepidity. Bound naked to the stake, as the flames consumed
   him, he continued to sing hymns in a "clear, untrembling" voice.

   The execution of Huss and Jerome kindled the flames of war in
   Bohemia--a war distinguished alike for atrocity and heroism. Alienation
   of race mingled with bitterness of religious hatred; and Bohemians
   fought with Germans, not merely to vindicate the cause of their
   martyred countrymen, but to avenge their insulted patriotism. Crusading
   army after army, sent forth by the Emperor and blessed by the Church,
   were met and routed by the Hussites, under the proud leadership of
   Ziska and Procopius. The insurrectionary movement embraced the whole
   country, and strengthened itself by successive victories. The Council
   of Basle, which met in 1433, was fain to negotiate with the triumphant
   Hussites, and a temporary concordat was arranged between them and the
   Emperor. This did not long prevent the renewal of hostilities, but it
   served to give permanent effect to dissensions that had already begun
   to weaken the cause of the reformers. They separated into two great
   parties, known by the name of the Calixtines and the Taborites. These
   dissensions accomplished in course of time what the arms of the Empire
   had failed to effect. The opposition to Rome gradually languished. So
   many violent and merely secular feelings had mingled in it, that when
   the tension of active contest was relaxed, the religious attitude of
   resistance gave way. A small remnant, however, proving faithful to its
   principles, formed the seed of the famous Community of Bohemian or
   Moravian Brethren, whose zealous Christian life survived, not only to
   the time of the Reformation, but long beyond it.

   The decaying issue of the Hussite movement brings us to the verge of
   the sixteenth century. Yet it cannot be said that we trace any direct
   links of connection between the German and the Bohemian reformer:
   Luther bears no such relation to Huss as Huss did to Wicliffe. The
   immediate effect of the Bohemian insurrection, on the contrary, was to
   strengthen the power of the Church in Germany. The Germans regarded
   with offence the opinions of a hostile people, whose arms had not only
   kept the imperial forces at bay, but invaded and laid waste their
   provinces and cities. The course of the reform movement seems,
   therefore, to run out at this point. The torch, if not extinguished,
   does not pass from hand to hand; yet it remained a grand beacon, at
   once of encouragement and warning. Luther did not spring in any
   historical connection from Huss, but the Bohemian reformer remained to
   him a noble example of heroic principle, and the Hussite struggle an
   affecting memory of the inefficacy of the sword to secure the great
   work of religious reformation.

   In the meantime, throughout the fifteenth century, new seeds of
   preparation for the great revolt were everywhere ripening. The
   reforming efforts hitherto made had failed, not from any lack of
   heroism in the men that led them, nor from any deficiency of the truth
   that animated them, but above all, from the inadequate field prepared
   to receive the truth. The darkness of ignorance lay as yet, in the
   fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, too heavy upon the popular mind.
   Intellectual as well as political power were too strongly centred in
   the Church to permit of a successful resistance either to the one or
   the other. A wider field of interest was necessary before individual
   resistance could rise into triumph; but such a field was now, in the
   course of the fifteenth century, rapidly preparing, especially in
   Germany. [5] We can trace this wider movement of preparation in three
   several directions,--political, religious, and literary; and, with a
   brief glance at these combined preparatory influences, we shall find
   ourselves on the threshold of the great crisis of the sixteenth
   century.

   The worldly and degraded spirit of the hierarchy, and the exactions
   which it everywhere made, continued to come always into more jarring
   conflict with the advancing interests of national pride and political
   freedom. Notwithstanding the disgraceful schisms which had so long rent
   it, its conflicts with successful Councils, and not least, its own
   profligacy and crimes--notorious to Christendom in the infamies of a
   Baldassare Cossa, and the tragic and appalling wickedness of a
   Borgia--the Papacy relaxed none of its pretensions. It spread its
   intrigues everywhere, aided by many of the most able and unscrupulous
   of the prelatic aristocracy, and the swarming herds of monks, sunk in
   ignorance and vice. The great end of its existence was to procure money
   to feed its insatiable avarice or prop its assailed power--in some
   instances, it must be confessed, to minister to great works of art and
   civilisation. For this purpose, the instrumentality of indulgences, the
   manufacture and the sale of pardons, had received an enormous
   extension, and reached a flagrant height of abuse. Huss, we have seen,
   had already been aroused by it. The tracts of Wicliffe and the poems of
   Chaucer, still earlier, testify to its popular notoriety. We shall see
   to what tremendous significance it was destined to grow in the life of
   Luther.

   It is not wonderful that a widespread excitement as to these abuses of
   the Papacy continued to gather force, notwithstanding all the vigorous
   checks its successive outbreaks had encountered. These checks had
   mastered the opposition for the time, but left its roots still
   uneradicated and strong, ready to spring up after a fresh season of
   repose. Wherever there was any reality of national life, any feeling of
   political hope, there could not fail to be found a rising spirit
   inimical to the pretensions of Rome. More than any other nation,
   Germany possessed at this time such a national life. The weakness of
   the Papacy on the one hand, and the distance of the Empire on the
   other, had given prominence and power to its several states, and
   promoted a spirit of healthy activity and freedom in its great
   municipalities. The old conflict of the Emperor with the Pope, although
   the spirit of opposition had been modified by recent circumstances,
   such as the Bohemian war, still served as a tradition of hostility. It
   was the floating banner, the symbol, of an immemorial national cause,
   which allured men like Sickingen and Hutten, and under which they
   burned to go forth and fight. Germany, moreover, was virgin soil, or
   nearly so, as far as the hitherto impeded footsteps of reformation were
   concerned. She had not been left to languish like England, Bohemia,
   France, and Italy, under the defeat of a reformatory impulse in which
   she had prematurely put forth the best and heartiest fibres of her
   national energies. In air these respects Germany might have been seen
   to be politically destined as the scene of the next great movement of
   Reform.

   But such political, or, as we may call them, external influences, while
   they formed the necessary conditions of such a movement, could never by
   themselves have given a true and enduring life to it. This came, and
   could alone come, from the Divine influences surviving in the heart of
   German Christendom, and which, although they had not hitherto, as in
   other countries, broken forth into any violent flame, had yet lived on
   in devout seclusion and patient doing of works of mercy, or in the
   earnest doctrines of some great teacher, whom the Church had not
   approved, but not violently extruded.

   While England had not yet begun to sway with the agitations of the
   Wicliffite reform, Germany and the Low Countries were nursing in their
   bosom various elements of a free spiritual life. Cologne, which, by the
   time of the sixteenth century, had sunk into the main refuge of monkish
   ignorance, was at this earlier period the centre of a spiritual
   earnestness which propagated itself by means of various associations,
   such as we have already mentioned. It was the characteristic of these
   societies, in contrast to the regular monkish establishments, that they
   were comparatively free and unorganised. They grew up under an
   operation of a common inward principle, rather than of an associative
   external bond; and their aim was to foster the spread of this
   principle, leaving it to its free action rather than to secure its
   permanence by legal restraints. Some of them were composed of women,
   such as the Beguines, others of men, such as the Beghards; some appear
   to have been more practical, others more contemplative, in their sphere
   of work. Among the latter must be reckoned the Brethren of the Free
   Spirit--the nursery of the great names of German mysticism--Eckart,
   Tauler, Suso, Ruysbroek. The labours of these men, especially the
   inward spiritualising and free character of their teaching, standing at
   the very opposite extreme to the prevailing scholastic theology, kept
   alive a spirit of inquiry and Christian zeal. They were not
   reformers--this is not the point of view in which they are interesting;
   but through them the warm current of Christian life, without which the
   Reformation could never have arisen, continued to pour itself onwards
   with fertilising vigour.

   When these earlier associations had degenerated in virtue of the very
   licence which, to some extent, they represented, the Brethren of the
   Common Life sprung up towards the beginning of the fifteenth century.
   These societies were distinguished from those of the Free Spirit by the
   comparatively evangelical character of the aim of the Brethren, their
   devotion to the study of Scripture and the active work of education, as
   well as almsgiving and visiting the poor and sick. Many of them spent
   their lives in multiplying and diffusing copies of the Scriptures, and
   watching over the care of the young. Their simple manner of living,
   their spirit of soberness and faithful self-denial, their extended
   beneficence, gave them a powerful influence--to which, more than to any
   other cause, was owing the latent heat of Christian susceptibility
   spread throughout Germany, and which responded so rapidly to the touch
   of Luther's glowing words. Gerhard Groot may be said to have been the
   founder of the Brethren of the Common Life, and Thomas à Kempis is
   their most illustrious name.

   Alongside this undercurrent of Christian life, which largely pervaded
   German society in the fourteenth century, and in fact springing out of
   it, there is found a succession of distinguished teachers of the
   Augustinian theology, in opposition to the Pelagian tendencies of the
   prevailing scholasticism. John Pupper of Goch, chiefly known by a work
   on Christian Liberty; John of Wesel, professor at Erfurt, and then
   preacher at Mayence and Worms; and especially John Wessel of Gröningen,
   are the representatives of this doctrinal tendency. The last and most
   eminent of them was educated under the guidance of Thomas à Kempis,
   and, as a theologian, may be said to have anticipated Luther in every
   direction, and on the doctrine of the Eucharist to have gone beyond
   him.. Luther himself said of him: "If I had read Wessel before I began,
   my opponents would have imagined that I had derived everything from
   him, so entirely do we agree in spirit." Combining profound devotional
   feeling with great dialectical and speculative power, Wessel is
   preeminently the theological forerunner of the Reformation. The
   Mystics, Ullmann says, "contributed warmth and spiritual life; others,
   like Huss, were greater in action; but Wessel was supreme in
   reformatory thinking, research, and doctrine." He contributed light to
   the approaching movement.

   Following these names, that of Staupitz, the friend and long the patron
   of Luther, deserves special mention. He was allied by his contemplative
   thoughtfulness, simple and gentle character, and fervent piety to the
   Mystics, of whose writings he was an ardent student and admirer. It was
   at his instance that Luther edited in 1516 the Theologia Germanica,'
   the text-book of German mysticism, whose perusal profoundly moved him;
   and we shall see more particularly in the sequel how decided an
   influence Staupitz exercised upon the great reformer at the most
   critical period of his life.

   The influences which we have now marked were among the most direct and
   powerful in preparing the way for the Reformation of the sixteenth
   century. They were those which it took up most directly into its bosom,
   and which most immediately helped, by their energy, to stimulate and
   strengthen it. Something more, however, was needed to secure to the
   movement that wide diffusion and intellectual and historical importance
   which it so soon obtained. The unripeness of the times had especially
   proved fatal to the preceding movements. The superiority of intellect
   and the highest knowledge that prevailed had, upon the whole, remained
   with the Church. Scholasticism was still in the ascendant, its vigour
   still unspent. But now at length a great revival of intellectual life
   spread beyond the Church; and, in many of its aspects and most
   distinguished representatives, came closely into collision with its
   decaying forms. This revival had already begun in Italy, when the
   conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, and the dispersion of
   its scholars throughout the south of Europe, gave a greatly increased
   impetus to it. Classical studies everywhere gained ground, and this
   irrespectively of any application to theological or ecclesiastical
   purposes. They were pursued for their own sakes, and as the basis of a
   new and general human culture, the idea of which survives in the name
   [6] that came to be universally applied to them.

   Taking its start in Italy, this literary renaissance soon extended into
   Germany and the Low Countries. Rudolf Agricola, a friend and companion
   of Wessel, is one of the first names that attract our attention. He may
   be reckoned the father of German Humanism. His scholarship was
   everywhere applauded his literary knowledge esteemed marvellous. The
   two great names, however, that represent this new intellectual
   movement, are those of Reuchlin and Erasmus. The early contests of the
   latter with the monks, the piquancy and success of his famous satires,
   brought him into immediate connection with the reformatory tendencies
   of his time. There was no name that, for a while, was more a symbol of
   reviving Christian as well as literary interest. His New Testament
   studies widely stimulated inquiry, and called forth principles at
   variance with the traditionary theology. He was the great leader of the
   Humanists; the prominent representative of a spirit of culture directly
   inimical to the long-venerated Scholasticism, and before the spread of
   which it was destined to perish. We shall afterwards have occasion. to
   estimate the special position which he took up towards Luther, and the
   diversities of aim and modes of thinking and action by which they were
   characterised.

   Reuchlin again became the centre of a conflict singularly significant
   of the insurrectionary spirit abroad, and the rottenness of the
   defences opposed to it. A baptised Jew of the name of Pfefferkorn, at
   Cologne; raised a cry against all Jewish writings as full of
   blasphemies against Christ, and called upon the Emperor to commit them
   to the flames. The Dominicans joined with him, and urged that the Jews
   should be proceeded against as heretics. The Imperial Council consulted
   Reuchlin in the circumstances. The son of a poor messenger, he had
   risen by his great accomplishments and happy manners to a post of
   influence at the court of Würtemberg, and was especially distinguished
   by his Oriental learning, and the attention he had given to the
   Rabbinical writings. As may be imagined, Reuchlin protested strongly
   against the proposal of the Dominicans. They were enraged at his
   interference, and attacked him with all the bitterness of ignorant and
   offended pride. He retorted with stinging sarcasm; and Hochstraten, the
   Cologne inquisitor, summoned him before his tribunal. Reuchlin appealed
   to Leo X. The contest widened and raged, not only throughout Germany
   but in Paris. Hutten and his coadjutors in the Epistolæ Obscurorum
   virorum' joined in it. In coarse and broad, but vigorous and vivid
   satire, the stupidity and obscenity of the monks were made to tell
   their own story in a continually running allusion to their quarrel with
   Reuchlin. The effect was so felicitous that (as in the no less famous
   case of Pascal's Provincials) some of the monks themselves thought the
   letters genuine.

   This occurred in 1516, on the very eve of the Reformation. A revelation
   of such mingled pride, ignorance, and wickedness, was in itself a
   revelation of weakness which could not fail to make a deep impression
   everywhere. Even the Pope felt ashamed of the Cologne ecclesiastics,
   and gave sentence in the dispute against them. A house thus divided
   against itself could not long stand. The monks, and especially the
   Dominicans, had become, in their deepened corruption, a constant and
   dangerous source of affliction to the Papacy; and Tetzel, with his
   indulgences and money bag, was soon to prove this with a conspicuous
   fatality.

LUTHER

LUTHER.

   LUTHER is the most notable of all the Reformers. His name at once
   starts the most stirring associations, and leads into the widest
   details and discussions. His work was comparatively single and original
   in its energy; and his life was especially heroic in its proportions,
   and varied and graphic and interesting in its incidents. There is a
   grandeur in the whole subject, below which we are apt to feel that we
   constantly fall, particularly within the limits of a mere sketch.

   Few characters have been more closely observed or more keenly
   scrutinised. There is a breadth and intensity and power of human
   interest in the career of the German reformer, which have concentrated
   the attention both of friend and foe upon it; while the careless
   freedom and humorous frankness with which he himself has lifted the
   veil and shown us his inner life, have furnished abundant materials for
   the one and the other to draw their portrait and point their moral. I
   do not know that in all history there is any one to whose true being,
   alike in its strength and weaknesses, we get nearer than we get to that
   of Luther. This is of the very greatness of the man, that from first to
   last he is an open-hearted honest German, undisguised by education,
   unweakened by ecclesiasticism, unsoftened by fame. Whatever faults he
   had lie upon the surface: they appear in all the manifestations of his
   character, and we have nowhere to search for any secret or double
   motives in his conduct. No one has ever ventured to accuse him of
   insincerity. He lives before us in all that he did; and neither
   dogmatic violence nor political necessity ever serve to hide from us
   the genuine human heart, beating warm beneath all the strong armour of
   controversy, or the thin folds of occasional diplomacy.

   The life of Luther divides itself into two great periods, which denote
   as well an important distinction in his work. The first of these
   periods terminates with the Diet of Worms (1521) and his imprisonment
   in the Wartburg, and is marked by the striking series of events which
   signalise his education and conversion, his conflict about indulgences,
   and then his general conflict and final breach with Rome. The whole
   series falls naturally into three main groups or stages sufficiently
   distinct, yet of disproportionate outline. The first may be said to
   extend to the memorable year of 1517, and summons before our minds a
   varied and lively succession of pictures--the boy at Mansfeld, the
   scholar at Eisenach, the student and monk at Erfurt, the pilgrim to
   Rome, the professor and preacher at Wittenberg. The second stage, with
   all its peculiar significance, is a very rapid one, lasting exactly a
   year from October 1517, when he posted the ninety-five theses on the
   gates of the Church of All Saints, to October 1518, when he fled by
   night from Augsburg after his unsuccessful interview with the Legate
   [7] Cajetan. The third is traced in its successive steps by the Leipzig
   Disputation, July 1519; the burning of the Papal Bull, Dec. 1520; and,
   finally, the Diet of Worms, April 1521.

   Between these several stages of the reformer's career there Is an
   intimate natural connection--a connection not merely accidental, but,
   so to speak, logical, in the manner in which they follow one another.
   They arise, the later from the preceding, by a sure process of rational
   and spiritual expansion, issuing in order like the evolving steps of a
   great argument, or the unfolding scenes of a great drama, or like both
   together,--presenting a marvellous combination at once of logical
   consistency and dramatic effect. It is of great importance, therefore,
   to understand the principle and ground of the whole, as portrayed in
   the struggles and experience of the first part of his life. The convent
   at Erfurt is the significant prologue to the whole drama.

   Luther was born at Eisleben on the evening of the 10th of November
   1483. His parents were poor,--his father, John Luther, being a miner;
   his mother, Margaret, a peasant. Humble in their circumstances, they
   were both of superior intelligence and character. The father was a
   diligent reader of whatever books came within his reach, and had his
   own somewhat immovable convictions as to life and duty; the mother was
   esteemed by all her honest co-matrons as peculiarly exemplary in her
   conduct,--ut in exemplar virtutum, as Melanchthon says. The story is,
   that they had gone to Eisleben to attend a fair, when their son was
   unexpectedly born on the eve of St Martin. The next morning he was
   carried to the Church of St Peter, and baptised by the name of the
   patron saint of the day. Shortly after Luther's birth, his parents
   removed to Mansfeld, where, by industry and perseverance, his father's
   worldly circumstances improved. He became the owner of two small
   furnaces, and was elevated to some civic dignity in the town of the
   district. Here, in the "Latin school," the young Martin first began to
   experience the hardships of life. He appears to have been a somewhat
   unruly boy, or the school discipline must have been of a very savage
   description. He is said to have been flogged by his master fifteen
   times in one day; and while the scholastic rod thus weighed heavily on
   him, the parental rod was not spared. Neither father nor mother nursed
   the boy in softness. He himself gives us rather an unpleasant glimpse
   of the domestic discipline. "He was whipped for a mere trifle," he
   says, "till the blood came." But then, as a companion picture, serving
   to relieve by its bright tenderness the severity of the other, we are
   told of the father carrying the little Martin to school in his arms,
   and bringing him back in the same manner.

   Having got all the schooling he could get at Mansfeld, he went first to
   the school of the Franciscans at Magdeburg, and then nearer home to
   Eisenach. It was in the latter place, while singing in the streets for
   bread, according to a common practice of the German schoolboys, that
   his fair appearance and sweet voice attracted the notice of a good lady
   of the name of Cotta, who provided him henceforth, during his stay at
   school, with a comfortable home. Luther in after years recalled his
   school-days with till the zest of his genial and affectionate nature,
   and used, in his familiar house-sermons, to exhort his hearers "never
   to despise the poor boys who sing at their doors, and ask bread for the
   love of God." He would illustrate the advantage of prayer by a humorous
   story drawn from his experience as a street-singer. "Importunity in
   prayer," he says, "will always bring down from heaven the blessing
   sought. How well do I remember singing once as a boy before the house
   of a rich man, and entreating very hard for some bread. At last the man
   of the house came running out crying aloud, Where are you, you knaves?'
   We all took to our heels, for we thought we had angered him by our
   importunity, and he was going to beat us but he called us back and gave
   us two loaves." [8]

   On his reaching his eighteenth year, it became a question to what
   profession he should devote himself. His father's ambition was excited
   by his talents, and the law seemed the most likely avenue by which
   these talents could carry him to distinction and emolument. He
   accordingly entered the University of Erfurt, then the most
   distinguished in Germany, with the view of preparing himself for the
   legal profession. There he studied philosophy in the writings of the
   school-men, and perfected his classical knowledge in the pages of
   Cicero and Virgil. Even thus early the barren subtleties of the
   scholastic philosophy rather repelled than interested him. They left,
   however, a permanent influence on his intellectual character.. He took
   his degree of Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Arts in 1505, when he
   was twenty-two years of age, and the event, according to custom, was
   celebrated by a torchlight procession and great rejoicing.

   But before this event he had begun an education of a far more real and
   profound character than any that the university could impart to him.
   One day, as he was turning over the books in the University library, he
   fell upon a copy of the Vulgate. He beheld with astonishment that there
   were more gospels and epistles than in the lectionaries. A new world
   opened upon him; he returned again and again with avidity to the sacred
   page, and, as he read, his heart burned within him. Several
   circumstances served to deepen these feelings--a dangerous sickness,
   which brought him near to the point of death, and the decease of a
   friend of the name of Alexis, accompanied, or at least somehow deeply
   associated in his mind, with a dreadful thunderstorm to which he was
   exposed on his return to Erfurt after a visit to his parents. This
   latter event especially made a powerful impression upon him. The common
   version of the story [9] is, that the lightning struck his friend by
   his side as they journeyed together, and that Luther was so appalled by
   the disaster that he fell upon his knees in prayer, and resolved, if
   spared, to dedicate himself to the service of God. The story is at
   least a fair tribute to the childlike piety that now and always
   animated him. He kept his resolve, silent and apparently unmoved for
   some time, yet cherishing it in his heart. His mode of carrying it out
   was characteristic. One evening he invites some of his fellow-students
   to supper, gives them of his best cheer; music and jest enliven the
   company, and the entertainment closes in a full burst of merriment. The
   same night there is a solitary knock at the door of the Augustine
   convent, and the student who has just gaily parted from his companions,
   two volumes alone of all his books in his hand, a Virgil and a Plautus,
   passes beneath its portal. He has separated from the world, and devoted
   himself to God, as he and the world then understood devotion.

   The three years which Luther now spent in the convent at Erfurt are
   among the most signal and significant of his life. During these years
   were laid deep in his heart those spiritual convictions out of which
   his whole reforming work sprang and grew into shape. The sparks which
   were afterwards to explode in the overthrow of the Papacy, and to
   lighten up into the glory of a restored Gospel, were here kindled. The
   struggle for which Germany was preparing, was here rehearsed in the
   single soul of a solitary monk. It is a painful and somewhat sad
   spectacle; but it possesses not only the interest of an earnest
   individual struggle, but the sublimity of a prelude to the great
   national conflict which was impending.

   It was Luther's duty as a novice to perform the meanest offices in the
   convent. He had chosen his lot, and he was not the man to shrink from
   its mere servile hardships; so he swept the floors, and wound the
   clock, and ministered in various ways to the laziness of his brother
   monks. He was even driven to his old trade of street-begging, as they
   assailed him with their doggerel cry, "Saccum per nackum"--"Go through
   the streets with the sack, and get us what you can to eat." After a
   while, and by the friendly interference of the university in his
   favour, he was able to resume his studies. Augustine and the Bible on
   the one hand, and Occam and Gerson on the other, shared his attention,
   and we are left vaguely to guess what seeds of divine truth from the
   one, and of papal disaffection from the other, were sown in his mind.
   All was as yet a chaos in his spiritual condition. The darkness had
   been stirred within him, and a profound uneasiness produced, but no ray
   of light yet rested on. it. By fasting and prayer, and every species of
   monkish penance, he laboured to satisfy his conscience and secure his
   salvation. "If ever monk could have got to heaven by monkery," he
   afterwards said, "I might have done so. I wore out my body with
   watching, fasting, praying, and other works." He was sometimes for four
   days together without meat or drink. But all his labours and
   mortifications brought him no peace. The terrors of guilt haunted him
   as a bodily presence--clung to him as a pursuing shadow, so that one
   day at mass he cried out, as some dire aspect of wrath rose up before
   him, "It is not I! it is not I!" On another occasion he disappeared for
   certain days and nights alarm was excited; his cell door was broken
   open, and he was found prostrate on the floor in a state of helpless
   emaciation--unconscious, and apparently dead, till roused by the
   chanting of the young choristers. The one human influence to which he
   was never insensible, moved him when everything else had failed. Now
   and always, music had a charm for him only second to theology. "It is
   the only other art," he says, "which, like theology, can calm the
   agitations of the soul and put the devil to flight."

   At length light began to dawn upon him, and it came from a source
   already recognised and described. The Augustines had recently received
   a new vicar-general in the person of Staupitz, and he now came on a
   visit of inspection to the convent at Erfurt. The character of this man
   stands out, amid the prevailing unworthiness of the Romish clergy of
   the time, as a remarkable and most honourable exception. Of clear
   intelligence, simple and affectionate feelings, and most real and
   living piety, he reflects the brightest side of the system which he
   represented; and it is well for us to remember that it had such a
   bright side, and that, saving for this, Luther and his work might never
   have been what they were. With characteristic frankness the reformer
   never ceased to confess his spiritual obligations to the head of his
   order. "Through him," he said, "the light of the Gospel first dawned
   out of the darkness on my heart." Touched by the undisguised zeal and"
   grave and melancholy looks of the young monk, Staupitz sought his
   confidence. Luther unbosomed himself. "It is in vain," he said, "that I
   promise to God; sin is always too strong for me." "I have myself,"
   Staupitz replied, "vowed more than a thousand times to lead a holy
   life, and as often broken my vows. I now trust only in the mercy and
   grace of God in Christ." The monk spoke of his fears--of the terrors of
   guilt that haunted him, and made him wretched amidst all his
   mortifications. "Look at the wounds of Christ," said the vicar-general;
   "see the Saviour bleeding upon the cross, and believe in the mercy of
   God."--Surely a brave and true Gospel speaking from the bosom of the
   old and corrupting hierarchy to the heart of the nascent and reviving
   faith! Luther further deplored the inefficacy of all his works of
   repentance. "There is no true repentance," answered Staupitz, "but that
   which begins in the love of God and of righteousness. Conversion does
   not come from such works as you have been practising. Love Him who has
   first loved you." There was comfort in such words to the heart of the
   weary monk. The darkness began to clear away; but again and again it
   returned, and the struggle went on. "Oh, my sins! my sins!" he
   exclaimed, in writing to the vicar-general. "It is just your sins that
   make you an object of salvation," was the virtual reply. "Would you be
   only the semblance of a sinner, and have only the semblance of a
   Saviour? Jesus Christ is the Saviour of those who are real and great
   sinners." To these precious counsels Staupitz added the present of a
   Bible; and Luther, rejoicing in its possession, devoted himself more
   than ever to its study. Gradually the truth dawned upon him as he
   nourished himself upon Scripture and St Augustine. Still he had not
   attained a clear and firm footing. A renewed sickness, brought on by
   the severity of his mortifications, brought back his old terrors. God
   seemed an offended judge ready to condemn him, and he lay miserable in
   his fears, when an aged monk, who had come to see him, sought to
   console him by repeating the words of the Creed, "I believe in the
   forgiveness of sins." Luther caught at the words. The monk pressed the
   point by urging that it was necessary to believe not only that David's
   or Peter's sins were forgiven, but that his own sins were forgiven.
   From this time the doctrine of grace was clearly seen by him, his soul
   passed into its bright light. The confusions which had rested on the
   language of Scripture cleared away. "I saw the Scripture in an entirely
   new light," he says, "and straightway I felt as if I were born anew; it
   was as if I had found the door of Paradise thrown wide open."

   Thus Luther fought his way step by step to the freedom of the Gospel;
   from hard and painful asceticism to despair of holiness by any such
   means, and then from the very depth of this despair to the comfort and
   gladness of a free salvation in Christ, as preached to him by Staupitz
   and the aged monk. By the end of his stay at Erfurt his Christian
   convictions were well matured, although he was still far, and for many
   years after this still far, from seeing their full bearing, and the
   inevitable conclusions to which they led.

   In the year 1507 he was ordained a priest, and in the following year he
   removed to Wittenberg, where the Elector Frederick of Saxony had
   recently planted a university, destined to be memorably associated with
   the reformer. If Erfurt be the cradle of the Reformation, Wittenberg
   was its seminary and the chief seat of its triumph; and the old
   Augustine convent there, even more than that at Erfurt, gathers to
   itself a stirring and glorious, if somewhat less solemn interest.

   At first Luther lectured on dialectics and physics, but with little
   good-will. His heart was already in theology--that theology "which
   seeks out the kernel from the nut, and the flour from the wheat, and
   the marrow from the bones." In 1509 he became a bachelor of theology,
   and immediately began lecturing on the Holy Scriptures. His lectures
   produced a powerful impression by the novelty of their views and the
   boldness of his advocacy of them. "This monk," remarked the rector of
   the university, [10] "will puzzle all our doctors, and bring in a new
   doctrine, and reform the whole Roman Church, for he takes his stand on
   the writings of the apostles and prophets, and on the word of Jesus
   Christ." On such truly Protestant ground he already stood, although he
   called himself after this, and truly enough so far as all practical
   recognition of his position was. concerned, "a most insane Papist."

   From lecturing he passed to preaching, although here, as at every step,
   with a struggle. He had an awful feeling of the responsibility of
   speaking to the people in God's stead, and it required the urgent
   remonstrance of Staupitz to make him ascend the pulpit. He began his
   career as a preacher in the small chapel of the convent, a mean
   building of wood, thirty feet long and twenty feet broad, decayed and
   falling to pieces. There for the first time was heard that mighty voice
   which at length shook the world. His words, Melanchthon said, were
   "born, not on his lips but in his soul;" [11] they sprang from a
   profoundly awakened feeling of the truth of what he spake, and kindled
   a corresponding feeling. They moved the hearts of all who heard them,
   as they had never been moved before; and very soon the creaking and
   mouldy timbers of the old edifice were altogether unable to contain the
   numbers who thronged to hear him. He was invited by the town-council to
   preach in the parish church, and there his burning words reached a much
   more general and. influential audience.

   One important element in the education of the reformer still remains to
   be mentioned. He was destined to see and study the Papacy in the very
   centre of its power--in its full-blown magnificence in Rome. In the
   year 1510--some say 1511--he went on a mission to this city. [12] What
   he saw and heard there made an ineffaceable impression on him, although
   it did not produce any immediate result. "I would not take a hundred
   thousand florins," he afterwards said, "not to have seen Rome. I have
   said many masses there, and heard many said, so that I shudder when I
   think of it. There I heard, among other coarse jests, courtiers
   laughing at table, and bragging that some said mass and repeated these
   words over the bread and wine, Panis es, Panis manebis; Vinum es, Vinum
   manebis." For the time, however, the fervour of his monastic devotion
   burned bright amid all this blasphemy. He ran the round of all the
   churches, and believed all the lying legends repeated to him. It even
   passed through his mind as a regret that his parents were still living,
   as otherwise he might have wrought their deliverance from purgatory by
   his masses and penances. He tried to mount the Scala Sancta (Pilate's
   staircase, miraculously transported from Jerusalem) on his knees, and
   yet (strange evidence of the conflict raging in his heart), as he
   essayed the painful task, a voice of thunder kept shouting to him, "The
   just shall live by faith!"

   A further and last step of academical honour awaited him on his return.
   He was created a Doctor in the Holy Scriptures in the year 1512; and
   the oath which, on this occasion, he solemnly swore on the. Bible, to
   study and preach it all his life, and maintain the Christian faith
   against all heretics, is said to have been often afterwards a source of
   comfort to him in the great crises of his work.

   And now our reformer's education was nearly complete, while everything
   was preparing for the approaching struggle. Some visits of inspection
   which he made in the place of Staupitz to the Augustine convents,
   served still more to awaken his feeling of the need of reform, and to
   call forth his activity and practical abilities. "The whole ground," he
   complained, "was covered, nay, heaped up, with the rubbish of all
   manner of strange doctrines and superstitions, so that the word of
   truth can barely shine through; nay, in many places not a ray of it is
   visible." The train of conviction was thus fully laid; the impulse and
   power of reform were fully prepared. It only required a spark to kindle
   the train--some special excitement to call forth the energy still
   slumbering, but all ready and furnished for the struggle. Could Rome
   only have penetrated beneath the surface at this moment, and seen what
   a deep tremor and current agitated the German mind--how light had begun
   to peer through unnumbered chinks of the old sacerdotal edifice,
   revealing not only its weak defences, but the vile and unclean things
   within--how warily would she have acted! But the blindness of decay had
   struck her--falsehood had eaten away her judgment, as well as
   undermined her strength, and foolishly she went onwards to her
   overthrow.

   The system of indulgences was a natural result of the general system of
   penance; it rested on the same fundamental falsehood. So soon as the
   purely spiritual character of repentance became obscured, and the idea
   of sin as an outward accident under the control of the Church, rather
   than an inward and spiritual fact, began to prevail, there was
   obviously no limit to the growth of ecclesiastical corruption. If the
   Church possessed the power of freeing the sinner from the consequences
   of his sins, it was a mere development of this principle that the Pope,
   as the head and sum of the Church, should possess this power in an
   eminent degree; and when attention was once fixed on the mere externals
   of penance, it was only a fair logical conclusion that these externals
   could be appointed and regulated by the Pope at pleasure. The steps of
   the degradation are plainly marked, from the recognition of outward
   satisfaction as a condition of salvation, to the substitution of
   mortifications, pilgrimages, &c., as exhausting the demands of the
   Church, and then, as the moral feeling sank, and the hierarchical
   spirit rose, to a payment of money in place of actual service of any
   kind. Once materialise the spiritual truth, and gradually the material
   accident will become everything, and not only substitute itself in
   place of that truth, but necessarily pass from one degraded form to
   another, till it find its last and summary expression in money--money
   being always the brief and convenient representative of all mere
   external work. In so far as there was anything distinct in the
   character of indulgences, they were worse than even the general system
   of which they formed a part. While penance and priestly absolution,
   corrupted as they had become, confessedly based upon the merits of
   Christ, and were held to imply contrition in the offender; indulgences
   were rested upon the special doctrine of the treasure of the Church or
   the overflowing merits of the saints, and were in some of their forms
   confessedly dispensed irrespective of the moral condition of the
   recipient. Regular ordination, moreover, was a requirement of the one
   system, whereas indulgence was arrogated by the Pope as his peculiar
   privilege, and could be exercised at will by any one nominated by him.
   [13]

   It may be easily imagined what a system this was in the hands of an
   unscrupulous and low-minded agent; and such an agent, of the worst
   description, it was the misfortune of Rome to send abroad at this time
   through Germany. At Jüterbock, a few miles from Wittenberg and the
   borders of Saxony, which the Elector had refused him permission to
   enter, John Tetzel, a Dominican friar, established himself for the sale
   of the papal indulgences. A shameless traffic had fallen into the hands
   of a man conspicuous for shamelessness of tongue, and who scrupled not
   at any blasphemy to exalt the value of his wares. As the dispenser of
   the treasure of the Church, he claimed to be on a level with St Peter,
   and even to have saved more souls than the apostle. Distinguished by an
   unblushing countenance and stentorian voice, with the papal red cross
   borne aloft, the papal brief prominently displayed to view, and the
   money-counter before him, he proclaimed aloud the merits of his paper
   pardons; while his companion, Friar Bartholomew, shouted always as he
   closed, "Come and buy! come and buy!" His mingled impudence and impiety
   almost baffle belief. He even went the length of saying, that "when one
   dropped a penny into the box for a soul in purgatory, so soon as the
   money chinked in the chest the soul flew up to heaven."

   When Luther heard what was going on in his neighbourhood, we can
   understand how his spirit was stirred in him. At first, indeed, and
   before the full enormities of the system became manifest, he seems to
   have taken it somewhat quietly. "He began," he himself says, "to preach
   with great moderation, that they might do something better and more
   certain than buying pardons." But when he saw the practical influence
   of the traffic on the members of his own flock, and heard of Tetzel's
   blasphemies, his whole soul was roused, and he exclaimed, "God willing,
   I will beat a hole in his drum." He felt the necessity of taking some
   decided step, as no one else seemed disposed to interfere. He took
   counsel with God and his own heart, with none besides; and on the eve
   of All Saints, when the relics, collected with great pains by Frederick
   for his favourite church, were exposed to view, and multitudes thronged
   to gaze on them, Luther appeared among the crowd, and nailed on the
   gate of the church his ninety-five theses on the doctrine of
   Indulgences, which he offered to maintain in the university against all
   opponents, by word of mouth or in writing. These famous propositions
   generally asserted the necessity of spiritual repentance, and limited
   the dispensing power of the Pope to those penalties imposed by himself.
   They did not absolutely deny the doctrine of the treasure of the
   Church, but only the sole authority of the Pope over this treasure, and
   altogether denied that this treasure had any power to absolve the
   sinner without contrition and amendment on his part. "If the sinner had
   true contrition he received complete forgiveness; if he had it not, no
   brief of indulgence could avail him,--for the Pope's absolution had no
   value in and for itself, but only in so far as it was a mark of divine
   favour."

   The publication of these theses is commonly considered the
   starting-point of the Reformation. The excitement produced by them was
   intense and widespread. Luther's diocesan, the Bishop of Brandenburg, a
   good easy man, expressed sympathy, but counselled silence for peace's
   sake. Silence, however, was now no longer possible. Everywhere the
   excited popular feeling caught up the bold note of defiance. It seemed,
   in the words of Myconius, "as if angels themselves had carried them to
   the ears of all men." The excitement grew and strengthened, and
   sympathetic voices were heard through all Germany. Tetzel retreated to
   Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and, with the assistance of Dr Wimpina, drew out
   a set of counter-theses, while he publicly committed those of Luther to
   the flames. But this was a game easily played at; and the students at
   Wittenberg retaliated, by seizing the messenger bearing the
   counter-theses, and burning them in the market-place. Frederick of
   Saxony refused to interfere. He did not encourage, he did not even
   promise to protect; but, what was the very best thing he could do, he
   let things take their course. Yet if the story of his dream be true, he
   must have had his own thoughts about the matter. It is told that on the
   night of All Saints, just after the theses were posted on the church
   doors, he lay at his castle of Scheinitz, six leagues distant, and as
   he was pondering how to keep the festival, he fell asleep, and dreamed
   that he saw the monk writing certain propositions on the chapel of the
   castle at Wittenberg, in so large a hand that it could be read at
   Scheinitz: the pen began to expand as he looked, and gradually grew
   longer and longer, till at last it reached to Rome, touched the Pope's
   triple crown, and: made it totter. He inquired of the monk where he had
   got such a pen, and was answered that it once belonged to the wing of a
   goose in Bohemia. Presently other pens sprang out of the great pen, and
   seemed all busy writing; a loud noise was heard, and Frederick awoke.
   The dream, mythical or not, foreshadowed the great crisis at hand. The
   hundred years had revolved, and Huss's saying had come true. "To-day
   you burn a goose; [14] a hundred years hence a swan shall arise whom
   you will not be able to burn." The movement, long going on beneath the
   surface, and breaking out here and there ineffectually, had at length
   found a worthy champion; and all these forming impulses of the time
   gathered to Luther, welcomed him and helped him. The Humanists,
   Reuchlin, Erasmus, and others, expressed their sympathy; the war-party,
   Hutten and Sickingen, uttered their joy; above all, the great heart of
   the German people responded; and while the monk of Wittenberg seemed,
   as he said afterwards, to stand solitary in the breach, he was in
   reality encompassed by a cloud of witnesses, a great army of
   truth-seekers, at whose head he was destined to win for the world once
   more the triumph of truth and righteousness.

   When the reality of the excitement produced by the theses became
   apparent, opposition as well as sympathy was of course awakened. Tetzel
   continued to rave at Frankfort-on-the-Oder; Hochstraten, professor at
   Cologne (the great seat of the anti-humanist reaction) and head
   inquisitor of Germany, clamoured for the heretic to be committed to the
   flames; Sylvester Prierias, the general of the Dominicans and censor of
   the press at Rome, published a reply in dialogue, in which, after the
   manner of dialogues, he complacently refuted the propositions of
   Luther, and consigned him to the ministers of the inquisition; and,
   last and most formidable of all, Dr Eck, a theological professor at
   Ingoldstadt, entered the lists against the reformer. Eck was an able
   man, well versed in the scholastic theology; and a warm friendship,
   founded apparently on genuine respect on either side, had hitherto
   existed between him and Luther. Now, however, instigated partly by a
   natural feeling of rivalry, partly by honest opposition to the
   sentiments of Luther, and the call of his diocesan the Bishop of
   Eichstadt, he attacked the ninety-five theses in a style of violence
   which galled. Luther, and made him strongly feel the breach of
   friendship, especially as Eck had given no warning of the attack. [15]
   The reformer, it may be imagined, did not spare his adversary in reply.
   Strong language was a difficult game to play at with Luther; and the
   old friends, now rival disputants, were destined ere long to meet face
   to face in a more memorable conflict.

   At first the Pope, Leo X., took but little heed of the disturbance. He
   is reported, indeed, to have said, when the attack of Prierias was
   submitted to him, that "Friar Martin was a man of genius, that he did
   not wish to have him molested; the outcry against him was all monkish
   jealousy." Busy with his own dilettante and ambitious schemes, his
   buildings and his MSS., Leo had no perception of the real state of
   things in Germany, and would fain have kept aloof from interference.
   Some of the cardinals, however, saw more distinctly the real character
   of the movement; the seriousness of the affair was made at length
   apparent even to papal indifference, and a tribunal was appointed to
   try Luther's doctrines. At the head of this tribunal was placed
   Luther's declared opponent, Prierias; and the monk received a summons
   to appear within sixty days at Rome to answer for his theses.
   Compliance with this summons would have been fatal to him. Once in the
   hands of the cardinals, the fate of Huss, or a secret and still more
   terrible one, awaited him. His university accordingly interceded, and
   the Elector at length took active steps, and claimed that, as a German,
   he should be heard in Germany rather than in Rome. This was conceded,
   and Luther was appointed to appear before the papal legate Cajetan,
   then present at the Diet of Augsburg.

   But while thus seeming to yield to a fair investigation of the case,
   the papal court, with true Roman perfidy, had prejudged it, and
   despatched secret instructions to the legate to deal with Luther as a
   notorious heretic, and forthwith excommunicate him, unless he recanted
   his opinions. Unwitting of this judgment, Luther hastened to present
   himself before the legate, under the protection of a safe-conduct
   procured through the zealous intervention of his friends. Cajetan met
   him with the most bland and smiling kindness. The affair seemed to him
   only to require a little smoothness and address. The idea of
   conscientious conviction in a poor monk was unintelligible to him. He
   offered two propositions to Luther--the one as to the spiritual virtue
   of indulgences, and the other as to the necessity of faith to the
   efficacy of the sacraments and he was asked; in opposition to his
   supposed views, to admit the affirmative of the one and the negative of
   the other. Submit, and recant your errors, was all that the legate had
   to say to him. Submission without conviction, however, was about the
   very last idea that had entered into Luther's mind. It is a fine and
   typical contrast between the moral earnestness of the Teuton, and the
   diplomatic accommodation of the Italian. "Most reverend father," said
   Luther, "deign to point out to me in what I have erred." "You must
   revoke both these errors, and embrace the true doctrine of the Church,"
   was all the answer. "I ask for Scripture; it is on Scripture my views
   are founded." "Do you not know that the Pope is above all?" "Not above
   Scripture." "Yes, above Scripture, and above councils. Retract, my son,
   retract it is hard for you to kick against the pricks." It was of no
   use. They could not get near to one another, and never could have done.
   Thrice the conference was broken up, and thrice renewed. At length
   irritated self-esteem broke through the fair courtesy of the Italian.
   "Retract," he cried, "or never appear in my presence again." Luther
   retired in silence, and set forth in writing the grounds on which,
   while willing to acknowledge that he might have spoken unadvisedly and
   irreverently of the Pontiff, he could not retract his doctrines, for
   that would be against his conscience. Cajetan made no reply. He felt
   that he had been foiled, and his real feelings betrayed themselves in
   an unguarded moment to Staupitz. "I will not speak with the beast
   again; he has deep eyes, and his head is full of speculation." What his
   designs were, remain unknown. Luther became convinced of his danger,
   hastily drew up two letters, the one to the legate, the other to the
   Pope, strongly repelling the imputation of heresy, and appealing from
   "Leo ill-informed to Leo well-informed;" and having procured horse and
   guide, he fled during the night from Augsburg, and with all speed
   reached Wittenberg. On his homeward way he was made acquainted with the
   secret instructions of the court of Rome, and with characteristic
   generosity offered to the Elector to retire into France till the storm
   had blown over. But this was not to be: God had further and higher work
   for him to do. The university resisted his proposal, and the Elector
   refused to part with him.

   Baffled so far, the papal court made a further attempt at negotiation.
   Miltitz, himself a German, and the envoy of the Pope to the Saxon
   court, undertook the office of mediator. He understood the necessities
   of the case better than Cajetan. He even recognised the justice of the
   attack on the indulgence system, by bringing Tetzel to task, dismissing
   and disgracing him. He was content to impose silence on the offending
   monk, without demanding retractation, and Luther for a while consented
   to keep the peace. The truce, however, was hollow; it was not in the
   nature of things: the current of change had set in too strongly. Luther
   himself, while constantly reluctant to advance, felt that he was driven
   onward, as if by a higher power. "God hurries, drives, not to say leads
   me," he wrote to Staupitz. "I am not master of myself. I wish to be
   quiet, and am hurried into the midst of tumults." And so the movement
   gathered force under apparent repression. The current only channelled
   for itself a deeper and wider course, from being shut up and sealed
   from outlet for a time. The convictions of the reformer were assuming a
   bolder scope. "Whatever I have hitherto done against Rome," he said,
   "has been in jest; soon I shall be in earnest. Let, me whisper in your
   ear that I am not sure whether the Pope is antichrist or his apostle."
   And this, too, while he still kept appealing to the Pope in language
   deprecatory, and even servile in its adulation. [16] This
   inconsistency, if not defensible, was very intelligible in Luther.
   There was a violent conflict raging in him, between the new ideas
   forcing themselves upon him from all sides, and his old and natural
   feeling of monkish obedience. Bold as he was, there were moments when
   he had dark and painful misgivings, and would fain have rested quietly
   in the bosom of the Church. More and more, however, the new ideas
   gathered force and shape, and took firm possession of him. It was no
   longer merely the special abuse of indulgences, but the general
   pretensions of the hierarchical Roman system, that actuated and
   impelled him forward. The indulgence controversy had done its work. A
   glare of light had been let in upon the hideous abuses of the
   prevailing ecclesiasticism. A rent had been made in the great
   sacerdotal fabric. Miltitz cunningly sought to patch up the rent, and
   shut out the streaming light but the time had passed for such
   compromise. The spirit moved was too earnest to be thus allayed: the
   arm which had rudely given the shock was too brawny and restless in its
   youthful power to be thus stroked into quietness. The work of
   destruction went on, and through the tumbling timbers of the crazy
   edifice light came rushing in at all points. Luther himself was amazed
   at the discoveries that crowded upon him.

   The Leipzig disputation with Dr Eck marks this great advance in his
   views. It is no longer a question merely as to indulgences and the
   power of the Pope on a special point, but a question as to the general
   supremacy of the Pope. So far as the doctrine of indulgences was
   concerned, Luther's adversary gave in on almost every point; but he
   made a vigorous stand on general grounds in behalf of the absolute
   supremacy of the Pope, arguing, among other reasons, from the basis of
   the well-known text, Matt. xvi. 18, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock
   I will build My church." Luther maintained the customary Protestant
   version of the text, applying the rock to Christ, whom Peter had just
   confessed to be the Son of the living God. He claimed for Christ the
   sole absolute headship of the Church: although, at the same time, he
   did not deny the primary ecclesiastical position of the Pope, nor his
   right to that position as a mere constitutional arrangement. Eck tried
   to frighten him, and cast discredit on his doctrines, by raising the
   old cry of "Bohemian" against them; but Luther was not to be moved by
   such imputations, and did not hesitate to defend some of the articles
   of Huss. The controversy lasted for days, and at length terminated with
   the usual issue in such controversies: both sides claimed the victory.
   A drawn battle, however, at this crisis was for Rome equivalent to a
   defeat. Luther was hailed more than ever as the champion of the
   national indignation, rising always more urgently against Rome. The
   question of indulgences was forgotten as the tide of national feeling
   swelled higher, and it became more manifest every day that the real
   question was Germany or Rome,--national independence or hierarchical
   bondage; and still more deeply,--Scripture or Church,--conscience or
   authority. The popular sympathy showed itself eagerly in numberless
   satires and caricatures of Eck and his party. Even Erasmus joined in
   the affray with his cold glancing mockery, [17] and Hutten, after his
   peculiar fashion, aimed a trenchant blow at the papal champion in the
   "Planed-off Corner" (der abgehobelte Eck). [18] Copies of the
   disputation in thirty different versions were rapidly bought up. Luther
   was now fairly engaged in a lifelong struggle, and the fight went
   bravely on.

   From this point onwards to the Diet of Worms the life of Luther rises
   to its highest pitch of heroism. No one ever stood more fully in the
   light of a nation's hopes, or answered, upon the whole, more nobly to
   them. Recognising his great position, he stood to it like a true man;
   and as the battle was now joined, he spared not those "thunderbolts,"
   [19] which no one knew better how to use in a moment of need. Resting
   for a month or two to gather breath after his contest with Eck, in the
   course of the following June (1520) he published his famous address to
   the "Christian Nobles of Germany." It was only a few sheets, but never
   did words tell more powerfully. "The time for silence is past," he
   said, "the time to speak is come." He struck a clear and loud note of
   national independence, and summoned the Christian powers of Germany to
   his aid. "Talk of war against the Turk," he cried; "the Roman Turk is
   the fellest Turk in the world--Roman avarice the greatest thief that
   ever walked the earth: all goes into the Roman sack, which has no
   bottom, and all in the name of God too!" He reiterated in brief and
   emphatic language the great truth which had begun to dawn upon him at
   Leipzig, that all Christians are priests, and that consequently the
   clerical office is a mere function or order: he maintained the
   independence of all national churches, and the rights of national and
   social life, against ecclesiastical usurpation. He drew a strong
   picture of the miserable exactions and oppressions of the Papal See,
   and cast back with no measure its insolence in its very teeth. "Hearest
   thou, O Pope, not all-holy, but all-sinful, who gave thee power to lift
   thyself above God, and break His laws? The wicked Satan lies through
   thy throat. O my Lord Christ, hasten Thy last day, and destroy the
   devil's nest at Rome." The impression produced by such language may be
   more easily imagined than described. In the course of a fortnight 4000
   copies of the address were sold, and before the end of the month a new
   edition was in print, and speedily bought up. This address was followed
   in October by a treatise "On the Babylonish Captivity of the Church,"
   in which he attacked with vigour the abuses into which its sacramental
   system had grown. He now looked back, as it were, with pity on his
   former indulgence to the Papacy. In the course of two years, and during
   his disputes with Eck, Emser, and others, his eyes had become greatly
   opened. After hearing and reading the "artful subtleties of these
   champions," [20] he was certain that the Papacy was "the kingdom of
   Babylon, and the power of Nimrod the mighty hunter." "I must now deny
   that there are. seven sacraments, and bind them to three--baptism, the
   Lord's Supper, and penance; and even these are led by the Church of
   Rome into a wretched prison, and the Church is robbed of all her
   liberty." He defended, as he never ceased to do, the literal reality of
   Christ's presence in the Supper; but he warmly combated the Thomist
   definitions of that presence, resting on a supposed Aristotelic
   distinction of subject and accident; and he zealously maintained the
   right of the laity to the cup as well as the bread. These two works,
   with his sermon "On the Liberty of a Christian Man," mark the very
   crisis of the movement. Appealing, on the one hand, to the' excited
   national interests of Germany, and, on the other hand, to its reviving
   spiritual life, they struck, with a happy success, the two most
   powerful chords then vibrating in the nation. "They contain," Ranke
   says, "the kernel of the whole Reformation." They concentrate its
   spirit while they signalise its triumph.

   The publication of the papal bull just at this time consummated the
   crisis. It had been obtained by the reckless importunity of Eck nearly
   a year before; but great difficulty had been felt in making it public,
   owing to the enthusiasm now so widely spread on behalf of the reformer.
   At length Eck fixed upon Leipzig as the place where he supposed that he
   could promulgate it most safely under the protection of Duke George;
   but even here, where so recently he had been hailed by the university
   as the champion of the Papacy, the students now seized and insulted
   him, and he was glad to make his escape. He fled for his life to
   Erfurt; but here too the students attacked him, laid hold of the bull,
   and threw it into the river, saying, "It is a bubble, let it swim."
   These demonstrations were crowned by Luther's own daring act on the
   10th of December (1520). Assembling the doctors, students, and citizens
   at the Elster Gate of Wittenberg on this memorable day, a fire of wood
   was kindled, and Luther, clad in his cowl, and with the papal bull and
   decretals in his hand, approached it, and cast them into the fire,
   saying, "As thou hast vexed the saints of God, so mayest thou be
   consumed in eternal fire." This irrevocable act severed Luther for ever
   from the Papacy. There was no compromise--no truce even henceforth
   possible. The battle must be fought out.

   With such high-hearted courage and clear trust in God on the part of
   the reformer, there was Ito doubt on whose side the victory would
   declare.

   The moment of Luther's proudest triumph was now at hand. Charles V. had
   recently succeeded to the Empire. He was only twenty years of age,
   inexperienced, and unconscious of all that was going on in Germany. "He
   understood neither its language nor its thoughts." [21] Naturally of a
   superstitious temper, his sacerdotal leanings were already manifest,
   and the papal party, with Aleander (the papal nuncio) at their head,
   failed in no efforts to influence him against the Reformation. They
   urged him to take some decided step--to cause the books of Luther to be
   burned throughout the Empire, and so to declare his determination to
   uphold the cause of the Church. The inclinations of Charles admit of no
   doubt; but he was too ignorant of the real meaning and magnitude of the
   movement, and hemmed in by too many practical difficulties, to be able
   to adopt and carry out a clear and uncompromising policy. Opposed to
   the zealots of the Papacy, the extreme national party approached him
   with the boldest suggestions. He was pressed to call the free national
   party, led by Hutten and Sickingen, to his aid. Hutten himself
   addressed him, offering to serve him day and night without fee or
   reward, if only he would throw off the trammels of a foreign
   ecclesiastical yoke, and place himself at the head of the German
   people. Add to this that he was mainly indebted for his imperial
   dignity to Luther's friend, the Elector Frederick, and the complexities
   of his position may be imagined.

   After being crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 28th January 1521,
   Charles had proceeded to Worms, where he assembled his first Diet of
   the sovereigns and states of Germany. It was the great object of
   Aleander, Eck, and the rest of the papal leaders, to have Luther
   condemned unheard, and with this view Aleander made a lengthened speech
   at the Diet. They succeeded so far as to induce the Emperor to issue an
   edict for the destruction of the reformer's books but the Estates
   refused to publish it, unless Luther had first an opportunity of
   confronting his accusers under a safe-conduct, and answering, before
   the Diet, to the charges preferred against him. Nothing could be more
   congenial to the present temper of Luther. It was exactly what he most
   desired--to confess the truth before the assembled powers of Germany.
   He made up his mind at once to obey the summons, and wrote bravely to
   Spalatin (the Elector's secretary)--"I will be carried hither sick, if
   I cannot go sound. . . . Expect everything from me but flight or
   retractation."

   Nothing can well be grander--more epical in its contrasts, more scenic
   in its adjuncts, and more impressive in its issues--than this passage
   in the history of the Reformation,--the journey of Luther, with its
   strange and mixed incidents--his appearance in Worms--his appearance
   before the Diet--his prayer beforehand--his fears--his triumph--the
   excitements that followed his triumph--his seizure on his return, and
   residence in the Wartburg. It would be difficult to find anywhere a
   nobler subject for a great poem.

   He set out on his mission on the 2d of April, with the sympathy and
   good wishes of all the Wittenbergers. He travelled in a carriage
   provided for the occasion by the town-council; and his friends of the
   university and others assembled to witness his departure. The imperial
   herald, clad in the insignia of his office, rode first, his servant
   followed; Luther and his comrades brought up the rear. His progress
   resembled a triumph. As he passed towns and villages the people came
   forth in numbers to greet him. At the hotels where he rested, crowds
   thronged to see him, and there were "drinking of healths, good cheer,
   and the delights of music." [22] As he left Nuremberg a priest sent
   after him a portrait of the Italian reformer Savonarola, with a letter
   exhorting him "to be manful for the truth, and to stand by God, and God
   would stand by him." At Weimar the imperial messengers were seen
   posting on the walls an edict summoning all who were in possession of
   his books to deliver them up to the magistrates. The herald turned to
   inquire if he were moved by such a sign of danger. "I will go on," he
   said, "although they should kindle a fire between Wittenberg and Worms
   to reach to heaven. I will confess Christ in Behemoth's mouth, between
   his great teeth." At Erfurt he preached, and a crowd of tender
   associations rushed upon his mind as he gazed at the convent, the scene
   of his spiritual birth; and as he stood by the grave of one of his
   former companions, a brother monk, "How calmly he sleeps, and I"--was
   his remark to Jonas, while he leaned upon the gravestone absorbed in
   thought, until warned of the lateness of the hour. At Eisenach, amidst
   the scenes of his boyhood, he was seized with a dangerous illness. His
   strength and spirits forsook him; but he went on in calm trust in God.
   At Heidelberg he held a public discussion: and undeterred by the
   remonstrances which were now poured upon him even from his best
   friends--unreduced by the well-meant intentions of Sickingen and others
   to retain him in safety at his castle of Ehrenberg--he approached the
   imperial city. Even Spalatin was alarmed, and sought to stay him.
   "Carry back," was the answer, "that I am resolved to enter Worms in the
   name of the Lord Jesus Christ, although as many devils should set at me
   as there are tiles on the house-tops."

   It has been supposed by Audin, Luther's modern Romanist biographer,
   that it was on this occasion,--as the old towers of Worms came in
   sight, and the full greatness of the crisis rushed upon him,--that,
   rising in his carriage, he chanted his famous hymn, "Ein' feste Burg
   isi unser Gott," "the Marseillaise," Audin significantly adds, "of the
   Reformation." The suggestion adds a grandeur to the event; but there is
   reason to believe that the hymn was not composed till some years later.
   [23]

   He entered Worms on the 16th of April, escorted by his friends and
   numbers of the Saxon noblemen, who had gone out to meet him. As he
   passed through the city, so great was the crowd that pressed to see
   him, that he had to be conducted through back courts to his inn. More
   than two thousand assembled at the Deutscher Hof where he took up his
   abode, and till late at night his room was thronged by nobles and
   clergy who came to visit him. After his room was cleared, a different
   picture might have been seen. The bold monk prostrated himself in an
   agony of prayer. His voice was heard in snatches by his friends as it
   rose to heaven, and it is impossible to read anything more touching and
   awe-inspiring than the fragments of this prayer which have been
   preserved. [24] On the following day he received intimation to attend
   before the Diet and in the afternoon of the same day, amidst the dark
   frowns of Spanish warriors and ecclesiastics, and the whisperings of
   affectionate and courageous sympathy, he was ushered into the imperial
   presence.

   The scene which presented itself in the Diet was one well fitted to
   move the boldest heart. The Emperor sat elevated on his throne, with
   the three ecclesiastical Electors on his right, the three secular on
   his left; his brother Frederick sat on a chair of state below the
   throne the nobles, knights, and delegates of free cities around; the
   papal nuncio in front. "The sun, verging to its setting, streamed full
   on the scene of worldly magnificence, strangely varied by every colour
   and form of dress: the Spanish cloak of yellow silk, the velvet and
   ermine of the Electors, the red robes of cardinals, the violet robes of
   bishops, the plain sombre garb of deputies of towns and priests." The
   monk stood alone, with his head uncovered, pale with recent illness and
   hard study, with little or none as yet of the brave rotundity [25] of
   his later age,--a pale and slight figure "encircled by the dark
   flashing line of the mailed chivalry of Germany." Little wonder that at
   first he seemed bewildered, and that his voice sounded feeble and
   hesitating. His old adversary Eck was the spokesman of his party, and
   loudly challenged him--first, as to whether he acknowledged the books
   before him as his writings; and, secondly, as to whether he would
   retract and recall them. To the first question he replied in the
   affirmative; in answer to the second, he demanded a day's delay to
   consider and frame an answer. Many thought he was at length frightened,
   and would temporise; but on the following day they were abundantly
   undeceived. All signs of timidity and hesitation had then vanished; he
   had had time to meditate an adequate reply, and in a speech of two
   hours, first in German and then in Latin, he expressed his
   determination to abide by what he had written, and called upon the
   Emperor and the States to take into consideration the evil condition of
   the Church, lest God should visit the Empire and German nation with His
   judgments. Being pressed for a direct answer, yea or nay, whether he
   would retract, he answered finally in the memorable words--"Unless I be
   convinced by Scripture and reason, I neither can nor dare retract
   anything; for my conscience is a captive to God's word, and it is
   neither safe nor right to go against conscience. Here I take my stand:
   I can do no otherwise. So help me God. Amen."

   The picture is barely half sketched; many strokes half humorous, half
   sublime, with a touching quaintness stamping them upon the memory,
   would be required to complete it. Sympathy with his position, and with
   his grand and simple daring, expressed itself in numerous incidents.
   The old warrior Freundsberg, the most gallant and renowned soldier of
   his day, greeted him as he entered the imperial presence. "My good
   monk, you are going a path such as I and our captains, in our hardest
   fight, have never trodden. But if you are sure of your cause, go on in
   God's name: fear not; He will not leave you." On his return to his
   hotel, Eric, the aged Duke of Brunswick, sent him a silver can of
   Einbech beer, in token of his admiration and sympathy; and the weary
   monk, parched with thirst, raised it to his lips, and took a long
   draught, saying, as he set it down, "As Duke Eric has remembered me
   this day, so may our Lord Christ remember him in his last struggle."
   Again Philip, the young Landgrave of Hesse, is seen riding into the
   courtyard of the inn, leaping from his horse, and as he rushes into
   Luther's room, greeting him with the words, "My dear Doctor, how do
   matters go with you?" "My gracious lord, with God's help all will go
   well," was the reply. "They tell me," the Landgrave added, "that you
   teach that, if a woman be married to an old man, it is lawful for her
   to quit him for a husband that is younger." "No, no! Your highness must
   not say so." "Well, Doctor, if your cause is just, may God aid you;"
   and seizing the reformer's hand, he shook it warmly, and disappeared as
   abruptly as he had come.

   Luther tarried some days in Worms, and various attempts were made to
   bring him to a more submissive frame of mind, but all without success.
   Questioned at length as to whether any remedy remained for the unhappy
   dissensions which had sprung up, "I know not of any," he replied,
   "except the advice of Gamaliel: If this counsel or this work be of men,
   it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.'
   Let the Emperor and the States write to the Pope that they are fully
   assured that, if the doctrines so much decried are not of God, they
   will perish by a natural death within two or three years." Strong in
   the confidence of the truth he taught, he fearlessly appealed to the
   future. He was at once courageous and humble--courageous in the face of
   man, and humble before God--the true spirit in which alone the world
   can ever be reformed.

   He received instructions to depart from Worms and return home on the
   25th of April. On the following day he set out. He appears himself to
   have been in high spirits, excited and braced by the conflict in which
   he had been engaged. A letter which he wrote from Frankfort to his
   friend Lucas Cranach, gives a lively impression of his cheerfulness in
   the caricature which it presents of the proceedings of the Diet. [26]
   "My service, dear Gossip Lucas. I supposed that his imperial majesty
   would have assembled some fifteen doctors or so, and have overcome the
   monk by argument: but no, nothing of the sort. Are the books
   yours?'--Yes.' Will you revoke or not?'--No.' Get you gone then.' O
   blind Germans, what children we are, to let the Roman apes scoff at and
   befool us in this way. Give my gossip, your dear wife, my greeting; and
   I trust she will keep well till I have the pleasure of seeing her
   again. . . . For a short time we must be silent and endure. A little
   time, and ye shall not see me; and again a little time, and ye shall
   see me. I hope it will prove so with us." These last expressions, as
   well as others still more explicit in the letter, show that he was
   cognisant of the design of his friends to seize and conceal him in some
   place of safety for a while; but how the design was to be carried out,
   or where he was to be placed, "seems to have been but indistinctly
   communicated to him. He has himself narrated the circumstances of his
   seizure. As he left Eisenach, where he had preached and solaced himself
   for a single day in the company of his relatives, and was passing a
   narrow defile near the fortress of Altenstein, two armed horsemen, with
   armed attendants, rushed upon him and his friends. The waggoner was
   thrown to the ground. His brother, James Luther, who was of the party,
   fled and escaped, and Amsdorf was held fast while Luther was hurried
   away, mount upon a horse; and after various turnings, with the view of
   eluding all pursuit, he was safely lodged in the old castle of the
   Wartburg. The affair was made to assume the appearance of violence for
   obvious reasons, but in reality Amsdorf was conscious of the intentions
   of Luther's friends, and he and the waggoner of course were quietly
   permitted to pursue their way after the horsemen had departed with
   their prisoner.

   Luther's residence in the Wartburg forms a quiet and green
   resting-place in his life, while it serves to mark the two great
   divisions into which it falls. From the fair heights of the Wartburg
   and the pleasant repose of his stay there, we look back with him upon a
   period of advancing struggle now completed, and forward upon a period
   scarcely less one of struggle, though of a far less consistent
   character. Hitherto all the interest of the movement is concentrated in
   his single figure. It is the monk at Erfurt and then the preacher at
   Wittenberg, and then the reformer at Worms, that engage our view. In
   all these different aspects we see the progress of a great spiritual
   conflict, waged almost by a solitary arm against surrounding
   corruptions. There is scarcely a companion figure to distract our
   attention. The purely religious impulse communicated by Staupitz is
   beheld strengthening into the earnest activity of the opponent of
   indulgences, and finally expanding into a clear and firm logical
   conviction directed against the whole hierarchical system which sought
   to extinguish it. The flame, kindled at the light of Scripture quietly
   read in the convent library, gradually burns into zeal, and at length
   blazes into triumphant defiance in the face of Pope and Emperor. From
   this point of advance Luther now looked at once backwards and forwards,
   and felt that he had done enough. Never was man less of an iconoclast.
   He fought for certain great religious principles as he apprehended
   them, but he had little or no wish to destroy existing institutions.
   Monkery, in all its shapes, had become hateful to him, and he resolved
   to attack it still more definitely than he had done; but the old
   Catholic worship and system, so far as it was national and not
   obviously Roman, he had no intention of subverting. To such feelings we
   must trace in great part the marked change in his subsequent career.
   The principle of revolt had exhausted itself in him with his great
   stand at Worms, and his naturally conservative convictions began to
   reassert themselves. We find, accordingly, that his life on from this
   point presents a far more complex and inconsistent picture than that
   which we have been contemplating. While many whom the spirit of the
   times had affected were disposed to go forward in the path on which he
   had entered, others had already before this begun to turn, back; and he
   is seen occupying a position of conflict both with the one and with the
   other. The Papacy on one side and his single figure on the other no
   longer fill up the scene; but other figures, some reactionary, and
   others of an impatient and violent character, crowd round, and he is
   beheld mingling in the crowd, rather than as any longer its controller
   and guide.

   His publication of his translation of the Scriptures; his controversy
   with Carlstadt and then with Erasmus; the peasant war in 1525, and his
   marriage in the same year; the conference at Marburg with Zwingli in
   1529; and the Diet at Augsburg and residence at Coburg in the following
   year, mark the most important epochs in this latter part of his life.
   The last sixteen years of his life are comparatively unmarked by
   incident or controversy; but it is the Luther of this period that,
   after all, in some respects, we know best, as portrayed by himself in
   his letters, and especially in his Table-talk, and as surrounded by his
   wife, children, and friends.

   In the Wartburg he tarried for about a year, attired and living in all
   outward appearance as a knight. He let his beard grow, wore a sword,
   and went by the name of Younker George. He rambled among the hills and
   hunted, notwithstanding that the ban of the Empire was out against him.
   In the hunting-field, however, he was still the theologian, and thought
   of Satan and the Pope, with their impious troops of bishops and
   divines, hunting simple souls as he saw the hare pursued by the dogs.
   "I saved one poor leveret alive," he says, "and tied it in the sleeve
   of my coat, and removed to a little distance; but the dogs scented out
   their victim, sprang up at it, broke its leg, and throttled it. It is
   thus that Satan and the Pope rage." [27] Although grieved to be absent
   from the scene, he rejoiced to know that the conflict still went on;
   and the old walls rang with his laughter as some satirical pamphlet of
   Hutten or Lucas Cranach reached him in his retreat. "I sit here the
   whole day idle and full of meat and drink," he writes to Spalatin ten
   days after his arrival; "and read the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. I am
   writing a sermon in German on the liberty of auricular confession; and
   I shall proceed with my comments upon the Psalms and with the Bible as
   soon as ever I have received what I want from Wittenberg." [28] It was
   at this time he began his greatest literary achievement--the
   translation of the Scriptures into his native language. He had few
   books with him, but by the indefatigable zeal and interest with which
   he worked, he completed his version of the whole of the New Testament
   during the period of his confinement (nine months). Add to this, three
   treatises--on Private Confession, on the Abuse of Private Masses, and
   on Monastic Vows--besides his commentaries and postils, and his
   accusation against himself of idleness will appear sufficiently
   strange.

   In fact, sedentary habits and hard study began to tell upon his health.
   He heard noises and seemed to see the devil in imaginary shapes as he
   sat at night in his room, or as he lay in bed. A bag of hazel nuts
   which had been brought to him by two noble youths who waited upon him
   with his food, was violently agitated by satanic power, one night after
   he retired to rest. [29] The nuts rolled and struck against one another
   with such force that they made the beams of the room to shake, and the
   bed on which he was lying to rattle. The same night, although the steps
   leading to his solitary apartment were barred fast with iron chains and
   an iron door, he was roused from his sleep by a tremendous rumbling up
   and down the steps, which he describes as though threescore casks were
   rolling up and down. Nothing doubting that it was the devil at work
   trying to molest him, he got up and walked to the stair's head, and
   called aloud, "Is it thou? be it so then! I commend me to the Lord
   Christ, of whom it is written in the eighth Psalm, Thou hast put all
   things under His feet.'" On another and still more memorable occasion,
   as he pored keenly over the pages of his Greek Testament, the enemy
   assailed him in the shape of a moth buzzing round his ears and
   disturbing him in his sacred task. His spirit was kindled in him by the
   envious pertinacity of the evil one, and seizing his inkstand he hurled
   it at the intruder. A hole of singularly apocryphal dimensions in the
   wall of the chamber which he inhabited, is pointed out to the traveller
   who can spare a long summer's day to visit the Wartburg and enjoy
   himself on its breezy slopes, as the mark made by the reformer's
   inkstand in this great encounter.

   It is well to smile at such incidents, but Luther lived all his days in
   the most real and pervading belief of a personal and visible devil
   haunting him in all his work, and never ceasing to disturb and hinder
   him. Once, in his monastery at Wittenberg, after he had celebrated
   matins and begun his studies, "the devil," he says, "came into his cell
   and thrice made a noise behind a stove, just as though he were dragging
   some wooden measure along the floor" (a mouse, probably, as one has
   heard the little creature in the quiet night, with no other noise in
   the room save the creaking of the ceaseless pen). "As I found he was
   going to begin again," he adds, "I gathered together my books and got
   into bed." "Another time in the night I heard him above my cell,
   walking in the cloister; but as I knew it was the devil, I paid no
   attention to him and went to sleep." There is almost an affectionate
   familiarity in some of his expressions--a gentleness of chiding and
   humorous badinage mingling with the irony and insult, which he thinks
   are among the best weapons for encountering his foe. "Early this
   morning when I awoke, the fiend came and began disputing with me. Thou
   art a great sinner,' said he. I replied, Canst thou not tell me
   something new, Satan?'" Again, "When the devil comes to me in the night
   I say to him, Devil, I must now sleep; for it is the command and
   ordinance of God that we labour by day and sleep by night.' If he goes
   on with the old story, accusing me of sin, I say to him, to vex him,
   Holy Spirit, Satan, pray for me.' Go,' I say to him, Physician, cure
   thyself.'" "The best way," he adds, "of getting rid of the devil, if
   you cannot do it with the words of Holy Scripture, is to rail at him
   and mock him: he cannot bear scorn." A very efficient plan also is "to
   turn your thoughts to some pleasant subject; to tell or hear jests or
   merry stories out of some facetious book. Music, too, is very good, for
   the devil is a saturnine spirit, and music is hateful to him, and
   drives him far away from it."

   This sort of belief will appear superstitious in a different degree to
   different minds; but there are some forms which the belief assumes not
   only to Luther, but to the more severe and sober mind of Calvin, so
   absolutely credulous and fanatical as to be matters of mere amazement
   to us now. [30] And yet, in truth, it is rather the form of credulity
   that is changed than the spirit of it that is extinguished, as many
   things in our own day, bearing upon this very subject, plainly witness.

   As Luther pursued his literary labours in the Wartburg, stimulating by
   his writings the spirit which his noble acts had kindled, unpleasant
   news reached his ears as to the progress of the Reformation in its home
   in Wittenberg. Carlstadt and some others, uncontrolled by his
   master-spirit, began to carry out to its natural consequences the
   spirit of negation involved in the Reformation. Monasteries were
   dissolved, and monks and nuns began to marry. All was in confusion
   without his presence, which was so urgently needed that he made a
   secret visit there in December. He appeared suddenly, and held three
   days' close conference with Amsdorf and other intimate friends. But the
   crisis was still too perilous for him to remain, and he returned to his
   retreat to prosecute his Bible studies and translations.

   In the spring of the following year (1522) Luther completed his
   translation of the New Testament, which may be pronounced his greatest
   literary work. It was almost entirely his own achievement, and he
   grudged no labour to make it perfect. Some of the MSS. of the work
   survive, and show the pains with which he corrected and recorrected
   many times. His aim was everywhere to catch the spirit of the original,
   and reproduce it as far as he could in simple, popular language. He
   chose a dialect, the Franconian, intelligible to High and Low German
   alike, and which has since remained the standard of the German tongue
   and a centre of literary unity for all the German peoples. The
   translation was first published on September 21, 1522. A second edition
   followed immediately, and no book has brought a greater glory to his
   name or a greater blessing to the German race. The translation of the
   Old Testament was a more extended and difficult undertaking, in which
   he called to his assistance not only the occasional advice, but the
   active assistance, of his friends--Melanchthon, Justus Jonas, and
   Bugenhagen--but even Jewish Rabbis, forming what his biographer
   Mathesius calls a kind of "Sanhedrim," which met regularly once a week
   several hours before supper in the old Augustinian monastery at
   Wittenberg, which had become his house. Luther himself describes the
   difficulties of the task. "We are labouring hard," he says, "to bring
   out the Prophets in the mother-tongue. Ach, Gott! what a great and
   difficult work it is to make the Hebrew writers speak German! They
   resist it so, and are unwilling to give up their Hebrew existence and
   become like Germans." By diligent and earnest labour, however--and
   especially by the ever helpful and erudite co-operation of
   Melanchthon--this great work was also accomplished, and a translation
   of the whole Bible was published in 1534.

   Unhappily, disturbances grew rather than abated at Wittenberg. It was
   only in the nature of things that the spirit of religious freedom,
   having rapidly spread, should burst bonds and run to excess. The
   popular mind, when aroused to a sense of the deceptions which had been
   practised upon it for centuries, broke out into extreme manifestations
   of hostility against the old Church system, in its forms as well as its
   doctrines, and a furious iconoclasm crowned the movement. It is the
   gift of but few minds--and never the gift of the mere popular and
   logical mind--to separate the form and the spirit, and to recognise
   that all reformation of any worth is in the latter and not in the
   former, which will by-and-by accommodate itself, without being
   violently cast down, to the improved and higher spirit. Carlstadt was
   merely a prominent expression of this popular and logical spirit. He
   was a species of German Puritan before that moral feeling had yet
   arisen, which in its strength and intensity was to become Puritanism.
   His projects were undoubtedly mistaken and out of place. Germany was
   then wholly unfitted for Puritanism, and never, in fact, has had any
   sympathy with it. Its higher minds, like Luther himself, were already
   beyond it in the breadth and tenderness of sentiment, and the richness
   and diversity of natural feeling which animated them. The ignorant mind
   again was far below it in the rudeness and lawlessness of its moral
   desires. Carlstadt, therefore, as the sequel sufficiently showed, could
   bring nothing but social disorder to Germany and disgrace to the
   Reformation; and Luther knew this with his clear, upright, and
   comprehensive appreciation of the national temper. After he fairly saw,
   therefore, that the danger was real, he made up his mind to quit his
   shelter in the Wartburg, come what would, and resume the direction of
   affairs at his old post.

   He re-entered Wittenberg on the 7th of March 1522. In the course of his
   journey thither, he tarried a night at Jena, and a very interesting
   account has been preserved of his interview with two students on their
   way to Wittenberg to see him. The little parlour in the Black Bear,
   with the reformer in his knightly disguise--red mantle, trunk hose,
   doublet, and ridingwhip--seated at table, his right hand resting on the
   pommel of his sword, while his eye was directed intently to a book
   which turned out to be the Hebrew Psalter; the respectful demeanour of
   the students before the supposed knight, and their gradually opening
   familiarity as he offered them seats at the table, and a glass of beer;
   their communication to him of their intention to proceed to Wittenberg
   to see Martin Luther, and his pleasant fence with them on the subject;
   the entry of two merchants, and the free opinion which they express of
   Luther; the landlord's hints and the disclosure,--all present a vivid
   sketch of the frank manly bearing, genuine heartiness, and humourous
   kindly ease of the great Augustine, that is worth a hundred
   descriptions.

   He mounted the pulpit on the first Sunday after his return, and
   delivered his opinion on the principles which should guide them in the
   great religious changes through which they were passing--the reality of
   sin and salvation--the necessity of faith and love; these were the main
   things to be concerned about, and not mere novelties or changes for
   their own sake. "All things are lawful, but all things are not
   expedient. Some things must be, others might or might not be. Faith
   must be. But in such things as might or might not be, regard must be
   paid to the profit of others." [31] On Monday he again preached,
   particularly on the subject of the Mass. "It was bad and detestable,
   especially as it had claimed to be a sacrifice, and to stand between
   the people and God. His wish was that all private masses throughout the
   world were abolished, and only the common evangelical mass celebrated.
   But love must reign in the matter. No one must draw or tear another
   away by the hair, but leave God to do His own work, for the plain
   reason that no man has in his hand the hearts of others, and no man can
   make his words pass deeper than the ear. The Word of God must be freely
   preached, and this Word must be left to work in the heart. Then, and
   not till then, should the work of abolition begin." [32] In a similar
   spirit he handled the monastic life and the subject of images, the
   sacrament in both kinds, and confession. Earnestness of principle,
   moderation in practice, was the key-note of all this remarkable series
   of sermons, listened to by crowded audiences day after day. Carlstadt
   and his associates were awed for the time; such images as had not been
   destroyed were replaced; the Latin service continued to be used, with
   the omission of the words which designated it a sacrifice; and peace
   was restored. Luther himself earnestly desired further changes, and
   especially that the communion service should be in the German tongue;
   but he would not yield as yet to Carlstadt's principle of this being
   essential. "This is carrying the thing too far," he said; "always new
   laws always laying down this as a necessity, and that as a sin." [33]
   Thus the strictly Puritanical spirit was wholly alien to him; he would
   have nothing of it.

   We cannot trace the changing relations which henceforth ensued between
   Luther and Carlstadt, now in fierce opposition, and now in comparative
   harmony, the latter ever and again returning to Wittenberg to shelter
   himself behind the good-nature and the really tolerant temper of the
   reformer. The seeds of fanaticism, which he and the Zwickau preachers
   had sown, soon began to ripen, and to assume a serious expression. The
   people, ignorant, oppressed, and unhappy, caught the free doctrines of
   the new preachers, translated them into the most crude and practical
   application to their own circumstances, and then proceeded by force of
   arms to carry them out and assert their rights. The armed peasantry,
   with Munzer at their head, hold a definite relation to the Zwickau
   fanaticism and Carlstadt; and yet there were distinct features of a
   purely political kind in the peasant insurrection, which it would take
   a long time to unravel. Nothing strikes one more remarkably in reading
   over the articles of complaint with which they began their movement,
   than the singularly moderate and sober spirit which characterises them.
   [34] They move our sympathy now, and they moved Luther's sympathy at
   the time, notwithstanding all his strong feelings of the duty of
   submission and of the horrors of insurrection. He is nowhere greater,
   indeed, than at this great crisis in the history of the Reformation, in
   the manner in which he threw himself between the opposing parties, and,
   on the one hand, set before the nobles and princes of Germany the
   unchristian cruelty of many of their actions; and, on the other hand,
   warned the peasantry of the disgrace and disaster that would attend the
   armed assertion of their rights. No part of Luther's conduct was less
   understood or appreciated at the time. In England, by such men as Sir
   Thomas More, he was identified with the disorders against which he was
   struggling so nobly, and which, save for him, might have been tenfold
   more perilous to the national interests of Germany.

   Words of higher wisdom than those by which he sought to restrain the
   approaching violence it is impossible to conceive. Addressing, in the
   first instance, the princes and nobles, he warns them that it was their
   long oppression and exactions that had roused the peasantry beyond
   endurance. "It is quite clear that we have no one upon earth to thank
   for all this disorder and insurrection but you yourselves. . . . In
   your capacity as secular authorities you manifest yourselves the
   executioners and spoilers of the poor. You sacrifice everything and
   everybody to your monstrous luxury, to your outrageous pride; and you
   have continued to do this until the people neither can nor will endure
   you any longer. . . . It is you, it is your crimes, that God is about
   to punish. If the peasants, who are now attacking you, are not the
   ministers of His will, others coming after them will be so. You may
   beat them, but you will be none the less vanquished. You may crush them
   to the earth, but God will raise up others in their place. It is His
   pleasure to strike you, and He will strike you. You fill up the measure
   of your iniquities by imputing this calamity to the Gospel and to my
   doctrine. Go on with your calumnies: you will ere long discover their
   injustice. You refuse to learn from me what is the Gospel, what my
   doctrine; there are others at your door who will teach you what both
   the one and the other are, in a way very different from mine, if you
   mend not speedily the error of your ways. Have I not at all times
   earnestly, zealously, employed myself in recommending to the people
   obedience to authority, to your authority, even tyrannous as it has
   been--intolerable as it has been? Who has combated sedition more
   energetically than I have always done? It is for this that the prophets
   of murder hate me as bitterly as they do you. You persecuted my Gospel
   by all the means in your power, yet all the while that Gospel called
   upon the people to pray for you, and aided you in supporting your
   tottering authority."

   Then, turning to the peasants, he exhorted them, under all their
   provocations, to desist from violence. "Nevertheless, though your
   complaints are just, and your demands reasonable, it behoves you to
   prosecute these demands with moderation, conscience, and justice. If
   you act with moderation, conscience, and justice, God will aid you; and
   even, though subdued for the moment, you will triumph in the end; and
   those of you who may perish in the struggle will be saved. . . . Put no
   trust, I pray you, in the prophets of murder, whom Satan has raised up
   amongst you, and who proceed directly from him, though they
   sacrilegiously invoke the name of the holy Gospel. They will hate me, I
   know, for the counsel I give you; they will call me hypocrite, but this
   I heed not a whit. What I desire is, to save from the anger of God the
   good and honest among you--I care not for the rest: I heed them not, I
   fear them not. I know One who is stronger than all of them put
   together, and He tells me, in the 3d Psalm, to do that which I am now
   doing. You invoke the name of God, and you say that you will act
   according to His Word. Has not God said, They that take the sword shall
   perish with the sword'? And St Paul, Render, therefore, honour to whom
   honour is due'? How can you, after reading these precepts, still
   pretend that you are acting according to the Gospel? Beware, beware,
   lest a terrible judgment fall upon you!

   "But, say you, authority is wicked, cruel, intolerable; it will not
   allow us the Gospel; it overwhelms us with burdens beyond all reason or
   endurance; it ruins us, soul and body. To this I reply, that the
   wickedness and injustice of authority are no warrant for revolt, seeing
   that it befits not all men indiscriminately to take upon themselves the
   punishment of wickedness. Besides which, the natural law says that no
   man shall be the judge in his own cause, nor revenge his own quarrel.
   The divine law teaches us the same lesson--Vengeance is mine, saith,
   the Lord; I will repay.' Your enterprise, therefore, is not only wrong
   according to Bible and Gospel law, but it is opposed also to natural
   law and to equity; and you cannot properly persevere in it unless you
   can prove that you are called to it by a new commandment of God
   especially directed to you, and confirmed by miracles." [35]

   These solemn words were no doubt ineffectual, but this was not Luther's
   fault. He had done his duty nobly--a duty none the less magnanimous
   that it failed in his object. His mortification and grief at the result
   were extreme; and if we detect in his final words to the peasants--when
   they had proved the fruitlessness of their efforts, and the day of
   sanguinary disaster which he had predicted had. come and gone--a
   bitterness almost cruel, and a 1iarshness that grates on our feelings,
   we must remember that he felt most acutely the disgrace which their,
   movement had brought upon the Reformation. He could not see the fair
   work of God so marred,--the religious revival, for which he wrought,
   thrust back and discredited before the world,--without being deeply
   moved and embittered.

   While Luther was thus standing in the breach, in favour of social
   order, against the peasants, and feeling, in the odium he thereby
   incurred, that he was no longer the popular chieftain he had been a few
   years before, he was made, at the same time, somewhat painfully to feel
   that he was no longer in unison with the mere literary or humanistic
   party in the Reformation. Erasmus, the recognised head of this party,
   had long been showing signs of impatience at what he considered to be
   Luther's rudeness and violence. He could not sympathise in the intense
   earnestness of the Wittenberg reformer: the religious zeal, the depth
   of persuasion, and especially the polemical shape which the latter's
   convictions had assumed in his doctrine of grace, were all
   unintelligible or positively displeasing to him. No two men could be
   more opposed at once in intellectual aspiration and in moral
   temper;--Luther aiming at dogmatic certainty in all matters of faith,
   and filled with an overmastering feeling as to the importance of this
   certainty to the whole religious life, with the most vivid sense of the
   invisible world touching him at every point, and exciting him now with
   superstitious fear, and now with the most hilarious
   confidence;--Erasmus--latitudinarian and philosophical in religious
   opinion, with a strong perception of both sides of any question,
   indifferent or at least hopeless as to exact truth, and with a
   consequently keen dislike of all dogmatic exaggerations, orthodox or
   otherwise--well informed in theology, but without any very living and
   powerful faith, cool, cautious, subtle, and refined, more anxious to
   expose a sophism, or point a barb at some folly, than to fight manfully
   against error and sin. It was impossible that any hearty harmony could
   long subsist between two men of such a different spirit, and having
   such different aims. To do Erasmus justice, it must be remembered that
   his opposition to the Papacy had never been dogmatic, but merely
   critical: he desired literary freedom and a certain measure of
   religious freedom; he hated monkery; but he had no new opinions or
   "truths" for which to contend earnestly, as for life or death. He was
   content to accept the Catholic tradition if it would not disturb him;
   and the Catholic system, with its historic memories and proud
   associations, was dear to his cultivated imagination and taste. It is
   needless to blame Erasmus for his moderation; we might as well blame
   him for not being Luther. He did his own work, just as Luther did his;
   and while we can never compare his character in depth, and power, and
   reality of moral greatness with that of the reformer's, we do not see
   in it the same exaggerations and intolerance that offend many in
   Luther.

   Already, in 1524, Luther felt that there was a breach impending between
   him and the literary patriarch of the time. He was so far from courting
   it, however, that he used careful means to avoid it. Nothing but a
   direct attack of Erasmus would draw him into conflict; he was disposed
   to overlook the sundry sharp side-blows and cuts which had already come
   from the keen armoury of Basle, and to let alone for let alone, if the
   offence were not repeated and aggravated. He acknowledged the services
   of Erasmus in having contributed to the flourishing rise of letters and
   the right understanding of Scripture, and he did not expect any further
   assistance from him in the work of reform. For the Lord had meted out
   to him in this respect but limited gifts (so Luther said), and had not
   seen fit to bestow upon him the energy and direction of mind requisite
   to attack the monsters of the Papacy soundly and boldly. But if this
   was not the case, let him be entreated to remain at least a silent
   spectator of the tragedy. "Do not join your forces to our adversaries;
   publish no books against me, and I will publish none against you." [36]
   Such was the strain in which Luther addressed Erasmus in a remarkable
   letter of this year. We cannot tell how he received the remonstrance.
   It does not seem particularly calculated, as a whole, to smooth his
   vanity or stay his hand. At the very moment he was busy with his
   treatise De Libero Arbitrio,' and the complacent admonitions of the
   reformer were not likely to deaden any of the glancing thrusts that he
   was aiming at the Lutheran doctrine of grace. The treatise saw the
   light in the following year; and Luther, although still disinclined,
   saw no alternative but to come forward in defence of views which he
   considered to be identical with the truth of Scripture. In the course
   of the same year (1525) he published his counter-treatise, De Servo
   Arbitrio,' on which he bestowed great pains, and which he was
   afterwards in the habit of reckoning, along with his Catechism, as
   among his greatest works.

   It would be idle for us to enter into the merits of this controversy,
   and in truth its merits are no longer to us what they were to the
   combatants themselves. The course of opinion has altered this as well
   as many other points of dispute, so that under the same names we no
   longer really discuss the same things. There are probably none, with
   any competent knowledge of the subject, who would care any longer to
   defend the exact position either of Luther or Erasmus. Both are right,
   and both are wrong. Man is free, and yet grace is needful; and the
   philosophic refinements of Erasmus, and the wild exaggerations of
   Luther, have become mere historic dust, which would only raise a cloud
   by being disturbed. Past polemics on such subjects become through time
   utterly dead and unmeaning and while we look for a living face in them,
   we find a mere empty skull--a hollow logical bone-work, from which the
   spirit has fled long years ago. There is reason to think that the
   controversy was far from being satisfying to Luther. He gave his
   adversary, indeed, as good as he got,--admitted his eloquence, but
   ridiculed his arguments, comparing them to "peasecods or waste matter
   served up in vessels of gold and silver." His heavy strokes would be
   felt beneath all the light indifference of the scholar and he was
   strong in the conscious possession of a deep moral conviction that lay
   nearer to the truth than any self-assertion of mere Pelagian subtlety
   but then the torturing dilemmas of his dogmatic position, set in the
   clear light of common sense, and expounded by his adversary with a far
   more philosophic comprehension than he himself possessed, drove him
   into untenable and even unmoral assertions [37] --assertions which
   could scarcely have been satisfactory to his own mind at the time, and
   which, on cool reflection afterwards, must have appeared less and less
   so. He is said to have consequently never recalled with pleasure the
   results of the controversy, and never to have forgiven Erasmus for
   having forced him into it. He spoke of him afterwards as "that
   amphibolous being sitting calmly and unmoved on the throne of
   amphibology, while he cheats and deludes us by his double meaning,
   covert phraseology, and claps his hands when he sees us involved in his
   insidious figures of speech, as a spider rejoices over a captured fly."
   This bitter feeling seems to have sprung up towards Erasmus from the
   determination with which he pursued the subject, and drew out in his
   cool and sinuous way the moral perplexities involved in Luther's bold
   statements. He replied in two treatises under the name of
   Hyperaspistes, and sought to overwhelm the reformer by ingenious
   criticism, and exposures of his prolixity and misrepresentations. "That
   venomous serpent Erasmus," Luther says in a letter to Spalatin, "has
   been once more writing against me." And again, "The treacherous Erasmus
   has brought forth two books against me, as full of cunning poison as a
   serpent." But perhaps the most remarkable evidence of the dislike which
   he henceforth cherished for his adversary is contained in a letter
   addressed to his son John: "Erasmus is an enemy to all religion, and a
   decided adversary to Christ, a counterpart to Epicurus and Lucian. This
   I, Martin Luther, have written to you, my dear son John, and through
   you to all my children and the holy Christian church." [38]

   It was in the same year, and amidst these contentions, that Luther took
   that step in his life which more than any other, except the affair of
   the Landgrave of Hesse, has exposed him to animadversion. On Trinity
   Sunday, the 11th of June (1525), he was married to Catherine von Bora,
   one of nine nuns who had escaped two years previously from the convent
   of Nimptsch and taken refuge in Wittenberg. His intention took his
   friends by surprise, and even alarmed Melanchthon to the point of
   urgent remonstrance. But Luther had made up his mind, after various
   delays; and although he was concerned at the disapprobation of his old
   friend, he was not to be moved from his purpose; and Melanchthon, when
   he saw this, had the good sense to change his tone, and to write to
   Camerarius in apology of the step. Luther does not lead us to suppose
   that he was moved to marriage at this time by any strong affection for
   the object of his choice. "I am not on fire with love," he said, "but I
   esteem my wife." In point of fact, he had originally destined Catherine
   for some one else, and it was only after this project fell through that
   he thought of marrying her himself. [39] It is difficult, perhaps, to
   explain all the reasons which influenced. him. He more than once in his
   letters pleads the advice and desire of his father. He pleads also a
   sense of duty and obedience to the divine command. "I am anxious," he
   writes to Amsdorf, "to be myself an example of what I have taught. It
   is the will of God I follow in this matter." [40] Melanchthon, in the
   letter to Camerarius, to which we have alluded, says somewhat vaguely,
   "It may seem strange that Luther should marry at such an unpropitious
   time, when Germany has especial need of his great and noble mind. But I
   think the case was as follows:--You are aware that Luther is far from
   being one of those who hate men and fly their society; you know his
   daily habits, and so you may conjecture the rest. It is not to be
   wondered at that his generous and great soul was in some way softened."

   It was a sufficiently startling step, no doubt, for a monk to marry a
   nun in the face of the world--and this, too, when the cause of the
   Reformation was undergoing its first violent shock in connection with
   the outbreak of the Zwickau fanatics and the peasants' insurrection.
   But when we look at it apart from these incidents, which do not
   essentially touch the character of the act, however they may affect our
   judgment of its prudence, it seems as if a very unnecessary noise had
   been made about the marriage of the reformer. Even if it had been more
   obviously imprudent than it can be fairly said to be, there is no
   reason why it should have invoked such harsh and invidious judgments as
   even Protestant writers, like Sir James Stephen, have passed upon it.
   If in anything a man is entitled to please himself, it is surely in
   taking a wife at such a mature age as that which Luther had now
   reached; and while certain sacred associations were no doubt outraged
   by the step, no true and natural feelings were violated. In so far as
   the act is to be judged by its consequences, it is well known that it
   proved of the happiest character. It is impossible to conceive a more
   simple and beautiful picture of domestic life than in the letters and
   Table-talk of Luther henceforth. There is a richer charm and tenderness
   and pathos in his whole existence,--rather enhanced than otherwise by
   the slight glimpses we get of the fact that Catherine had a spirit and
   will of her own, and that while she greatly loved and reverenced the
   Doctor, she nevertheless took her own way in such things as seemed good
   to her. Some of the names under which he delights to address her seem
   to point to this little element of imperiousness, though in such a
   frank and merry way as to show that it was a well understood subject of
   banter between them, and nothing more. "My Lord Kate," "My Emperor
   Kate," are some of his titles; and again, in a more circumlocutory
   humour, "For the hands of the rich dame of Zuhlsdorf, Doctoress
   Catherine Luther:" sometimes simply and familiarly, "Kate my rib."
   Nowhere does his genial nature overflow more than in these letters,
   running riot in all sorts of freakish extravagance, yet everywhere
   touched with the deep mellow light of a healthy and happy affection.
   What a pleasant glimpse and sly humour in the following: "In the first
   year of our marriage my Catherine was wont to seat herself beside me
   whilst I was studying; and once not having what else to say, she asked
   me, Sir Doctor! in Russia is not the maître d'hôtel the brother of the
   Margrave?'" And again, in the last year of his life, and when he is on
   that journey of friendliness and benevolence from which he is never to
   return to his dear household, the old spirit of wild fun and tender
   affection survives. He writes to his "heart-loved housewife Catherine
   Lutherinn, Doctoress Zuhlsdorferess, Sow Marketress, and whatever more
   she may be, grace and peace in Christ, and my old poor love in the
   first place."

   Catherine is said by Erasmus to have been very beautiful. [41] Her
   portraits taken by Lucas Cranach represent her with a round full face,
   straight nose, and full tender eyes. Luther himself was greatly taken
   by the likeness, and threatened to send it to the Council of Mantua, to
   see if it would not influence the holy fathers there assembled to
   determine in favour of the marriage rather than the celibacy of the
   clergy.

   Of this marriage there were born six children to Luther, and his
   relations to his children open up still deeper veins of love and
   kindness than any we have contemplated. Especially his eldest son
   Johnny and his daughter Magdalen seem to have been dear to his heart;
   and there is nothing more pathetic in any life than his wild yet
   resigned grief by the deathbed of the latter, who was taken from him in
   her fourteenth year." "I love her very dearly," he cried; "but, dear
   Lord, since it is Thy will to take her from me, I shall gladly know her
   to be with Thee." And as he saw her lying in her coffin he said, "Thou
   darling Lena, how happy art thou now! Thou wilt arise again and shine
   as a star. I am joyful in the spirit, yet after the flesh I am very
   sad. How strange it is to know so surely that she is at peace and
   happy, and yet to be so sad." "We have ever before us," again he says,
   "her features, her words, her gestures, her every action in life, and
   on her deathbed, my darling, my all-beautiful, all-obedient daughter.
   Even the death of Christ cannot tear her from my thoughts, as it ought
   to do."

   The birth of his eldest son was an event of immense interest to the
   reformer. "I have received," he writes to Spalatin, "from my most
   excellent and dearest wife a little Luther, by God's wonderful mercy.
   Pray for me that Christ will preserve my child from Satan, who, I know,
   will try all that he can to harm me in him." [42] And then again, in
   answer to Spalatin's good wishes, and in reference to his own hopes of
   the same character, "John, my fawn, together with my doe, return their
   warm thanks for your kind benediction; and may your doe present you
   with just such another fawn, on whom I may ask God's blessing in turn.
   Amen." [43] As the little fellow grows and is about a year old, he
   writes to Agricola, "My Johnny is lively and strong, and a voracious,
   bibacious little fellow." [44]

   It was to this son that he wrote when stationed at Coburg, during the
   Diet of Augsburg, that most beautiful and touching of all child-letters
   that ever was written. "Mercy and peace in Christ, my dear little son.
   I am glad to hear that you learn your lessons well and pray diligently.
   Go on doing so, my child. When I come home I will bring you a pretty
   fairing. I know a very pretty pleasant garden, and in it there are a
   great many children, all dressed in little golden coats, picking up
   nice apples, and pears, and cherries, and plums, under the trees. And
   they sing and jump about and are very merry; and besides, they have got
   beautiful little horses with golden bridles and silver saddles. Then I
   asked the man to whom the garden belonged, whose children they were,
   and he said, These are children who love to pray and learn their
   lessons, and do as they are bid;' then I said, Dear sir, I have a
   little son called Johnny Luther; may he come into this garden too?' And
   the man said, If he loves to pray, and learn his lessons, and is good,
   he may; and Philip and Joe too.'" And so on in the same tender and
   beautiful strain, mixing the highest counsel and richest poetry with
   the most child-like interest. Only a very sound and healthy spirit
   could have preserved thus fresh and simple the flow of natural feeling
   amid the hardening contests of the world, and the arid subtleties of
   theological controversy.

   In the year 1527, two years. after his marriage, Luther fell into a
   dangerous sickness and general depression of spirits, from the latter
   of which he was only fully aroused by the dangers besetting the German
   nation, and the very integrity of Christendom itself, by the threatened
   advance of the Turks. This was in the year 1529--the same year in
   which, on the invitation of the Landgrave of Hesse, he engaged in his
   famous conference with Zwingli, Bucer, and OEcolampadius at Marburg.
   The Landgrave, who, whatever may have been his personal failings, was
   always one of the most warm and zealous, and withal energetic and
   intelligent, supporters of the Reformation, was hopefully eager of
   establishing a union between the Swiss and German Reformers. Zwingli
   and his party shared in his eagerness, and were willing to concede much
   to Luther if only he would heartily extend to them the right hand of
   fellowship. In the matter of the sacrament of the Supper, however,
   Luther was not to be moved. His mind here remained shut against all
   argument; and although he is supposed to have admitted, under the name
   of Consubstantiation, a modification of the Catholic tradition, he
   adhered substantially to that tradition in all its significance to the
   last: he held to the literal reality of the Divine presence in the
   Eucharist, and would recognise nothing but rationalism, or, as he
   called it, mathematics, in the reasonings of Zwingli and his
   companions.

   The conference was held in an inner compartment of the castle of the
   Landgrave. Many who had come from distances to be present were
   disappointed in gaining admission. Carlstadt had requested to be
   allowed to attend, but Luther would on no account consent: lie
   remembered, no doubt, his interview with him at Jena, and the violence
   with which he had obtruded upon him his contradictions on this very
   subject. The Prince opened the audience on the morning of the 2d of
   October, accompanied by certain of his counsellors and courtiers, and
   the professors of the University. The numbers who were present vary
   considerably in the respective accounts--the Swiss say about
   twenty-four, the German about fifty. A table covered with a velvet
   cloth separated the disputants; on the one side of it sat Luther and
   Melanchthon, on the other Zwingli and OEcolampadius. Before the
   discussion commenced, Luther is said to have taken a piece of chalk and
   written in large characters upon the velvet cloth the words, "This is
   My body"--not a very hopeful beginning!

   The chancellor, Feige, on the part of the Prince, exhorted the
   disputants to approach the subject in a spirit of fairness and
   moderation. Luther, thereupon, after some preliminary objections to the
   general views of the Swiss, which were overruled, took up the keynote
   he had already started, and protested against the views of his
   opponents on the ground that the words of Scripture were explicit and
   conclusive, "This is My body." OEcolampadius urged in reply that these
   words must be interpreted figuratively, in such a manner as other and
   corresponding expressions--viz., "I am the door"; "I am the true vine."
   Luther admitted the figurative character of the latter expressions, but
   would not admit that there was an analogy between them and the solemn
   words he had put forward in the front of the controversy. Then they
   verged to a prolonged discussion as to the meaning of Christ's language
   in the famous sixth chapter of St John's Gospel. The Swiss divines
   maintained that the passage, "It is the spirit that quickeneth, the
   flesh profiteth nothing," was conclusive against the doctrine of
   transubstantiation. Luther denied that it applied to the sacrament of
   the Lord's Supper, and besides argued that the flesh did not and could
   not mean the flesh of Christ, but our own flesh. To say that "the flesh
   of Christ profiteth nothing," appeared to him blasphemy. Christ Himself
   said, "His flesh bringeth life"; "but if there be spiritual life in
   Christ," it was urged, "what does it matter to eat His flesh?" "That,"
   Luther replied with heat, "is a rationalistic question; it is enough
   that the Word of God says so: what the Word states, we are bound to
   believe without doubt or cavil. The world must obey God's precepts; we
   must all obey His Word. Worms, listen! It is your God who speaks!"
   Zwingli joined in the discussion, and it waxed more vehement. He
   hinted, not very reverently, that Luther did nothing but repeat the
   same words; Christ Himself had decisively explained what He meant by
   His words. "Your language," Luther retorted, "savours of the camp."

   The announcement of dinner fortunately-interrupted the disputants for
   the time. After dinner the debate was resumed, and carried on
   throughout the forenoon and afternoon of the following day. Zwingli
   became metaphysical and argumentative. "A body," he said, "cannot be
   without place; but Christ's body is in heaven, therefore it cannot be
   in the bread of the Eucharist." [45] Luther was not to be moved from
   his point by such an argument, although he afterwards acknowledged its
   force. When pressed by Zwingli's dialectics, he exclaimed, "I will have
   nothing to do with your mathematics: God is above mathematics!" "The
   body of Christ," he held, "was in the bread as the sword in the
   scabbard, or the Holy Ghost in the dove;" and finally, rising from his
   seat, he tore the velvet cloth from the table, and held up before the
   Assembly the large letters, "This is My body," as an unassailable
   watchword to be received in evidence of his doctrine by all good
   Christians.

   It was obvious that continued discussion could lead to no good.
   Luther's dogmatism was unyielding. All his deepest feelings, as well as
   his theological reputation, were involved in his maintaining his
   ground. He had taken his stand, as he supposed, upon the Word of God,
   and nothing should make him swerve from that. It was proposed by the
   Landgrave that the conference should terminate by a declaration from
   both sides that, although they disagreed in this particular, they
   concurred in the essentials of faith, and recognised each other as
   Christian brethren. The Zwinglian party eagerly embraced the proposal;
   but Luther hesitated: he would not acknowledge a hearty brotherhood
   where there were variances on so vital a point as the Sacrament of the
   Altar. Zwingli was affected to tears by this coldness. Luther said, "We
   cannot accept you as brethren, but we are willing to hold out to you
   the hand of charity." The warmheartedness of the Swiss responded
   cordially even to this offer, and the conference terminated with
   apparent good-will and commendatory prayers on both sides.

   Upon the whole, Luther appears nowhere less admirable than in this
   famous conference--not, indeed, for the opinion which he defended, but
   for the irate and dogmatic spirit in which he defended it. He kept ever
   singing the same song, as Zwingli said, "This is My body." His tone was
   very unreasoning and arbitrary, and there is scarcely any absurdity
   that might not be based on Scripture in the manner in which he used it,
   and considered it enough to use it, on this occasion. There is
   something, moreover, painful and unworthy of him in the terms in which
   he characterised the Swiss divines in his letters, [46] and in the
   unbending, unkindly temper in which he met the warmly proffered
   friendship of Zwingli. The character of the latter--frank, gallant,
   fearless,--a soldier-reformer, with his Greek Testament, and nothing
   else, in his hand--appears in a far higher light throughout the debate.
   But he and Luther never could understand one another; and when, in the
   end of this very year, the German heard of the death of the brave Swiss
   on the sanguinary field of Cappel, fighting for the liberties of his
   country, there is. no sympathy, but a grating harshness, in the tone in
   which he received the sad news. The Marburg Conference, however, was
   not without some friendly and conciliatory results even in matters of
   doctrine, as the fourteen articles, which were at length signed on both
   sides, testify. It did not serve to unite Luther and the Swiss more
   cordially, for he continued to write with an increasing vehemence
   against them; [47] but it served to show, in all things save that of
   the Eucharist, a substantial unity of doctrine in the two great
   branches of the Reformation, meeting locally together at so many
   points.

   In the following year we find Luther at Coburg during the memorable
   meeting of the Diet at Augsburg. The reformer had proposed to attend
   the Diet in company with the Elector, but a letter met them at Coburg
   intimating that the ban of the Empire was still in force against him,
   and it was therefore wisely resolved that he should not make his
   appearance at the Diet, but leave the conduct of affairs in this great
   crisis to Melanchthon, whose more courtly manner and cooler judgment
   were in any case supposed to be more fit for bringing the pending
   negotiations to some favourable termination. Luther, however, removed
   to Coburg to be conveniently at hand for consultation; and, secure in
   the strong fortress of the Elector there, he abandoned himself to a
   most joyful interest in nature, and a variety of literary studies,
   while the news of the Diet floated to his solitude; and, in return, he
   counselled, encouraged, and warned Melanchthon. On the 22d of April he
   writes: "I have at length arrived at my Sinai, dear Philip; put of this
   Sinai I will make a Sion: I will raise thereon three tabernacles--one
   to the Psalmist, one to the Prophets, and one to Esop. It is truly a
   pleasant place, and most agreeable for study, unless your absence
   saddens me. . . . I reside in a vast abode which overlooks the castle;
   I have the key of all its apartments. There are about thirty persons
   together, of whom twelve are watchers by night, and two sentinels
   besides, who are constantly posted on the castle heights." [48] On the
   29th of June, while matters are proceeding, and Melanchthon writes
   complaining of his difficulties, he replies, "To-day your last news has
   reached me, in which you advise me of your labours, your dangers, your
   tears, as if I were ignorant of these things, or sat in a bed of roses,
   and bore no part of your cares. Would to God my cause were such as
   admitted of tears!" [49] When he hears of the Confession being read in
   open Diet, he is in great spirits; but the fears and anxieties of
   Melanchthon, who desired not merely to maintain the reformed doctrines,
   but to effect a reconciliation with the Romanists, speedily bring
   disquiet to him. He fell back upon that in which he was always stronger
   than Melanchthon--Faith. "Our cause is deposited," he said, "in a
   commonplace not to be found in your book, Philip; that commonplace is
   Faith." And in the same grand strain he wrote to the chancellor, Bruck:
   "I was lately looking out of my window, when I beheld two wonderful
   sights. First, I saw the stars and God's fair bright firmament, but
   nowhere any pillars on which the Master-builder had poised this lofty
   frame; yet the heavens did not fall in, and the firmament stood quite
   fast. But there are some who search for such pillars, and would
   anxiously grasp and feel them, and because they cannot do this, fear
   and tremble lest the heavens should fall. The other spectacle I saw was
   a great dense cloud floating over us, so charged and burdened that it
   might be likened to a mighty sea, and yet I could perceive nothing on
   which it rested, no coffer in which it was enclosed and yet it fell
   not, but, greeting us with a black frown, passed on. When it had
   passed, a rainbow appeared--a weak, thin, and slight bow, which soon
   vanished into the clouds. Now, there are some who think more of the
   dense cloud than of the dim and slender bow, and are in great terror
   lest the clouds should pour down an eternal deluge. . . . I write to
   your worship in this familiar yet serious style, because I rejoice to
   hear that your courage has not failed. Our rainbow, indeed, appears a
   frail hope on which to rest, and their clouds are dark and lowering;
   but in the end it will be seen who will gain the victory." [50]

   In this confident manner Luther encouraged his friends, and feared for
   himself no evil. It is a grand and heroic spectacle this solitary man
   in the old fortress of Coburg, looking out upon nature and the world
   with such a calm clear trust in God, interested in the proceedings at
   Augsburg, yet feeling, with the fulness of a living faith, how much
   greater was Providence than the negotiations of princes,--and with what
   mysterious safety the wheels of the world's progress were revolving,
   whatever the poor pride of man might counsel or devise. The jackdaws
   and rooks, as they convened in circling crowds in front of his window,
   seemed to him not an unfitting emblem of the "magnanimous kings, dukes,
   and nobles," consulting over the affairs of the realm at Augsburg. As
   he watched their movements, and saw them "flap their wings and strut
   with mimic majesty, not clad in royal attire, but glossy black or dark
   grey, having eyes of ashy paleness, and singing the same unvarying
   song, diversified only by the weaker tones or more discordant notes of
   the young or inexperienced," he thought of the great princes and lords
   busying themselves with pompous and weak inconsequence over the
   movements of the world, which they vainly imagined within their
   control. The fresh and living glance with which he looked from his high
   and lonely windows upon the heavens above, and the joyous creatures of
   nature around, compare well with the hesitations and uncertainties
   which marked the proceedings at Augsburg, even on the part of his
   friends.

   The result justified the confidence of Luther. Melanchthon, both from
   natural timidity and an ardent love of peace, would have made too many
   concessions--concessions which in the end would not have proved
   effectual. The favourable reception which his Confession at first met
   with, had encouraged not only him but Jonas and others to believe that
   a modus vivendi might be found between the Lutherans and the adherents
   of the Papacy within the Empire. "Christ," cried Jonas, "is in the
   Diet, and He does not keep silence; the Word of God is indeed not to be
   bound." For a moment even Luther seemed to see a prospect of
   conciliation, and in his enthusiasm wrote a letter of entreaty to
   Cardinal Albert. "Do not let us fall out. Do not let us ruin Germany.
   Let there be liberty of conscience, and let us save our fatherland."
   But when it was proposed to unite, at the sacrifice of the truth, and
   even to grant the supremacy of the Pope (for so far was Melanchthon
   disposed to yield), Luther's heart rose high within him, and he would
   brook no such policy. "You have begun a marvellous work," he wrote to
   his friend, "to make Luther and the Pope agree together; but the Pope
   will say that he will not, and Luther begs to be excused. Take care.
   Your negotiations have no chance of success unless the Pope renounces
   Papacy." The demands of the Romanists increased with Melanchthon's
   concessions, until at length even he would go no farther. He shrank
   from all acknowledgment of private masses, auricular confession, and
   the merit of good works. The negotiations came to an end. Threats were
   made, and the imperial troops called within the free city of Augsburg;
   but Luther cried from his watch-tower, "Threats will not kill. There
   will be no war." His friends escaped, all hope of reconciliation
   terminated, and threatening as the danger seemed, it passed away. The
   truth was, as Luther saw, that the Emperor was in no position to make
   war upon the Protestant princes. The Turks were hovering on the borders
   of the Empire. Henry VIII. of England and Francis were in alliance,
   watching their opportunity of breaking down Charles's power. The
   Emperor, and even his brother Ferdinand of Austria, acknowledged the
   difficulties of the crisis, and the political compromise was allowed to
   remain as it was.

   The Diet at Augsburg marks a turning-point in the history of the
   Reformation and in the career of the reformer. The Confession then
   presented by Melanchthon, known as the Confessio Augustana, remains the
   great dogmatic monument of German Protestantism. It is rightly
   associated with the name of Melanchthon, who digested its contents into
   their final form but the substance of the articles was Luther's. He had
   written them on various occasions, and they embraced all the main
   points of his theology, positive and negative, from the doctrine of the
   Trinity to his disavowal of the special tenets of Romanism. The first
   part enumerates the "chief articles of faith" held by the princes and
   churches that had embraced the Reformation--twenty-one articles in all,
   stated with clearness, brevity, and moderation. The second part, under
   the distinct heading of "Articles in which are recounted the abuses
   which have been changed or corrected," extends to only seven
   articles--the Lord's Supper, the marriage of priests, the sacrifice of
   the mass, auricular confession, fasts and traditions, monastic vows,
   ecclesiastical power--points all of which had called forth the
   reformer's polemical energy, and which are accordingly stated with much
   more detail and amplitude. They occupy more than double the space of
   the preceding articles.

   But it is not only as marking definitely the dogmatic significance of
   the Reformation that the Diet of Augsburg is important. It marks also a
   significant political epoch. In the Preface to the Confession,
   addressed to the Emperor, attention is specially called to the two
   preceding Diets at Spires, in 1526 and 1529, when the Protestant States
   rightly believed they had gained a definite standing-ground from which
   they could not be fairly displaced. At the former of these Diets the
   Emperor had specially conceded that the matters in dispute were beyond
   his own jurisdiction. He was neither willing nor able to conclude
   anything touching them, but to endeavour to obtain the sanction of the
   Roman Pontiff to the assembly of a General Council; "every State in the
   meantime to live, rule, and bear itself, as it shall be ready to answer
   for to God and his Imperial Majesty." The same promise of a General
   Council had been repeated at the second Diet of Spires, held only the
   year before, notwithstanding that the Emperor was then in a far less
   tolerant humour, and disposed to abrogate the Act of Toleration passed
   in 1526. A majority of the Diet in fact virtually did this, by falling
   back upon the Edict of Worms, and proposing its enforcement wherever it
   was practicable. It was then that the minority prepared the famous
   Protest, from which the name Protestant has come. "The Diet has
   overstepped its authority," they said; "our acquired right is that the
   Decree of 1526, unanimously adopted, remain in force until a Council
   can be convened. Up to this time the Decree has maintained the peace,
   and we protest against its abrogation." At the Augsburg Diet the same
   ground was taken up, and the same protest renewed. "To the convention
   of a General Council, as also to your Imperial Majesty, we have, in the
   due method and legal form, before made our protestations and appeal in
   this greatest and gravest of matters. To which appeal, both to your
   Imperial Majesty and a Council, we still adhere; nor do we intend, nor
   would it be possible for us to forsake it, unless the matter between us
   and the other party should, in accordance with the latest Imperial
   citation, be composed, settled, and brought to Christian concord in
   friendship and love; concerning which appeal we here also make our
   solemn and public protest."

   From this point, accordingly, the political attitude of the Protestant
   States was really changed. They were already banded together in their
   defence before the league of Schmalkald united them. The religious
   difference had merged into a difference in the great political body of
   which they were members. So long as the head of the empire held the
   balance between the Pope and the insurgent States, some compromise
   seemed possible, but now that he had entered into affiance with Rome,
   they were threatened with exclusion not only from the Catholic Church
   but from the Public Peace, as the shelter of the Empire was called. The
   crisis in every respect was a grave one; and it bespeaks much for the
   courage of the protesting minority that they resolved to face it, and
   "never to abandon the religious position which they had taken up, and
   the importance of which filled their whole souls." [51] It was in the
   last days of the same memorable year that John of Saxony, Ernest of
   Lüneburg, Philip of Hesse, Wolfgang of Anhalt, the Counts of Gebhard
   and Albrecht of Mansfeld, and delegates from George of Brandenburg and
   several cities, assembled at Schmalkald, and, amidst the severities of
   winter, entered into the great league which bound them to support one
   another in the event of any hostile movement of the Emperor. Happily,
   any such movement was thwarted by another Turkish invasion, which
   divided the attention of Charles, and, with other causes, gave peace
   during the remainder of Luther's life. The civil war, however, came at
   last, and in the most terrible form, and no country ever paid more
   dearly than Germany for religious freedom.

   It was some dim forethought of all this that changed Luther much during
   the last sixteen years of his life. Courageous against the Pope and the
   devil, he shrunk now again, as in the time of the peasants' war, from
   all civil commotion. To his simple German heart the empire was a sacred
   reality, far more sacred than the Pope. He could only contemplate with
   the utmost reluctance any alliance against the imperial power. From
   this time, therefore, Luther is found comparatively withdrawn from
   public life. He is no longer leader of the movement in the sense in
   which he has hitherto stood forth as its public champion on all
   occasions. He seems to have felt that his part of the work was done. He
   lacked sympathy, unhappily, with both the political and Zwinglian side
   of the Reformation, which called forth the strong interest of Philip of
   Hesse and others. He stood aloof from further projects of reform, and
   the conservative elements of his large and many-sided nature gathered
   force with advancing years. The wild excitements of the times--the
   terrifying advance of the Turks, and the dreadful excesses of the
   Anabaptists, which broke out afresh in the north, under the leadership
   of John of Leyden--all tended to moderate and somewhat sadden his
   spirit. To crown all, the affair of the Landgrave of Hesse, who
   married, in 1536, a second wife while his first was still living,
   proved to him, as to Melanchthon (whom it nearly killed), a dark and
   humiliating trial, and left, as his letters show, a gloomy shadow on
   his temper and the prospects of the cause so dear to him. "Who is not
   now ruffled by the folly of Luther?" he wrote, in bitterness of spirit,
   to a friend who asked him to be present at his marriage, while excusing
   his absence.

   There were special causes, also, in his own immediate experience,
   during the year which followed the Diet of Augsburg, which gave a
   pensive cast to his life. His dear and illustrious friend, the Archduke
   John, died in the autumn of 1532. Luther and Melanchthon were suddenly
   summoned to his bedside, but he was unconscious before they arrived.
   Luther preached his funeral sermon at Wittenberg, as, seven years
   before, he had performed the same office for his brother, and,
   according to Spalatin, was deeply moved and wept as a child. The good
   Archduke had stood firm in the great cause in the hour of danger, and
   well earned for himself the epithet of "Steadfast." The reformer traced
   in his character, above all, the simple attributes of piety and
   goodness, as in his brother those of wisdom and understanding. "Had
   these qualities only been united in one person," he said, "it would
   have been a miracle." Along with such changes, Luther felt in himself a
   growing sense of old age and weakness. He complained in his letters of
   dizziness and unfitness for his work in the morning. "I am become so
   useless," he says, "that I hate myself. I hardly know how the time
   passes, and I do so little. I am dying slowly, not of years, but of
   decay of strength." His physical suffering culminated in a serious
   attack of illness at Schmalkald in 1537. He had come there on one of
   the many projects of a union among all Protestants which occupied these
   years. He had preached a powerful sermon, "not so much speaking as
   thundering from heaven in the name of Christ," and immediately
   afterwards he was seized with violent pain. Physicians were called from
   Erfurt to attend him; but he disliked doctors, and they did him no
   good. He could find no relief, and his body swelled till he thought his
   end was at hand. "They made me drink," he afterwards said, "as if I was
   a great ox." In immediate prospect of death, he cried to God--"I die a
   foe of Thy foes, under the curse and ban of Thine enemy, the Pope. May
   he too die under Thy ban, and we both appear before Thy judgment seat."
   The young Elector, son of the good John, stood by his bedside,
   lamenting that God would take away with him his dear Word. Luther
   quieted him with the assurance that God would raise up many true men to
   defend the good cause, and committed to him the care of his wife and
   children. As Melanchthon began to weep, he could not restrain some of
   his old humour, reminding him of a saying of one of their friends, that
   there was no art required in drinking good beer, but only beer that was
   sour; and recalling to him the words of Job, "Have we received good
   from the Lord, and shall we not also accept evil.' The wicked Jews had
   stoned the holy Stephen, but his stone, the villain, was stoning him"
   (Ihn steinige sein Stein, der bösewicht). He never lost his confidence
   in God, to whom he repeatedly committed his soul. At length, as none of
   the physicians of Schmalkald did him any good, they resolved to remove
   him to Coburg; and, happily, on the way thither, the rough jolting in
   the carriage which conveyed him did for him what medical skill had
   failed to do. He obtained relief, and immediately felt his whole body
   lightened, and was filled with thankful joy. "I was dead," he wrote at
   once to his wife, "and had committed you and the dear children to God,
   but He has had compassion upon me for your sakes."

   If these latter years of Luther's life are comparatively deficient in
   stirring incident, they enable us to see the man in his home-life,
   among his friends and his children, more clearly than in previous
   years. They were years also of good, if less notable, work. Although
   the higher projects, which he never cherished with much confidence, of
   formal union among the branches of the Reformation, miscarried or never
   came to anything, the time was, upon the whole, a prosperous one for
   that branch of the Church in which he was specially interested. In the
   face of the dangers threatening his own power, and even Christendom,
   Charles recognised the necessity of keeping peace with his Protestant
   subjects. The truce of Nuremberg followed the league of Schmalkald, and
   the Protestant states rested from their fears, and rapidly grew in
   numbers. Würtemburg became genuinely Protestant. Even the
   Elector-Archbishop of Cologne inclined to the new movement and the
   apprehension of such a defection, amidst his other difficulties, was
   enough to keep Charles in check. Luther was satisfied with the progress
   he had made. He continued his labours at Wittenberg, publishing various
   expositions or lectures on portions of Scripture, particularly on the
   Epistle to the Galatians and the Psalms of Degrees. As already
   mentioned, he had the joy of seeing, in 1534, the first entire
   translation of the Old as well as the New Testament made public, and a
   new edition of the Wittenberg Hymn-book appeared in the following year.
   His weapons of controversy against both Roman Catholics and Zwinglians
   were not stayed but controversy formed a far less important element of
   his life. He lived happily with his wife and children in the old
   cloister on the banks of the Elbe, which had been his first lodging
   when he came from Erfurt. His salary was not large, but many presents
   were sent to him, not only by the Elector, but by the free cities, and
   men of all lands looked to him with respect and admiration. He was able
   at last to buy a small house in the country and farm, which his
   "heartily beloved housewife Catherine, Lady Luther, Lady Doctor, Lady
   Zuhlsdorf, Lady of the. Pigmarket, and whatever else she may be,"
   managed for him with much thrift and profit. He was never tired of
   commending matrimony and its blessings. "The state of matrimony," he
   says, "is the chief in the world after religion." Again, "How great,
   how rich, and how noble are the blessings God gives in marriage! what a
   joy is bestowed on man through his children--the fairest and sweetest
   of all joys." "God's best gift is a pious, cheerful, God-fearing,
   home-keeping wife, to whom you can trust your goods and body and life."
   Like all large-hearted men, he was never so happy as when in his
   country home, surrounded by his family. He wrote to Spalatin with
   delighted enthusiasm of his garden and his fountain, his lilies and
   roses. As, one day, his children were standing round the table, looking
   eagerly at the grapes and peaches on it, he said, "He who would know
   what it is to rejoice in hope, may see a perfect counterpart of it
   here." Everything in nature charmed his imaginative sense, and brought
   out the poetry as well as the piety of his life. When, one day, two
   birds kept flying into his garden, where they had made a nest, but were
   repeatedly scared away by the steps of passers-by, he exclaimed, "Oh
   you dear little birds, do not fly away; I mean you well, from the
   bottom of my heart, if you could but believe it. Just so do we refuse
   to trust and believe in our Lord God, who yet means us and shows us all
   kindness."

   We have already described his deep affection for his children. He
   remembered, perhaps, the hardness of his own youth, and the occasional
   severity of his father, and he resolved to make his own home bright,
   sunny, and cheerful, full of satirical frolic and unfailing gentleness
   and love. "Natural merriment," he said, "is the best food for
   children." He would joke with his well-beloved Catherine over her
   thrifty carefulness, calling her a "Martha" more than a "Mary," and
   quietly touching, with a tender stroke, her love of profit and
   business. Yet he prized her worth above all price--"more highly than
   the kingdom of France or the empire of the Venetians," as he phrased
   it. "Everywhere among married people he heard of much greater faults
   and failings than any she had." "She is more to me than I dared to
   hope, thanks be to God."

   These latter years also are the years of the Tischreden' or
   Table-Talk,' which bring us so near to him in his familiar thoughts. He
   was open-handed in his hospitality, and his table was always furnished
   for friends and guests as well as the members of his own family. Never
   man had more numerous and warm-hearted friends--some who had struggled
   with him from the beginning in "the good cause," and younger disciples
   who gathered round him with admiring veneration in his later years, who
   came to listen to his talk, and take notes of the many wise and racy
   sayings that dropped from his lips. It is to the notes of two of these
   younger friends that we owe the remarkable volume of Table-Talk' [52]
   which has done more than any of his works to make his name known, not
   merely as a theologian but as a humourist and close observer of man and
   nature. It reveals more than all else the dramatic breadth of his
   intellect, his hearty interest in life, and wise, pathetic, and droll
   insight into its heroisms and follies. It is stamped with genius
   throughout, and retains its vivacity and readableness when so much that
   he has written remains covered with the dust of centuries, untouched
   save by the student of polemical theology. In this volume, more than in
   any other, the German people of divers kinds have found a point of
   sympathy with his life, its poetry and music, its affection and
   free-heartedness, its deep piety and earnest aspiration. His reporters
   have been too indiscriminate in their notes, as he himself told them
   they, were. They beset him too closely, not merely at his table, but on
   his walks, and in the discharge of his duties. "They were with him," it
   is said, "at his down-sitting and uprising; they looked over his
   shoulder as he read or wrote his letters: did he utter an exclamation
   of pain or of pleasure, of joy or of sorrow, down it went; did he
   aspirate a thought above breath, it was caught by the intent ear of one
   or other of the listeners." But if they have added some crude pieces to
   the heap of his sayings, and filled the volume here and there with
   repetitory notes, it has also given freshness and genuineness to them,
   and served to bring out his intellect and character in vivid mass, with
   something of the natural bulk and fulness with which Cranach has
   presented his person in his well-known portrait of Luther standing with
   the Bible in his hands.

   The first edition of the Tischreden' was published twenty years after
   his death--in 1566--and successive editions were immediately called
   for. It has been partially translated in our own language, among others
   by William Hazlitt; [53] and some of its best sayings have been widely
   circulated. It will interest our readers, however, and serve to vivify
   our sketch, to present a brief selection. His simple faith; his hatred
   of the Pope and of all lies; his high estimate of his friend and
   fellow-labourer, Melanchthon; his dislike of Erasmus; his love of
   nature, birds, and children; his humorous sense, as he looked abroad
   upon life in all its civil and domestic aspects,--all appear in rich
   and unguarded language, here and there touched with exaggeration, such
   as naturally falls from a great mind freely ranging over many topics. A
   great proportion of the Table-Talk sayings are of course theological,
   and we may begin with these. As might be expected, he exalts greatly
   Holy Scripture. "Homer, Virgil, and other noble and profitable
   writers," he says, "have left us books of great antiquity, but they are
   nothing to the Bible. The books of the heathen contemplate only the
   present. Look not therein for aught of trust or hope in God. But see
   how the Psalms and the Book of Job treat of faith, hope, resignation,
   and prayer,--in a word, the Holy Scripture is the highest and best of
   books, abounding in comfort under all afflictions and trials. It
   teaches us to see, to feel, to grasp, and to comprehend faith, hope,
   and charity far otherwise than mere human reason can; and when evil
   oppresses us, it teaches us how these writers threw light upon the
   darkness, and how, after this poor miserable existence of ours on
   earth, there is another and eternal life. . . . A theologian should be
   thoroughly in possession of the basis and source of faith--that is to
   say, the Holy Scriptures. . . . He who wholly possesses the text of the
   Bible is a consummate divine. . . . Let us not lose the Bible, but with
   diligence, in fear and invocation of God, read and preach it. While
   that remains and flourishes all will be well with the state; tis head
   and empress of all arts and faculties. Let but divinity fall, and I
   would not give a straw for the rest."

   "The School Divines, with their speculations in Holy Writ, deal in pure
   vanities. Bonaventura, who is full of them, made me almost deaf. I
   sought to learn in his book how God and my soul had become reconciled,
   but got no information from him. They talk much of the union of the
   soul and the understanding, but tis all idle fantasy. The right
   practical divinity is this--Believe in Christ, and do thy duty in that
   state of life to which God has called thee."

   "I have grounded my preaching on the Divine Word. Although I am an old
   doctor of divinity, to this day I have not got beyond the children's
   learning--the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; and
   these I understand not so well as I should, though I study them daily,
   praying with my son John and my daughter Magdalene."

   "Forsheim said that the first of the five books of Moses was not
   written by Moses himself. Dr Luther replied, What matters it even
   though Moses did not write it?"

   We have spoken of his high esteem of Melanchthon. His admiration of him
   as a theologian never failed, even when he deplored his lack of faith
   and courage. Every student of theology, he said, should read over and
   over again Melanchthon's Loci Communes' "until he has it by heart. Once
   master of these two volumes, he may be regarded as a theologian whom
   neither devil nor heretic can overcome. Afterwards he may study
   Melanchthon's Commentary on the Romans,' and mine on Deuteronomy and
   the Galatians."

   Again, "we possess no body of Christian theology like Melanchthon's
   Commonplace Book.'" "All the fathers, all the compilers of sentences,
   are not to be compared with this book. 'Tis, after the Scriptures, the
   most perfect of works."

   There is at times a harshness in his ready and emphatic speech, as when
   he pronounced the Epistle of St James to be a "strawy epistle" and in
   such a sentence as the following. "When one asked where God was before
   heaven was created, St Augustine answered: He was in Himself. When
   another asked me the same question, I said: He was building hell for
   such idle, presumptuous, flattering, and inquisitive spirits like
   you. . . . How should God deal with us? Good days we cannot bear, evil
   we cannot endure. Gives He riches unto us? then are we proud so that no
   man can live by us in peace; nay, we will be carried upon head and
   shoulders, and will be adored as gods. Gives He poverty unto us? then
   are we dismayed, impatient, and murmur against Him. Therefore nothing
   were better for us than forthwith to be covered with the shovel.

   "Since God knew, said some one, that man would not continue in a state
   of innocence, why did He create him at all? Be sure,' Dr Luther said,
   laughing in reply, God knew quite well what He is about. Let us keep
   clear of such abstract questions, and consider the will of God as it
   has been revealed to us."

   "God only, and not wealth, maintains the world; yet is the world so mad
   that it sets on riches all its joy and felicity."

   "There is no greater anger than when God is silent and talks not with
   us, but suffers us to go on in our sinful works, and to do all things
   according to our own passions and pleasures."

   "Melanchthon asked Luther if this word hardened,' hardeneth whom He
   will,' were to be understood directly as it sounded, or in a figurative
   sense. Luther answered, We must understand it specially, and not
   operatively; for God works no evil. Through His almighty power He works
   all in all; and as He finds a man, so He works in him, as He did in
   Pharaoh, who was evil by nature, which was not God's but his own
   fault."

   "Christ lived three-and-thirty years, and went up thrice every year to
   Jerusalem--making ninety-nine times He went thither. If the Pope could
   show that Christ had been but once at Rome, what a bragging and
   boasting would he make! Yet Jerusalem was destroyed to the ground."

   "When Jesus was born, doubtless he cried and wept like other children,
   and his mother tended him as other mothers tend their children. As he
   grew up he was submissive to his parents, and waited on them, and
   carried his supposed father's dinner to him; and when he came back,
   Mary no doubt often said, My dear little Jesus, where halt thou been?'
   He that takes no offence at the simple, lowly, and mean life of Christ
   is endowed with high divine art and wisdom--yea, has a special gift of
   God in the Holy Ghost."

   "We cannot vex the devil more than by teaching, preaching, singing, and
   talking of Jesus. Therefore I like it well when, with sounding voice,
   we sing in the church, Et homo factus est; et verbum caro factum est.'
   The devil cannot endure those words, and flies away."

   "I expect more goodness from Kate my wife, from Philip Melanchthon, and
   from other friends, than from my sweet and blessed Saviour Christ
   Jesus; and yet I know for certain that neither she nor any other person
   on earth will or can suffer that for me which He has suffered. Why,
   then, should I be afraid of Him? This very foolish weakness grieves me
   much."

   "When Jesus Christ utters a word, He opens His mouth so wide that it
   embraces all heaven and earth, even though that word be but a whisper.
   The word of the emperor is powerful, but that of Jesus Christ governs
   the whole universe."

   Luther's powers as a preacher were universally recognised. God gave
   especially to him the word of power to the God-fearing and the ungodly
   alike. He was once reproached by a popish priest because he reproached
   the people with such passion and vehemence. He answered: "Our Lord God
   must first send a sharp pouring shower with thunder and lightning, and
   afterwards cause it mildly to rain, as then it wets finely through. I
   can easily cut a willow or a hazel wand with my trencher-knife; but for
   a hard oak a man must use the axe, and little enough to fell and cleave
   it."

   He gives many excellent advices as to preaching; as for example--

   "I would not have preachers torment their hearers and detain them with
   long and tedious preaching, for the delight of hearing vanishes
   therewith, and the preachers hurt themselves. . . . But to speak
   deliberately becomes a preacher, for thereby he may the more
   effectually and impressively deliver his sermons. Seneca writes of
   Cicero that he spake deliberately from the heart. . . . We ought to
   direct ourselves in preaching according to the condition of the
   hearers; but most preachers commonly fail herein: they preach that
   which little edifies the poor simple people. To preach plainly and
   simply is a great art."

   "The defects of a preacher are soon spied. Dr Justus Jonas has all the
   good virtues and qualities a man may have; yet merely because he hums
   and spits, the people cannot bear that good and honest man."

   "Luther's wife said to him, Sir, I heard your cousin John Palmer preach
   this afternoon in the parish church, whom I understood better than Dr
   Pommer, though the Doctor is held to be a very excellent preacher.
   Luther answered, John Palmer preached as ye women use to talk--for what
   comes into your minds ye speak. A preacher ought to remain by the text
   and deliver that which he has before him, to the end people may well
   understand it. But a preacher that will speak everything that comes in
   his mind is like a maid that goes to market, and meeting another maid,
   makes a stand, and they hold together a goose-market."

   "A preacher must be both soldier and shepherd. He must nourish, defend,
   and teach; he must have teeth in his mouth, and be able to bite and to
   fight. There are many talking preachers, but there is nothing in them
   save words. They can talk much, but teach nothing rightly."

   "I would not have preachers in their sermons use Hebrew, Greek, or
   foreign languages, for in the church we ought to speak as we are wont
   to do at home--the plain mother-tongue. . . . To be condemned are all
   preachers who aim at high and hard things. When I preach I sink myself
   down. I regard neither doctors nor magistrates--but the multitude of
   young people, children, and servants, of whom are more than two
   thousand. Will not the rest hear me? The door stands open, they may be
   gone. . . . When preachers come to me, as Melanchthon and Dr Pommer,
   let them show their cunning, how learned they be. They shall be well
   put to their trumps. But to sprinkle Hebrew and Greek in their public
   sermons savours much of show, according with neither time or place."

   "I have more than once heard him say at table," Mathesius says, "how
   that in the Schools it was proper to dispute and bring forward acute
   arguments to confute the adversaries; but that in the pulpit those are
   the best preachers who discourse in a childlike, ordinary, simple
   style, intelligible to the common people."

   We have already spoken of Luther's view of the devil. Whatever Luther
   learned to doubt of the medieval theology, he certainly retained its
   strong faith in the existence and constant work of an evil personality
   fighting against God and the kingdom of God. This persuasion made him
   also believe in witchcraft, with its attendant horrors. He was in many
   ways the child of his time, much as he rose above it in some things. "I
   should have no compassion on these witches," he says. "I would burn all
   of them." "Witchcraft is the devil's own work." "The devil is so crafty
   a spirit that he can ape and deceive our senses. He can cause one to
   think he sees something which he sees not; that he hears thunders or a
   trumpet which he hears not." "When I could not be rid of the devil with
   sentences out of Holy Scripture, I made him often fly with jeering
   words. Sometimes I said to him, Saint Satan! if Christ's blood which
   was shed for my sins be not sufficient, then I desire that thou wouldst
   pray to God for me."

   In contrast with such superstitions, which plainly tended to darken the
   Reformer's views of life, and even to degrade his conception of
   Christianity, may be placed his keen love of nature, of music, and all
   the brighter aspects of social fellowship. He not only delighted in
   nature, but he was almost scientifically observant of its
   phenomena--their beautiful order, their ministries of service. "God's
   power and wisdom," he says, "are shown in the smallest flowers.
   Painters cannot rival their colour, nor perfumers their sweetness:
   green and yellow, crimson and blue and purple, all growing out of the
   earth. And we do not know how to use them to God's honour. We trample
   on lilies as if we were so many cows." "Could a man make a single rose
   we should give him an empire; but these beautiful gifts of God come
   freely to us, and we think nothing of them. The most precious of things
   is nothing, if it be only common."

   In the spring time his heart rose to God in grateful joy as he saw the
   green life again appearing on the earth. "Praise be to God the Creator,
   that now in this time of Lent out of dead wood makes all alive again.
   Look at that bough, as if it were with child, and full of young things
   coming to the birth. It is a figure of our faith: winter is death,
   summer is the resurrection."

   "Look at a pair of birds," he said; "they build a neat little nest and
   drop their eggs on it, and sit on them. Then come the chicks. There is
   the creature rolled up inside the shell. If we had never seen such a
   thing before, and an egg was brought from Calicut, we should be all
   wondering and crying out. Philosophers cannot explain how the chick was
   made. God spake and it was done. He commanded and so it was."

   Of music he often spoke. "I always loved music," he said; "whoso has
   skill in that art is of a good temperament fitted for all things. We
   must teach music in schools; a schoolmaster ought to have skill in
   music. Neither should we ordain young men as preachers, unless they
   have been well exercised in music. Music is one of the best of arts;
   the notes give life to the text; it expels melancholy, as we see in
   King Saul. Satan hates music, because it drives away evil thoughts. We
   read in the Bible that the good and godly kings maintained and paid
   singers. Music is the best solace for a sad and sorrowful mind; by it
   the heart is refreshed and settled again in peace. It is a discipline
   too; for it softens us, and makes us temperate and reasonable. I have
   no pleasure in any man who, like the fanatics, despises music. It is a
   gift from God to drive away the devil, and make us forget our anger,
   and impurity, and pride, and evil tempers. I place music next to
   theology. I can see why David and all the saints put their choicest
   thoughts into song."

   There are many miscellaneous sayings in the Table-Talk' of great
   value--many serious thoughts and many wise and merry sayings. All who
   would know Luther must study them, and see how much more than a mere
   ecclesiastic or theologian he was,--how he had in him the elements of a
   great statesman and "dramatist," as Mr Froude says, as well as of a
   large-minded Christian thinker. This latter he was too; yet clearness
   and rationality of thought were by no means his most characteristic
   powers. He was stronger in his estimates of men and religion in the
   concrete, as represented in the family, in society, and in the Church,
   than he was in any mere abstract questions. In pure thinking the
   medieval trappings of his mind clung to him more closely than when he
   looked with broad open eyes at life, and the necessities whether of
   political or Christian society. War he hated, although he did not
   shrink from it when inevitable in the interests of civil order or the
   defence of Christendom. "War," he said, "is one of the greatest plagues
   that can afflict humanity; it destroys religion, it destroys states, it
   destroys families. Any scourge, in fact, is preferable to it. Famine
   and pestilence become as nothing in comparison with it. Pestilence is
   the least evil of the three, and 'twas therefore David chose it,
   willing rather to fall into the hands of God than into those of
   pitiless man." While detesting war, he loved and admired soldiers. "A
   great soldier is the man; he has not many words; he knows what men are,
   and holds his tongue; but when he does speak, he acts also. A real hero
   does not go about his work with vain imagination. . . . A valiant and
   brave soldier seeks rather to preserve one citizen than to destroy a
   thousand enemies. He begins not a war lightly or without an urgent
   cause. . . . Certain ages seem more fruitful in great men than others.
   When I was a boy there were a great many--the Emperor Maximilian in
   Germany, Sigismund in Poland, Ladislaus in Hungary, Ferdinand, Emperor
   Charles's grandfather, in Spain--pious, wise, noble princes. There were
   a good many bishops, too, who would have been with us had they been
   alive now. There was a bishop of Würzburg who used to say, when he saw
   a rogue, To the cloister with you--thou art useless to God or man.'"

   His ill feeling to Erasmus, to whom he was certainly far from just,
   appears in the following: "In the year 1536 Luther wrote on his
   tablets, Res et verba Philippus; verba sine re Erasmus; res sine verbis
   Lutherus; nec res, nec verba Carolostadius; that which Philip
   Melanchthon writes has hands and feet, the matter is good and the words
   are good. Erasmus Roterodamus writes many words, but to no purpose;
   Luther has good matter but the words are wanting; Carlstadt has neither
   good words nor good matter."

   His love of fun is never far away. "A student of Erfurt," he tells,
   "desiring to see Nuremberg, departed with a friend on a journey
   thither. Before they had walked half a mile, he asked his companion
   whether they would soon get to Nuremberg, and was answered, 'Tis scarce
   likely, since we have only just left Erfurt.' Having repeated the
   question another half mile further on, and getting the same answer, he
   said, Let us give up the journey, and go back, since the world is so
   vast.'"

   Again, "There are poets who affect to be carried away by their
   enthusiasm. There was Richius, for example. I remember him sitting with
   his legs out of his window pretending to be in a fit of poetic fury
   against the devil, whom he was abusing and vilifying with long
   roundabout phrases. Strigel, who chanced to pass under, for sport
   suddenly took hold of the brawling poet's legs and frightened him
   heartily--the poor man thinking the devil had come to carry him off."

   "I am a great enemy to flies, quia sunt imagines diaboli et
   hæreticorum. When I have a good book they flock upon it, and parade up
   and down upon it, and soil it. Tis just the same with the devil; when
   our hearts are purest, he comes and soils them."

   "An idle priest, instead of reciting his breviary, used to run over the
   alphabet, and then say, Oh my God! take this alphabet, and put it
   together how you will.'"

   With one other saying, the substance of which is as old as Solomon, but
   the application of which is ever new, we must conclude these
   illustrative extracts. "The multitude of books is a great evil. There
   is no measure nor limit to this fever for writing. Every one must be an
   author,--some out of vanity to acquire celebrity, others for the sake
   of lucre and gain. The Bible is now buried under so many commentaries,
   that the text is nothing regarded. I could wish all my books were
   buried nine ells deep underground, by reason of the ill example they
   will give."

   Luther's last years were, upon the whole, peaceful, with a thread of
   sadness in them as he looked beyond his own happy home and Wittenberg,
   and saw how unsettled the prospect was for the good cause in Germany.
   It was well for him that he had a happy home, and good wife and
   children and friends, in whose society he could solace himself as he
   saw the gathering darkness about to descend on his country. "I love my
   Catherine," he says. "I love her more than I do myself, for I would die
   rather than any harm should happen to her or her children." But the
   long-delayed rupture in the Empire was steadily approaching. He was
   mercifully to be spared the sight of it, though he could not but see it
   coming. When the year 1544 brought peace with France, it was clear that
   the issue must be tried between the old and the new forces. The Pope
   once more began urging the Emperor to put down toleration, and compel
   the Protestants to a surrender. The promised "free and Christian
   Council," [54] which was to compose religious differences, after a fair
   hearing of both sides, had become a mere Roman council, before which
   the Evangelical party were summoned to appear as culprits. The
   Protestant princes and theologians, as may be imagined, refused to
   appear; and from the date of its summons at Trent, December 13, 1545,
   war seemed imminent, although still postponed. Luther felt himself
   growing old: he had begun to lose his eyesight, and he had wished to
   leave his work at Wittenberg and return permanently to his farm,--"old,
   spent, worn, weary, cold, and with but one eye to see with," as he
   spoke of himself. But the perfidy of the Papacy at the last moment
   roused him to indignant earnestness. He was like an old lion stirred in
   his lair, and he gave forth his last thunders in his terrible pamphlet,
   Against the Papacy in Rome, founded by the Devil.' The "Aller heiligst"
   became the "Aller höllischst vater," the "most holy" the "most hellish
   father." So he closed his career, though in sterner tones, very much as
   he began it, with the exposure of the pretensions of the Papacy to
   represent Christendom. The conservatism of his later years had made him
   in no degree more tolerant of Rome. He saw the bloodthirsty designs it
   cherished against his native land, and he raised his last voice against
   it.

   The circumstances of his death were befitting his noble life. On the
   23d of January 1546, he left Wittenberg on a mission of conciliation
   between the Counts of Mansfeld, the lords of his native soil, who had
   long been at variance with one another, but had offered to submit their
   dispute to the reformer's arbitration. For some time previously his
   mind had been filled with thoughts of death, and, on his journey
   presentiments of his approaching end haunted him. "When I come back
   from Eisleben, I will lay me in my coffin: the world is weary of me,
   and I of the world: pray God that He will mercifully grant me a
   peaceful death." The prayer was granted. On the 14th of February he
   wrote to his "dear Ketha" that his work of peace was all but concluded.
   Two days after, he was overheard in earnest prayer while standing, as
   he was wont to do, in the window. The next day he was unwell, and the
   idea of death again came vividly to his mind. "I was born and baptised
   here in Eisleben; what if I am likewise to die here?" He was still
   able, however, the same day to dine and sup with his friends, and
   somewhat enjoy himself. During the night his illness increased. He
   suffered from oppression of the chest and severe pains. He was joined
   by his friends in alarm, a soothing draught was administered to him,
   and he murmured, "If I could fall asleep for half an hour, I think it
   would do me good." Sleep came for a little, but did not bring him
   relief. During the whole of the next day, his friends, and his two sons
   who were with him, watched by his bedside as he gradually sank. "Do you
   die in the faith of Christ and the doctrine you have preached?" he was
   asked by Dr Jonas, as consciousness was departing. He answered "Yes,"
   closed his eyes, and fell asleep; and then, with one deep sigh, slept
   his last. By the command of the Elector his body was brought in solemn
   procession from Eisleben to Wittenberg, and laid in the church whose
   walls had so often resounded with his eloquence. Melanchthon pronounced
   an oration over his tomb; and sobs and tears from the congregated
   thousands,--men, women, and children, who had loved the great monk,
   mingled with the words of the admiring and faithful friend.

   The character of Luther, as presented in our rapid survey, is
   especially distinguished for its broad and massive manliness.
   Everywhere and pre-eminently Luther is a man with a heart alive to all
   true human feeling, and burning with the most earnest and passionate
   aspirations after human good. When we remember that he was trained a
   monk, and was in fact a monk till he was about forty-two years of
   age--that books rather than men were his chief study during the most
   fresh and formative period of life--it is truly wonderful to recognise
   in him such a breadth and intensity, such a variety and richness of
   human interest and affection. Scholastic in the spirit of his theology,
   sacerdotal to the last in many of his convictions, he was of all the
   reformers the least technical and narrow and ecclesiastical in feeling.
   His genial and vivifying humanity broke through all conventional
   bounds, brushed them aside, and more than anything else, except the
   spiritual truth which he preached, brought him near to the heart of the
   German people. Had he been less of a man and more of a scholar, less
   animated by a common and popular sympathy, and more animated by mere
   intellectual impulse, he could never have achieved the work that he
   did. It is but a poor and one-sided criticism, therefore, which
   delights to expose Luther's intellectual inconsistencies, unscholarly
   temper, and unphilosophical spirit. [55] The truth is, that Luther was
   not characteristically a scholar, not even a divine, least of all a
   philosopher. He was a Hero with work to do; and he did it. His powers
   were exactly fitted to the task to which God called him. As it was of
   Titanic magnitude, he required to be a Titan in human strength, and in
   depth and power, and even violence of human passion, in order to
   accomplish it. The mere breadth and momentum of his humanity would not,
   indeed, have sufficed by themselves, but inspired and swayed by Divine
   truth they were irresistible. Both conditions were equally necessary to
   his success--the energy, vehemence, and pith of the man; the animation,
   control, and sway of the Divine Spirit. Had the instrument been less
   powerful and varied, less full-toned and responsive to all the rich
   wavering breath of human emotion, the Spirit might have breathed in
   vain, and the full chorus of resounding triumph from many gathering
   voices never have been raised. To initiate the reform movement, which
   was destined to renew the face of Europe, and to give a higher impulse
   and nobler and more enduring life to all the Saxon nations, required a
   strong and gigantic will like that of Luther, which, instead of being
   crushed by opposition or frightened by hatred, only rose in the face of
   both into a prouder and grander attitude of daring. As he himself said,
   "To clear the air and to render the earth more fertile, it is not
   enough that the rain should water and penetrate its surface--there
   needs also the thunder and lightning;" [56] and he acknowledged himself
   to be the impersonation of the latter.

   And yet, with all this manly energy and vehemence of character, Luther,
   we have already seen, was no Radical in his reforms. His moderation was
   at least as conspicuous as his energy, and we shall greatly
   misapprehend both him and his work if we do not perceive this. He was
   very little of a theorist. He fought for the truth as God had revealed
   it to him. But of all the reformers, except Latimer, none fought less
   for mere schemes or devices of his own to supplant the old fabric of
   the Church. He would rather rebuild and purify it than supersede it. In
   his own language, "he was never for throwing away the old shoes till he
   had got new ones." Iconoclasm of every kind he abhorred. "It must be a
   bad spirit," he said, "which can show its fruit only by breaking open
   churches and cloisters, and burning images of saints." Of a certain
   preacher who was flying high, and carrying things out in a violent
   spirit of innovation, he writes: "What good can result from all this
   precipitation? I myself preached nearly three years before I touched
   such questions, while these people think to settle the whole business
   in half an hour. I beg you will enjoin the preacher to observe more
   moderation in future, and to begin with making his people thoroughly
   understand Jesus Christ." [57] It was this spirit of moderation that
   set him resolutely against Carlstadt. Innovation for its own
   sake--innovation for the sake of uniformity in different churches--all
   that marks so intensely the later history of Protestantism in Geneva
   and elsewhere, was unintelligible, and would have been thoroughly
   uncongenial to him.

   So far, and as a mere practical method, his moderation appears entirely
   commendable; but it is impossible to deny that he carried his
   moderation farther than this. He not only did not like changes, but he
   naturally shrank from new views. His mind as well as his practice was
   strongly conservative; the truth only reached him at first through a
   struggle and wrench of his whole being so violent that he could not
   bear to repeat the process. After admitting one streaming flood of
   light, he shut himself closely against its further ingress. He
   possessed none of that calmly speculative and inquiring spirit, which
   is ever going out in search of truth in all directions, and unfolding
   itself more and more to the sunlight of discovery. He was both too
   logical and too practical, too dogmatic and too immediate in his
   judgments, to permit of such a consistent intellectual progress. His
   mind required to be girded by clear and strong convictions, within the
   sphere of which his activity knew no bounds; but no soaring aspirations
   after a higher truth than that which had first seized him, as it were,
   by divine violence, haunted his spiritual imagination, and he would
   have thought it mere idle vanity to dream of any larger and more
   comprehensive view than that which seemed so plain and open to himself.
   It is this which constitutes at once the disappointment of his later
   years, and his, weakness and defects as a mere theologian. He would not
   advance with Carlstadt; and so far he was right. He would have nothing
   to do with Zwingli and the Sacramentarians, and so far he was honest.
   We respect his independence in both cases. But he would not only not
   advance with others--he would not advance at all. He would not open his
   mind to the free air of heaven as it breathed in Scripture; and he was
   angry and violent with all who went beyond himself. He spoke with
   contemptuous dogmatism of the Swiss divines, and he had little patience
   even with Melanchthon's cautious and well-balanced progress, and his
   more subtle and comprehensive insight into the dogmas of the
   Reformation. If we regard Luther, therefore, as a mere theologian, it
   is fair enough to object to his violence, his narrowness, his
   one-sidedness; but it is far from fair to regard him merely or mainly
   in this point of view. As a theological thinker he takes no high rank,
   and has left little or no impress upon human history. The very
   qualities, however, which made his weakness as a thinker, were so far
   from retarding that they helped Ms work of reform. His impatience, his
   intensity, and crudeness of apprehension, and his coarseness of
   handling, are but poor arms of reason; but they are manful and honest
   weapons in a struggle for life or death, and they carried him
   triumphantly through, when others of a less robust and hardy texture
   would have yielded and been overpowered.

   If we add to this strong manliness the most simple and pure
   affectionateness, a rich and powerful humour, an exquisite tenderness
   of feeling under all his occasional coarseness of language, and the
   most vivid appreciation of life and nature, the outline of his
   character is only partially filled up. It is impossible to conceive any
   nature more frank, open, and genial than that which the domestic
   history of the reformer discovers. He lays bare his heart with the most
   guileless and winning simplicity; he has the most gay and jovial relish
   of all that is pure and good, however trivial, in life,--sharing in the
   amusements of his children, counselling with his wife how to reward an
   old servant, entering with the most earnest cordiality into the joys of
   his friends, and sharing his warm tears with them in their sorrows.
   None but a man of the most genuine kindliness could have ever bound
   fast to him so many friends as Luther did--old schoolfellows, such as
   Nicolas Emler and John Reinacke; brother monks, such as John Lange,
   whom he made Prior of Erfurt; and all his more immediate
   fellow-labourers in Wittenberg--Amsdorf, Justus Jonas, Bugenhagen,
   Lucas Cranach, and Melanchthon,--not to speak of the Electors Frederick
   and John, and their secretary Spalatin. It was no mere bond of interest
   or of accident that bound these brave men together, but above all, the
   great heart and diffusive kindliness of Luther, as the central figure
   around whom they gathered. How exquisite the kindly hilarity and
   tender-heartedness with which he wrote to Spalatin after his marriage!
   "If you will come to me, you will see some monument of our old love and
   friendship. I have planted a garden and built a fountain, both with
   great success. Come, and you shall be crowned with lilies and roses."

   Intimately allied with, and springing out of, both his affectionateness
   and manliness, was his humour, the rich emollient softening all his
   asperities, and dropping like a pleasant balm in the midst of his
   harshest controversies. The difference between Erasmus and him is
   somewhat the difference between wit and humour. Not that the author of
   the Colloquies can be said to want humour in his sly sallies at the
   follies of monkish superstition; yet that depth and richness of
   sympathy which is the most characteristic difference of humour from
   wit, is comparatively wanting in Erasmus. No contrast can be more
   marked than the covert and ingenious sarcasm, the subtle point and
   pungent dilemmas of the one, and the riotous attack, open-eyed gaiety,
   and hilarious laughter of the other. In Luther's humour, powerful as it
   is, there mixes no bitterness. He is blunt, but never cynical. He
   dislikes intrusion and laughs at ignorance, but never in a harsh way. A
   man once came from the Low Countries to dispute with him about all
   sorts of things. He remarks, "When I saw what a poor ignorant creature
   he was, I said to him, Hadn't we better dispute over a can or two of
   beer?'" His heart is not pained and fretted by the contrasts which
   touch his imagination. They sometimes weary, but seldom chafe or vex
   him; more frequently they only kindle in him a wild spirit of glee,
   which breaks forth in sparkles of laughter or shouts of defiant
   jollity. But beneath all his uproarious fun there lie depths of
   tenderness and sadness, a passionate unrest and "unnameable
   melancholy." The pathos, and distance, and gentleness of many of his
   allusions show that he had a saddened and shadowed heart that felt
   unutterably the awful mystery of life and death. The thoughts of his
   daring and strange career would sometimes awaken this hidden chord of
   grief. As he and Catherine were walking in the garden one evening, the
   stars shone with unusual brilliancy. "What a brilliant light!" said
   Luther, as he looked upward; "but it burns not for us." "And why are we
   to be shut out from the kingdom of heaven?" asked Catherine. "Perhaps,"
   said Luther, with a sigh, "because we left our convents." "Shall we
   return, then?" "No," he replied, "it is too late to do that."

   The sights and sounds of nature all touch him, now with joy and now
   with pathetic aspiration. Of all the reformers, we see in him alone
   this elevated susceptibility to natural grandeur and beauty. In the
   view of these, his poetic depth and richness of feeling come strongly
   into play. The flowers, the birds, the "bounteous thunder shaking the
   earth and rousing it, that its fruits may come forth and spread a
   perfume;" the troubled sky, and the dark and heaving clouds poised
   overhead, and guided by the swift and invisible hand of God; the quiet
   loveliness of the harvest-fields on his return home from Leipzig; the
   little bird perching at sunset in his garden, and folding its wings
   trustfully under the care of the Almighty Father; the first song of the
   nightingale,--all touch him with emotion, and awaken his tender or
   solemn interest. The sprouting branches of his garden trees, "strong
   and beautiful, and big with the fruit that they shall bring forth,"
   make him think of the resurrection, and of the awakening of the soul
   after the wintry sleep of death. Luther was in truth a poet, gifted not
   only with the keen appreciation and life of feeling that constitute
   poetic sensibility, but, moreover, with that mastery of melodious
   expression which makes the fulness of the "gift and faculty divine."
   His love of music, his love of nature and liberty, and, above all, his
   heroic faith, inspire his hymns with a rapture of lyrical feeling and
   excellence rarely reached. These beautiful and stirring utterances,
   escaping from him, as Heine says, "like a flower making its way between
   rough stones, or a moonbeam glittering amid dark clouds," [58] finely
   grace the grand and rugged life of this man, and shed a joy of harmony
   amid all its mighty discords.

   Upon the whole, we have before us a tender as well as energetic
   character--softness mingling with strength--sadness with
   humour--gentleness with power. History presents many more complete or
   symmetrical characters; few greater; none more rich in diverse elements
   of human feeling and moral aspiration. No selfishness, nor vanity, nor
   mere vulgar ambition, meet us, amid all his proud consciousness of
   power or most high-handed dogmatism; but everywhere, even when we can
   least sympathise with him, we see an honest and magnanimous nature
   swayed by a living faith and glowing earnestness--a great soul moved by
   passionate conviction and sublimed by divine thought.

   It remains for us to inquire concerning the main thought that moved
   Luther, and animated him in all his work. It requires but little
   penetration to discover that he was possessed by such a thought--that a
   profound principle--a single inspiring spiritual idea--ran through the
   whole of this great movement, and, more than anything else, gave
   direction and strength and triumph to it.

   Many other influences, as we have seen, were at work. With the
   commencement of the sixteenth century there was a dawning life of
   national feeling and of literary culture all through the southern and
   western nations of Europe: Germany was in a special manner moved and
   agitated by such influences. They prepared the soil and rendered it
   receptive. Erasmus turned the ploughshare of his sharp intelligence
   into it, and cast it up, and made it quick with an unwonted movement of
   intellectual life. Reuchlin and his Humanist coadjutors, in their
   famous conflict with the monks of Cologne, not only strengthened the
   labours of Erasmus, but in a very clear and decisive manner proved the
   hopeless ignorance and incapacity of their opponents; the free secular
   or war party, headed by Franz von Sickingen and Hutten, and afterwards
   by the Landgrave of Hesse, rallied to their aid a strong political
   feeling, bursting forth on all sides against the ecclesiastical
   oppressions and unnational bigotries of Rome. These literary and
   political powers are all distinctly seen working throughout Germany at
   this time. A satirical pen was the chosen weapon of the one, a sword
   the proffered weapon of the other; and the fearless and hapless Ulrich
   von Hutten is found equally ready with his pen or with his sword. He is
   a strange, restless, and gallant figure, this knight of the
   Reformation--the co-operator both of Humanists and Secularists--and,
   more than any one else, the bond of connection between both and Luther.
   Luther could not approve of his projects, but he liked his independence
   and courage, and he mourned his early death, while the cold sarcasms of
   Erasmus cast bitter ashes over his grave. [59] But no one nor all of
   these influences concurrently can be held as adequately accounting for
   the Reformation.

   Starting from the midst of them, stimulated and no doubt greatly aided
   by them, it had its real origin deeper below the surface than either
   Humanism or Nationalism. It was characteristically a spiritual
   revolt--an awakening of the individual conscience in the light of the
   old Gospel, for centuries imprisoned and obscured in the dim chambers
   of men's traditions, but now at length breaking forth with renewed
   radiance. This was the life and essence of Luther's own personal
   struggle, and it was this which formed the spring of all his labours,
   and gave them such a pervading and mighty energy. The principle of
   moral individualism--of the free responsible relation of every soul to
   God--stamps the movement with its characteristic impress, and, more
   than any other thing, enables us to understand its power and success.
   In theological language this principle is known as the doctrine of
   justification by faith alone; but we prefer to apprehend it in this
   more general and ethical form of expression.

   It was this element of individualism that had become especially
   corrupted during many centuries of ecclesiastical bondage. Scholastic
   subtlety on the one hand, and monkish superstition on the other, had
   crushed it out of sight. A vast system of traditional authority,
   covering with its ample and insinuating folds every sphere of thought
   and every phase of society, left no room for any fresh and healthy
   individual life. It encompassed and restrained all the movements of
   opinion and action within a monotonous and rigid routine. Scholasticism
   and monkery as its two great expressions remain, beyond doubt, among
   the most marvellous monuments of human energy that the world has ever
   witnessed,--the one a gigantic structure of logical enthusiasm, and the
   other a picturesque and stirring drama of missionary adventure, to
   which there can scarcely be said to be any modern parallels; yet in
   neither was there any real freedom of mental or spiritual life. The
   vast energies which they engaged, operated within artificial and
   prescribed limits--with a power and results at which we wonder--but
   beneath an incubus of priestly tradition, which left the soul confined,
   and at a distance from God. The individual was nothing, the School or
   the Church was everything; and during the fourteenth and fifteenth
   centuries this moral stagnation had deadened into absolute corruption.
   Farther and farther the scholastic doctrine had separated itself from
   Scripture, and the monastic piety from the life of faith. The one, in
   such representatives as Eck and Emser, had degenerated into a dogmatism
   at once fierce and frivolous; the other, as in Luther's brother monks
   at Erfurt, into an asceticism at once pretentious and ridiculous. In
   various forms the smouldering life of these centuries had continued to
   show itself; it had burst forth in the magnanimous intrepidity of Huss
   and of Jerome, and the beautiful mysticism of Tauler and the Theologia
   Germanica; but now at length the fire of a strong spiritual conviction
   was kindled in the convent at Erfurt, which was destined to break forth
   into light, and cover with its glory the face of Europe.

   Luther had tried scholasticism and tried monkery, and found both to be
   wanting. So far from bringing him near to God, they had hid God from
   him, and left him miserable in his weakness and sinfulness. The poor
   priest, thirsting for righteousness, found himself fed on "sentences."
   The great human heart of Luther, full of spiritual depths and
   sensibilities, could not nourish itself on the writings of the
   schoolmen; and his frequently expressed bitterness against Scotists and
   Thomists is not to be regarded as mere vehemence of temper, but as the
   strong reaction of his intellectual and spiritual nature against the
   useless subtleties in which he had once sought satisfaction. Monkery
   had failed even more signally in his experience. He had sought
   spiritual peace, through its moat painful observances, with a
   single-hearted earnestness. Its distant heaven, whose interval was
   spanned by a bridge of painful and sore travel, he had spared no toil
   or weariness to reach. His body and soul were reduced to the last
   extremity by fastings and penances, and the heaven of his desires
   seemed as far off as ever. Cherishing the most profound faith in the
   supposed spiritual guardianship of the Church, he had passed within its
   pale an abject worshipper, craving salvation by the most humiliating
   submissions and earnest prayers; and yet he had not found it. "Sin was
   always too strong for him," as he said; he could not expel it by the
   most untiring vigils or the most unrelenting mortifications. He was
   driven, therefore, to seek strength and comfort elsewhere; and the
   words of Staupitz and of the aged monk came to him as life from the
   dead. Gradually the words of Scripture revealed to him a new
   righteousness, and it became the one pervading and triumphant joy of
   his heart. He felt that the divine way of salvation was not as that of
   man. Works of the Church, works even of piety, sunk out of sight before
   the overmastering and glad conviction of God's free grace to the
   soul--to the individual.

   It is remarkable how completely Luther apprehended his new creed in
   this polemical form--how it shaped itself in his mind doctrinally as an
   opposing tenet to the "Aristotelic" principle with which he had been
   working,--which had expressed itself dominantly at once in his
   scholastic training and his ascetic discipline--the principle, viz.,
   "that a man becomes just by doing just acts." "We must first be just,"
   he said in one of his earliest vindications of his favourite doctrine,
   "and then we shall do just actions." The heart must be changed--the
   result will follow. "Without faith in Christ men may become Fabricii.
   or Reguli, but can no more become holy than a crabapple can become a
   fig." Righteousness, in short, is from within, not from without--a
   divinely implanted life of faith, and not a formal life of works. It
   springs directly out of the relation of the soul to God, and not out of
   any outward mortifications, or tentative moral habits.

   This bare assertion of individualism does not indeed exhaust the
   doctrine of Luther. There was poor comfort to him rather--the most
   gloomy misery--so long as he merely felt that all his penances were
   worthless, and that God could alone save him. He only got peace when at
   length he recognised how God is in Christ a Saviour--when the
   forgiveness of sins became to him a divine fact, clearly and completely
   expressed in Christ. Then he realised that righteousness not only could
   not begin from without, but not even from within, in any partial or
   selfish sense, but from Christ within--from the union of the divine and
   human--from the heart apprehended by Christ, and apprehending Him as
   the source of all strength and salvation. And this is the full doctrine
   of justification by faith, when the immediate responsibilities of the
   soul to God are met and consummated in Christ. Then only does the
   bondage of sin fall away from it, and the joy of a divine righteousness
   becomes its portion.

   It was this reality of moral freedom in Christ--this undoing of the
   heavy burdens that had lain on the human conscience, that, more than
   all else, gave impulse and triumph to the Reformation. The hearts of
   men were weary with seeking salvation in the way of the priests; and as
   the voice of the monk of Wittenberg was heard crying, "No priest can
   save you!--no masses or indulgences can help you! But God has saved
   you! He Himself, and no mediatory saints, no holy Mother of God even,
   but God Himself, the Divine Son, has redeemed you!"--this, which in its
   first and most powerful utterance was no mere dogma,--no dry formula,
   which it so soon became, but a living voice of "Help from
   Heaven"--seized the great heart of the German people, and mightily
   swayed it. Brushing by the faltering and unsteady steps of Humanism,
   this faith in a divine righteousness near to every soul made for itself
   a joyful way among the nations, and carried with it, wherever it went,
   liberty and strength. It was this, and no mere destructive zeal, nor
   yet polemical logic, that "shook the ancient cathedrals to their inmost
   shrines," and spread a moral renovation throughout Europe.

   The spiritual principle is eternally divine and powerful. It is a very
   different thing when we turn to contemplate the dogmatic statements of
   Luther. So soon as Luther began to evolve his principle, and coin its
   living heart once more into dogma, he showed that he had not risen
   above the scholastic spirit which he aimed to destroy. It was truly
   impossible that he could do so. Not even the massive energy of Luther
   could pierce through those intellectual influences which had descended
   as a hoary heritage of ages to the sixteenth century. Like the mists
   cleared away by the morning sun, they had retired before the fresh
   outburst of the Sun of Righteousness, as the preaching of Luther
   kindled by its stirring words many lowly hearts looking upwards; but
   when the first glow of the warming sun had spent itself, the mists,
   which had only retreated and not disappeared, were seen creeping
   backward, and although no longer obscuring, yet spreading confusion and
   dimness over the illumined scene. It was not enough for Luther to
   proclaim a free righteousness in Christ for all, but he must, as a
   theologian, lay down his distinctions and enter into minute and
   arbitrary definitions of the divine if act of righteousness. Faith is
   not enough, but he further inclines to the assurance of faith, with its
   tendency to a rapid translation into mere barren self-confidence.
   Undeniably there grew up in his mind a reaction against the popish
   tenet of works, so extreme as frequently to leave him in his doctrinal
   statements on the verge of Antinomianism. The harmony of spiritual
   truth is broken up, and one side of it--the opposite to that in which
   as a monk he had been educated--is seized with such force and crudeness
   as to turn a free salvation scarcely less into a mechanism than the old
   doctrine of works. It is in vain for the most ardent admirers of Luther
   to deny this tendency to an unmoral view of the doctrine of grace in
   many of his expressions, although it is easy enough for them to prove
   against calumnious criticism, that this was not the substance but the
   mere reactionary shadow of his doctrine, thrown over it by those very
   mists of scholasticism in which his intellectual life had been nursed.

   The Reformation, in its theology, did not and could not escape the
   deteriorating influences of the scholastic spirit, for that spirit
   survived it and lived on in strength, although in a modified form,
   throughout the seventeenth century. In one important particular,
   indeed, the Scholastic and Protestant systems of theology entirely
   differed: the latter began their systematising from the very opposite
   extreme to that of the former--from the divine and not from the human
   side of redemption--from God, and not from man. And this is a
   difference on the side of truth by no means to be overlooked. Still the
   spirit is the same--the spirit which does not hesitate to break up the
   divine unity of the truth of Scripture into its own logical shreds and
   patches,--which tries to discriminate what in its moral essence is
   inscrutable, and to trace in distinct dogmatic moulds the operation of
   the divine and human wills in salvation,--while the very condition of
   all salvation is the eternal mystery of their union in an act of mutual
   and inexpressible love. This spirit of ultra-definition,--of essential
   rationalism,--was the corrupting inheritance of the new from the old
   theology; and it is difficult to say, all things considered, as we
   trace the melancholy history of Protestant dogmas, whether its fruits
   have been worse in the latter or in the former instance. The mists, it
   is true, have never again so utterly obscured the truth, but their
   dimness, covering a fairer light, almost inspires the religious heart
   with a deeper sadness.

   But there is a further principle which claims our consideration in
   connection with the Lutheran Reformation--a principle which was by no
   means consistently expressed, but which still had its imperfect birth,
   then. It was very far from Luther's intention, when he entered on his
   contest with the Church of Rome, to assert what. has been called the
   right of private judgment in matters of religion. Even in the end he
   did not fully understand or admit the validity of this principle; yet
   so far there was no other resting-ground for him. He was driven to
   claim for himself freedom of opinion in the light of Scripture as the
   only position on which, with any consistency, he could stand.
   Accordingly, when pressed to retract his views at Worms, when it was
   clearly made manifest that authority--Catholic and Imperial--was
   against him, he boldly took his ground here, in magnanimous and always
   memorable words. For himself, he said, "Unless I be convinced by
   Scripture or by reason, I can and will retract nothing; for to act
   against my conscience is neither safe nor honest. Here I stand." On
   Scripture and on reason he based his convictions, and would recognise
   the right of no mere external authority to control him. Not what the
   Emperor said--not what the Doctors said--not what the Church said,--but
   only what his own conscience owned to be true in the light of
   Scripture, would he acknowledge to be the truth. Nothing else could
   move him--so help him God. It is impossible to conceive a more
   unqualified assertion of the right of private judgment--of the
   indefeasible privilege of the individual reason to know and judge the
   truth for itself; and the Reformation only had a rational and
   consistent basis in so far as it took up this position in so far as
   Luther, for himself at least, felt its force and conclusiveness.

   It is too well known, however, that neither he nor any of his
   fellow-reformers recognised the full meaning and bearing of his
   position. They knew what their own necessities demanded,--but that was
   all. They raised the ensign of a free Bible in the face of Rome, but
   they speedily refused to allow others to fight under this banner as
   well as themselves. What Luther claimed for himself against Catholic
   authority he refused to Carlstadt, and refused to Zwingli, in favour of
   their more liberal doctrinal views. He failed to see that their
   position was exactly his own, with a difference of result,--which
   indeed was all the difference in the world to him. Against them he
   appealed not merely to Scripture, but to his own obstinate views of
   certain texts of Scripture; and gradually he erected a new authority,
   which to him, and still more to his followers, became absolute as
   Scripture itself. Scripture, as a witness, disappeared behind the
   Augsburg Confession as a standard; and so it happened more or less with
   all the reformers. They were consistent in displacing the Church of
   Rome from its position of assumed authority over the conscience, but
   they were equally consistent all of them in raising a dogmatic
   authority in its stead. In favour of their own views, they asserted the
   right of the private judgment to interpret and decide the meaning of
   Scripture, but they had nevertheless no idea of a really free
   interpretation of Scripture. Their orthodoxy everywhere appealed to the
   Bible, but it rested in reality upon an Augustinian commentary of the
   Bible. They displaced the medieval schoolmen, only to elevate
   Augustine. And having done this, they had no conception of any limits
   attaching to this new tribunal of heresy. Freedom of opinion, in the
   modern sense, was utterly unknown to them. There was not merely an
   absolute truth in Scripture, but they had settled by the help of
   Augustine what this truth was, and any variations from this standard
   were not to be tolerated.

   The idea of a free faith associated with very different dogmatic views,
   and yet equally Christian--the idea, of spiritual life and goodness
   apart from theoretical orthodoxy--had not dawned in the sixteenth
   century--nor long afterwards. Heresy was not a mere divergence of
   intellectual apprehension, but a moral obliquity,--a statutory
   offence,--to be punished by the magistrate, to be expiated by death. It
   is a strange and saddening spectacle to contemplate the gradual process
   by which the human mind has emancipated itself from the delusion that
   intellectual error is a subject of moral offence and punishment.
   Freedom, of opinion has won its way but slowly; and hindrances and
   conflicts yet await it. Men learn with difficulty that there is a
   temporary narrowness in their most consecrated traditions--that even
   the highest expressions of the most enlightened dogmatism are in their
   very nature but partial representations of the Divine Will--deflected
   rays from a light in its perfection inaccessible and full of glory,
   which no man hath seen, neither indeed can see. It required the lapse
   of many years to make men begin to feel--and it may still require the
   lapse of many more to make them fully feel-- that they cannot
   absolutely fix in their feeble symbols the truth of God,--that it is
   ever bursting with its own free might the old bottles in which they
   would contain it; and that, consequently,--according to that very law
   of progress by which all things live,--it is impossible to bind the
   conscience by any bonds but those of God's own wisdom (Word) in
   Scripture--a spiritual authority addressing a spiritual subject--a
   teacher not of "the letter which killeth, but of the Spirit which
   giveth life."

   [24] There seems to be some doubt as to whether it was on this evening
   or on the succeeding one, after his first appearance before the Diet,
   that he appealed so solemnly to Heaven. The following are parts of his
   prayer: "My God, O Thou my God! stand by me against all the world's
   reason and wisdom: Thou must do it--Thou alone, for it is not my cause
   but Thine. I have nothing to do for mine own self; nothing to do with
   these great lords of the world. I would have good peaceable days, and
   be free from tumult. But it is Thy cause, Lord! the true eternal cause.
   Stand by me, Thou true eternal God! I trust in no man. It is vain and
   to no purpose all that is flesh, O God! my God! Hearest Thou not, O my
   God Art Thou dead? No; Thou canst not die. Thou only hidest Thyself.
   Hast Thou chosen me to this? I ask of Thee that I may be assured
   thereof. I have not taken it upon myself, O God! Stand by me in the
   name of Thy dear Son Jesu Christ; for the cause is right, and it is
   Thine. I shall never be separated from Thee. Be this determined in Thy
   name. The world must leave my conscience unconstrained; and though it
   be full of devils, and my body, Thy handiwork and creation, go to the
   ground and be rent to fragments and dust, it is but the body, for Thy
   word is sure to me; and my soul is Thine, and shall abide with Thee to
   eternity. Amen. God help me. Amen."

   righteousness."--De Servo Arbitrio, Opera, vol. iii. p. 225. The whole
   of this paragraph, and many other expressions of Luther, amply bear out
   the statement of the text. He speaks, for example, of God by His own
   will making us necessario damnabiles (p. 171); and again he compares
   the human will to a "pack-horse now mounted by God, and now mounted by
   the devil," driven hither or thither by divine or by satanic agency,
   irrespective of all moral bias or character in itself (p. 172). This
   subject has been fully discussed in a polemic between two distinguished
   men--Sir William Hamilton and Archdeacon Hare. Of the two, the
   archdeacon shows by far the most true and profound appreciation of
   Luther as a whole; but in particular instances (as in his paraphrase of
   one of the above passages) he has failed to defend him successfully
   against the accusations of Sir W. Hamilton.

   scarcely be said to have deserved the appellation of Erasmus. Any
   beauty she had must, at least, have been of a very broad, blond,
   Teutonic cast--the beauty of round, full, and child-like features,
   rather than of graceful and winning intelligence. Likely enough,
   however, there is some caricature in the engraving,--so perverse is the
   dramatic caricature of M. Audin's touch everywhere throughout his
   interesting but singularly untruthful history.

CALVIN

CALVIN.

   THERE were almost from the beginning two very different classes of men
   engaged in the Reformation--the men of movement and of action, and the
   men of organisation and of policy. The first class were, in the most
   radical sense, reformers--those who broke through the old bonds of
   superstition, and, by a process of disturbance and disintegration,
   prepared the way for a new creative epoch in the relations of human
   society and the forms of religious life; the second were
   characteristically theologians and ecclesiastics as well as
   reformers--those who, having accepted the principles of the reformed
   movement, sought to mould them into new expressions of Christian
   thought and life. The former were heroes heading a great insurrection
   in human history, which had not yet taken to itself a well-defined
   shape, but was moving onwards rather under the sway of an irresistible
   spiritual impulse than of clear regulative ideas; the latter were
   thinkers and legislators, whose aim it was to impress a dogmatic and
   constitutional character upon the disturbing elements that had been set
   in motion. As Luther is the greatest of the first class, so Calvin is,
   beyond all comparison, the greatest of the second class. In each case,
   however, there is a group of contrasted characters around the central
   figure--Melanchthon, Camerarius, and others, around Luther; and Lefevre
   and Farel around Calvin.

   When we turn our gaze from Germany to France in the beginning of the
   sixteenth century, we find both Lefevre and Farel actively at work in
   the cause of religious reform. Farel particularly is seen labouring
   with fiery zeal, and a self-sacrificing and heroic temper. An
   enthusiastic priest of Dauphiny, he had, in his earlier. career,
   exhausted almost every device of sacerdotalism with a determined
   self-devotion, and only reached the truth after severe spiritual
   struggles; with a powerful and restless energy he gave himself, so soon
   as his own heart was quickened, to a life of religious adventure--to
   the kindling of a spirit of reform wherever he travelled,--in Dauphiny,
   in Basle, in Geneva. He is beyond doubt the most notable of the early
   reformers of France and even before Luther, in his famous theses, had
   sounded that note of war which soon awakened all Germany, and
   propagated itself to France and England, Farel had in Paris raised his
   voice against the papal authority, and begun his evangelical labours.
   He wins our sympathy from something of the same frank, bold, and
   careless character which distinguishes the great German, bearing on his
   front, like him, the impress of an ever-fresh enthusiasm, and the scars
   of many a hard conflict. He stands, however, at a great distance from
   the hero of Worms. There was in all Farel's fiery earnestness too
   little comprehension and firm persistence to have enabled him to carry
   out in any great and enduring shape the impulse which he himself
   communicated. It was necessary that some master-mind should arise
   within the sphere of the Gallic reform movement, in order to
   consolidate it into a distinctive spiritual power, and to impart to it
   a lasting social result.

   Such a master-mind was Calvin, who represents most strikingly the
   converging influences of the Swiss and the French Reformations. Both
   may be fairly regarded as summed up in him, in so far as they
   enunciated principles and entered as a controlling influence into the
   history of the world. In this sense he is the most comprehensive
   representative of each and of both together, although he must yield the
   palm of priority and of active heroism in the one case to Zwingli, and
   in the other case to Farel. Into their labours he entered in a somewhat
   similar way as Melanchthon entered into the labours of Luther; and so
   far he takes his place beside Melanchthon in the second class of
   reformers. His theological and didactic qualities and personal
   sympathies, moreover, ally him with the friend and supporter of Luther,
   rather than with Luther himself. But there are other and most important
   respects in which, as we shall see, he occupies a position not only
   above Melanchthon, but above Luther--a position singular in moral
   grandeur, and in the vigorous and widely extending influence which
   spread around from it.

   The life of Calvin, in contrast with that of the German reformer,
   presents but few dramatic aspects. In merely biographic interest it is
   not nearly so rich, although there is a great consistency and purpose
   in its several parts, which invest it with a powerful charm to some
   minds. [60] It may be conveniently divided for our purpose into three
   periods of unequal duration: First, From his birth in 1509 to his
   completion of the Institutes' in their first shape in 1536. This, like
   the corresponding period in Luther's life, may be called the period of
   his education. Second, From his first appearance in Geneva in the same
   year, 1536, onwards to the incidents of his expulsion and residence at
   Strasburg to September. 1541, when he re-entered and finally settled in
   Geneva. Third, From this latter date to his death in 1564. We can only
   sketch in each of these epochs, as we rapidly glance through them, such
   features as are absolutely necessary to start before us some picture of
   the man, and to enable us to comprehend the meaning of the great aims
   for which he lived, and towards which he wrought.

   Calvin was born at Noyon, in Picardy, on the 10th of July 1509: he was
   thus twenty-six years the junior of Luther. His father, Gerard Cauvin
   or Calvin, was Procureur-Fiscal of the district of Noyon, and Secretary
   of the Diocese. He was a man of ability, distinguished by success in
   his profession, and the favour and friendship of the influential
   families in his neighbourhood. [61] His mother, Jane Lefranc, was a
   native of Cambray, and is reported to have been beautiful, and of a
   strongly religious spirit. Calvin was one of six children, four sons
   and two daughters. One of his sisters, Mary, followed his faith and
   fortunes, and is occasionally mentioned in his letters. Of his
   brothers, the eldest was an ecclesiastic, the fourth died young, and
   the third, also bred an ecclesiastic, ultimately joined the reformer in
   Geneva. The position of the father is the natural explanation of so
   many of his sons entering into the Church. While our reformer was still
   only twelve years of age, his father procured for him a chaplaincy in
   the cathedral church of Noyon, as a means of support during his
   education--a practice not uncommon in the Galilean, as in all the other
   churches of the time.

   Of Calvin's youth and earlier education we have but few particulars. We
   get no hearty glimpses of his home and school-days, as in the case of
   Luther. We only know that, in contrast with the rough and picturesque
   boyhood of the German, he was nurtured tenderly, and even in an
   aristocratic atmosphere. The noble family of Mommor, in the
   neighbourhood, to some extent adopted the boy, and his studies were
   pursued in conjunction with those of the young members of this family.
   Beza narrates his precocity of mental power, and the grave severity of
   his manners, even at this early age. His companions, it is said,
   surnamed him the "Accusative." [62] Having received the rudiments of
   his education in his native town, he went in his fourteenth year to
   Paris, still in the company of the children of the Mommor family. There
   he was entered as a pupil in the College de la Marche, under the
   regency of Mathurin Cordier--a name still familiar to boys entering
   upon their Latin studies, under its classical form of Corderius. It was
   under this distinguished master that Calvin laid the foundation of his
   own wonderful mastery of the Latin language. From the College de la
   Marche he passed to the College Montaigu, where he was initiated into
   the scholastic philosophy under the guidance of a learned Spaniard. In
   his eighteenth year he was appointed to the living of Marteville, and
   this, too, while he had only as yet received the tonsure, and was not
   admitted to holy orders. [63]

   About this time his professional views underwent a change. The law
   appeared to his father somewhat as to Luther's, to offer a more
   tempting worldly prospect than the Church; [64] and he resolved
   accordingly to turn the studies of his son in the direction of the
   former profession. He sent him with this view to the university of
   Orleans, then adorned by Pierre de l'Etoile, one of the most famous
   jurists of his day, and afterwards President of the Parliament of
   Paris. In taking this step, however, Calvin did not resign his Church
   living; and it appears to have been after this time that, by the kind
   patronage of a member of the same family who had hitherto so befriended
   him, he effected the exchange of the living of Marteville for that of
   Pont l'Evêque, where he is said occasionally to have preached. It is a
   singular enough picture of the times which is presented to us by this
   conduct both of Calvin and his father. His justification in the case,
   if any such be needed considering his youth, is the prevalence of the
   practice in an age in which the ecclesiastical office had become too
   frequently a mere material convenience, or transmitted guild.

   Of his life at Orleans we know something more than of his previous life
   at Noyon or Paris, although it is still only very vague glimpses we
   get. Beza has told us, on the authority of some of Calvin's
   fellow-students, that his life was here marked by a rigorous temperance
   and devotion to study that, after supping moderately, he would spend
   half the night in study, and devote the morning to meditation on what
   he had acquired,--thus laying the foundation of his solid learning,
   but, at the same time, of his future ill-health. His talents were
   already so generally recognised, that, in the absence of some of the
   professors, he was called upon to do their duty. It was here that for
   the first time he became acquainted with the Scriptures, in the
   translation of a relative of his own, Pierre Robert Olivetan. Here also
   he formed the friendship of two young men, Francis Daniel, an advocate,
   and Nicholas du Chemin, a schoolmaster, who seem already to have
   imbibed the reformed opinions. His earliest extant letter, in which he
   details the illness and approaching death of his father, and which
   bears the date of 14th May 1528, is addressed to the latter of these
   friends and a brief series of letters, on to the year 1536, is
   addressed to the former. We cannot say as yet that Calvin's
   traditionary opinions were unfixed, still less that he had embraced
   with any decision the Protestant views which were spreading everywhere.
   Beyond doubt, however, the first impulse to the new faith, which was
   soon to seize him and mould his whole sentiments, was imparted at
   Orleans, under the influences and amid the companionships we have
   mentioned.

   From Orleans he went, still in prosecution of his legal studies, to
   Bourges, where for the first time he acquired the knowledge of Greek
   under the tuition of a learned German, Melchior Wolmar, to whom he has
   recorded his obligations. [65] The spiritual impulse received at
   Orleans seems to have been confirmed and promoted by this distinguished
   teacher, to whose piety and admirable abilities Beza, also one of his
   pupils, bears tribute. His convictions became deepened and settled to
   such a degree that he now began openly to preach the reformed
   doctrines. Slowly but surely he passed over to the Protestant ranks, in
   a manner entirely contrasted with that of Luther, even as his mind and
   character were wholly different. We trace no struggling steps of
   dogmatic conviction--no profound spiritual agitations--no crisis, as in
   the case of the German reformer. We only learn that, from being an
   apparently satisfied and devoted adherent of Popery, he adopted, with a
   quiet but steady and zealous faithfulness, the new opinions. He
   himself, indeed, in his preface, when commenting on the Psalms, speaks
   of his conversion being a sudden one; and to his own reflection
   afterwards it may have seemed that the clear light began to dawn upon
   him all at once; but the facts of his life seem rather to show it in
   the light in which we have presented it, as a gradual and consistent
   growth under the influences which surrounded him, first at Orleans and
   then at Bourges.

   In accordance with this new growth of spiritual conviction, he returned
   to the study of theology, or rather took it up for the first time with
   real earnestness. Not only so, but he soon became an instructor and
   authority in the reformed doctrine. "Not a year had passed over," he
   says in the same preface to the Psalms, "when all those who had any
   desire for pure learning came to me, inexperienced as I was, to gain
   information. I was naturally bashful, and loved leisure and privacy,
   hence I sought retirement; but even my solitary place became like a
   public school."

   He proceeded to Paris (1533), which already, under the teaching of
   Lefevre and Farel, and the influence of the Queen of Navarre, the
   sister of Francis I., had become a centre of the reformed faith. The
   university had become strongly infected with the "new learning." There
   was great excitement and rising discontent with the old religion at
   once in the court, among the bishops, [66] and even in the Sorbonne.
   The presence of Calvin, whose great powers had already made him
   extensively known, [67] operated vigorously to increase this
   excitement. One Nicolas Cop, a physician, happened to be rector, and in
   this capacity had to deliver a discourse on the festival of All Saints,
   for the composition of which he is said to have been indebted to
   Calvin. Instead of the usual traditionary orthodoxy on such an
   occasion, the discourse boldly entered upon the subject of religion,
   and advocated the doctrine of justification by faith. The attack was
   too obvious to pass unnoticed; the ancient spirit of the Sorbonne
   revived; and Cop was summoned to answer for the heresy. Aware of his
   peril, he fled to Basle; and Calvin, whose share in the offence became
   speedily known, also fled. There are various stories as to his
   flight--as, for example, that he was let down from his window by means
   of his sheets, and escaped in the habit of a vine-dresser, an
   acquaintance, to whose house he had repaired. Beza simply states that
   when the officers went to seize him, he was not to be found, [68] and
   that the Queen of Navarre subsequently interposed in his behalf.

   Repairing to Noyon after this event, he is now said to have resigned
   his ecclesiastical offices; and henceforth for a year or two he seems
   to have led a wandering life. We find him first at Saintonge, then at
   Nerac, the residence of the Queen of Navarre, where for the first time
   he made the personal acquaintance of Lefevre, who is said to have
   recognised in the pale young student the future apostle of the
   Reformation, in France. Subsequently he spent some time in retirement
   at Angouleme with his friend Louis du Tillet, his letters to whom
   afterwards, when Tillet felt himself impelled to rejoin the Roman
   Church, are among the most interesting of his early correspondence,
   marked as they are by an unusual freedom and affectionateness of
   feeling. It was during this retirement that he is supposed to have made
   the first sketch of his Institutes of the Christian Religion.' Again,
   in 1533, we find him for a brief while at Paris, strangely enough
   expecting a meeting with Servetus, who had expressed a desire to see
   and confer with him. He did not, however, keep his appointment. Not yet
   were they destined to meet,--the stern reformer and the enthusiastic
   speculator! Had they done so now in the warmth of comparative youth,
   and while the dogmatism of both was not yet hardened, we may please
   ourselves with the imagination that their later and darker meeting
   might have been avoided, and a great crime have been spared to the
   progress of the Reformation.

   Persecution now raged fiercely against the adherents of the Reformation
   in France. The agitation of the Anabaptist insurrection in Germany had
   spread across the Rhine, and even into England. There was alarm and
   excitement everywhere. All reformers were confounded as disturbers of
   social order. Calvin felt that he was no longer safe in Paris, nor even
   in France, and he prepared to take refuge at Basle. Previously,
   however, he published at Orleans a treatise against one of the peculiar
   tenets of the Anabaptists, as to the sleep of the soul, under the title
   of Psychopannychia.' This was his second literary labour. Two years
   before, he had first appeared as an author in a commentary on Seneca's
   treatise De Clementia.' What is chiefly remarkable about these works is
   their scholarly and intellectual character. They are, even the treatise
   against the Anabaptists, more like the exercitations of a student than
   the productions of a mind strongly moved by religious reforming zeal.

   Arrived at Basle in 1535, the spirit of the reformer may be said to
   have awakened in him for the first time in full strength. The famous
   preface to the Institutes, it is certain, was written here in this
   year. It bears the date of Basle, August 1, 1535. The concentrated
   vigour of this address--its intensity of feeling rising into indignant
   remonstrance, and at times a pathetic and powerful eloquence--make it
   one of the most memorable documents in connection with the Reformation.
   It shows the vehement desire of Calvin's mind no less than of Luther's
   to exonerate the religious movement from the social excesses that had
   sprung up in its progress--to prove that the latter had in reality no
   connection with the former, whose legitimate tendency was everywhere to
   strengthen the moral stability of society, and to increase dutifulness
   and loyalty in subjects. It is throughout a noble defence of the
   righteous character of the reformed doctrines, and their support alike
   in Scripture and in history. The energetic decisiveness and moral zeal
   of the future teacher and legislator of Geneva speak in every page of
   it.

   A dispute exists as to whether there was any corresponding edition of
   the Institutes in 1535. On the one hand, the presumption is strong that
   there must have been such an edition, and Beza distinctly states that
   the work first appeared in that year; but, on the other hand, all
   research has failed to discover any edition before 1536. Dr Henry's
   conjecture is, that the edition of both the work and preface in the
   earlier year was in French; but this again is contradicted by certain
   expressions in a letter of Calvin to Francis Daniel, of date 15th
   October 1536, which lead us to suppose that he was then busy for the
   first time with the French version of his work. The dispute is not
   really important save in a bibliographical point of view. At this
   period,--whether in 1535 or the beginning of 1536,--Calvin, beyond
   doubt, completed at Basle the first sketch of his great dogmatic
   scheme. Now, before he had entered at all upon his special career as a
   reformer, the great lines of thought were laid down, and the
   principles, both dogmatical and ecclesiastical, enunciated, which were
   to guide and stamp all his labours. He put forth, as it were, the
   charter of the great movement, to which he was destined to give
   theological consistency and moral triumph. He showed himself already
   the master-spirit who was fitted to guide and consolidate the agitated
   elements of religious thought and life around him.

   After this residence at Basle, and completion of the Institutes, Calvin
   made a short visit to Italy, to Renée, the Duchess of Ferrara, of which
   we know very little. He then once more is found at Noyon, settling the
   paternal estate which had fallen to him on the death of his eldest
   brother; and finally bidding it adieu in company with his younger
   brother Anthony and his sister Mary. His attention appears to have been
   to proceed to Strasburg; but the direct way being rendered dangerous by
   the armies of Charles V., which had penetrated into France, he sought a
   circuitous route through Savoy and Geneva.

   He arrived at Geneva late in the summer of 1536. He meant merely to
   sojourn a single night in the city, and then advance on his journey. He
   had no thoughts of anything but of some quiet refuge in which to pursue
   his studies. "I was wholly given up to my own intense thoughts and
   private studies," he afterwards said. But his old friend Tillet, now in
   Geneva, discovered him, and apprised Farel of his discovery. Situated
   as Farel then was, almost alone, with the Reformation but partially
   accomplished, and the elements of disturbance smouldering around him,
   the advent of Calvin seemed to him an interposition of Divine
   Providence. He hastened to see him, and set before him his claims for
   assistance, and the work of God so obviously awaiting him. But Calvin
   was slow to move. He urged his desire to study, and to serve all
   Churches, rather than to attach himself to any one Church in
   particular. He would fain have yielded to the intellectual bias so
   strong in him; the still stronger instinct for practical government
   that lay behind his intellectual devotion, was not yet owned by him. By
   some strange insight, however, Farel penetrated to the higher fitness
   of the young stranger who stood before him, and he ventured, in the
   spirit of that daring enthusiasm which characterised him, to lay the
   curse of God upon him and his studies if he refused his aid to the
   Church in her time of need. This, which seemed to Calvin a divine
   menace, had the desired effect. "It was," he said, "as if God had
   seized me by His awful hand from heaven." He abandoned his intention of
   pursuing his journey, and joined eagerly with Farel in the work of
   reformation.

   In order to understand this work, it is necessary to know something of
   the previous history of Geneva. Without this knowledge it is impossible
   to apprehend, and still more impossible to estimate, the part which
   Calvin now acted. Geneva was nominally a free city of the Empire, but
   had in reality been governed for some centuries by its own bishop,
   associated with a committee of lay assessors, and controlled by the
   general body of the citizens, in whose hands the ultimate power of
   taxation, and of election of the magistrates, and regulation of the
   police, rested. The prince-bishop did not exercise his temporal
   jurisdiction directly, but through an officer called the Vidomme
   (vice-dominus), whose rights had in the fifteenth century become
   hereditary in the dukes of Savoy. These rights appear to have been
   exercised without any considerable attempt at encroachment till the
   beginning of the following century, when Charles III. succeeded to the
   ducal crown (1504). To his ambition the bishop, John, a weak and
   willing tool of the Savoy family, to which he was nearly allied, ceded
   everything; and the result was a tyrannical attempt to destroy the
   liberties of the Genevese. The Assembly of the citizens rose in arms; a
   bitter and sanguinary contest ensued between the Eidgenossen or Patriot
   party on the one side, and the Mamelukes or monarchical party on the
   other side. By the help of the free Helvetian states, particularly
   Berne and Friburg, the Patriots triumphed, the friends of Savoy were
   banished, the Vidommate abolished, and its powers transferred to a
   board of magistrates.

   The conduct of the bishops in this conflict--not only of John, but of
   his successor Peter de la Baume, who to his misgovernment added gross
   personal profligacy--helped greatly, as may be imagined, to shake the
   old hierarchical authority in Geneva; and when, in 1532, Farel first
   made his appearance in the city, he found a party not indisposed to
   join him in his eager and zealous projects of reform. He had a hard
   fight for it, however, and was at first obliged to yield, and leave the
   city for a time; and it was not till August 1535 that he and Viret and
   Froment succeeded in abolishing the mass, and establishing the
   Protestant faith. During the year's interval he had prosecuted his work
   without ceasing, amidst many difficulties, and Calvin's arrival found
   him still struggling with the popish priests in the neighbouring
   villages, and aiming to lay a broader foundation for the Reformed
   Church.

   Calvin was immediately elected Teacher of Theology. In the following
   year he assumed the office of Preacher, which at first apparently he
   had declined, and produced such an impression by his first sermon, that
   it is said multitudes followed him home to testify their enthusiasm. In
   conjunction with Farel, he drew up a confession of faith in twenty-one
   articles, which was submitted to the Council of Two Hundred, the lowest
   of the representative governing boards of the city, [69] and by them
   ordered to be printed, and proclaimed in the cathedral church of St
   Peter's, as binding on the whole body of the citizens. One of the
   articles related to the right of excommunication claimed by the
   ministers; and this, along with the general conduct of Farel and
   Calvin, and the severity with which they reproved the vices of all
   classes of the community, soon awoke a storm of opposition. Calvin,
   however, was firm; he threatened to leave the city unless the powers
   which he supposed necessary to his work were yielded to him; and for
   the present he prevailed.

   A marvellous change, in the course of a short time, was wrought upon
   the outward aspect of Geneva. A gay and pleasure-loving people, devoted
   to music and dancing, the evening wine-shop, and card-playing, found
   themselves suddenly arrested in their usual pastimes. Not only were the
   darker vices of debauchery, which greatly prevailed, punished by severe
   penalties, but the lighter follies and amusements of society were laid
   under imperious ban; all holidays were abolished except Sunday; the
   innocent gaieties of weddings, and the fashionable caprices of dress,
   were made subjects of legislation: a bride was not to adorn herself
   with floating tresses, [70] and her welcome home was not to be noisy
   with feasting and revelry. The convent bells which had rung their sweet
   chimes for ages across the blue waters of the Rhone, and become
   associated with many evening memories of love and song, had been
   previously destroyed and cast into cannon. [71] It was impossible that
   a change so sudden and severe as this could be lasting, all at once. A
   strong opposition, partly composed of political malcontents, and of the
   lovers of a more free and social life, was gradually formed; and after
   various struggles they succeeded in their resistance to the clergy, and
   banished them the city.

   It is difficult to characterise the party which now temporarily
   prevailed against the Calvinistic discipline in Geneva, and finally, in
   a later and memorable struggle, was thwarted and crushed by the
   influence of the great reformer. It has descended to us under the name
   of the Libertines; but this was in reality its nickname, given to it by
   its enemies, and beyond doubt it serves greatly to misrepresent it. The
   Libertines, rightly so called, were a spiritual sect which sprang up in
   the course of the Reformation, a kind of offshoot of Anabaptism. It is
   not pretended by any that the anti-Calvinist party in Geneva were
   mainly, or even to any considerable extent, composed of the adherents
   of this spiritual libertinism, although some of its leaders may have
   shared in certain tenets of the sect, and even been in affiance with
   it. This was probably the position of some of the Favre family,
   afterwards so signally associated with the anti-Calvinist reaction.
   There seems good reason to believe, however, that the main nucleus of
   the party was the Eidgenossen, or band of really liberal patriots, who
   had formerly rescued their native city from a foreign yoke, and who now
   and afterwards were animated, as we shall find, by very strong
   feelings, but by very mixed and indefinite views, in the part which
   they acted.

   On his expulsion from Geneva, Calvin proceeded with Farel to Berne,
   where a series of negotiations were set on foot with a view to the
   conciliation of the Genevese and the return of the reformers.
   Previously, while the disputes were still going on, the Bernese had
   taken a friendly part in them, and it was hoped that by their present
   mediation they might be still accommodated. But their efforts, thwarted
   by the bitter dislike of some of the Bernese ministers to Calvin, and
   by the obstinacy of the Genevese, were fruitless. The decree of
   banishment was confirmed, and the reformers driven to seek some other
   sphere for their labours. Calvin repaired first to Basle, his old place
   of refuge, and then to Strasburg by the invitation of Bucer. Here he
   settled in the end of 1538, and became the pastor of a congregation of
   French refugees, who were exiles, like himself, from their native
   country on account of their faith.

   Here Calvin spent the next three years, amongst the happiest, or at
   least the quietest and most honourable, of his life. At no time does he
   appear more admirable than during those years of exile. His magnanimity
   and single-minded earnestness come out, strongly tempered by a certain
   patience, moderation, and sadness, that we seem to miss elsewhere.
   Relieved from power, he was also relieved from its wounding
   irritations, which were apt to chafe his keen spirit, and we see only
   the simple grandeur, wonderful capacity, and truthful feeling of the
   man. They were years of busy interest and activity, political,
   domestic, and theological.

   We find him engaged in the three great conferences at Frankfort, Worms,
   and Ratisbon, co-operating with Bucer, and counselling with
   Melanchthon. Not less anxious than either for a comprehensive peace
   which should embrace all the Churches, he yet saw, with a clearer eye
   than they did, the difficulties in the way of union. His various
   letters on the subject to Fuel are full of sound wisdom and
   sense--moderate and conciliatory, yet clear-sighted and earnest for the
   truth. We see him farther the centre of a private series of
   negotiations in connection with Caroli, a singular impostor of the
   time, who is strangely mixed up with the history of the Reformation.
   This person had previously rendered himself notorious for his enmity to
   Calvin and Farel, both of whom he had accused of Arianism; and
   afterwards, when he failed to establish his reputation at their
   expense, he had rejoined the Church of Rome. He now sought a
   reconciliation with the reformers, and seems to have imposed upon the
   good-nature of Farel. Calvin, however, was not so easily moved; and his
   letters to Farel, in which he takes him to task for his softness in the
   matter, especially one of 8th October 1539, give a curious
   self-unveiled glimpse of the reformer's vehemence of temper. [72]

   In the midst of these negotiations, public and private, he was induced
   to think of marriage. "I am so much at my ease," he says, in a spirit
   approaching to jocularity," as to have the audacity to think of taking
   a wife." [73] He had, in fact, a year before, written to Farel on the
   subject, and various projects of union were in the meantime set on foot
   by his friends--which, however, came to nothing. The truth is, that he
   was himself but a reluctant suitor, and if it had not been for the
   urgency of Bucer particularly he would probably never have taken any
   step in the matter. "I am none of those insane lovers," he says, "who
   embrace also the vices of those they are in love with, when they are
   smitten at first sight with a fine figure. The beauty that allures me
   in a wife is that she is chaste, not too nice or fastidious,
   economical, patient, and that there is hope she will be interested
   about my health." [74] There is a naïveté amusing, if it were not so
   cold, in the manner in which he narrates to Farel how one matrimonial
   project failed, and another was vigorously taken up by him. "A certain
   damsel of noble rank has been proposed to me, and with a fortune above
   my condition. Two considerations deterred me from that
   connection--because she did not understand our language, and because I
   feared she might be too mindful of her family and education. Her
   brother, a very devout person, urged the connection; his wife also,
   with a like partiality; so that I would have been prevailed to submit
   with a good grace, unless the Lord had otherwise appointed. When I
   replied that I could not engage myself unless the maiden would
   undertake to apply her mind to the learning of our language, she
   requested time for de, liberation. Thereupon, without further parley, I
   sent my brother to escort here another, who, if she answers her repute,
   will bring a dowry large enough without any money at all." [75]

   The person here referred to--undowried, save in character and
   reputation--was Idelette de Bures, the widow of an Anabaptist whom he
   had converted; and to her he was married on the following August
   (1540). We learn but little of her. Calvin never unveils his domestic
   life as Luther does. We never catch the warm firelight of his family
   hearth kindling in any of his letters no touches of playful portraiture
   relieve their gravity; and Idelette de Bures remains, consequently, but
   a dim personality beside Catherine von Bora. All that we know of
   Calvin's wife, however, points to a somewhat elevated, if not very
   interesting character. He himself speaks of her as "a woman of rare
   qualities"; and the account which he has given of her deathbed (their
   union only lasted nine years) is deeply touching in the picture of
   simple affection, and absorbed, if somewhat unmoved, piety, which it
   presents. [76] No breath of unhappiness seems to have rested on a union
   which, if uninspired by passion, was at the same time free from all
   sordidness. She was mother of several children by her previous husband;
   to Calvin she had only one child, whose early loss was a profound grief
   to the reformer. "My wife," he writes to Farel, "sends her best thanks
   for your friendly and holy consolations. The Lord has indeed inflicted
   a grievous and a bitter wound in the death of our little son." [77]

   The most remarkable of his theological labours at this time was his
   elaboration of the Institutes into the extended edition which is
   familiar to us, and which appeared at Strasburg in 1539. There were
   improvements and further extensions in subsequent editions, even to the
   last, issued from the press of Robert Stephens at Geneva in 1559; but
   the work remained substantially the same after this. Among the most
   marked enlargements of the Strasburg edition was the detailed
   exhibition of his ecclesiastical system. His thoughts had been
   naturally turned to this subject by his experience in Geneva; and,
   consistently with the bent of his intellectual character, he was led
   not to modify his views, but to work them out into a more thorough and
   consistent shape. A scarcely less important contribution to theological
   literature was furnished by him, in the same year, in his Commentary on
   St Paul's Epistle to the Romans--the first of that noble series of
   exegetical works which, apart from all other claims to distinction,
   have placed his name in the highest rank of Christian authors.

   In the meantime, during these years the state of things at Geneva had
   greatly altered. After the first outburst of their triumph, and the
   most riotous manifestation of their hostility to the expelled
   reformers, the party of the Libertines soon began to feel the inherent
   weakness springing out of the want of any fixity or determination in
   their principles and aims. Some had sought political, some only
   personal liberty, and not a few had joined in the movement from mere
   negative motives--dislike of Calvin and of the French, and of all
   effective moral or civil restraints. In such a party there were no
   elements of a continued constructive opposition to the ecclesiastical
   rule and discipline which they had overthrown. The hand of authority
   was relaxed, and licence worse than that of the old Catholic times
   returned. Two of the syndics who had taken a lead in the expulsion of
   the ministers perished by a violent death, and two were exiled for the
   miscarriage of some embassy in which they engaged. The new reforming
   clergy were destitute of any ability or energy of character to meet the
   disorders that sprang up on all sides, and left the city a prey to the
   weakness at once of faction and of immorality. In these circumstances
   it is not to be wondered at that the friends of the reformers should
   have gradually gathered something of their former influence, and that
   in the course of two years' experience of an unsettled and disorderly
   civic condition, a very different spirit should have begun to manifest
   itself towards the exiled clergy. The conduct of Calvin, moreover,
   helped greatly to quicken this returning feeling. Although the Genevese
   had driven him with ignominy from their city, he did not cease to
   cherish a warm interest in its welfare; and when Sadolet, bishop of
   Dauphiny--a man of acknowledked merits, who had recently received a
   cardinal's hat from Rome--turned his attention to Geneva, and thought
   to improve the opportunity of its dissensions to the advantage of his
   Church by addressing a letter to the Council and burgesses inviting
   them to return within its bosom, Calvin took up the pen against him,
   and powerfully vindicated the religious interests of his former
   fellow-citizens. The result of all was, that before the end of 1540 the
   Council and new syndics sent a letter to the reformer imploring him to
   return, and reassume his old position of authority, The letter is very
   interesting, as showing the complete revulsion of feeling that had
   occurred in the city, and how naturally all eyes turned to Calvin in
   the circumstances. "On the part," it bears, "of our lesser and greater
   councils (which hereupon have strongly admonished us), we pray you
   earnestly that you would transfer yourself hitherward to us, and return
   to your old place and former ministry; and we hope, with the help of
   God, that this shall be a great benefit, and fruitful for the increase
   of the holy evangel, seeing that our people greatly desire you among
   us, and will conduct themselves towards you in such sort that you shall
   have occasion to rest content." [78]

   Calvin, however, did not return to Geneva till the 13th of September
   1541. He was in no hurry to respond to the call made to him, not from
   any motives of pique or affectation, but from the double reason that he
   could not all at once quit his pastoral engagements at Strasburg, and
   that he needed some evidence of the sincere willingness of the Genevese
   to submit to the re-establishment of the reformed discipline. Convinced
   at length, he embraced their invitation, and re-entered upon his old
   duties. With a steadier comprehension and increased vigour he began
   again the great work of practical reformation which had been rudely
   interrupted three years before, and never henceforth swerved or yielded
   in it.

   We shall afterwards consider at length the merits of Calvin's
   ecclesiastical discipline; but we must here sketch the machinery by
   which he established and worked it, and, to some extent, the character
   of the results which followed it.

   Calvin's general views of Church government, as expounded in the fourth
   book of the Institutes, are sufficiently well known. In no respect,
   perhaps, are they more remarkable than in a certain comprehensiveness
   and catholicity of tone, which to many will appear strangely associated
   with his name. But Calvin was far too enlightened not to recognise the
   grandeur of the Catholic idea which had descended through so many ages:
   this idea had, in truth, for such a mind as his, special attractions,
   and his own system, we shall find, mainly sought to give to the same
   idea a new and higher form. The narrowness and intolerance of his
   ecclesiastical rule did not so much spring out of the general
   principles laid down in the Institutes, as from his special
   interpretation and application of these principles.

   The Calvinistic plan of Church government is represented by doctors and
   pastors, and certain assessors, under the name of Elders. These are
   merely office-bearers for the general Christian community or church,
   which is composed alike of laity and clergy, with no radical or
   hereditary distinction of priesthood. The doctor is the learned
   interpreter of Scripture and teacher of theology. The function of the
   pastor is not merely to preach, but, by the practical administration of
   discipline in conjunction with the elders, to reprove, warn, and
   punish. The civil power is recognised as distinct from the
   ecclesiastical, but as bound to support the latter in carrying out its
   authority in the repression of vice and offences against religion, such
   as idolatry and blasphemy. There is some conception of the right
   general principle here as elsewhere, but in practice it was utterly
   confused and misapplied, and could not help being so in conjunction
   with the notions which then universally prevailed as to the moral
   jurisdiction of the magistrate.

   This mode of Church government expressed itself in two main courts in
   Geneva, as follows:--

   1. There was a college of pastors and doctors under the name of "The
   Venerable Company." This college was composed of all the clergy of the
   State, both those of the city and of the rural parishes, with the
   teachers of theology, and to it belonged the general supervision of
   Church affairs, especially of all connected with the education,
   qualification, and appointment of persons to the ministry. It selected
   and determined, in the first place, as to all candidates, and the
   fitness of their ordination to special charges, and the people were
   finally invited to sanction the nomination, or "if there be any one who
   is aware of aught to object to in the life or doctrine of the person
   nominated, to come and declare it to one of the syndics before the next
   following Sunday, on which day also it may be presented, to the end
   that no one be inducted to the ministry except with the common consent
   of the whole church." A sufficiently fair and seemly order!--the rights
   of authority on the one hand asserted, and the rights of the people on
   the other hand recognised: but there seems to have been no adequate
   provision for a conciliating adjustment of the conflicting rights so
   soon as actual collision should arise. The future difficulties of
   presbytery thus lay concealed in its very origin.

   2. There was a consistorial court of discipline of far more practical
   and living authority than the general college of pastors and doctors.
   This court was constituted by the five pastors of the city parishes and
   twelve elders. These elders were selected from the two representative
   councils of the city--two from the Council of Sixty, and the remainder
   from the Council of Two Hundred. Their nomination lay with the ordinary
   council, in conjunction with the Company. The consistory was thus
   chiefly composed of lay members but the influence of the clergy,
   although, numerically reckoned, it appears small, was in reality
   strongly secured in the mode of appointment of the elders, which was
   annual, besides being so far under the direct control of the clergy.
   The clerical element was comparatively fixed, the lay element varied
   from year to year.

   This consistorial court became the great engine of Calvin's power. He
   is supposed to have by-and-by assumed the permanent presidency of it,
   [79] although this constitutionally belonged to one of the syndics. It
   extended its jurisdiction over all social usages, as well as offences
   against morality and religion. It was a court of practical ethics, in
   the widest sense--the Church in that repressive disciplinary aspect
   which had such a charm for Calvin's mind, and in which it alone seemed
   to him to rise to its right character and use. Its only direct weapon
   of authority was excommunication; but where this proved unavailing or
   inadequate, the culprit was transferred to the council, which inflicted
   on him any measure of civil punishment, even to death.

   The great code [80] of ecclesiastical and moral legislation, which
   guided both the consistory and council, was the production of Calvin:
   It was sworn to by the whole of the people in a great assembly in St
   Peter's, on the 20th of November 1541. It not only laid down general
   rules, but entered with the most rigorous control into all the affairs
   of private life. "From his cradle to his grave," "the Genevese citizen
   was pursued by its inquisitorial eye." [81] Ornaments for the person,
   the shape and length of the hair, the modes of dress, the very number
   of dishes for dinner, [82] were subjected to special regulation.
   Wedding presents are only permitted within limits; and at betrothals,
   marriages, or baptisms, bouquets must not be encircled with gold or
   jewelled with pearls, or other precious stones. "Est défendu de donner
   aus dites fiancailles, nopces, ou baptisailles, des bouquets liés d'or
   ou canetilles, ou garnis de grénats, perles, et autres pierreries."

   The registers of Geneva remain to show with what abundant rigour these
   regulations were carried out. It is a strange and mournful record, with
   ludicrous lights crossing it here and there. A man hearing an ass bray,
   and saying jestingly, "Il chante un beau psaume," is sentenced to
   temporary banishment from the city. A young girl in church singing the
   words of a song to a psalm-tune is ordered to be whipped by her
   parents. Three children are punished because, during the sermon,
   instead of going to church, they remained outside to eat cakes. A man,
   for swearing by the "body and blood of Christ," is condemned to be
   fined, and to sit in the public square in the stocks. Light reading, in
   the shape of Amadis de Gaul'--as dear to the lovers of romance then as
   the treasures of, the circulating library are to the modern reader--is
   peremptorily forbidden, and the book ordered to be destroyed. [83] And
   there are darker colours far in the picture, at which we shrink as
   their shadow still falls across three centuries upon us. A child for
   having struck her parents was beheaded in 1568. Another lad of sixteen,
   for having only threatened to strike his mother, was condemned to
   death. [84] If we think of what even mothers, alas! sometimes are, and
   how temporary and trivial are often the worst of such domestic
   collisions--momentary bursts of childish passion without moral instinct
   of any kind--it makes one's blood run chill to think of an arbitrary
   death inflicted for such offences.

   A system of such a character could only maintain itself on an absolute
   divine right--a right nowhere, indeed, formally set forth by Calvin,
   yet distinctly asserted in all the spirit and practice of his
   ecclesiastical legislation. The consistorial discipline, for example,
   when the Favres begin to rebel against it, is declared to be "the yoke
   of Christ." [85] The ordinances and laws of Geneva, and the whole
   system of polity of which Calvin himself remained the centre, is
   carried back to Scripture, and presumed to rest upon express divine
   command. This was the only valid plea and justification of a system
   which applied itself in such a direct and authoritative manner to the
   regulation of human life. It could only stand as a special embodiment
   of the divine will--as a declared Theocracy.

   Henceforth Calvin's life in Geneva does not present any very varied
   course of incident. It is mainly a succession of earnest labours in
   defence of the truth, and of earnest struggles against its enemies. His
   activity was indefatigable, and his keen spirit knew scarcely what it
   was to rest day by day. His ordinary duties are thus described by
   Beza:--"During the week, he preached every alternate and lectured every
   third day; on Thursday he met with the presbytery, and on Friday
   attended the ordinary Scripture meeting called the congregation,' where
   he had his full share of the duty." His Commentaries, on which he now
   continued to work regularly, and his unceasing correspondence, filled
   up a measure of industry which we contemplate with astonishment. No man
   certainly was ever less self-indulgent; and if he was severe in his
   exactions from others, he was no less unsparing with himself. Viret
   continued temporarily associated with him at Geneva; but he was soon
   left to bear the main burden of ecclesiastical rule himself, as his
   permanent colleagues enjoyed comparatively little esteem.

   More than anything else, the subsequent tenor of the reformer's life is
   marked by the successive controversies in which he was engaged. Caroli
   again appears for a brief space upon the scene, but disappears finally
   in deserved obscurity and disgrace--closing a life of scandalous
   imposture by a death of infamy in a Roman hospital. Then in succession
   the names of Pighius, Castellio, Bolsec, and, farther on, Westphal and
   Heshusius, besides the well-known names of Servetus and Amy Perrin at
   the head of the Libertines, are among the most prominent that mark the
   controversial epochs into which his history now runs. We shall, as we
   advance, glance slightly at the successive points of interest and
   conflict which these names suggest, in one or two instances touching
   only in the most cursory way on what by itself might lead into wide
   discussion.

   Pighius was a zealous Papist of the Cologne school, a pupil of Adrian,
   and tutor of Charles V. He published, about the time Calvin returned to
   Geneva, an elaborate treatise on the old subject of Free Will and
   Predestination, in opposition to the views of the reformers. Calvin, as
   soon as the pressure of his labours permitted, replied in a volume
   which he dedicated to Melanchthon. He discusses the arguments of
   Pighius in detail, and vindicates the reasoning of Luther, while he
   admits the hyperbolical character of his language in certain cases.
   What is particularly remarkable is his generous appreciation of
   Luther's character and talents, as indeed this appears elsewhere in his
   Letters. [86] So far as the merits of the controversy are concerned, it
   cannot be said that he is any more successful than the German reformer.
   He is here and everywhere more simple and cautious in his statements,
   but his cold reiterations and evasions really no more touch the obvious
   difficulties than Luther's heated paradoxes. A point of interest
   connected with the dispute is the tradition that Calvin's work was
   successful in converting Pighius to predestinarian views. This seems to
   rest on so slender a foundation, however, that it is contended, on the
   other hand, that Pighius was dead before Calvin's work appeared. He is
   said to have died in December 1542, while the reply of the reformer was
   not published till the following year. Calvin himself says somewhat
   summarily that "Pighius died a little after my book was published,
   wherefore, not to insult a dead dog, I applied myself to other
   lucubrations."

   The dispute with Sebastian Castellio was of a more painful and
   prolonged character. Calvin had become acquainted with Castellio at
   Strasburg. They seem at first to have warmly attracted one another, and
   Calvin was beyond all doubt for some time very zealous in his
   friendliness to the poor scholar, whose ingenious spirit and classical
   acquirements had won his regard. On his return to Geneva he invited him
   thither, and procured for him the appointment of regent or tutor in the
   gymnasium of the city. In reality, however, there were but few points
   of sympathy between the two men. Castellio's learning was intensely
   humanistic; his classical tastes and somewhat arbitrary criticism
   moulded all that he did; and, especially as he aspired to be a
   theologian, and to carry this spirit into his Scriptural studies, he
   soon came into conflict with Calvin. The first indications of
   disagreement between them are to be found in a letter of Calvin's to
   Farel in September 1542, in which he speaks of the freaks of "our
   friend Sebastian, which may both raise your bile and your laughter at
   the same time." [87] These freaks relate to Castellio's notions of
   Scriptural translation, and his refusal of Calvin's offer to revise his
   version, while offering to come and read it to him. Then subsequently,
   in February 1544, there appears in a further letter to Farel, and in
   the Council Registers, evidence that Castellio had desired to enter
   into the ministry, but that Calvin had advised the Council that this
   was not expedient, on account of some peculiar opinions which he held.
   These were certain rationalistic views as to the authenticity and
   character of the Song of Solomon, the descent of Christ into hell, and
   also about election. Still at this date Calvin speaks kindly of him,
   and recommends him strongly to the patronage of Farel. He seems to have
   left Geneva at this time for Lausanne, but to have returned shortly;
   and, irritated probably by disappointment, he now vehemently attacked
   Calvin. After a violent scene in church, which is painted, perhaps,
   with some exaggeration by the reformer, [88] he was forced to leave the
   city. The two old friends, now declared enemies, did not spare each
   other henceforth. Castellio retired to Basle, and among his other
   employments busied himself with the free criticism of the Calvinistic
   doctrines; and particularly, nearly ten years after this, a tract
   appeared on the death of Servetus and the subject of toleration, which
   was at once imputed to him by Calvin and Beza. Both replied in no
   measured terms. Later still, an anonymous publication, attacking with
   keen logic and covert and ingenious sarcasm the Genevan theology, was
   supposed to proceed from his pen; and the reformers, in their answer in
   the preface to their version of the New Testament, stigmatise him as a
   "deceiver and vessel of Satan." It is but a melancholy spectacle of
   polemical hatred on both sides; but the truculence of the theologians,
   it must be confessed, bears off the palm. Castellio was no match for
   them in strength of argument or firm consistency of purpose. He lived
   on in great poverty at Basle, cultivating his garden with his own
   hands, and without the means of keeping himself warm, as he sat up at
   night to finish his translation of the Scriptures. He died in want, in
   1563, the same year as Calvin; and Montaigne [89] has given vent to his
   expressions of shame for his age, that one so distinguished should have
   been left to die so miserably. Regretful and touching memories linger
   around his blameless scholarly life, pinching poverty, and sad death,
   and especially the incident of his gathering from the banks of the
   Rhine pieces of drift-wood for fuel. The incident is painful in its
   associations as well as affecting in its simplicity. Calvin and Beza
   did not hesitate to circulate against him the calumnious charge that he
   had stolen the wood--a fact sufficient to prove the disgraceful spirit
   in which these controversies were conducted, and how deservedly they
   are consigned to oblivion.

   The controversy with Bolsec carries us on to 1551, and, both in its
   special object and in the character of the man, presents a marked
   contrast to the preceding. Bolsec was originally a Carmelite monk, but
   he had thrown aside the habit and betaken himself to the practice of
   medicine. He came to Geneva in the above year, and settled as a
   physician. There is no reason to doubt the integrity of his character,
   although Beza has thrown out insinuations against it. What were his
   previous relations to Calvin we are not informed, but he began to
   question his great doctrine of predestination. He made it the subject
   of discussion and attack among his friends. This no sooner reached
   Calvin's ears than he called him to account; summoned him first to a
   private interview, then before the consistory, and made him understand
   that he was not at liberty to question the Genevan doctrine. In a
   letter to Cristopher Libertet, Calvin has given a description of the
   manner in which Bolsec sought to vindicate himself, and how he was
   dealt with by him and the other clergy. The picture is not a very
   amiable one, and the poor heretic excites our sympathy even in the
   narrative of his great adversary. "He was called before our Assembly,
   when, in spite of his cavils, I dragged him from his hiding-place into
   the light. Besides the fifteen ministers, other competent witnesses
   were present; and all know that, if he had had a single drop of
   modesty, he would have been immediately convicted. At first he used
   trifling and puerile cavils; but being more closely pressed he threw
   aside all shame. Sometimes he denied what he had twice or thrice
   conceded, and then admitted what he had questioned; he not only
   vacillated, but entirely abandoned his principles, and kept working in
   the same circle without measure or aid." [90] No wonder! To be baited
   by fifteen ministers, with Calvin at their head, must have been more
   than enough to disturb the consistency and weaken the resolution even
   of the boldest heretic. The matter did not end here. On the occasion of
   a sermon in St Peter's on the subject of predestination, Bolsec was so
   foolish as to step forth and take up the argument against the preacher,
   a certain John de St André. Calvin had entered the church unobserved
   during Bolsec's address, and suddenly presenting himself before the
   heretic, overwhelmed him with quotations from Scripture, and Augustine
   Farel joined in the discussion, and the police terminated it by
   apprehending Bolsec for abuse of the clergy and disturbance of the
   public peace. It became a somewhat serious question how to deal with so
   daring an offender. Negotiations were entered into with the Bernese and
   French ministers on the subject, the moderation of whose counsels does
   not seem to have been particularly pleasing to the reformer. It has
   been insinuated, but on a very slender foundation, that he would not
   have been disinclined to proceed to the last extremity against one so
   hardened. There was no warrant, however, for any extreme procedure. The
   churches all advised moderation in the view of the abstruseness and
   darkness of the subject of controversy; and Bolsec was merely sentenced
   to banishment from the city whose doctrinal quietude he had disturbed.
   He afterwards revenged himself, in a somewhat dastardly way, by writing
   a life of Calvin in a spirit of slanderous detraction, which
   effectually destroys all sympathy with him, or interest in his
   sufferings.

   The Sacramentarian controversies with Westphal and Heshusius extend to
   the very close of Calvin's life. No feature in the internal history of
   the Reformation is at once more painful and perplexing than that which
   is unfolded in these controversies: the subtlety, and in truth
   unintelligibility, of the distinctions contended for, the sacredness of
   the topic, and the fierce violence of the contention, all make a
   picture which even the polemic theologian of modern times can scarcely
   delight to contemplate, and which is apt to inspire the historical
   student with mere weariness and disgust. We have already in our former
   sketch seen with what vehemence Luther maintained his ground on this
   subject against the Swiss divines at Marburg. He never got reconciled
   to them, and to the last his language was that of uncompromising and
   disrespectful opposition to their supposed doctrine. Melanchthon, on
   the other hand, so soon as he was brought into personal contact with
   Calvin, especially at the Diet of Ratisbon, began to incline to his
   opinion of the Eucharist, which, denying the reality of a local
   presence as asserted by the Lutherans, maintained the reality of a
   spiritual presence in the elements, and a true participation of the
   very body and blood of Christ by the faithful. Through the influence of
   Calvin mainly, an agreement or "consensus" of sacramental doctrine was
   established at Zurich in the close of 1549. It was fondly hoped that
   the result of this might be to promote a general harmony on the
   subject, not only in all the reformed Churches, but, moreover, between
   them and the Lutheran Church; or at least to open up the way for such a
   comprehensive union. Never was hope more utterly disappointed. The
   abated zeal of Luther, as the sadness of those last years was fast
   bearing him to the grave, had no beneficial effect upon some of his
   followers. They took up the controversy with increased bitterness and a
   yet more narrow intolerance. Without the excuse of those traditionary
   associations which clung to his great mind, and from which he could
   never set himself free, the men, such as Flacius and Osiander, and
   Westphal and Heshusius, who embraced what they supposed to be the
   strict type of Lutheran doctrine, showed a polemical spirit equally
   violent and mean, which at once hardened the excesses of the reformer's
   dogmatism, and covered it with the contempt of their own weakness.
   There is not anywhere in theological history a set of men more factious
   in temper, less amiable in character, or even less respectable in
   strength, than the Lutheran divines who now occupy the field, and
   darken and confuse it with their controversial din. Well might
   Melanchthon say that "he lived as in a wasp's nest," and pray to be
   delivered from the "rabies theologorum." They embittered his last
   moments by their furious and unmeaning contests, and made him sigh for
   a rest above, undisturbed by controversial clamour. Well might Calvin
   say, "Ah, would that Luther were still alive! These people have none of
   his virtues, but they think to prove themselves his disciples by their
   cries."

   Westphal, a pastor at Hamburg, takes his rank among most violent of
   these Lutheran divines. In the hands of this man the sacramental
   "concordat" of Zurich became a nucleus of more embittered controversy
   than ever. Instead of "being softened to concord" [91] "by that
   temperate simplicity of doctrine, he seized upon the very name of
   agreement as a kind of furies' torch to rekindle the flame"--a flame
   which continued to burn in the Lutheran Church till it ate all the
   heart of Christian life out of it, and which, by the antagonistic
   spirit. it provoked, became a source of weakness and disgrace to the
   Protestant cause in genera1. [92] Calvin first of all replied with some
   mildness to this "foolish fellow," refusing to name him, or to enter
   into personal conflict with him. But when, instead of being silenced,
   "he flamed forth with much greater impetuosity," it became necessary,
   he says, "to repress his insolence"; and he wrote and published with
   incredible haste, in 1556, his "Second Defence of the Sacraments, in
   Answer to the Calumnies of Westphal." The heat and rapidity with which
   he composed this treatise may be held in some degree to excuse the
   vehemence of its expressions, as he himself urges to Bullinger.
   Moreover, the conduct of Westphal in his cruel treatment of John
   A'Lasco and a company of reformed brethren, who, having been driven
   from England on the accession of Mary, sought refuge in Denmark, had
   justly kindled the keen sensitiveness and warm feelings which Calvin
   ever showed towards the oppressed. Yet, making every allowance, it must
   be admitted that here, as too often, Calvin "answered a fool according
   to his folly." Invective, Contempt, and scorn he pours upon him as from
   a full vial, overwhelming him at once with logic and abuse. "If I have
   used in some cases too strong expressions," he says in the preface
   addressed to "all honest ministers of Christ," "you must consider,
   according to your wisdom, how he has goaded me to this. His book
   appears written with no other object than that of casting us down to
   hell, and overwhelming us with curses. What could I do otherwise than
   act according to the proverb, the bad ass must have a bad driver,' to
   prevent him indulging too complacently in his savage temper?" Westphal
   retorted, complaining that Calvin had treated him worse than the
   Anabaptists, Libertines, and Papists; and Calvin replied in a "last
   admonition to Joachim Westphal."

   In the meantime, many still smaller names had entered the
   field--"petulant, dishonest, and rabid men, as if they had conspired
   together" to make the reformer "the special object of their
   virulence"--"a foul apostate of the name of Staphylus," one named
   Nicolas le Coq, and lastly, Tilleman Heshusius; and finally, in one
   more publication, [93] on the "True Partaking of the Flesh and Blood of
   Christ," the reformer made a rejoinder to these attacks. His old
   strength is not abated, but there is mingling with traces of the former
   violence a nobler spirit of aspiration for peace from the weary
   contentions which now, in 1560, were fast wearing him out. This gathers
   around the name of Melanchthon, just departed, in an affectionate and
   touching appeal, wherein we can read a depth of tender warmth amid all
   his proud and flaming zeal. "O Philip Melanchthon, for I appeal to thee
   who art now living in the bosom of God, where thou waitest for us till
   we be gathered together with thee to a holy rest! A hundred times halt
   thou said, when, wearied with labour and oppressed with sadness, thou
   didst lay thyself familiarly on my breast, Would that I could die on
   this breast!' Since then I have a thousand times wished that it had
   been our lot to be together."

   Well might Calvin be weary of controversy! And yet we have still to
   notice the two most memorable struggles in which he was engaged--viz.,
   his final contest with the Libertines, with Amy Perrin at their head,
   and the sad affair of Servetus.

   The renewed contest with the Libertines was protracted during a long
   period, and was beyond doubt the central contest of Calvin's
   existence--waged hand to hand, and for life or death, through many
   strange turns and changes. It did not terminate till about two years
   after the death of Servetus, and this latter event is in some degree
   mixed up with it; but it will be more convenient to complete our view
   of it, before passing to consider the circumstances connected with the
   trial and execution of Servetus. It is only its most general outline
   that we can trace; and indeed, amid the confusion in which, to some
   extent, the subject has been left by all the historians of Geneva, as
   well as the biographers of Calvin, it is not easy to describe the
   various influences under which it was so long prolonged, now in
   Calvin's favour, and now in favour of his opponents, while yet
   terminating in what appears a contemptible émeute, leaving Calvin
   victor of the field.

   Amy Perrin had at first been a friend of Calvin--one of those who
   solicited his return, and to whom, in conjunction with the reformer,
   had been committed the preparation of the ecclesiastical ordinances.
   Ambitious himself, however, and united to a family both the male and
   female members of which seem to have cherished a natural dislike to the
   reformer, he soon began to chafe under the pride and rigour of the
   Calvinistic rule, and gradually attached himself to the mixed liberal
   party, whose principle of fusion was mainly hostility to Calvin.
   Personal causes served to embitter the animosity--scandals too dark and
   wretched for us to rake from their forgotten hiding-places. The picture
   which the reformer has drawn of the whole Favre family in his letters
   is coloured with a grim harshness, and vivid with touches of the most
   biting sarcasm. The intensity of his temper--sparing no folly, and
   exposing with a kind of zest all the details of their disgrace--comes
   out strongly. He fixes their several features by some ludicrous or
   opprobrious epithet, concentrating at once his scorn and their
   absurdity or baseness. Speaking, for example, of a marriage in the
   family, which had been conducted, in his view, with a flagrant mockery
   of religion, and the consequences of which were deservedly humiliating,
   he writes to Viret: [94] "Proserpine [supposed to be wife of Francis
   Favre, the head of the family], the day before they received the spouse
   with such honours, beat the mother-in-law in such a manner that she
   bled profusely; her whole countenance was disfigured with wounds, and
   her head covered with dirt. You know the old woman's temper; she was
   heard through the whole street calling on God and man to assist her. We
   cited her before the consistory, but she escaped to her sisters:
   Penthesilea [Perrin's wife] will certainly have to be reprimanded
   stoutly; she patronises the worst causes and defends herself furiously
   in short, her every word and deed betray her utter want of modesty."
   Another marriage at the house of a widow was celebrated with dancing,
   at which the same Penthesilea had distinguished herself, and the
   opportunity of reprimanding her could not be passed over. She seems,
   however, to have been almost a match for Calvin, for, according to his
   own confession, she "abused him roundly," while he answered her as she
   deserved. "I inquired," he continues "whether their house was
   inviolably sacred--whether it owed no subjection to the laws? We
   already detained her father in prison, being convicted of one act of
   adultery; the proof of a second was close at hand; there was a strong
   report of a third; her brother had openly contemned and derided the
   Senate and us. Finally, I added, that if they were not content to
   submit to us here under the yoke of Christ, they must build another
   city for themselves, for that so long as they remained at Geneva, they
   would strive in vain to elude the laws, and that if each person's head
   in the house of Favre wore a diadem, it should not prevent the Lord
   from being superior." [95]

   All this occurred at an early period of the struggle in 1546. The
   execution, in the year following, of Gruet, a leader among the
   spiritual Libertines, whose opinions are represented as of an impious
   and flagrant character, increased the bitterness of the factions.
   Calvin stretched his power to the utmost. Slashed breeches, in which
   the young Libertines had delighted as a symbol of their party, were
   prohibited--"not that we cared about the thing itself," he says, "but
   because we saw that, through the chinks of those breeches, a door would
   be opened to all sorts of profusion and luxury." The Libertines in
   their turn carried their licence to the extent of publicly insulting
   Calvin, and threatening to cast him into the Rhone. He professed to
   laugh at their threats as only "the froth of the pride of Moab, whose
   ferocity must at length fall with a crash." Things continued in this
   state through various alternations, Perrin being now imprisoned, with
   his wife and father-in-law, and now again, through a change of fortune,
   not only elevated to the magistracy, but made chief syndic. This took
   place in 1549, and Calvin ridicules unsparingly his attempts at
   statesmanship, calling him now the "Comic Cæsar," and now the "Tragic
   Cæsar."

   The execution of Servetus in 1553 gradually drew the contest on to a
   dénouement. The deep feeling which in various quarters was excited by
   this event, and the vehemence with which it was directed against
   Calvin, seemed to encourage the Libertine party to action. One
   Berthelier tried to wrest from the consistory its right of
   excommunication, and to force admission to the Lord's Supper, from
   which he had been excluded. But Calvin's firmness baffled him, and even
   awed Perrin. In the beginning of 1554 there was a sudden truce, and
   things assumed a quieter look. But there was no sincerity of
   reconciliation on either side, and the contention soon broke out more
   fiercely than ever. Calvin's power seemed to totter in his hands. He
   wrote to an old friend, whose name is not given, "If you knew but a
   tenth part of the abuse with which I am wounded, feelings of humanity
   would make you groan at sufferings to which I am myself grown callous.
   Dogs bark at me on all sides." At length, in 1555, the crisis came--a
   confused and disorderly affair, the account of which reads more like a
   street riot than anything else. Perrin, with his fellow-leaders
   Berthelier and Peter Vandel, had probably planned a regular rising of
   the populace, which. was to be directed against the French in the city,
   for the cries heard in the tumult took something of this shape. Their
   own confusion, however, or the apathy of the citizens, converted it
   into a ridiculous failure. They then tried to make light of the affair,
   but the Council of Two Hundred assembled and took a very different view
   of it; and, apprehensive for their safety, the agitators fled from the
   city. Sentence was pronounced against them in absence. They were
   condemned to lose their heads and be quartered, and special tortures
   were to be inflicted on Perrin. The sentence was executed in effigy;
   and the city permanently delivered from commotion.

   Thus terminated the long struggle with the Libertines, in which,
   whatever be our judgment of particular points of Calvin's conduct, we
   must admire his heroism, and moreover rejoice in his triumph. For it
   was undoubtedly the triumph of moral order against a liberalism which,
   resting on no basis of principle, and conserved by no bonds of moral
   feeling, must have speedily dissolved in its own success, and left
   Geneva a sure prey to internal factions and weakness. As it was, Geneva
   became, strange as it may seem, the stern cradle of liberty, an asylum
   of Protestant independence against the gathering storms of despotism on
   all sides. Freedom of thought and action were crushed for the time
   under an iron sway, but in behalf of a moral spirit which, nursed by
   such rough discipline, was to grow into potency till it became more
   than a match for Jesuitical state-craft in many lands, and, from the
   very limitations of its infancy, only expanded into higher and
   healthier forms of development.

   In the meantime, it must be confessed, as we turn to gaze upon the
   picture presented to us in the trial and death of Servetus, it is
   difficult to trace the germs of liberty in the Genevan theocracy. We
   shall not attempt to enter into the endless polemics that surround this
   affair. The main facts are palpable, and not only not denied, but
   gloried in by Calvin and the other reformers--for they all share almost
   equally with him the undying disgrace which, under all explanations,
   must for ever attach to the event. The wise Bullinger defended it, [96]
   and even the gentle Melanchthon could only see cause for gratitude in
   the hideous tragedy. The special blame of Calvin in the whole matter is
   very much dependent upon the view we take of his previous relation to
   the accusation and trial of Servetus by the Inquisition at Vienne. If
   the evidence, of which Dyer has made the most, were perfectly
   conclusive, that the reformer, through a creature of his own of the
   name of Trie, was really the instigator from the beginning of the
   proceedings against Servetus--that from Geneva, in short, he schemed
   with deep-laid purpose the ruin of the latter, who was then quietly
   prosecuting his profession at Vienne--and, from MSS. that had privately
   come into his possession, furnished the Inquisition with evidence of
   the heretic's opinions,--if we were compelled to believe all this, then
   the atrocity of Calvin's conduct would stand unrelieved by the sympathy
   of his fellow-reformers, and would not only not admit of defence, but
   would present one of the blackest pictures of treachery that even the
   history of religion discloses. The evidence is not satisfactory,
   although there are admitted facts which raise suspicion. There can be
   no doubt that Calvin was so far privy through Trie to the proceedings
   of the Inquisition, and that he heartily approved of them. Nor is there
   further any reason to doubt that he contemplated from the first the
   death of Servetus as a stern necessity, should he ever come to Geneva,
   as he had offered to do. In the well-known letter on the subject, which
   is not printed in Beza's collection, but has since been published, he
   tells Farel that he was unwilling that Servetus should trust to
   him--for he adds, "If he should come, and my authority be of any avail,
   I will never suffer him to depart alive." [97]

   Having escaped from Vienne, [98] before the completion of his trial,
   about the 7th of April, Servetus is found in Geneva about four months
   later. His intention appears to have been to proceed to Italy, although
   Calvin represents him as having come from Italy--a fact which he
   himself denied in the course of his examination. In any case, it seems
   to have been something like infatuation on the part of the heretic to
   put himself in the way of Calvin, of whose disposition towards him he
   could scarcely be ignorant. The reformer seemed to recognise a sort of
   judicial blindness in his conduct. "I know not what to say of him," he
   remarked, "except that he was seized by a fatal madness to precipitate
   himself on destruction."

   It is a deeply pathetic picture, as we look back and try to realise
   it,--that of the homeless and persecuted man entering the theocratic
   city on foot and alone in the middle summer of 1553, taking up his
   residence in a small inn by the side of the lake, and entering into
   frank and humorous talk with his host--more like a man of the world
   than a speculative enthusiast; and finally, after he had dined,
   wandering into the church where his great adversary was preaching,--a
   fatal audacity which led to his discovery. Some one recognised and
   immediately reported the fact to Calvin; and just as the wanderer had
   made his arrangements to leave for Zurich, and hired a boat to carry
   him across the lake, he was arrested and conveyed to prison. [99]
   Calvin takes to himself all the merit of this step, and the character
   and circumstances of the trial were mainly arranged by him.

   The particulars are full of interest. At first a young man, [100]
   Calvin's secretary, undertook the office of accuser, and prepared an
   indictment against him of thirty-eight articles, enumerating various
   forms of heresy and of insulting offences against the reformers, and
   especially Calvin. It was found that the young champion of orthodoxy
   was no match for the veteran polemic who had vexed his brain so long
   with every species of theological subtlety; and Calvin himself and the
   other clergy then entered the lists personally against him. Encouraged
   probably by some feeling that there was a party in Geneva prepared to
   back him, Servetus gave way at first to great insolence of manner, and
   dared his adversaries in a very contemptuous way. In reference to some
   charge about contradicting Moses' account of the Holy Land in his notes
   on Ptolemy, which he considered very paltry, he wiped his mouth and
   said, "Let us go on,"--a proceeding which deeply offended Calvin. The
   most violent and abusive language was used on both sides. Servetus
   addressed the reformer as a "pitiful wretch," a "disciple of Simon
   Magus," a "liar," and even a "murderer." Calvin retorted on him as an
   "obscene dog" and "perfidious villain," and publicly devoted him to
   eternal fire. The trial, nevertheless, proceeded in a regular and
   formal manner, on through August and September. The advice of the
   churches of Zurich and Berne was asked, while the unhappy prisoner,
   complaining bitterly of the hardships of his confinement, [101] begged
   to have his case appealed from the ordinary Council to that of the Two
   Hundred. In this Amy Perrin supported him, more with the view of
   turning the event to his own advantage against Calvin than from any
   pity to the heretic. There is no evidence that the reformer urged the
   Council to any summary violence, or that his influence swayed with
   them, especially in the judgment to which they came. They seem to have
   taken the course of proceedings very much into their own hands. But
   there is just as little doubt of the conclusion to which Calvin's
   advice and movements pointed all along, and--confirmed in their own
   feelings by his authority and that of Bullinger, Farel, and
   others--they passed sentence on Servetus on the 26th of October,
   condemning him to death by fire. To do Calvin justice, he appears to
   have used his exertions to have the mode of the heretic's death
   alleviated, but without success.

   On the very next morning after the sentence was pronounced, Servetus
   was led out of the city to his dreadful doom. The spot where he
   suffered is an extended eminence of the name of Champel--about two
   miles off,--from which the eye can trace the encircling ridges of the
   Jura as they rise like frowning battlements around the scene, and the
   clear windings of the Arve as it pours its "snow-grey" waters into the
   bright azure stream of the Rhone. There the wretched man was fastened
   to a stake surrounded by heaps of oak wood and leaves, with his
   condemned book and the MS. he had sent to Calvin attached to his
   girdle; and while with choked utterance he could only say, "Oh God! oh
   God!" the fire was kindled. The wood was green, and did not burn
   readily. Some persons ran and fetched dry fagots, while his piercing
   shrieks rent the air, and--exclaiming finally (in words which, with a
   strange perversity, have been supposed to indicate his persistence in
   his heresy to the last), "Jesus, thou Son of the eternal God, have
   mercy upon me!"--he passed from the doom of earth to a higher and
   fairer tribunal.

   It is needless to indulge in reflective commonplace on this memorable
   crime. To the reformers, on the principles they avowed and advocated,
   it scarcely needed any apology. To us, looking back upon it from this
   point of time, it can receive no palliation, and they are but poor and
   unfaithful sons of Protestantism who have sought for a moment to defend
   it. Whatever apology it may admit of from the spirit of the age, and
   the supposed (blasphemous) character of the charge, it can admit of no
   apology on any intelligibly Protestant ground. In so far as the
   reformers were concerned in it, they were simply untrue to their own
   position, and ignorant of their own only rational weapon of defence. To
   the benefit of this inconsistency and ignorance they are entitled, but
   to nothing more. The act must bear its own doom and disgrace for ever;
   and if it stirs the heart more with pity for the long darkness of human
   mistake than with indignation for the harshness of human cruelty, it
   yet remains a mournful and unhappy blot upon the history of the
   Reformation.

   Ater the expulsion of the Libertines in 1555, Calvin's power in Geneva
   was thoroughly consolidated. He had still his controversies with
   Westphal and others, but the life-and-death struggle at his door had
   ceased, and none any more sought to question his supremacy as the
   master-spirit and governor of the city. Beza--a lively, meddlesome,
   serviceable, but by no means great man--became his active coadjutor in
   the last years of his life, and in his faithful reverence for his
   master's traditions, and ardent and affectionate admiration of his
   genius, was a man after Calvin's own heart. The great struggle that was
   proceeding in France during these years, between the hierarchical
   party, with the Guises at their head, and the Protestants led by Condé
   and Coligny, deeply interested both. In the somewhat unintelligible
   conspiracy of Amboise in 1560, the aim of which was to wrest the power
   from the hands of the Guises and bring them to trial, Calvin was
   supposed to have been implicated. He has himself confessed that he knew
   about it, but that he disapproved of it, and did all he could to hinder
   its execution. This is a more likely version of the fact, for Calvin's
   political opinions were never of an active and violent character. He
   had no love for political revolution of any kind, and was not likely to
   have advised it.

   About 1561, Calvin's long-continued bad health greatly increased.
   Abstemious to an unnatural degree, and overwrought by his many labours,
   he was, towards the close of this year, seized with gout. Unable to
   walk, he was transported to church in a chair to continue his
   preaching, from which he would not desist. His sufferings became
   aggravated during the next three years. Not one but numerous disorders,
   bred by his unhealthy habits of study, laid waste his frame. On the 6th
   of February 1564 he preached his last sermon. He was henceforth only
   able, when carried occasionally to church, to say a few words to the
   people. He is said to have been very uncomplaining,--only the cry would
   sometimes come from him, "How long, O Lord?" On the 2d April,
   Easter-day, he was for the last time carried to church, and received
   the sacrament from the hands of Beza; but after this was still able to
   address a long discourse to the members of the Council who came to his
   house. On the 28th he received the clergy, and boldly encouraged them
   to persevere in the great work which he had begun. Farel, himself
   tottering to the grave, came from Neufchatel to visit him, [102] and
   the old fellow-labourers, after one more conference, parted, only to
   meet in a less disturbed state of existence. He lingered on during May,
   and had even another meeting of the clergy in his house. Then on the
   27th of the month, as summer was flushing over those bright scenes
   amidst which he had lived untouched by their beauty, he peacefully fell
   asleep. Beza had quitted him only for a moment, and on his return the
   reformer lay calm in death. "At the same time with the setting sun,"
   says his admiring friend, "was this great luminary withdrawn."

   He was buried without ostentation, but amidst the profound regret of
   the citizens, in the common cemetery of Plein Palais outside of the
   city, on the banks of the Rhone. He had especially enjoined that no
   monument should mark his resting-place. His severe simplicity turned
   away from all such honours. His biographerHenry. accordingly says that
   his grave continues unknown. In point of fact, however, a plain stone,
   with the letters "J. C." upon it, is now pointed out to the stranger as
   marking it, although on what authority we do not know. Whether his
   remains lie in that particular spot or elsewhere, the simple and rude
   stone, as the meditative visitant stands beside it and looks round upon
   many imposing tablets raised over comparatively unmemorable dust, seems
   no unfitting memorial of the man--starting by its very nakedness
   associations all the more sublime.

   Thus lived and died Calvin, a great, intense, and energetic character,
   who, more than any other of that great age, has left his impress' upon
   the history of Protestantism. Nothing, perhaps, more strikes us than
   the contrast between the single naked energy which his character
   presents, and of which his name has become symbolical, and the grand
   issues which have gone forth from it. Scarcely anywhere else can we
   trace such an imperious potency of intellectual and moral influence
   emanating from so narrow a centre.

   There is in almost every respect a singular dissimilarity between the
   Genevan and the Wittenberg reformer. In personal, moral, and
   intellectual features, they stand contrasted--Luther with his massive
   frame and full big face, and deep melancholy eyes; Calvin, of moderate
   stature, pale and dark complexion, and sparkling eyes, that burned
   nearly to the moment of his death. [103] Luther, fond and jovial,
   relishing his beer and hearty family repasts with his wife and
   children; Calvin, spare and frugal, for many years only taking one meal
   a day, and scarcely needing sleep. [104] In the one, we see a rich and
   complex and buoyant and affectionate nature touching humanity at every
   point in the other, a stern and grave unity of moral character. Both
   were naturally of a somewhat proud and imperious temper, but the
   violence of Luther is warm and boisterous, that of Calvin is keen and
   zealous. It might have been a very uncomfortable thing, as Melanchthon
   felt, [105] to be exposed to Luther's occasional storms; but after the
   storm was over, it was pleasant to be folded once more to the great
   heart that was sorry for its excesses. To be the object of Calvin's
   dislike and anger was something to fill one with dread, not only for
   the moment, but long afterwards, and at a distance, as poor Castellio
   felt when he gathered the pieces of drift-wood on the banks of the
   Rhine at Basle.

   In intellect, as in personal features, the one was grand, massive, acid
   powerful, through depth and comprehension of feeling, a profound but
   exaggerated insight, and a soaring eloquence; the other was no less
   grand and powerful, through clearness and correctness of judgment,
   rigour and consistency of reasoning, and weightiness of expression.
   Both are alike memorable in the service which they rendered to their
   native tongue,--in the increased compass, flexibility, and felicitous
   mastery which they imparted to it. The Latin works of Calvin are
   greatly superior in elegance of style, symmetry of method, and
   proportionate vigour of argument. He maintains an academic elevation of
   tone, even when keenly agitated in temper; while Luther, as Mr Hallam
   has it, sometimes descends to mere "bellowing in bad Latin." Yet there
   is a coldness in the elevation of Calvin, and in his correct and
   well-balanced sentences, for which we should like ill to exchange the
   kindling though rugged paradoxes of Luther. The German had the more
   rich and teeming--the Genevan the harder, more serviceable, and
   enduring mind. When interrupted in dictating for several hours, Beza
   tells us that he could return and commence at once where he had left
   off; and that amidst all the multiplicity of his engagements, he never
   forgot what he required to know for the performance of any duty.

   As preachers, Calvin seems to have commanded a scarcely less powerful
   success than Luther, although of a different character--the one
   stimulating and rousing, "boiling over in every direction"--the other
   instructive, argumentative, and calm in the midst of his vehemence.
   [106] Luther flashed forth his feelings at the moment, never being able
   to compose what might be called a regular sermon, but seizing the
   principal subject, and turning all his attention to that alone. Calvin
   was elaborate and careful in his sermons, as in everything else. The
   one thundered and lightened, filling the souls of his hearers now with
   shadowy awe, and now with an intense glow of spiritual excitement:
   [107] the other, like. the. broad daylight, filled them with a more
   diffusive though less exhilarating clearness.

   Altogether, it is sufficiently easy to fix the varying characteristics,
   however difficult it may be to measure the relative greatness of the
   two chief reformers: moral and intellectual power assumes in the one an
   intense, concentrated, and severe outline,--in the other, a broad,
   irregular, and massive, yet child-like expression. The one may suggest
   a Doric column, chaste, grand, and sublime in the very simplicity and
   inflexibility of its mouldings; the other a Gothic dome, with its
   fertile contrasts and ample space, here shadowy in lurking gloom, and
   there riant in spots of sunshine, filled through all its amplitude with
   a dim religious awe, and yet, as we leisurely pause and survey it,
   traced here and there with grotesque and capricious imagery--the
   riotous freaks, as it were, of a strength which could be at once lofty
   and low, spiritually grand, yet with marks of its earth-birth
   everywhere.

   Simplicity is beyond doubt the main feature of Calvin's character; yet
   it is not the simplicity of nature--but of an even and orderly
   spiritual development. Earnest from the first, looking upon life as a
   great and stern reality, a hard yet noble discipline, his moral purpose
   is everywhere clear and definite--to live a life of duty, to shape
   circumstances to such divine ends as he apprehended, and in whatever
   sphere he might be placed to work out the glory of God. Protestantism
   changed the direction, but probably very little the principle, of his
   energies. As Romanist or Protestant he must have equally led a life of
   intense devotion and spiritual work. For there were no elements of
   lawless affection in him, no excesses of youthful passion, and,
   moreover, no impulses of mere selfish desire that could have ever drawn
   him aside to the service of the flesh or the world. He was naturally
   fitted as well as divinely trained for the special work which he had to
   do. He found his career, or rather it found him, with a singular
   felicity, amid the exciting strifes into which he. was born. Before his
   arrival in Geneva, he appeared very much the mere scholar and
   theologian. Intellectual study seemed not unlikely to divert and absorb
   his energies. But so soon as he settled there, his great practical and
   administrative qualities were drawn forth, and intellectual interest
   became henceforth subservient to that which he felt to be his peculiar
   mission,--the reorganisation of the divine kingdom in the world, as he
   saw and believed in it.

   Combined with this strict simplicity of aim in Calvin there is a
   wonderful grandeur of endurance and power. Nowhere lovely, he is
   everywhere strong. Strength looks upon us with a naked glance from
   every feature of his life and work. He is stern and arbitrary and cruel
   when it suits him, but never weak. He seldom mistakes, and as seldom
   fails. Confident in his own conclusions, and inflexible in his
   resolutions, he never goes back upon his practical policy, nor upon his
   theological views, [108] for revisal or modification, but always
   forward in expansive and consistent development. He never wavers, and
   has no scruples. In all his pained and worn countenance you cannot
   trace a quivering of feebleness, scarce a spark of sensitiveness,--only
   the forward and steady gaze of resolved and imperious duty, whatever it
   might cost him.

   As to the more social aspects of his character, it becomes a very
   difficult task to be at once just and critical. On the one hand, even
   in the face of his acknowledged harshness in many cases, it is
   impossible to adopt the representations of some, and regard him as
   destitute of all warmth of affection. Many of his letters are marked,
   on the contrary, by an affectionate interest, which, if not very warm
   or tender, is yet considerate and kindly. Then his relations with
   Farel, and Viret, and Bucer, and still more Melanchthon, from whom in
   many points he differed, sufficiently show that there was something in
   him lovable and capable of love, fitted both to engage sincere and deep
   regard, and to respond with an affectionate faithfulness to the
   friendly emotions which he excited. We have seen how his weary spirit
   clung to that of Melanchthon, removed beyond the contentions of
   theological strife; and there is something peculiarly affecting in' his
   long and sometimes very trying and delicate relations with Farel,
   terminated by that last kind and tender memorial which he sent him from
   his deathbed. On the other hand, it appears to us altogether a
   misinterpretation of character to read these tokens of friendly
   sympathy as being what have been called "the overflowings of a heart
   filled with the deepest and most acute sensibility." [109] Overflowing
   of any kind is exactly what you never find in Calvin, even in his most
   familiar letters. His strongest expressions of affection are always
   calm and measured. When he condoles with Viret and Knox, for example,
   on the death of their wives, there is no impulsive trembling or
   sensitive fulness in his tones, but only a becoming and regulated
   expression of grief. [110] Then it cannot be forgotten that there are
   some of his letters full of fierce expressions of hatred and anger,
   which one can only read now with pity and sorrow. [111] Affectionate
   and even hearty to his friends let us admit him to have been, and
   capable of unbending so far as to play with the syndics at the game of
   the key (whatever that may have been), on a quiet evening; but Calvin
   was certainly not in the least a man of genial and overflowing
   sensibility. His temper was repressive and not expansive, concentrated
   and not sympathetic, and his heart burned more keenly with the fires of
   polemic indignation, than it ever glowed with the warmth of kindly or
   tender emotion.

   There are nowhere in all his letters any joyous or pathetic
   exaggerations of sentiment; there is nothing of that play of feeling or
   of language which in Luther's letters makes us so love the man. All
   this he would have thought mere waste of breath--mere idleness, for
   which he had no time. The intensity of his purpose, the solemnity of
   his work, prevented him from ever looking around or relaxing himself in
   a free, happy, and outgoing communion with nature or life. Living as he
   did amid the most divine aspects of nature, you could not tell from his
   correspondence that they ever touched him--that morning with its golden
   glories, or evening with its softened splendours, as day rose and set
   amid such transporting scenes, ever inspired him. The murmuring rush of
   the Rhone, the frowning outlines of the Jura, the snowy grandeur of
   Mont Blanc, might as well not have been, for all that they seemed to
   have affected him. No vestige of poetical feeling, no touch of
   descriptive colour, ever rewards the patient reader. All that
   exquisitely conscious sympathy with nature, and varying responsiveness
   to its unuttered lessons, which brighten with an ever-recurring
   freshness the long pages of Luther's letters, and which have now
   wrought themselves as a commonplace into literature, are unknown, and
   would have been unintelligible to him. No less strange to him is the
   fertile interest in life merely for its own sake--its own joys and
   sorrows--brightness and sadness; the mystery, pathos, tenderness, and
   exuberance of mere human affection, which enrich the character of the
   great German. There is nothing of all this in Calvin; no vague
   yearnings or sentimental aspirations ever touched him. Luther, in all
   things greater as a man, is infinitely greater here. And in truth this
   element of modern feeling and culture is Teutonic rather than Celtic in
   its growth. It springs out of the comparative rich and genial soil of
   the Saxon mind,--deeper in its sensibilities and more exuberant in its
   products.

   On the whole, simplicity, grandeur, and consistency of purpose, mark
   out Calvin from his fellows, and constitute the main elements of his
   greatness and influence. The same kind of consistency which we shall
   meet with in his theological system appears in his character--a
   consistency not of manifold adaptation, but of stern compression. As in
   the former the complexities of Christian doctrine are not merely
   evolved and laid side by side, but crushed into a unity, so in the
   latter there is uniqueness and symmetry at the expense of richness and
   interest, and a whole and hearty humanity. His theology and life alike
   must be judged in reference to the exigencies which called them forth,
   and the work that they accomplished. Human progress needed both of them
   assuredly, although it is a melancholy and saddening reflection that it
   did so. It was a hard and bad world that needed Calvin as a reformer.
   And when we think of the Institutes in comparison with the Gospels, we
   cannot help acknowledging how far man was then, and alas is still,
   below his blessings--how infinitely higher is the reach of divine truth
   than the response of human desire or the capacity of human
   understanding!

   An impression of majesty and yet of sadness must ever linger around the
   name of Calvin. He was great, and we admire him. The world needed him,
   and we honour him; but we cannot love him. He repels our affections
   while he extorts our admiration; and while we recognise the worth, and
   the divine necessity, of his life and work, we are thankful to survey
   them at a distance, and to believe that there are also other modes of
   divinely governing the world, and advancing the kingdom of
   righteousness and truth.

   According to what we have already said, the great distinction of
   Calvin, as we see him appearing within the sphere of the Reformation,
   is that in him the movement found its genius of order. He is from the
   outset of his career not at all, like Luther, the head of an onward.
   struggle, but the representative of a new organisation of the
   disturbing forces, spiritual and social, that were spreading all around
   in France and. Switzerland. While, therefore, Luther is
   characteristically the hero, Calvin is characteristically the
   legislator. He feels that the insurrectionary movement, which has been
   proceeding vigorously and fiercely for a quarter of a century, needs a
   guide--some one, not indeed to beat back and check it, but to rein it
   in, [112] to impress upon it a definite constitution, and to bring it
   under discipline. Unless such an one should arise, the movement seemed
   likely to spend itself, on the one hand, in the most extravagant forms
   of social disturbance, through the spread of Anabaptism and other forms
   of pseudo-Christian Communism; or, on the other hand, in intellectual
   unbelief, like that of Servetus and others. With a view to what seemed
   the probable development of such tendencies, Calvin was just as much
   the master of the occasion as Luther was of a very different occasion:
   or, to speak in other language, the instrumentality of divine
   Providence was manifested equally in the rise of the Genevan as in that
   of the German reformer. The elements of religious thought and social
   liberty let loose by Luther, and within more limited spheres by Zwingli
   and Farel, and which required, as eminently in the case of Luther they
   found, a heroic impulsion of character and a strength of popular and
   enthusiastic zeal to represent and carry them forward to triumph,--now
   in 1536 demanded the influence of a quite different character, and a
   strength of intellectual and moral, rather than of popular
   earnestness--an aristocratic, in short, rather than a democratic power,
   to direct and control them.

   Calvin was the impersonation of this spirit of order in the surging
   movement of the sixteenth century. He was so in two distinct and
   important respects, closely connected with one another, but separately
   so important that it is difficult to say in which point of view he
   appears most as a genius and master. He was so, first as the great
   theologian of the Reformation; and secondly, as the founder of a new
   religious and social organisation--a new order of Church polity--which
   did more than anything else to consolidate the dissipating forces of
   Protestantism, and to oppose, if not a triumphant, yet an effectual
   front to the old Catholic organisation, now beginning to gather life
   again after its first rude shocks. His influence in both these respects
   not only survived himself, but from the small centre of Geneva was
   propagated through France and Holland and Scotland, and to a large
   extent England, in a manner which, as we look back upon it, exalts him
   to the highest rank of great men, who, by the concentration and
   intensity of their thought and will, have ever swayed the destinies of
   their race. Limited, as compared with Luther, in his personal
   influence, apparently less the man of the hour in a great crisis of
   human progress, he towers far above Luther in the general influence
   over the world of thought and the course of history, which a mighty
   intellect, inflexible in its convictions and constructive in its
   genius, never fails to exercise.

   In briefly speaking of Calvin as a theologian, we shall not attempt to
   criticise in detail his religious opinions. This would be altogether
   foreign to the purpose of these sketches. We shall try, however, to
   seize the spirit and general character of his dogmatic system, as they
   serve to explain his historical position, and as they came in contact
   with the spiritual tendencies then most active, not only in France, but
   in other countries.

   When Calvin turned his keen glance upon the spiritual atmosphere around
   him, he saw at once the necessity, not so much of charging it with any
   new impulses, as of introducing clearness, intelligibility, and
   arrangement into those already in operation. This was the task that he
   essayed; and he brought to this task no new spirit or principles, but
   simply learning, faith, and vigour of mental conception. Novelty of
   purpose or of doctrine was as far as possible from his thought. The
   famous preface to the Institutes is mainly a powerful protest against
   any such view. What he really contemplated, and what he accomplished in
   the Institutes, first in a comparatively slight, and then in a more
   elaborate and definite form, was to reconstruct on a professed Biblical
   basis those doctrinal ideas which, disengaged from the old Catholic
   tradition by the powerful preaching of the earlier reformers, had not
   yet assumed, at least to the Gallic mind, any consistent expression.
   The primitive Christian character of these ideas is the great point
   which he tries to force upon the attention of Francis I., in view of
   the calumnies which the enemies of the Reformation had widely spread
   abroad. Novelty or even originality in doctrinal conception would have
   been repelled by him as a shameful accusation, and in fact was so when,
   under the misrepresentation of Caroli and others, he was accused of
   Arianism. Nothing in his early career moved him more, or gave him more
   pain. In the very face of all such views, it was his single aim to set
   anew in a Scriptural framework the old truth--to rebuild in its purity
   and completeness the old dogmatic edifice which had been overlaid and
   disfigured by the corruptions of Popery.

   It arose from the very nature of the case, that this could only be done
   in the abstract and systematic spirit in which he attempted it. It was
   necessary to meet system with system--theory by theory. The old
   Catholic tradition, notwithstanding all that had happened, and the
   vigorous rents that had been made in it by the attacks of the
   reformers, had a power not merely of resistance but of successful
   reaction to the "new" opinions, in the mere coherence and apparent
   unity which it seemed to present in contrast with the latter, so long
   as these could at all be regarded as the mere opinions of individual
   teachers. To show, in a systematic method, that they could not rightly
   be so regarded, but that they were in reality the revival of the
   primitive Christian teaching--to raise thus a coherent front of
   Scriptural dogmatism, in opposition to the old ecclesiastical
   dogmatism, and thereby at once save the principles of the Reformation
   from licence, and strengthen and consolidate them against Popery,--such
   was Calvin's great work as a theologian. [113]

   In a historical point of view we cannot think that any will deny the
   distinguished success with which he accomplished this work. Never did
   man, perhaps, more truly measure his powers to the exact task for which
   they were fitted, and then bring them to bear with a more steady and
   adequate energy upon the achievement of that task. Seizing with a
   powerful and comprehensive grasp the whole scheme of Christian
   doctrine, he analysed and exhibited it step by step in all its parts,
   and set it forth in an order most imposing and effective. Melanchthon
   had previously systematised the reformed tenets, but without the same
   confident grasp and mastery of logic. The German theologian possessed a
   more delicate perception, and a more subtle insight into many points;
   but this very fineness of spiritual texture unfitted him for the more
   bold and compact dogmatic handiwork that was then required: it gave
   indecision and apparent feebleness to many of his views. Calvin did not
   know the meaning of dogmatic indecision. His intellectual penetration
   and directness overmatched all scruples and doubts, and enabled him at
   almost every point to maintain a firm footing--to show his readers, as
   he himself says, "how to pursue and hold without wandering the good and
   right way." And this mere strength of intellectual consistency,
   traversing the whole ground of Christian truth--mapping it out, and
   arranging it territory to territory, so as to present a great whole was
   the primary, as it was among the most powerful, means of giving to his
   work the influence which it secured; it met exactly one of the most
   urgent wants of the Reformation.

   When we bring into view the prominent Scriptural ground on which this
   consistency was made to rest, we recognise a further important element
   of Calvin's success. It was not merely the coherence of a great logical
   method which was presented in the Institutes, but the method seemed to
   identify itself at every point with Scripture, and appropriately
   express its truth. "He who makes himself master of the method which I
   have pursued," he says, "will surely understand what he should seek for
   in Scripture." The logical framework, in all its well-ordered parts,
   was clothed with the living garment of the divine Word. Even now it is
   difficult to disentangle the two; for Calvin, with all the theologians
   of his century, and of the succeeding century as well, does not quote
   Scripture merely in support of his view, so that you can see the view
   distinctly, and then the Scriptural warrant for it, but he everywhere
   blends undistinguishably his own reasoning and Scripture, so that it is
   often very difficult indeed to say where you have the human reasoner,
   and where the divine Teacher. He applies Biblical language, moreover,
   as all his compeers did, with comparatively little regard to its
   historical connection, taking a statement at random from any book of
   the Old, or from any book of the New Testament, as bearing with equally
   conclusive force upon his argument. The result of this is to exhibit
   the outline of his system as representing, in all its successive
   evolutions, a strikingly Scriptural aspect. The argument at every
   point, even in the first book, "De Cognitione Dei Creatoris," takes up
   Scriptural phrase, and drapes itself in it as a sure vesture fitted to
   it closely, and with great skill. This prominence of Biblical
   statement, worked into every phase of his dogmatic scheme, and
   disguising its mere abstract propositions, constituted, and constitutes
   to this day with many minds, the greatest success of Calvin's work. The
   philosopher is hidden in the divine--the dogmatist in the Scripturist.

   But it was a still farther characteristic of Calvin's system that may
   be said to have completed its triumph. He not merely apprehended the
   Christian scheme as a whole, and set it forth with the rare logical and
   Scriptural consistency we have described, but he apprehended it with
   clear and firm vision, in the view of a great central truth, which shed
   light, darkened indeed, but intense in its very darkness, upon all its
   relations. The great moving-spring of the Reformation, we formerly saw,
   was the principle of individual religion--the assertion of the
   immediate relation of the soul to God expressed in the doctrine of
   justification by faith alone. Calvin seized this great truth with the
   same clearness, if not with the same intensity, as Luther. He saw with
   an equal force that God is the only source of all good in man--that
   human righteousness can only spring out of the free act and
   communication of the divine grace, and that therefore the supposed
   merit of any human work, even of the noblest piety, as recognised by
   the Catholic tradition, was a mere delusion, ensnaring to the soul. He
   laid down this as a distinctive article of faith with his usual
   lucidity and coherence, bringing out the Scriptural proportions of his
   own view against what he considered to be the perversion of an eminent
   Lutheran teacher, Osiander. [114] But beyond this special aspect of the
   principle of the free and immediate relation of the soul to God in the
   doctrine of Justification, Calvin saw a still higher and more
   comprehensive aspect of it in the doctrine of Predestination. If there
   be no veil between the soul and God, so that the former finds all its
   life and righteousness only in the latter--the human in the divine
   Personality--it is but a mere step from this to apprehend the Divine
   Being as not only freely but sovereignly, "of His mere good pleasure,"
   bestowing life and righteousness. Not only is justification of God
   alone, but an act of the divine sovereignty--definite, immutable,
   irrefragable--has determined from all eternity the objects of
   justification. Only then do we fully recognise free grace in all its
   grandeur, when we recognise it in this shape as the eternal election of
   God--when we acknowledge the divine act of clemency: and not merely so,
   but, moreover, the divine act of reprobation, as eternally consummated
   in certain persons without any reference to their conduct. The whole of
   human life and of human history, the good and evil that are in them,
   are gathered up by Calvin into a single point in the abyss of eternity,
   from which all their complicated threads go forth in a double series of
   undeviating demarcation. The divine is apprehended not only on its
   positive but on its negative side, as working out not only a
   progressive kingdom of righteousness, but also a retrogressive kingdom
   of evil, and in each case equally for its own glory. And this moral
   dualism is applied with a fearless and untrembling hand. It is in no
   sense a mere theory--the mere blank category of a transcendental
   philosophy--but a living principle which he brings to bear without
   flinching upon all the mysteries of human existence. He confesses,
   indeed, that it is a "horrible decree"; [115] but its clear and
   undeniable proof seems to him to lie in the simple statement which
   follows up this confession: "God must have foreseen the special destiny
   of each individual before He created him, and He only foresaw this as
   having ordained it." [116] This was the highest triumph of his system.
   Even a logic such as Calvin's could go no farther than this.

   In what degree this confident audacity in carrying out the great
   principle of the Reformation helped to give permanence to its general
   doctrines, and to make them dominant not only over the learned but over
   the popular minds that came within its sway, is a question far too wide
   and important to take up here. But none can doubt, looking merely at
   the most obvious facts, that it had a very powerful influence, not only
   in virtue of its own logical vigour, and the craving there then was, in
   all minds astir about religious truth, for some great theory or
   absolute idea into which to fit and harmonise their floating
   conceptions; but especially in virtue of the profound spiritual
   instinct out of which the theory sprang, and which it long continued
   and even continues to express to many deeply religious minds. The
   feeling of direct and devout dependence upon God--of tracing all to
   Him, and finding all in Him--of emptying the creaturely will wholly in
   the Creative will--of bending low before the Majesty of heaven, and
   rejoicing that our very weakness and misery are its strength and
   glory;--this deep instinct of humility appeared to many merely sublimed
   in the doctrine of Predestination, and, apart from its own
   argumentative consistency and hardihood, it thus carried with it the
   energy and triumph of a lofty spirituality.

   As we look back, therefore, upon this great system in conjunction with
   the spirit not only of the century which produced it, but of that which
   followed, we can well understand the success with which it maintained
   its ground, and the conquest which it won against rival systems. Viewed
   as systems--as exhaustive logical generalisations of Christian
   truth--Calvinism is the natural victor of Arminianism in this very
   thoroughness and higher consistency of system which it presents, in its
   greater Scriptural earnestness, and in the superior boldness and
   directness with which it carried out the great fundamental principle of
   the Reformation. Arminianism--no less infected than Calvinism by a mere
   logical zeal, having no more than the latter any apprehension of a
   higher method than that of argumentative definition even in the highest
   region of spiritual truth--yet paltered and sophisticated in its logic
   everywhere. It had neither the courage to lay aside logic and confess
   its weakness, nor yet the vigour to carry it out. And so it patched at
   every point, and covered the last mystery, into which Calvinism rushed
   with daring footing, with its thin glosses--glosses so feebly
   transparent now when we examine them, that it seems strange they should
   have ever satisfied any minds, and least of all minds of such acuteness
   as some of those that professed to rest on them.

   The higher Scriptural congruity of Calvinism was especially apparent on
   the dogmatical principle of interpretation then common. It mirrored far
   more profoundly the spiritual depths of the Epistles, and took up more
   naturally and directly the great keynotes of their language. It was
   more true, as a whole, to the vast and shadowy outlines of thought
   which meet us everywhere on the surface of Scripture, and especially
   concentrate themselves in certain deep utterances of the letters of St
   Paul over which criticism has long hung perplexed.

   While thus claiming for Calvinism a higher Scriptural character, it
   would yet be too much to say that Calvinism, any more than Lutheranism,
   or Arminianism, was primarily the result of a fresh and living study of
   Scripture. Calvin everywhere appealed to Scripture,--he is the greatest
   Biblical commentator, as he is the greatest Biblical dogmatist, of his
   age. But his dogmas, for the most part, were not primarily suggested by
   Scripture; and as to his distinguishing dogma, this is eminently the
   case. Like Luther, he had been trained in the scholastic philosophy,
   and been fed on Augustine; and it was no more possible for the one than
   for the other to get beyond the scholastic spirit or the Augustinian
   doctrine. An attentive study of the Institutes reveals the presence of
   Augustine everywhere; and great as Calvin, beyond doubt, is in
   exegesis, his exegesis is mainly controlled by Augustinian dogmatic
   theory. As to the question of predestination--so apt to be identified
   with his name in theology--Calvin is not merely indebted to Augustine,
   but he verbally reproduces him at great length; and it is a favourite
   plan with him, when hard pushed by the dilemmas which his own acuteness
   or the representations of opponents suggest, to retreat behind the
   arguments of his great prototype, and to suppose himself strong within
   the cover of assertions not less startling and inadmissible, though
   more venerable than his own. In fixing anew, therefore, this keystone
   in the Christian arch, he was merely repeating, as elsewhere, an old
   work; and strangely enough,--as is so often the case in all such
   reactions,--the chief weapon which he employed against the degraded
   scholasticism of his day was tempered in the very forge which it was
   meant to extinguish.

   This appeal to an earlier Catholicity on the part of the Reformed
   theologies--this support in Augustine--beyond doubt greatly contributed
   to their success in their day. For few then ventured to doubt the
   authority of Augustinianism, and the theological spirit of the
   sixteenth century hardly at any point got beyond it. It was a natural
   source of triumph to the great Protestant confessions against the
   unsettled unbelief or more superficial theologies which they
   encountered, that they wielded so bold and consistent a weapon of
   logic, and appealed so largely to an authoritative Scriptural
   interpretation. Calvinism could not but triumph on any such modes of
   reasoning or of Biblical exegesis as then prevailed; and so long as it
   continued to be merely a question of systems, and logic had it all its
   own way, this triumph was secure. But now that the question is changed,
   and logic is no longer mistress of the field; now, when a spirit of
   interpreting Scripture, which would have hardly been intelligible to
   Calvin, generally asserts itself--a spirit which recognises a progress
   in Scripture itself--a diverse literature and moral growth in its
   component elements--and which, at once looking backward with reverence
   and forward with faith, has learned a new audacity, or a new modesty.
   as we shall call it, according to our predilections: and while it
   accepts with awe the mysteries of life and of death, refuses to submit
   them arbitrarily to the dictation of any mere logical principle--now
   that the whole sphere of religious credence is differently apprehended,
   and the provinces of faith and of logical deduction are recognised as
   not merely incommensurate, but as radically distinguished,--the whole
   case as to the triumphant position of Calvinism, or indeed any other
   theological system, is altered. An able writer [117] has shown with
   convincing power what are the inevitably contradictory results of
   applying the reasoning faculty with determining sway to the settlement
   of religious truth. The conclusions of this writer, sufficiently
   crushing as directed by him against all rationalistic systems, are to
   the full as conclusive against the competency of all theological
   systems whatever. The weapon of logical destructiveness which he has
   used with such energy, is a weapon of offence really against all
   religious dogmatism. What between the torture of criticism, and the
   slow but sure advance of moral idea, this dogmatism is losing hold of
   the most living and earnest intelligence everywhere. And it seems no
   longer possible. under any new polemic form, to revive it. Men are
   weary of heterodoxy and of orthodoxy alike, and of the former in any
   arbitrary and dogmatic shape. still more intolerably than of the
   latter. The old Intitutio Christianæ Religionis no loner satisfies, and
   a new Institutio can never replace it. A second Calvin in theology is
   impossible. Men thirst not less for spiritual truth, but they no longer
   believe in the capacity of system to embrace and contain that truth, as
   in a reservoir, for successive generations. They seek for it themselves
   afresh in the pages of Scripture and the ever-dawning light of the
   spiritual life of humanity. The age of tradition is gone beyond recall,
   and the most venerated creeds, no less than the most novel religious
   theories, must submit to the tests of an expanding historical and moral
   judgment.

   In the endless conflict of systems, and the mutual destructiveness of
   their opposing principles, there is a lesson to be learned, but it is
   by no means the lesson which the Bampton lecturer draws. The
   uncertainty of reason in all religious matters, and the
   contradictoriness of its vaulting theories, should teach us a greater
   trust in revelation, but a trust in its spiritual unity and simplicity,
   rather than in the dogmatic meanings assumed to represent it. If the
   intellect be a helpless arbiter in religious questions, and everywhere
   starts more difficulties than it suggests solutions, our appeal must be
   to Scripture, and we thank God for it but to Scripture in its
   historical connection, and the critical and literary conditions which
   its several books present, rather than to traditionary conclusions
   drawn from these books--to the Divine Spirit, in short, that speaks in
   Scripture under the necessary limitations of human language and a
   progressive development of moral thought. [118]

   We have still to consider Calvin in what appears to us his most
   creative capacity--as an ecclesiastical legislator; and in order to do
   this, we must understand yet more fully the historical necessities of
   his position, and of the Reformation as represented by him.

   After the first spiritual impulse of the Reformation had spent itself,
   great difficulties and dangers arose on all sides. Not only did the
   unsettled elements of Christian doctrine require a master-mind to mould
   and reconstruct them into an authoritative shape, but the same process
   of reconstruction was still more urgently demanded in the sphere of
   social life. With the overthrow of the old Catholic polity and
   discipline there was left a great opening for moral laxity, and the
   dissolution of the bonds of society. Corrupt as that polity was in its
   deeper springs, it remained a machinery highly conservative of social
   and national existence. Intolerable in its unspirituality and
   oppressiveness, it operated as a vast social and political agency,
   touching life everywhere, and binding it together in all its relations.
   Gradually it had grown to be this. Augustine's grand idea of a civitas
   Dei--of a divine commonwealth had developed itself till the hierarchy
   sketched by him covered the whole of the western world, and not merely
   placed itself in contact with human activity at every point, but
   directly held within its embrace all the intricacies of personal,
   family, and national relation. Starting as the most individual of all
   religions, and seizing, by its primary influence, not on man's outward
   condition, but on his deepest inward sensibilities, Christianity had
   taken the place of the old imperial authority as the latter decayed,
   and become a religion in the strictest sense--a great system of
   political as well as moral government. At first, slowly pushing its way
   in conflict with the immoralities of paganism, and the spurious ethics
   alike of Gnostical and Epicurean philosophy, it had grown in the course
   of five centuries into a vast Power, extending its control over all the
   interests of human existence within its reach. Christianity had become
   the Church: spiritual individualism had developed into Catholic
   Authority. Augustine stood on the verge of this great change,
   recognised it, gloried in it--and, by his great work, helped to forward
   it.

   This second phase of Christianity had now worked itself out. The
   radical Christian spirit was not and could not be extinguished under
   all the compression of the Catholic system; and it had now, after many
   partial and ineffectual efforts, risen up against it in might. For a
   thousand years the system had dominated over all expressions of
   individual energy, fitting itself into human history, and so far
   constituting that history in its successive manifestations. Now,
   however, it was broken up. The warm breath of a living Gospel had
   dissolved it, and men were cast loose from the bonds which had so long
   controlled them. The old spirit of individualism, which in primitive
   Christianity had gone forth with triumphant success into pagan society,
   had once more awakened as from a long slumber, and rent with sundering
   force the repressive machinery which had bound without destroying it.

   Such an awakening as this, in the very nature of the case, soon began
   to run into many extravagant issues. In the first feeling of liberty
   men did not know how to use it temperately; and Anabaptism in Germany
   and Libertinism in France testified to the moral confusion and social
   licence that everywhere sprang up in the wake of the Reformation. We
   can now but faintly realise how ominous all this seemed to the
   prospects of Protestantism. It appeared to many minds as about to
   terminate in mere anarchy. The religious revival seemed likely to
   become mere social disorder. At the very best, the new life was every
   where obscured by the disorder which spread alongside of it, and was
   apt to be confounded with it. [119]

   To add to the exigency thus arising out of the circumstances of the
   Reformation itself, there were signs now at length (1536) showing
   themselves in all directions of a reviving strength in Romanism. With
   that singular vitality which it had so often previously, and has so
   often since, displayed, it now, after the first shock of the
   Reformation, took a new and more powerful start than in any of its
   preceding developments. Jesuitism arose as the formidable and
   well-matched opponent of Protestantism; the highest craft, subtlety,
   and energy, the consummate immorality and persistent cruelty of the
   Romish system, received in this marvellous agency a fresh and vigorous
   birth; and it is only when we apprehend and bring clearly into view its
   peculiar working and influence, that the later history of the
   Reformation becomes intelligible.

   This, then, was the historical position which Calvin occupied. He
   surveyed and realised it as no other mind of his time did. He naturally
   hated every species of disorder. His whole character and mind were
   constructive and legislative. Protestant by religious conviction, he
   was conservative and Catholic by natural instinct; and accordingly he
   was no sooner within the reformed movement, than he aimed to fix it.
   Especially did the great idea, which had been originally expressed in
   the Catholic Church, but had' become degraded into an unspiritual
   hierarchy--the idea of a divine state--hold possession of his mind. The
   unity and completeness which it presented charmed Calvin. He felt,
   moreover, that it was only by the resurrection of this idea in some new
   form that the reactionary strength of the Catholic polity could be met
   and withstood. He saw clearly that unless the moral intensity which had
   broken forth in the Reformation, and separated itself from the old
   ecclesiastical forms, could be turned into some new disciplinary
   institution, it would spend itself and disappear. In the nature of
   things it was unable to propagate itself merely by its own force.
   Already in Germany it was failing to do so. A controversial interest
   there was fast beginning to swallow up the spiritual life out of which
   the Reformation had sprung; and with all his own strong polemical
   tendencies, Calvin sufficiently discerned the evil that would come from
   such a spirit--the negation and deadness to which it would give rise.
   He was himself too practically earnest, and he had far too deep a
   feeling of the wants of human nature, and the divine education through
   which alone it can be trained to strength and goodness, not to aim at
   something higher than the mere settlement of controversial dogma.
   Argumentative as he was, he was yet more the legislator than the
   dialectician; and it was an institutional instinct and capacity, still
   more than a philosophical or dogmatical interest, that directed all his
   activity. His mind, therefore, could not rest short of a new Church
   organisation and polity--of a new order of moral discipline, which,
   planting itself in the heart of Protestantism, should at once conserve
   its life, and enable it to confront the re-collecting forces and still
   powerfully repressive energy of the Roman hierarchy. Strongly impressed
   by its necessity, he aimed to impart to Protestantism a new social as
   well as doctrinal expression--to reconstitute, in short, the divine
   commonwealth, the civitas Dei.

   There are two distinct views that may be taken of this part of Calvin's
   work. It presents itself, on the one hand, as a moral influence--a
   conservative spiritual discipline suited to the time, as it was called
   forth by it; and on the other hand, as a new theory, or definite
   reconstitution, of the Church. In the first point of view, it is almost
   wholly admirable; in the second, it will be found unable to maintain
   itself any more than the Catholic theory which it so far displaced.

   The general principle of Calvin's polity was simply the reassertion of
   a divine order amid the confused activities of the time--of the
   majesty, right, and peacefulness of divine Law. That there is a kingdom
   of God in the world; that man is God's creature and subject, and that
   there is life for human society, and happiness for the human race only
   in recognising and acting upon this idea; the consequent obligation of
   self-sacrifice, and the duty of subordination and combination among all
   the members of a common State,--these were the old truths applied by
   Calvin to the reconstruction of the Christian community. Any one who
   reads the opening chapter of the fourth book of the Institutes will at
   once see how deeply he was struck and penetrated with the idea of the
   Church visible as well as invisible, and with the necessity of a due
   and becoming relation of authority among its various constituents. His
   consistorial scheme of government was to him the appropriate expression
   of this authority; and whatever may be our critical judgment of this
   scheme, we are not to forget, in reference even to its most extreme and
   misdirected efforts, the absolute lawlessness with which it came in
   contact. Such an order, though of the most stern and repressive kind,
   was better than no order; and in truth we may believe it was only
   through such a system of iron repression--a system which, in the nature
   of the case, and in all the circumstances of the period, sometimes
   confounded mere liberty with wrong, and mere folly with crime, and cast
   its restraining presence into the very heart of the family as well as
   the bosom of the Church--that the moral life of the Reformation could
   have been saved, or at any rate strengthened and hardened for the
   fearful contest that was before it. The more any one studies the facts
   of this great crisis, the more will he be forced to see that no mere
   aesthetic spirit of freedom could have then maintained its ground
   Against the dark perjuries and malice of the reactionary interest. It
   required a moral spirit nurtured in hardness, and made strong-limbed by
   strenuous and daring exercise, to encounter the supple deceit and
   Satanic persistence of the Jesuit faction, spread into every land, and
   working by the most dexterous and disguised communications.

   And when we contemplate for a moment the actual results of Calvin's
   discipline, all this plainly appears. It was the spirit bred by this
   discipline which, spreading into France and Holland and Scotland,
   maintained by its single strength the cause of a free Protestantism in
   all these lands. It was the same spirit which inspired the early, and
   lived on in the later Puritans; which animated such men as Milton and
   Owen and Baxter which armed the Parliament of England with strength
   against Charles I., and stirred the great soul of Cromwell in its
   proudest triumphs; and which, while it thus fed every source of
   political liberty in the old world, burned undimmed in the gallant crew
   of the "Mayflower"--the pilgrim-fathers--who first planted the seeds of
   civilisation in the great continent of the West. A stern and unyielding
   reverence for law and duty, combined with a high resistance to the
   encroachments of mere selfish tyranny; an intense love of the Bible,
   and an undoubting and indiscriminating application of its examples to
   the business of life and the affairs of state; all the moral heroism in
   Puritanism which awes us by its grandeur, though it may fail to win our
   sympathy or enlist our love,--had its wellspring in Geneva, and
   reflects a lineal glory on the name of Calvin. Linked not only
   spiritually but formally with the Genevan polity, it was from thence it
   received the great theocratic idea which it prominently embodied, and
   launched forth once more with such triumph into the history of the
   world. That man, as the creature of God, is near to God, and under the
   control and sanctity of the divine influence, not only in some, but in
   all expressions of his manifold activity--that he is bound in all by a
   relation to the divine will--that as there is no individual goodness,
   so there can be no social blessing, and no real civil grandeur apart
   from God;--that the civitas Dei, therefore, is no dream of mere
   enthusiasm or of sacerdotal ambition, but a true idea resting on the
   everlasting relations of things, and all other ideas of the nation or
   society rather the dreams and shows of which this is the reality;--all
   this, of which Puritanism was conspicuously the renewed powerful
   expression, germinated in the small state of Geneva, and from this
   narrow centre went forth to mingle in the increase, and to add moral
   stability to the ambition, of the highest forms of modern civilisation.
   Saving for this new and grand development given to Protestantism--in
   which Germany had no share--it would have fared ill with it in the
   great crisis through which it had to pass; for it was only this
   profound belief in a divine society and state,--in a kingdom of truth
   and righteousness in the world,--that was able to encounter the
   falsehoods of state-craft and the immoralities of mere arbitrary power.
   It was only Puritanism that proved a match for Jesuitism, and held it
   in check; and while other phases of Protestantism were shrinking into
   mere formality or dying out in weakness, this was not merely holding
   its own in a stern struggle with Romish intrigue, but, through many
   strange aberrations and internal contradictions, was working out in a
   higher form the principles both of religious and of civil liberty.

   It is a very different subject that is before us when we turn to
   contemplate the theocracy of Calvin, in its formal expression and basis
   as a new and definite outline of Church government. In this respect he
   made more an apparent than a real advance upon the old Catholic
   theocracy. He took up the old principle from a different and higher
   basis, but in a scarcely less arbitrary and external manner. There is a
   kingdom of divine truth and righteousness, he said, and Scripture, not
   the priesthood, is its basis. The divine Word, and not Roman tradition,
   is the foundation of the spiritual commonwealth. So far, all right; so
   far, Calvin had got hold of a powerful truth against the corrupt
   historical pretensions of Popery. But he at once went much farther than
   this, and said, not tentatively, or in a spirit of rational freedom,
   but dogmatically, and in a spirit of arbitrariness tainted with the
   very falsehood from whose thraldom he sought to deliver men, "This is
   the form of the divine kingdom presented in Scripture." Not the
   presence of certain spiritual qualities, but the presence of certain
   external conditions, which I have fixed and determined, constitute the
   Church. Scripture absolutely demands this and forbids that in reference
   to the organisation and order of the Christian Society. This idea of
   going back to Scripture not merely as a historical starting-point, but
   de novo and entirely, for all the elements of an ecclesiastical polity,
   was one peculiar to Calvin, and all who more or less embraced or were
   influenced by his principles. Luther had no perception of it,--it was,
   in fact, strongly distasteful to his concrete and historical
   sympathies. He sought rather to preserve the inherited Catholic
   machinery in every respect, so far as it was not plainly opposed to
   Scripture. He wished to amend and rectify, but not to abolish and
   re-institute. He strenuously resisted the pretence of Scriptural
   simplicity by which Carlstadt urged forward his pseudo-Puritanism. The
   old Catholic usages were not to be wantonly touched; under all the
   corruptions which had overlaid them, they remained dear to his
   affection and beautiful to his imagination. But Calvin felt no such
   ties to the past, and could never understand the influence of them on
   others. It was his constant complaint against the Lutherans that they
   preserved so many ceremonies; and his contempt for the tolerabiles
   ineptias [120] of English Protestantism is well known. With no
   imagination, and but cold feelings, and a meagre sympathy with
   traditional associations--with a sphere, moreover, singularly cleared
   for his activity in the small state of Geneva--he was led to indulge to
   the full his legislative bias, and to plan and rearrange, according to
   his own arbitrary convictions, a "religious constitution."

   The vigour of this religious constitution sufficiently showed itself in
   the approbation which it commanded, and the manner in which it spread
   itself wherever the popular will had scope in moulding the progress of
   the Reformation. Presbyterianism became the peculiar Church order of a
   free Protestantism, carrying with it everywhere, singularly enough, as
   one of the very agencies of its free moral influence, an inquisitorial
   authority resembling that of the Calvinistic consistory. It rested,
   beyond doubt, on a true divine order, else it never could have attained
   this historical success. But it also contained from the beginning a
   source of weakness in the very way in which it put forth its divine
   warrant. It not merely asserted itself to be wise and conformable to
   Scripture, and therefore divine, but it claimed the direct impress of a
   divine right for all its details and applications. This gave it
   strength and influence in a rude and uncritical age, but it planted in
   it from the first an element of corruption. The great conception which
   it embodied was impaired at the root by being fixed in a stagnant and
   inflexible system, which became identified with the conception as not
   only equally, but specially divine. The ritual thus once more preceded
   the moral,--the accidental, the essential,--external uniformity, moral
   unity; and Calvin himself, seduced by this radical mistake, sought by
   the mere rigour of the consistory, and the most trivial details of
   over-legislation, to touch the heart of life, and mould it to a holy
   and peaceful order. Never was there a greater mistake. All the richest
   qualities and most genuine aspirations of life forbid the attempt.
   However temporarily strengthened, they cannot healthily grow under such
   a system. The kingdom of righteousness can only flourish in an
   atmosphere of freedom; it is never helped but truly injured by any
   species of external compulsion; divine society is only held together by
   inner bonds; it lives along lines of spiritual communication, and not
   of legal enactment; in its essence, in short, it is not "of this
   world," while yet necessarily taking to itself, according to
   circumstances, some definite outward shape. In so far as Presbyterian
   Puritanism came short of all this--nay, in many respects contradicted
   it--it failed to realise the only divine principle of moral government;
   and the theocratic idea accordingly, in its renewed assertion, fell
   back once more into its old mistake and confusion. The garments of
   Judaism still clung to it; the idea had not yet worked itself clear
   from the beggarly elements that haunt it as its shadow, and are
   everywhere ready to supplant and degrade it.

   But were not these "elements," some will say, really Biblical?--did not
   Calvin establish his Church polity and Church discipline upon
   Scripture?--and is not this a warrantable course? Assuredly not, in the
   spirit in which he did it. The fundamental source of the mistake is
   here: The Christian Scriptures are a revelation of divine truth, and
   not a revelation of Church polity. They not only do not lay down the
   outline of such a polity, but they do not even give the adequate and
   conclusive hints of one. And for the best of all reasons, because it
   would have been entirely contrary to the spirit of Christianity to have
   done so; because the very vitality of Christian principle and the
   conditions of human progress do not admit of the imposition of any
   unvarying system of government, ecclesiastical or civil. The system
   adapts itself to the life, everywhere expands with it or narrows with
   it, but is nowhere in any. particular form the absolute condition of
   life. A definite outline of Church polity, therefore, or a definite
   code of social ethics, is nowhere given in the New Testament; and the
   spirit of it is entirely hostile to the absolute assertion of either
   the one or the other. Calvin, in truth, must have felt this
   sufficiently in his constant appeal to the spirit and details of the
   Old Testament legislation. The historical confusion, in this respect,
   in which he and all his age shared, was a source of fruitful error here
   as elsewhere.

   But what of the Church, then, and Church authority? Do they not
   disappear altogether in such a view as that suggested? No; not in the
   least. They appear, on the contrary, in their only true and divine
   light, as resting on Scripture, but not as absolutely contained and
   defined in it. There is and ought to be in both a rightful conformity
   with Scripture, as with the growth of the Christian Reason in history.
   The Church is everywhere a positive divine institution resting on these
   two bases--on the latter not less than the former, as constituting no
   less, really and practically, a jus divinum. For the renewed assertion
   of the positive character and educational necessity of the Church, and
   for the fresh element of strength thus imparted to Protestantism, we
   are indebted to Calvin; but his special theory of the Church is not
   more authoritative than any other theory. Neither his Church nor any
   Church is necessarily and absolutely the divine institution. Turn some
   arbitrary ritual element in front, whether Romanistic or Calvinistic,
   and make it the divine, and you invert the truly divine method. This
   always turns the moral elements in front--the rights of faith, the
   rights of reason and of charity; and the ritual follows as a fitting
   and shifting vestment. The spirit, in short, dominates, the form
   serves; and it was Calvin's great error--and is, alas! by no means an
   extinct error of Protestantism--to forget this fundamental law of the
   divine, which we can never alter save at our peril.

   While claiming this divine freedom, without which truth can nowhere
   live, it becomes us at the same time to remember that the highest
   freedom is always bound fast in moral law. This, the essential spirit
   of Puritanism, is eternal, whatever may be the temporary character of
   its dogmatical or ecclesiastical machinery. These may perish, as they
   seem in many of their forms decaying; but the earnestness,
   righteousness, purity, and resoluteness, which were the highest meaning
   of Puritanism, and the really valuable growth of Calvinism, can never
   decay without moral and social ruin. Amid all the expansions and
   refinements of modern thought and life, let us hope, therefore, that we
   shall never lose these genuine elements of the Calvinistic spirit; and
   while we open our minds to the higher and more comprehending
   expressions of divine truth that meet us everywhere, and learn a nobler
   wisdom and tolerance amid all our differences, let us, at the same
   time, always remember that there is no strength of good save in the
   Gospel of old, and that the highest dignity and beauty of human life
   are in Him "who did no sin."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] Calvin has been hitherto (1860) unfortunate in biographers,--there
   not being a single life of him with which we are acquainted at once
   adequate in its comprehension of the man and his work, fair and
   critical in its estimate, and interesting in its composition. The work
   of Dyer, published in this country some years ago, is sufficiently
   readable and well composed, but without the pretension of grasping the
   whole subject, and judging it from any comprehensive point of view. The
   work of Henry, in three massive German volumes, and translated, without
   the appendices, into two large English octavos by Dr Stebbing, is,
   either in German or in English, a somewhat unreadable book, with
   certain glimpses of critical insight here and there, but without
   coherence or biographical finish. It is, however, the most adequate, as
   a whole,--being animated by a higher, although scarcely a more
   impartial, spirit than that of Dyer, and embodying, as it does, the
   main contents of the reformer's correspondence,--which happily remain
   to the student, the most instructive and complete sources of his
   history. Two volumes of Bonnet's complete edition of the
   correspondence, containing the French letters, have already appeared.
   Two volumes, containing a selection both from the French and Latin
   letters translated into English, have been published by Mr Constable of
   Edinburgh. Besides a full edition of the Letters, Bonnet promised, so
   long ago as 1854, "Une étude sur Calvin, formant une histoire du
   Reformateur d'après les documents originaux et authentiques;" but
   Bonnet's promised "Study" is still, so far as we know, a promise. Since
   the last edition of this volume, M. Bungener has issued a life of
   Calvin, which has been translated into English (Edin., 1863). A new
   edition of his works, edited by G. Baum, E. Cunitz, and E. Reuss, is in
   course of publication; vol. xxvi. has appeared (1883); and at length
   there is a new life in German by E. Stähelin, adequate to the
   subject--Johannes Calvin: Elberfeld, 1863 (2 vols.)

   [69] Political power rested ultimately, as we have stated in the text,
   in the whole body of the citizens, who were entitled to meet in general
   assembly. A representative body of this council, however, composed of
   sixty members, was constituted in 1457, in order to avoid the
   turbulence arising out of too frequent meetings of all the burgesses or
   citizens. In 1526, after the alliance of Friburg and Berne, a more
   extended representative Council of Two Hundred was appointed, in
   imitation of the constitution of these cities. There was, besides, an
   ordinary executive council, who, in conjunction with the four
   magistrates or syndics of the year, practically administered the
   government of the city.

   [72] "They appointed a meeting with me together at the house of

   There I sinned grievously in not having been able to keep within

   poured out bitterness on all sides. There was certainly some cause for
   indignation, if moderation had only been observed in the expression of
   it. . . . In the conclusion of my speech, I stated my resolution rather
   to die than to subscribe this. Thereupon there was so much fervour on
   both sides, that I could not have been more rude to Caroli himself had
   he been present. At length I forced myself out of the supper-room,
   Bucer following, who, after he had soothed me by his fair speeches,
   brought me back to the test. I said that I wished to consider the
   matter more fully before making any further reply. When I got home I
   was seized with an extraordinary paroxysm, nor did I find any other

   compenrises les mesmes entrées, et huict plats de tout dessert et q'au
   dit dessert y n'ait pastisserie, ou pièce de four, sinon une tourt
   seulement, et cela en chacune table de dix personnes." It is a singular
   and instructive fact that, amid the long-continued decay of religious
   Protestantism in Geneva, the memory of the rigour of Calvin's sumptuary
   laws remains a kind of popular tradition at once ludicrous and
   melancholy. An old man, who pointed out to the writer the supposed
   resting-place of the reformer, seemed to have little other idea of
   Calvin than as the man who limited the number of dishes at dinner!

   [98] Servetus had led a wandering kind of life. Born in 1509 (the same
   year as Calvin), at Villeneuve in Arragon, he had passed into France;
   and in this respect too, like his great adversary, had first devoted
   himself to the study of the civil law at Toulouse. He appears to have
   here taken to the study of the Scriptures, and imbibed his peculiar
   notions of the Trinity. Excited by the movement of the Reformation, he
   set out for Germany, and sought interviews with OEcolampadius at Basle,
   and Bucer and Capito at Strasburg. About this time, viz., in 1531, he
   prepared and published his first book, entitled De Trinitatis Erroribus
   libri septem.' In the following year he published a further volume on
   the same subject, Dialogorum de Trinitate libri duo,' in which he
   reviews and to some extent retracts his previous opinions--not as
   false, but as imperfect. It was not till more than twenty years after
   this that his more elaborate work, which formed the ostensible ground
   of his condemnation, appeared at Vienne anonymously, under the title of
   Christianismi Restitutio.' In the interval he had corresponded with
   Calvin, and furnished him with various statements of his views, and
   even offered to come to Geneva. It is difficult to give any
   intelligible account of his peculiar views. While an anti-Trinitarian,
   he cannot be regarded in any modern sense as a mere Humanitarian or
   Unitarian. The following exposition by Emile Saisset (Revue des deux
   Mondes,' Mars 1848) may interest, but can scarcely enlighten the
   reader. "God, indivisible in Himself, divides Himself in ideas; ideas
   divide themselves in things. God is the absolute unity which creates
   all--the pure essence which essentiates all. Essence and unity descend
   from God to ideas, and from ideas to everything else. He is an eternal
   ocean of existence, of which ideas are the currents and things the
   waves. Ideas, regarded in their entire essence, are the untreated
   light, or the Word of God. So they all emanate from one general and
   superior type, which is the type of human nature, the primitive model
   of all beings. This central idea in which all ideas unite, this sun of
   the world of ideas, this superior and primitive type, this eternal
   model of human nature, is Christ;"--a kind of German transcendentalism
   born out of time, rather than any mere phase of Trinitarian heresy.

   [99] These are the undoubted features of the story. The particular
   circumstances and dates are involved in some obscurity. The common
   statement given both by Henry and Dyer is that he arrived in Geneva in
   the middle of July, and remained nearly a month incognito. Mr Gordon,
   in his ingenious and, upon the whole, very fair pamphlet on Calvin and
   Channing,' London, 1854, shows that there is good reason to doubt this.
   The point is not of much consequence, but the single contemporary
   statement quoted by Mr Gordon, and to which we have already referred,
   is quite decisive ("Postea se vinculis clam elapsus esset venit
   Genevam, et eodem die, videlicet Dominico, audivit concionem post
   prandium"), while neither Henry nor Dyer furnish any evidence for the
   story of the incognito during a month. As to Calvin's statement of his
   wanderings in Italy for four months (per Italiam erravit fere quatuor
   menses), which would of course carry on his arrival in Geneva from July
   to August, I do not think that much can be made of this, as Calvin
   appears to have been in error about his visit to Italy altogether. Upon
   the whole, the probability is against the story of the incognito for a
   month or for any considerable time. The alleged fact of his going to
   church has also been disputed.--See Impartial Hist. of Servetus, p. 82.

   [100] Nicolas de la Fontaine.

   [101] His language on this subject is very pitiable, and, if entirely
   to be credited, reflects infinite disgrace on his persecutors. "Les
   poulx me mangent tout vif, mes chauses sont descirées, et nay de quoy
   changer, ni perpoint ni chamise, que une mechante."--Impartial History
   of Servetus, p. 120.

   [102] Farel was now in his eightieth year, and in very feeble health.
   He sent beforehand intimation of his visit; and the brief letter in
   which Calvin sought to dissuade him from his intention, the last
   probably he ever wrote, is very touching: "Farewell, my best and most
   right-hearted brother, and since God is pleased that you should survive
   me in this world, live mindful of our friendship, of which, as it was
   useful to the Church of God, the fruit still awaits us in heaven. I
   would not have you fatigue yourself on my account. I draw my breath
   with difficulty, and am daily waiting till I altogether cease to
   breathe. It is enough that to Christ I live and die; to His people He
   is gain in life and death. Farewell again, not forgetting the brethren.
   At Geneva, 11th May 1564."--Beza, Vita Calv.

   [105] See Note, Calvin's Letters, vol. i. p. 409, and the expression

   which, however, too much must not be made.--Lit. of Europe, vol. i. p.
   492.

   [106] Beza, Vita Calv.

   [107] The description which Beza has given of Farel's preaching seems
   to indicate a resemblance in this as in other respects between the
   fiery Dauphinese and the great German. "Farel," he says, "excelled in a
   certain sublimity of mind, so that nobody could either hear his
   thunders without trembling, or listen to his most fervent prayers
   without feeling as it were almost carried up to heaven." He adds,
   "Viret possessed such winning eloquence, that his entranced audience
   hung upon his lips. Calvin never spoke without filling the mind of the
   hearer with most weighty sentiments. I have often thought that a
   preacher compounded of the three would have been absolutely
   perfect."--Vita Calv.

   [108] Beza has noticed this, Vita CaIv. "In the doctrine which he
   delivered at the first, he persisted steadily to the last, scarcely
   making any change."

   [109] Preface to Letters'--Constable.

   [110] His words to Knox, quoted by MCrie, are--"Viduitas tua mihi, ut
   debet, tristis et acerba est. Uxorem nactus eras cui non reperiuntur
   passim similes." His letters to Viret indicate perhaps more warmth of
   feeling (vol. ii. pp. 22-24).

   [111] See especially a brief letter to Madame de Cany, vol. ii. p. 323.

   [112] This is the very light in which, Beza tells us, he himself saw
   his work. "He saw how needful it was to put bridles in the jaws of the
   Genevese."

   [113] See his own description of his design, in his address to the
   reader from the edition of 1559.--Tholuck's edit., p. 24.

   esset habiturus homo, antequam ipsum conderet et ideo præsciverit, quia
   decreto suo sic ordinarat.

   [117] Mansel, in his Bampton Lecture.

   [118] It appears singular that a writer of the acuteness and power of
   Mr Mansel should find any satisfaction in the positions which he has
   laid down in his last Lecture. The views there propounded of the
   overbearing authority of what he calls moral miracles, and of the
   absolute dogmatic virtue of all parts of Scripture alike, supposing the
   student to have satisfied himself on the subject of the external
   evidences, are alike untenable and destructive,--ignoring, as they do,
   the obvious conditions of historical criticism, and, by leaving the
   individual judgment helpless before confessed difficulties, simply
   casting it into the arms of the first authority, dogmatic or catholic,
   to which it may incline. The very idea of moral miracle is a
   preconception of the worst kind, and untenable on any grounds of
   enlightened Christian reason. It disappears entirely before the
   principles of modern exegesis, now almost universally accepted, which
   recognises a progress in the ideas of Scripture both intellectual and
   moral, and accounts for the moral difficulties of the Old Testament in
   a natural historical manner.

   [119] Sir William Hamilton, in his notes about Luther (Discussions, p.
   499 et seq.), has indicated a very strong opinion as to the dissolution
   of manners following the Reformation in Germany. There is, however,
   considerable arbitrariness in his assertions, without any clear and
   definite background of evidence. It were well if his notes about Luther
   and the history of Lutheranism, of which he is understood to have had a
   large collection, were in some shape given to the public.

LATIMER

LATIMER.

   IN the English Reformation we contemplate a state of things peculiar
   and unexampled: we do not see, as in Germany, a mighty spiritual
   movement sweeping for the moment all before it, and headed by one who
   gives voice and direction and triumph to it; nor yet, as in the
   Calvinistic Reformation, a great reconstructive organisation of the
   doctrinal and social elements which had been disturbed and set in
   motion; but a complicated action of distinctly political as well as
   religious forces, the former frequently crossing and impeding the
   latter, rather than contributing with them to one great result. This
   characteristic of double action--of the working of political as well as
   religious influences against the Papacy--goes far back into English
   history; and the political opposition is, in truth, the earlier and in
   some respects the more powerful influence. All along from the Conquest,
   such an opposition marks like a line of light the proud history of
   England, the grandest, because the richest in diverse historical
   elements, that the world has ever seen. From the memorable struggles of
   the reign of Henry II., when political and ecclesiastical interests
   stamped the impress of their fierce contention so strongly on the
   English character, Rome appears as an alien and antagonistic power in
   the country--as the threatening shadow of a concealed enemy, against
   which the higher and healthier national life is continually directing
   itself. With the reign of Edward III. and the rise of Wickliffe, the
   religious element attains for the first time to clear and impressive
   prominence, working alongside of, and even outbalancing, the political
   action.

   Wickliffe himself, in the earlier and later phases of his career,
   represents both sides of the national movement against the Papacy--his
   primary position as the friend of John of Gaunt being mainly political,
   and his final position as the Theologian of the Scriptures and Rector
   of Lutterworth being mainly religious. We find in his words the
   powerful echo of the feelings then stirring the heart of England; the
   protesting vehemence of both nobles and people as they raised the cry,
   "No! England belongs not to the Pope; the Pope is but a man, subject to
   sin;" the awakening breath of an earnest Christian activity as he bade
   his followers "Go and preach; it is the sublimest work: but imitate not
   the priests, whom we see after the sermon sitting in the ale-houses, or
   at the gaming-table, or wasting their time in hunting. After your
   sermon is ended, do you visit the sick, the aged, the poor, the blind,
   and the lame, and succour them according to your ability." The same
   principles which afterwards triumphed in the sixteenth century were now
   everywhere operating. It is singular, indeed, how even to its
   extravagances this earlier Reform movement in England mirrored the
   various features of the later and more powerful movement--the royal
   moderation, the parliamentary indignation, the spiritual revival among
   the lower classes, the communistic exaggerations, into which the plain
   truth of the Gospel, crudely apprehended, so fastly ran. This latter
   result, in the comparative swiftness with which it came in the
   fourteenth century, was a sufficient indication that the time was not
   yet ripe for a successful insurrection against Popery. The national
   mind was still too unenlightened, the popular feeling too unsteady for
   such an event, as the armed tumult of Wat Tyler with his hundred
   thousand followers proved. The hierarchy, moreover, was as yet very
   powerful; its intelligence and moral strength outmatched any opposition
   that could be brought against it.

   With the death of Wickliffe in 1384 the moving energy of his principles
   and teaching very much died out. Their unfortunate association with the
   anarchy which characterised the earlier years of Richard II.'s weak and
   disgraceful reign, contributed to lessen and deteriorate their
   influence, and to provoke against them severe parliamentary penalties.
   [121] The spirit, however, which the great proto-reformer had kindled,
   lived on through the fifteenth century in Lollardism, and various
   obscure forms of religious life. It penetrated, as a secret and quiet
   influence, whole districts, binding poor families together by a
   spiritual bond such as they could no longer find in the corrupt
   formalism of the Church, and cherished by the private reading and
   transmission from hand to hand of portions of Wickliffe's translation
   of the Scriptures. We can trace in the language of the parliamentary
   acts directed against "divers false and perverse people of a certain
   new sect, damnably thinking of the faith of the sacraments of the
   Church, and of the authority of the same," how widely religious
   disaffection had spread, and with what unceasing and secret acting--"by
   holding and exercising schools, by making and writing books"--the
   Wickliffites sought to keep alive a pure faith hidden in many hearts,
   long after they had ceased to be a formidable power in the country.
   They spread into Scotland, carrying with them their precious books, and
   kindling wherever they went a divine light in the darkness--a peaceful
   and holy gleam amid the wild contentions and miseries of that unhappy
   time.

   With the dawn of the sixteenth century, and especially as we near the
   great crisis of 1517, we are met by an awakening religious life in
   England as elsewhere; and what mainly strikes us is the varied
   character which it presents. It proceeds from diverse sources, and
   shows itself in very different classes. There is a comparative
   complexity in the Anglican Reformation, even on its purely religious
   side, and altogether apart from the great political agencies at work,
   which are out of the sphere of our present consideration.

   There is first of all a marked Christian revival among the poorer
   classes, alike among the tradesmen of the metropolis and the peasantry
   on the banks of the Humber, the "Christian brethren" of London, and the
   "just men" of Lincolnshire. It seems most natural to connect this
   revival with the still unextinguished spirit of Lollardism, and to
   recognise in it accordingly a fresh outburst from the long-choked-up
   source of Wickliffe's influence. The influence had perished in any
   definite national expression, but there seems no reason to question
   that it lived on as a hidden life; that persecution did not absolutely
   destroy it, but only drove it underground into obscure channels no
   longer traceable, from which it now again, under fresh excitement,
   began to emerge. [122] In any case, we discern at this time abundant
   manifestations of a fresh religious interest among the poor, and it
   appears very much to be characterised by the old Wickliffite spirit of
   contempt and derision of the clergy. Some of the stories preserved by
   Foxe show a proud and bitter cynicism naturally bred by the
   circumstances of these humble people, and the stern repression of all
   the earnest feeling awakened in them. As a. man of the name of John
   Brown was descending the Thames in a passage-boat to Gravesend, he fell
   into conversation with a priest, who insolently admonished him that he
   stood too near to his sacred person. "Do you know who I am?" demanded
   the priest. "No, sir," said Brown. "Well, then, you must know that I am
   a priest." "Indeed, sir!" said Brown; "and pray are you a parson, or
   vicar, or lady's chaplain?" "No; I am a soul priest; I sing masses for
   souls," he pompously replied. "Do you, sir?" remarked Brown; "that is
   well done: and can you tell me where you find the soul when you begin
   mass, and where you leave it when the mass is ended?" "Go thy ways,"
   said the priest; "thou art a heretic, and I will be even with you." And
   straightway, on reaching their destination, he communicated his
   suspicions of Brown to two of his companions and together they set off
   to Canterbury, to denounce the poor man to the archbishop. The result
   was, that after many sufferings Brown expiated his free speech at the
   stake. The story is minutely told by Foxe, and repeated by D'Aubigné;
   [123] and the contrasts of the happy English home, with its quiet
   cheerful domesticities, and the rude seizure, torture, and death of the
   poor man, make a deeply touching picture. Then again, amid the fens of
   Lincolnshire, we are introduced to a peasant threshing his corn in his
   barn as a neighbour passes by and salutes him cheerfully. "Good morrow!
   you are hard at work." "Yes," replied the man, in allusion to the
   priestly doctrine of transubstantiation, "I am threshing God Almighty
   out of the straw." [124] A very deep and intense feeling expresses
   itself in these as in many other incidents of the time. The Catholic
   authority might seem scarcely weakened in outward appearance, but with
   such a spirit slumbering amongst the people, and now constantly
   gathering strength, that authority was really impaired in its very
   foundation, and no longer presented its old capacity of resistance.

   While such a spirit lurked among the people, there had appeared in the
   Church itself a marked revival of Christian and literary interest. A
   group of notable men, with Erasmus in the midst of them, meet us at the
   opening of the sixteenth century in the Church of England--viz., Colet,
   Grocyn, Linacre, Lilly, and More. All, with the exception of More, had
   recently returned from Italy, and some of them from Florence itself,
   where they had been in the very centre, not merely of the literary
   excitement which was then moving the Court of the Medici, but of the
   reformatory movement of Savonarola. The prophetic denunciations of the
   famous preacher of San Marco, which had converted the great scholar
   Pico della Mirandola, and even reached the conscience of Lorenzo de'
   Medici, were not likely to leave the hearts of the young Englishmen
   unimpressed. The scandals of the Papacy, with a Borgia (Alexander VI.)
   at its head, were brought immediately under their notice, and every
   ecclesiastical abuse seen in its full and original enormity.

   It was no wonder if they brought back to England a spirit of reforming
   zeal as well as of intellectual enthusiasm. This spirit was greatly
   promoted by the arrival of Erasmus. Invited by Lord Mountjoy, who had
   been one of his pupils at Paris, and who had listened with delight to
   his opening sallies on the monks, the rising Dutchman came to England
   first in 1497 or 1498. He immediately formed an intimacy with Colet,
   and the circle of enthusiastic scholars of which he was the chief. He
   was in raptures with the friendly reception he everywhere met, with the
   country, even with its climate, and especially with the ladies, and
   their easy manners. [125] He retired for a time to Oxford, where he
   devoted himself, in company with Grocyn, and Colet, and More, to the
   study of Greek. In this delightful seclusion, and amid such
   companionship, he was already laying the foundation of his future
   labours on the Greek Testament.

   Twelve years afterwards, when Henry VIII. had ascended the throne,
   Erasmus came for the third time to England, and prolonged his stay for
   nearly five years. On his first visit he had been introduced to the
   young Henry, then only nine years of age, and was greatly charmed by
   his intelligence, vivacity, and beauty of person; above all, by a
   certain decision and aptitude in everything he undertook. Few boys
   could have been more captivating in all the pride of his youthful
   agility and grace, and with such a rare capacity that his father had
   already destined him to fill the see of Canterbury. Erasmus credited
   him with the highest powers. He proclaimed him the Octavius of England;
   and when the death of his brother and father had raised the young Duke
   of York to the throne, and amidst all the adulation that had greeted
   his accession, it was reported that he had sighed, "Ah! how I should
   like to be a scholar," we can understand the eagerness with which
   Erasmus once more responded to the invitation of his friend Mountjoy,
   "Come, behold the new star; our young Octavius is on the throne." He
   renewed his intimacy with Colet and More. In the house of the latter he
   concluded his famous satire, "Morias Encomium" (Praise of Folly). He
   assisted the former in founding the great school of St Paul's, and
   composed text-books for it. Colet and his friends were encouraged by
   the example of Erasmus, while he in his turn received no small good
   from them. They defended his attacks upon the monks: he learned from
   their teaching a nobler zeal and more Christian use of his powers than
   he had yet shown. While the satires of the great Humanist connect him
   with Paris, Germany, and Italy, his Greek studies and Greek New
   Testament connect him especially with England.

   Of all this band of men that ushered in the Anglican Reformation, none
   is more illustrious than Colet himself. Scholar, Christian, and
   patriot, the faithful preacher, the earnest worker, his name is among
   the most respected, if not the brightest, in the religious annals of
   England. Unlike Erasmus, whose faith, according to his own confession,
   was never such as would lead him to expose his life to danger for it,
   Colet was ready for any sacrifice to maintain the truth. Unlike More,
   his piety was free from that dark tinge of asceticism which so readily
   develops into cruelty and the love of persecution. He did not hesitate
   to proclaim before Henry VIII., in all the first excitement of his
   power and thirst for glory, the injustice of his intended war with
   France. "Whoever takes up arms from ambition," he said, "fights not
   under the standard of Christ, but of Satan." When he became Dean of St
   Paul's, he set the example of preaching from Scripture instead of from
   the Schoolmen. He explained to the people, who came in crowds to hear
   him, the Gospel of St Matthew, and translated into English, and
   distributed among them, certain portions of Scripture, such as the
   Lord's Prayer. At the opening of the Convocation of 1511, he preached a
   famous sermon on Conformation and Reformation, choosing for his text
   the words, "Be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye reformed," &c.
   In this sermon he inveighed strongly against the worldly love of the
   clergy, their "feasts and banquetings," their "hunting and hawking,"
   their covetousness and ambition. "There is no heresy more dangerous to
   the Church," he said, "than the vicious lives of its priests. A
   reformation is needed; and that reformation must begin with the bishops
   and be extended to the priests." Many of the clergy took alarm, and
   sought to silence him; but, strong in his integrity and moderation, as
   well as in the truth he preached, he maintained his position and
   influence till his death in 1519.

   In the meantime a new and more vigorous reforming influence was
   beginning in the universities. The publication of Erasmus's Greek
   Testament, and the news from Germany, started a spirit of inquiry in
   both universities almost simultaneously. Students, wearied with the
   subtleties of the schools, felt a fresh world opened to them in the
   original pages of the Gospels and Epistles. They read; and as they
   read, a new impulse came to them from their own quiet study. It was
   impossible that, amid the religious excitement everywhere astir, young
   and earnest and aspiring minds could be brought into contact with the
   divine Word without catching the life that in every page appealed to
   them, and being drawn under its stimulating power. Luther's opinions,
   propagated to the very centres of the old Catholicism of England,
   helped this awakening. His writings passed from hand to hand under
   every attempt to suppress them; and the enthusiasm of his great example
   gave effect to his daring words. The reform movement in the English
   universities, however, retained a distinctive spirit of its own.
   Although indebted to the writings of Luther, it was still more indebted
   to the Greek Testament, and in its whole spirit was characteristically
   English. There was an earnestness and yet moderation in it--an
   intensity practical rather than doctrinal,--a simplicity and purity of
   Christian apprehension which, without lacking vigour, shrank
   sensitively from all violence--eminently notable, and corresponding to
   its source in the ancient seats of learning, and in the original soil
   of Scripture, rather than in the cloister, and in the solitary
   struggles of any one great and vehement soul.

   The three names that may be said to represent the earlier phase of this
   movement are those of Tyndale, Bilney, and Frith, whom we find
   associated at Cambridge in the year 1520. Tyndale was a native of
   Gloucestershire, and descended from an old family which had suffered
   greatly in the Wars of the Roses. He was early sent to Oxford, where he
   became the pupil of Grocyn and Linacre, and imbibed their liberal
   principles, and especially their love of the Greek New Testament.
   Gradually his mind opened to the great truths which it revealed; and,
   collecting around him "certain students and fellows, he read privily to
   them, and instructed them in the knowledge and truths of the
   Scriptures." [126] The monks arose against him, denounced his Greek
   learning and the doctrines that he taught; and he fled to Cambridge.
   Here he found Bilney, who, like himself, had been some time before
   drawn to the study of Erasmus's Testament, and, after much struggle,
   had reached the same truth in which he rested. Weary with fasting and
   vigils, and buying of masses and indulgences, in which he could find no
   peace, he at length lighted on the precious words of St Paul, "This is
   a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save sinners." "This one sentence," he says,
   "through the power of God working on my heart, in a manner at that time
   unknown to me, rejoiced my soul, then deeply wounded by a sight and
   sense of my sins, and almost in the depths of despair, so that I felt
   an inward comfort and quietness which I cannot describe, but it caused
   my broken heart to rejoice." Frith was the worthy associate of these
   two men. He was distinguished in mathematics as Tyndale was in
   classics. He was not only a "lover of learning," Foxe says, but "an
   exquisite learned man;" [127] of which we need no higher proof than
   Wolsey's appointment of him to be one of the masters of the new college
   which he had instituted at Oxford. Through his acquaintance with
   Tyndale, he first received into his heart the seed of the Gospel, and
   of sincere godliness; [128] and together with Bilney, they laboured to
   promote the good cause in Cambridge.

   These men, and especially Tyndale, exercised a powerful influence in
   awakening the religious life of England. After leaving Cambridge
   Tyndale retired to his native country, and resided for some time as
   tutor in the house of Sir John Walsh. Here he was in the habit of
   holding disputations with the various clergy--"abbots, deans,
   archdeacons, with divers other doctors and great beneficed men" that
   resorted to the house. He appealed openly to Scripture in confutation
   of their errors and in support of his own opinions. At the same time he
   was busy preparing his Christian Soldier's Manual,' which had the
   effect of fully converting his host and hostess to his views, so that
   the "doctorly prelates" were no more so often invited to the house, nor
   received the same welcome as before. [129] Tyndale, it may be imagined,
   soon became an object of hatred to the clergy, and felt that he was no
   longer safe in the country. He was burning, moreover, with desire to
   enter upon his great work of translating the Scriptures into the
   English tongue. He could find "no place in all England" to do this, and
   accordingly he repaired to Hamburg, and there set about his design. At
   length, in 1524, his version of the New Testament appeared at Worms,
   and copies found their way rapidly into England. Tonstall, Bishop of
   London, employed a person to buy them all up; but the presses of the
   Low Countries supplied them more swiftly than they could be bought and
   consumed. The volumes circulated widely, and the light thus kindled
   spread throughout the country.

   In the universities the movement continued to strengthen and grow into
   prominence. New Testaments and heretical tracts passed numerously from
   hand to hand. All the vigilance of the authorities failed to check the
   inroads of a literature which was fast sapping their power, and the
   effects of which some of them fully discerned. They seized and burned
   volumes without number; but new agents, with increased supplies of the
   prohibited volumes, arose on all sides. A very minute and interesting
   narrative has been preserved of the search instituted at Oxford for
   Master Garret, who had come down to the university loaded with Greek
   Testaments and other "mischievous books." By the help of a friend,
   Anthony Delaber, he contrived for the time to escape; but subsequently
   he was captured, and, along with Delaber himself, Clarke, Farrar, and
   others, imprisoned and threatened with the stake. Clarke died in
   prison, a confessor to the truth that he had maintained, declaring with
   his last breath that the "true sacrament is faith." The courage of the
   others gave way under their sufferings [130] --they recanted, and bore
   fagots as Barnes had done at St Paul's. The Oxford authorities breathed
   for a while in their labours of persecution; but the number of names
   mentioned in Delaber's narrative shows how widely extended were the
   ramifications of heresy, and how deeply the "poison" had penetrated the
   minds of many of the most promising youth.

   In Cambridge the movement had taken even deeper root. The labours of
   Tyndale and Bilney had not been without their reward; and, passing over
   names of lesser note, such as Barnes, we find a group of men like
   Cranmer and Ridley and Latimer, rising into prominence during the years
   that succeeded the conversion of Frith in 1520. These were all
   Cambridge students, and about the same period. There is no evidence of
   concert or of any special friendship between them thus early; but the
   spirit which afterwards united them, and the faith for which they
   suffered in common, are to be traced back beyond doubt, in the case of
   all of them, to this period of remarkable excitement in Cambridge. They
   are the three chief names of the English Reformation, so far as we are
   able to contemplate it distinctly as a religious movement. They did
   more than any others to advance it, and in their lives and in their
   deaths they reflect its character, and constitute its tragedy and
   glory.

   Of the three it may be a question which is most entitled singly to
   represent it. Cranmer is historically the most prominent: he stood most
   in the light of the great public events of his time, and was the
   official leader, we may say, of the movement, upon which he impressed
   somewhat of his own hesitating and timid, but practical and modest
   character. He was not a lofty nor far-seeing man, and by no means a
   hero; but his difficulties were peculiar and his instincts honest, and
   by his very weakness he accomplished what perhaps another's strength
   could not have done. Ridley presents a more pure, elevated, and
   consistent character--"wise of counsel, deep of wit, benevolent in
   spirit." [131] His gentleness wins us, while his scholarly and calm
   intrepidity fills us with admiration. Latimer is in many respects the
   most remarkable of the three. Less prominent than Cranmer, less learned
   than Ridley, his life possessed a broader interest, while his labours
   excited a more general enthusiasm than theirs. He connected far more
   than either of them the religious spirit moving the lower and the
   citizen ranks of society, with the spirit at work in the universities.
   Academic in education, he was in heart and mind a man of the people: to
   some extent a leader in the ranks of the Episcopate, he of all the
   bishops most influenced and led the popular feeling. We have selected
   him, therefore, to stand as the representative hero of the English
   Reformation. His claims to this position, indeed, are very different
   from those which place Luther and Calvin and Knox at the head of their
   respective movements; and with such names it may seem somewhat out of
   place to associate that of Latimer. But no single name in England
   possesses the glory of a primary and paramount leadership in the
   religious movement of the age. We do not find, as in Germany and
   Switzerland and Scotland, any single figure towering above all the
   others in mental and moral greatness, but groups of figures such as we
   have noticed, each with their own claims to distinction and notice; and
   as we must make a selection, Latimer appears, upon the whole, the most
   typical in combined display of character, and of popular activity, and
   in the real influence which he exercised upon the course of the
   Reformation.

   The life of Latimer remains unwritten, and there are probably no longer
   materials for any adequate biography. We shall endeavour, however, in
   the light of such facts as exist in Foxe's Acts' [132] and Strype's
   Memorials,' and particularly in the light of the vivid picture-work of
   his own sermons, to furnish as complete a sketch as we can of his
   career and labours. There are in these many graphic and not a few
   grotesque etchings, giving us the very life of the man; but it is
   difficult to catch throughout a clear view and any continuous thread of
   narrative, tracing the whole and binding it in order.

   Latimer was born at Thurcaston in Leicestershire in the year 1490, some
   say 1491. His father was an honest yeoman, and it is his own hand, in
   the first sermon which he preached before King Edward VI., that has
   drawn for us the paternal character and homestead. "My father," he
   says, "was a yeoman, and had no lands of his own, only he had a farm of
   three or four pounds by the year at the uttermost, and hereupon he
   tilled so much as kept half-a-dozen men. He had walk for a hundred
   sheep, and my mother milked thirty kine. He was able and did find the
   King in harness, with himself and his horse, while he came to the place
   that he should receive the King's wages. . . . He kept me to school,
   else I had not been able to preach before the King's majesty now. He
   married my sisters with five pounds or twenty nobles apiece; so that he
   brought them up in godliness and fear of the Lord. He kept hospitality
   for his poor neighbours, and some alms he gave to the poor. All this he
   did of the said farm" [133] --evidently a worthy, solid, and able man,
   fit to do his work in this world, and leave the memory of his worth, if
   not much more, to his children.

   Latimer grew up in this old English household a vigorous, pure, and
   happy boy; health and manly life and a joyous feeling of home breathe
   in all the hints he has given us of his youth. When only six or seven
   years old, he tells us that he helped to buckle on his father's armour
   when he went to the field of Blackheath, where the King's forces were
   encamped against the Cornish rebels. It was a time of stir. Henry VII.
   had been at this period about ten years upon the throne, but the embers
   of a century's internecine strife were still only dying out. Latimer's
   father was stanch in his devotion to the new government, as this event
   shows; he had all a yeoman's devotion to fighting, and to the grand old
   art of cross-shooting--"God's gift to the English nation above all
   other nations, and the instrument whereby He had given them many
   victories against their enemies." [134] He was careful to train his
   children in the love of the same soldierly arts; and the reformer
   afterwards recalled these exercises of his youth with pride, in
   contrast with the degenerate and vicious recreations of his own age.
   "My father," he says, [135] "was as diligent to teach me to shoot as to
   learn any other thing: he taught me how to draw, how to lay my body in
   my bow, and not to draw with strength of arms as other nations do, but
   with strength of the body. I had my bows bought me according to my age
   and strength: as I increased in them, so my bows were made bigger and
   bigger; for," he adds, in a quaint didactic vein not uncommon with him,
   as to the affairs of the present life as well as of that to come, "men
   shall never shoot well except they be brought up in it: it is a goodly
   art, a wholesome kind of exercise, and much commended in physic."

   So Latimer grew up, hardily trained in body as well as in mind. An
   atmosphere of reality surrounded his boyhood; he looked at life and
   nature in the fresh and rough yet beautiful forms in which they
   surrounded him in the old Leicestershire farmhouse, and the impressions
   then gathered never left him, and long afterwards helped to deliver him
   from the falsehoods of his scholastic training, when the higher
   quickening came to stir the true heart in him.

   About fourteen years of age he was sent to Cambridge; and D'Aubigné has
   noticed that the year 1505, when he entered the university, was the
   same year in which Luther entered the Augustine convent at Erfurt. He
   is said to have been a very diligent and industrious student. In 1509,
   whilst yet an undergraduate, he was chosen Fellow of Clare Hall. In the
   following January he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts, and proceeded
   to that of Master of Arts in July 1514. Up to this period, when he had
   attained his twenty-fourth year, we do not learn anything of his
   religious views--for the best of all reasons, probably, that there was
   nothing to learn. He fell into the habits of the place in this as in
   other things, and probably had as yet few serious thoughts about the
   matter. He seems to have carried into his college life the heartiness
   and cheerfulness of the yeoman's son--for it is to this earlier period,
   most likely, that the following description and story apply: "There was
   a merry monk in Cambridge in the college that I was in, and it chanced
   a great company of us to be together, intending to make good cheer and
   to be merry, as scholars will be merry when they are disposed. One of
   the company brought out this sentence--Nil melius quam lætari et facere
   bene' There is nothing better than to be merry and to do well. A
   vengeance of that bene,' quoth the monk; I would that bene had been
   banished beyond the sea: and that bene were out it were well, for I
   could be merry, but I love not to do well.'" [136]

   From 1514 Latimer betook himself to the study of divinity--"of such
   school divinity as the ignorance of that age did suffer"--and became
   exceedingly zealous in support of the established doctrines and
   services. As Luther said of himself that he was a "most insane Papist,"
   so he says, "I was as obstinate a Papist as any in England." He was
   haunted with scrupulous and tormenting fears as to whether he had
   sufficiently mingled water with the wine in performing mass, as the
   missal directs; and on the occasion of his taking his degree of
   Bachelor in Divinity, the date of which is not preserved, he directed
   his "whole oration" against Melanchthon and his opinions. He appears
   about the same time to have distinguished himself by his hostility to
   Master George Stafford, "reader of the divinity lectures at Cambridge,"
   who had become imbued with the "new learning," and succeeded in turning
   many of the youth who attended him to the study of the Holy Scriptures,
   from those "tedious authors," as Foxe calls them, in which Latimer
   still found his delight. He is represented as entering Stafford's
   lecture-room, and "most spitefully railing against him," [137] while he
   eloquently sought to persuade the youth against his teaching. [138]

   Here, therefore, we have the old picture of youthful sacerdotal zeal.
   It is the very highest qualities of the ancient system that the new
   spirit seizes upon and consecrates to its service. Young Latimer,
   hailed by the clergy as a rising champion of the papal cause, and for
   his talents and the excelling sanctimony of his life, preferred to be
   the keeper of the university cross, [139] is destined to become the
   sharp reprover of the clergy, and the great agent in carrying out the
   religious changes then threatening them.

   Bilney, we have already remarked, was one of the most active in the new
   movement. He had watched with interest the progress of Latimer. He
   appreciated his high qualities, and saw how much could be made of his
   zeal, if only it could be turned in the right direction. He had been
   one of his auditors when, as Bachelor of Divinity, he lectured against
   Melanchthon, and the thought was forced upon him of trying what he
   could do to convert the youthful enthusiast. His device was a strange
   one, and will be best narrated, with the results that followed, in
   Latimer's own brief words. "Bilney heard me at that time, and perceived
   that I was zealous without knowledge; and he came to me afterwards in
   my study, and desired me, for God's sake, to hear his confession. I did
   so; and, to say the truth, by his confession I learned more than I did
   before in many years. So from that time forward I began to smell the
   Word of God, and forsook the school doctors and such fooleries." [140]

   Such was the turning-point in Latimer's spiritual history. We do not
   impart more meaning to his. simple statement by dwelling upon it, and
   trying tc point out more particularly the influences whirl moved him.
   One earnest heart in communion with another regarding their deepest
   secrets before God, is all that we are permitted to see. The effect
   produced on Latimer was decided. "Whereas before he was an enemy, and
   almost a persecutor of Christ, he was now a zealous seeker after Him."
   [141] He was frequently in conference with Bilney; and he sought out
   Stafford to beg his forgiveness for his former rudeness to him. His
   change of religious feeling immediately began to assume a practical
   form. He accompanied Bilney in visiting the sick and the prisoners in
   the tower of Cambridge; and by-and-by he felt that he was called even
   to a nobler work than his friend. His energy and enthusiasm began to
   find their natural outlet in the pulpit. Recognising this as above all
   his vocation, "he preached mightily in the university day by day, both
   in English and ad clerum, to the great admiration of all men who
   aforetime had known him of a contrary severe opinion.'' [142]

   Cambridge was greatly excited by Latimer's discourses. The spirit which
   had been working secretly in it for some time now became manifest. The
   fruit of Bilney's prayers and of Stafford's divinity lectures showed
   itself in the enthusiasm which welcomed the earnest preacher, and the
   eagerness especially with which the students gathered round him and
   drank in his clear and powerful words. To one of these students, Thomas
   Becon, who afterwards became chaplain to Cranmer, we are indebted for
   some brief hints of the character and effect of these early sermons of
   Latimer. "I was present," Becon says, [143] "when, with manifest
   authorities of God's Word, and arguments invincible, besides the
   allegations of doctors, he proved in his sermons that the Holy
   Scriptures ought to be read in the English tongue of all Christian
   people, whether they were priests or laymen, as they be called. . . .
   Neither was I absent when he inveighed against temple-works, good
   intents, blind zeal, superstitious devotion, as the painting of
   tabernacles, gilding of images, setting up of candles, running on
   pilgrimage, and such other idle inventions of men, whereby the glory of
   God was obscured, and the works of mercy the less regarded. I remember
   also how he was wont to rebuke the beneficed men, with the authority of
   God's Word, for neglecting and not teaching their flock, and for being
   absent from their cures,--they themselves being idle, and masting
   themselves like hogs of Epicurus's flock, taking no thought though
   their poor parishioners miserably pine away, starve, perish, and die
   for hunger. Neither have I forgotten how at that time he condemned
   foolish, ungodly, and impossible vows to be fulfilled, as the vow of
   chastity, &c. O how vehement was he in rebuking all sins, and how sweet
   and pleasant were his words in exhorting unto virtue!"

   The practical, earnest, undoctrinal character of Latimer's earlier as
   of his later preaching is clearly shown in this description. He aimed,
   in the same spirit as Tyndale, to bring the minds of men in contact
   with the living truth of Scripture--to divert them from all mere
   pretences of religion, the mockery and uselessness of which he had
   himself been brought to feel, to the real interests and duties of the
   Christian life. He spoke from the heart of his own fresh experience,
   swayed by an enthusiasm not wild or stormy, but direct, vehement, and
   caustic; and the effect was irresistible on all who heard him. "He
   spake nothing," continues Becon, "but it left, as it were, certain
   pricks or stings in the hearts of the hearers, which moved them to
   consent to his doctrine. None but the stiff-necked and uncircumcised in
   heart went away from his sermons without being affected with high
   detestation of sin, and moved to all godliness and virtue. I did know
   certain men which, through the persuasion of their friends, went unto
   his sermons swelling blown full, and puffed up, like unto Esop's frog,
   with envy and malice towards him; but when they returned, the sermon
   being done, and demanded how they liked him and his doctrine, they
   answered, with the bishops' and Pharisees' servants, There was never
   man that spake like unto this man!'" According to another testimony,
   [144] the practical results of these sermons were equally decided.
   "Numbers were brought from their will-works, as pilgrimage and setting
   up of candles, unto the work that God commanded expressly in His Holy
   Scripture, and to the reading and study of God's Word." To his
   preaching Latimer added works of charity and piety, not less impressive
   in their influence. "He watered," continues the admiring Becon, "with
   good deeds whatsoever he had before planted with godly words."

   A time not merely of excitement but of blessing had come to Cambridge;
   a new life was spreading in the university and the city; hearts were
   awakened and disciples multiplying, and the memory of this happy period
   of evangelical revival was long preserved in the popular
   doggerel--"When Master Stafford read, and Master Latimer preached, then
   was Cambridge blessed."

   Such a state of things could not last long without opposition. It was
   not to be supposed that the clergy could quietly contemplate the daring
   operations of their former champions, now turned against them. It was
   not in human nature, and certainly not in clerical nature, to do this.
   A feeling of amazement and humiliation may at first have kept them
   silent; but soon they began to realise the peril of their position and
   the necessity of action; or, to use the words of old Foxe, "Belike
   Satan began to feel himself and his kingdom to be touched too near, and
   thereforethought it time to look about him, and to make out his men of
   arms." The devil's men of arms accordingly appear in "whole swarms of
   friars and doctors, who flocked against Mr Latimer on every side."

   It is not easy to trace the chronological succession of the
   difficulties and controversies into which Latimer was now plunged.
   Already to some extent the guidance of dates has forsaken us. Our last
   date was 1514, when he had taken his Master's degree, and between this
   and 1529, or during a period of fifteen years, we have no very distinct
   thread of chronological arrangement. A general statement of his own,
   that he "walked in darkness and the shadow of death" until he was
   thirty years of age, enables us to fix his entrance upon his new career
   about 1521. The subsequent eight years, representing his first activity
   as a preacher, and now described as so memorable in their results,
   remain in great confusion. According to Foxe, the famous sermons "on
   the Card" would seem to have been among the first causes of excitement
   and disturbance against him. But we learn from Foxe's own statement
   that these sermons were not preached till about Christmas 1529, and
   there is every reason to conclude, therefore, that the interference of
   the Bishop of Ely, and the reformer's citation before Wolsey at the
   instance of "divers Papists in the university," who made a "grievous
   complaint" against him, occurred in the interval between 1521 and this
   later period.

   The story of his encounter with Bishop West is very characteristic. He
   was preaching one day ad clerum in the university, when the bishop,
   attended by a troop of priests, entered the church. Latimer paused
   until they had taken their seats, and then remarking that a new
   audience demanded a new theme, said that he would alter his intended
   topic of discourse, and preach from Heb. ix. 11, "Christus existens
   Pontifex futurorum bonorum,"--"Christ a high priest of good things to
   come." From this text he took occasion to represent Christ as "the true
   and perfect pattern unto all other priests;" and in his usual pithy
   manner drew out the contrasts between this pattern and the English
   prelates of the day. It may be imagined that the bishop was not
   particularly pleased. He sent for Latimer and held some parley with
   him, commending his talents, and urging him to display them in a sermon
   against Luther from the same pulpit. Latimer, however, was not to be
   ensnared, and boldly replied, "If Luther preaches the Word of God, he
   needs no confutation; but if he teaches the contrary, I will be ready
   with all my heart to confound his doctrine as much as lies in me." The
   bishop cautioned him that "he smelled somewhat of the pan," and that he
   would one day or another repent his conduct. He forthwith issued an
   edict forbidding him to preach any more within the churches of the
   university; but Latimer found refuge in the church of the Augustine
   Friars, [145] which was exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, and there
   continued his stirring sermons. The bishop, along with others,
   complained to Wolsey, who sent for the bold preacher, and held an
   interview with him which has been preserved in detail in Strype's
   Memorials.' It presents a very good picture of the courtly, magnificent
   cardinal, and the plain-spoken and ready preacher.

   The scene was "York Place"; "there, attending upon the cardinal's
   pleasure, the reformer was called before him into his inner chamber by
   the sound of a little bell which the cardinal used to ring when any
   person should come or approach unto him. When Mr Latimer was before him
   he well-advised him, and said, Is your name Latimer?' Yea, forsooth,'
   quoth Latimer. You seem,' quoth the cardinal, that you are of good
   years, nor no babe, but one that should wisely and soberly use yourself
   in all your doings; and yet it is reported to me of you that you are
   much infected with this new fantastical doctrine of Luther, and
   suchlike heretics; that you do very much harm among the youth and other
   light heads with your doctrine.' Your grace is misinformed,' Latimer
   replied; for I ought to have some more knowledge than to be so simply
   reported of, by reason that I have studied in my time both of the
   ancient doctors of the Church and also of the school-doctors.' Marry,
   that is well said,' quoth the cardinal; Mr Doctor Capon, and you, Mr
   Doctor Marshall' (both being then present), say you somewhat to Mr
   Latimer touching some question in Dunce.' Whereupon Dr Capon propounded
   a question to Mr Latimer. Mr Latimer being fresh then of memory, and
   not discontinued from study as those two doctors had been, answered
   very roundly; somewhat helping them to cite their own allegations
   rightly, where they had not truly nor perfectly alleged them. The
   cardinal, perceiving the ripe and ready answering of Latimer, said,
   What mean you, my masters, to bring such a man before me into
   accusation? I had thought that he had been some lightheaded fellow that
   never studied such kind of doctrine as the school-doctors are. I pray
   thee, Latimer, tell me the cause why the Bishop of Ely and others doth
   mislike thy preaching: tell me the truth, and I will bear with thee
   upon amendment.' Quoth Latimer, Your grace must understand that the
   Bishop of Ely cannot favour me, for that not long ago I preached before
   him in Cambridge a sermon of this text--"Christus existens Pontifex,"
   &c., wherein I described the office of a bishop so uprightly as I
   might, according to the text, that never after he could abide me; but
   hath not only forbidden me to preach in his diocese, but also found the
   means to inhibit me from preaching in the university.' I pray you tell
   me,' quoth the cardinal, what thou didst preach before him upon that
   text.' Mr Latimer plainly and simply (committing his cause unto
   Almighty God, who is director of princes' hearts) declared unto the
   cardinal the whole effect of his sermon preached before the Bishop of
   Ely. The cardinal, nothing at all misliking the doctrine of the Word of
   God that Latimer had preached, said unto him, Did you not preach any
   other doctrine than you have rehearsed?' No, surely,' said Latimer. And
   examining thoroughly with the doctors what else. could be objected
   against him, the cardinal said unto Mr Latimer, If the Bishop of Ely
   cannot abide such doctrine, you shall have my licence, and preach it
   unto his beard, let him say what he will!' And thereupon, after a
   gentle monition, the cardinal discharged him with his licence home to
   preach throughout England." [146]

   His two sermons "on the Card" are the earliest of his printed sermons
   that we possess. These discourses, so remarkable in their quaintness,
   and the keen and plain tone of their practical exhortation, renewed the
   monkish commotion against him in the university. The prior of the Black
   Friars, one Buckenham, tried to rival him as a preacher, and to outdo
   him even in his peculiar line of homely popular allusion. "About the
   same time of Christmas," [147] Foxe says, [148] "When Mr Latimer
   brought forth his cards (to deface belike the doings of the other), the
   prior brought out his Christmas dice, casting them to his audience
   cinque and quator;" and in some unintelligible manner aiming, through
   this poor counter-device to Latimer's symbolic cards, to prove the
   inexpediency of entrusting the Scriptures in English to the vulgar. The
   prior's sense and eloquence seem alike to have been at fault. He
   brought forward the most miserable arguments against the use of the
   Scriptures; as, for example, that the ploughmen, when hearing that "no
   man that layeth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is worthy of
   the kingdom of God," might peradventure cease from his plough; and that
   the baker, in a similar manner, might be induced to leave his bread
   unleavened on hearing that "a little leaven corrupteth a whole lump."
   It was a dangerous line of argument to enter upon with an opponent like
   Latimer, who had so keen an eye for the comic aspects of stupidity. He
   had been an auditor of the friar's, and taken note of such points for
   future use. Soon after he is the preacher, and the friar a listener
   among "a great multitude, as well of the university as of the town, met
   with great expectation to hear what he would say." The arguments of the
   friar were dallied with in a manner that must have touched the quick
   even beneath his thick conceit. Such figures of speech, the preacher
   said, were no worse to be understood than the most common
   representation of painters, such as they paint on walls and on houses.
   "As, for example," he continued, casting a meaning glance at the friar,
   who sat opposite him, "when they paint a fox preaching out of a friar's
   cowl, none is so mad to take this to be a fox that preacheth, but know
   well enough the meaning of the matter, which is to point out unto us
   what hypocrisy, craft, and subtle dissimulation lieth hid many times in
   these friars' cowls, willing us thereby to beware of them." "Friar
   Buckenham," the chronicler adds, was so "dashed with this sermon, that
   he never after durst peep out of the pulpit against Master Latimer."

   This year of 1529, which presents to us Latimer in hot conflict with
   his popish adversaries in the university of Cambridge, was a memorable
   one in English history. Wolsey had fallen in the beginning of the year;
   Sir Thomas More had been installed as his successor. The country was
   strongly excited on the subject of the negotiations with Rome as to the
   King's divorce, which had been procrastinated from time to time under
   the most wearying pretences. The extortions of the clergy in the
   consistory courts, and the manifold abuses long complained of, but
   still maintained by them, and now grown to an intolerable height, had
   produced a widespread feeling of indignation, which only waited for a
   fitting opportunity to burst forth. Writs were issued for a new
   parliament in the September of this year, and no sooner had it met in
   November, than the feelings of the country found voice in the famous
   petition against the bishops and clergy. The main abuses detailed in
   the petition were afterwards the subject of special legislation; and
   the bench of bishops beheld with amazement bill after bill pass the
   Commons, "all to the destruction of the Church," as Fisher, Bishop of
   Rochester, said. There was no help for it, however; and the "Probate
   and Mortuary Act," the "Clergy Discipline Act," and the "Residence and
   Pluralities Act," rapidly carried through both Houses in defiance of
   episcopal apposition, sufficiently showed the temper of the times, and
   signalised the legislative activity of a brief session of six weeks.

   It deserves to be noticed that, with all this opposition to the clergy,
   the. Parliament of 1529 was so far from having any sympathy with the
   awakened spiritual life represented by such men as Tyndale and Latimer,
   and out of which Protestantism was growing, that it was especially
   anxious to clear itself from all suspicion of countenancing heresy, and
   in fact encouraged the more active prosecution of heretics which was
   about this time commenced.

   In the course of the following year, the differences between Latimer
   and his accusers were the subject of official investigation before the
   Vice-Chancellor. The latter seems to have shrunk from the challenge to
   lay a regular charge against the reformer; and the affair terminated in
   both parties being bound to keep the peace, and to abstain from using
   offensive expressions against each other in the pulpit, on pain of
   excommunication. The virulence of his enemies, rather than the
   imprudent speech of the daring preacher, seems to have called forth
   this judgment.

   Latimer was one of the divines appointed by the university of Cambridge
   to examine into the lawfulness of the King's marriage with Catherine.
   He declared on the side of the King, and the decision of the university
   in favour of the divorce was given on the 9th of March 1530. On, the
   following Sunday he preached before the King, who "greatly praised his
   sermon." Henry, who, whatever may have been his faults, had certainly a
   rare appreciation of character, and a genuine respect for a true and
   able man when he came in his way and was likely to be useful to him,
   appears to have been strongly taken with the honest and unsparing
   preacher. He appointed him one of his chaplains the same year. And
   although he did not take his advice any more now than afterwards,
   unless when it suited him, he extended his friendship to the man who
   had the courage to counsel him in words dictated by no courtly
   interest, but by a manly and unshaken conviction of their truth. Henry
   had, with the sanction of a convention of learned men, issued an
   inhibition against Tyndale's Bible as well as all English books either
   containing or tending to any matters of Scripture. Latimer was one of
   this convention on the part of the university of Cambridge, and one of
   an excepting minority [149] to the advice tendered to Henry, and upon
   which he acted. Unsuccessful in his previous resistance to the course
   of persecution, he addressed an energetic letter to the King on his own
   behalf. It is printed at length by Foxe, and in its spirit, power, and
   eloquence, heroic yet modest, courageous yet respectful, is one of the
   most remarkable of his writings. The King did not yield to the
   remonstrance. "It did not prevail, through the iniquity of the time,"
   says Foxe in his usual way; but so far from displeasing Henry, it seems
   only to have excited in him a more cordial goodwill towards the
   reformer.

   In 1531, Latimer received from the King, at the instance of Cromwell,
   and Dr Butts, the King's physician, the living of West Kington in
   Wiltshire, and, weary of court, he gladly retired to the more congenial
   and earnest labours of his parish. He was not destined, however, to
   enjoy quiet. His unresting spirit would not suffer him to confine his
   preaching to a single congregation; and being one of the twelve
   preachers yearly licensed by the university to preach, with the express
   sanction of the sovereign, throughout the realm, he extended his
   diligence to all the country about. He travelled to Bristol, to London,
   to Kent, everywhere preaching the truth--opportune, importune,
   tempestive, to use the language ironically applied by him to the Bishop
   of London, [150] --and this, too, with his health greatly weakened and
   impaired. His zeal and activity could not long pass without notice.
   Complaints were made against him by the country priests; the bishops
   were on the watch to entrap him; there was no safety for them, and no
   peace, they felt, so long as he was at large, moving the country by his
   marvellous eloquence. They were triumphantly busy just then, besides,
   in the destruction of heretics. Poor Bilney, having wiped out the
   disgrace of his fall [151] in a few months of faithful preaching and
   self-denial, expiated at the stake, in August this year, his Christian
   heroism, not the less grand, certainly, that it was the heroism of a
   trembling and sensitive nature. Bayfield and Tewkesbury followed before
   the expiry of the year; and Bainham, whose affecting interview with
   Latimer is preserved in Strype's Memorials,' crowned the list on the
   5th of May 1532. These were the closing months of the chancellorship of
   Sir Thomas More, around whose memory still lingers the dark stain of
   these dreadful tragedies. But the appetite of the bishops was still
   unsatisfied,--they hungered for more victims; and Latimer became the
   special object of their vengeance. Fortunately they were destined to be
   disappointed.

   The zealous preacher was summoned to appear before Stokesley, the
   Bishop of London, on the ground of his having preached in St Abb's
   Church in the City without the bishop's permission, and, moreover, for
   his alleged defence of Bilney and his cause. His friends expressed
   anxiety for him, and he himself was not without concern, as he knew
   very well that the real aim of the bishop was to get him into the hands
   of the Convocation, and to deal with him summarily for his free speech
   as to the corruptions of the clergy. He pleaded in excuse the length of
   the journey, the deep winter, and the miserable condition of his
   health. [152] He appealed at the same time to his own ordinary, Sir Ed.
   Baynton, the chancellor of the diocese of Sarum, and it is from his
   long and interesting letter on the subject of his appeal that we gather
   these facts, and the state of his feelings at this time. After some
   delay, the citation was formally issued, and Latimer "was had up to
   London, where he was greatly molested, and detained a long time from
   his cure at home."

   The circumstances of his present persecution, and especially the extent
   to which he yielded after being repeatedly examined and remanded, and
   even excommunicated and imprisoned, are involved in some obscurity. His
   trial lasted on through January, February, March, and April, and was
   prosecuted not only before the Bishop of London and the Archbishop
   (Warham) and bishops collectively, but also before the Convocation. The
   bishops devised a series of articles [153] which he was called upon to
   subscribe, and which he at first refused to do, especially objecting to
   two of them, one of which concerned the power of the Pope. For this
   refusal he was pronounced contumacious, excommunicated, and delivered
   up to the custody of Warham. This appears to have occurred in
   Convocation on the 11th of March. On the 21st it was resolved, after a
   long debate, "to absolve him from the sentence of excommunication if he
   should subscribe the two articles in question," and he is represented
   on the same authority as making his appearance at the next sitting, and
   kneeling down and humbly craving forgiveness, confessing that he
   "misordered himself very far, in that he had so presumptuously and
   boldly preached, reproving certain things by which the people that were
   infirm hath taken occasion of ill." It was not till a subsequent day,
   however--the 10th of April--that he is stated to have subscribed the
   eleventh and fourteenth articles, to which he had taken exception; and
   even then he appears to have been in difficulty, owing to some further
   matter having been presented against him, arising out of a letter he
   had written to a graduate at Cambridge. It was then that he appealed to
   the King; and the Convocation was given to understand, by a message
   conveyed through Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, that it was not
   desirable to proceed to further extremities, although the disposal of
   the case was still left in their hands. The end of the affair was that,
   after a further and more special submission, he was relieved of all
   penalties, and "taken into favour again at the special request of the
   King," although with grudging and protest on the part of certain of the
   bishops, who did not think that his submission implied any
   "renunciation of his errors," as was usual in such cases. [154]

   Latimer returned to his parish, but still not to rest. Enemies rose up
   on all sides against him, as he tells us in a letter to his friend
   Morice; for it is to this period that the letter seems to refer.
   Certain priests, who at first had desired and welcomed him, now
   actively sought to stay his preaching because he was not in possession
   of the bishop's licence. They procured certain preachers "to blatter
   against him," and especially one Hubberdin, who distinguished himself
   by his empty violence and ridiculous zeal against the reformer. Foxe
   has given so comical an account of this man and his preaching, that we
   cannot refrain from quoting it: it may serve to give a glimpse of the
   ludicrous features that mingled themselves with the tragical shadows of
   the great struggle that was now proceeding in England. Every cause, for
   the most part, has its buffoon--a man of "no great learning, nor yet of
   stable wit" (as Latimer characterised Hubberdin)--but who makes up for
   better qualities by uproarious zeal, and stands forward in virtue of
   his simple absurdity and grotesque officiousness. In neither Germany
   nor England does Popery seem at this crisis to have lacked such
   supporters.

   "Forasmuch as mention has been made," says Foxe, [155] "of Hubberdin,
   an old divine of Oxford, a right painted Pharisee, and a great strayer
   abroad in all quarters of the realm, to deface and impeach the
   springing of God's holy Gospel, something should be added more touching
   that man, whose doings and pageants, if they might be described at
   large, it were as good as any interlude for the reader to behold. . . .
   But because the man is now gone, to spare therefore the dead, this
   shall be enough for example's sake for all Christian men necessarily to
   observe--how the said Hubberdin, after his long railing in all places
   against Luther, Melanchthon, Zwinglius, John Frith, Tyndale, Latimer,
   and other like professors,--riding in his long gown down to the horses'
   heels, like a Pharisee, or rather like a sloven, dirted up to the
   horse's belly--after his forged tales and fables, dialogues, dreams,
   dancings, hoppings and leapings, with other like histrionical toys and
   gestures used in the pulpit, at last riding by a church side where the
   youth of the parish were dancing in the churchyard, suddenly lighting
   from his horse, he came into the church, and there causing the bell to
   toll in the people, thought, instead of a fit of mirth, to give them a
   sermon of dancing: in the which sermon, after he had patched up certain
   common texts out of the Scripture, and then coming to the doctors,
   first to Augustine, then to Ambrose, so to Jerome, and Gregory,
   Chrysostome, and other doctors, had made every one of them (after his
   dialogue manner) by name to answer to his call, and to sing after his
   tune against Luther, Tyndale, Latimer, and other heretics, as he called
   them,--at last, to show a perfect harmony of all these doctors
   together, as he made them before to sing after his tune, so now to make
   them dance after his pipe, first he called out Christ and His apostles,
   then the doctors and seniors of the Church, as in a round ring, all to
   dance together, with pipe of Hubberdin. Now dance Peter, Paul; now
   dance Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome: and then old Hubberdin, as he was
   dancing with his doctors lustily in the pulpit, how he stampt and took
   on I cannot tell, but crash quoth the pulpit, down cometh the dancer,
   and there lay Hubberdin, not dancing, but sprawling in the midst of his
   audience, where altogether he brake not his neck, yet he so brake his
   leg and bruised his old bones that he never came in pulpit more."

   More prosperous days, however, were about to dawn on Latimer. Old
   Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, died this year; and in the
   following year (1533) Cranmer was elevated to the primacy. This
   distinguished prelate, destined to take so active a lead in the
   progress of the Reformation, to carry it on with his own advance of
   opinion to a higher and more Scriptural expression, and finally to
   crown the labours of his life by martyrdom along with Latimer and
   Ridley, had been a Cambridge student of about the same standing as our
   reformer. [156] Whether or not early friends, they were clearly known
   to each other. Cranmer understood well Latimer's worth; and when raised
   to his exalted position, he extended towards him his protection as
   Primate, and entered into the most confidential relations with him. It
   was now no longer, therefore, a time of persecution with the unresting
   rector of West Kington; the frown of episcopal authority lay on him no
   more, and friars and priests, Hubberdin and Dr Powel of Salisbury, and
   all his other enemies, were forced to retreat, or yield to the powers
   now intrusted to him. At the instance and request of Latimer, we are
   told that "Cranmer was in the habit of licensing divers to preach
   within his province"; and in his own district the reformer was
   empowered to deal with preachers, and even to withdraw their licences
   if he saw fit to do so. [157] Latimer, moreover, was recalled to the
   discharge of his previous duties at the court, and admitted to preach
   before the King on all the Wednesdays of Lent 1534.

   This renewed intercourse with his sovereign probably served to
   strengthen Henry's liking for him, and to bring about the important
   result which followed in the subsequent year. Cromwell is mentioned by
   Foxe as particularly concerned in Latimer's promotion to a bishopric,
   and we may well believe so. The astute secretary and vicar-general, the
   enemy of monks and the intrepid friend of the new movement in all its
   directions, must have recognised a congenial spirit and fellow-labourer
   in the great preacher. They were worthy allies, and trode with equal
   courage, although swayed by somewhat different impulses, the same
   perilous path terminating in death--as noble work commonly did in that
   unhappy time.

   Latimer was consecrated Bishop of Worcester in the autumn of 1535, and
   in the June of the following year we behold him in a position, perhaps,
   save the last of all, the grandest and most trying in his whole life.
   The Convocation assembled on the 9th of June 1536, the nation heaving
   with the excitement of coming change; the clergy sullen with feelings
   of affront and injury; the great question of reform in all its branches
   staring them in the face. The fabric of ecclesiastical abuse had been
   already rudely shaken, but it was obvious that things could not remain
   as they were, and that further and more extensive invasions of clerical
   privilege must come. It was at the request of Cranmer that Latimer, in
   these circumstances, undertook the office of opening the Convocation
   with two sermons, which have been preserved; and which, viewed in the
   light of the situation in which they were uttered, are among the
   boldest sermons ever preached. They ring fresh and powerful in our
   hearts as we read them now, and think of the scowling faces that must
   have looked upon the preacher from priest's hood and abbot's mitre. Mr
   Froude has pictured the scene with such rare spirit and grouping of
   impressive effects, that we cannot venture to touch it save in his
   words.

   "There were assembled in St Paul's on this occasion, besides the
   bishops," he says, "mitred abbots, meditating the treason for which,
   before many months were past, their quartered limbs would be rotting by
   the highways; earnest sacramentarians making ready for the stake; the
   spirits of the two ages, the past and the future, in fierce collision;
   and above them all, in his vicar-general's chair, sat Cromwell, the
   angry waters lashing round him, but, proud and powerful, lording over
   the storm. The present hour was his. The enemies' turn in due time
   would come also. . . . The mass had been sung; the roll of the organ
   had died away. It was the time for the sermon, and Hugh Latimer, Bishop
   of Worcester, rose into the pulpit. Nine-tenths of all those eyes which
   were then fixed on him, would have glistened with delight could they
   have looked instead upon his burning. The whole crowd of passionate men
   were compelled by a changed world to listen quietly while he shot his
   bitter arrows at them. His object on the present occasion was to tell
   the clergy what especially he thought of themselves; and Latimer was a
   plain speaker. They had no good opinion of him. His opinion of them was
   very bad. His text was from the 16th chapter of St Luke's Gospel: The
   children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children
   of light.'" He then presents his readers with a summary of the sermons,
   which, however, we shall not attempt to do. Latimer's words, when they
   are telling, do not bear to be summarised, however they may be
   extracted. One must read them in their natural quaintness and colour in
   order to feel their right force--the vivid and rapid impress which they
   make upon the mind--like a rain of rattling hail upon the ground.

   The conclusion of the second and longer sermon, rising into a strain of
   sweeping ironical urgency that must at once have awed and galled the
   hearts of many who heard him, will afford a good specimen of their
   boldness and power. "If there be nothing to be amended and redressed,
   my lords, be of good cheer--be merry--and at the least, because we have
   nothing else to do. Let us reason the matter how we may be richer; let
   us fall to some pleasant communication. After, let us go home even as
   good as we came hither--that is, right-begotten children of the world,
   and utterly worldlings. And while we live here, let us all make bone
   cheer (bonne chère); for after this life there is small pleasure,
   little mirth for us to hope for, if now there be nothing to be changed
   in our fashions. Let us not say, as St Peter did, Our end approacheth
   nigh': this is an heavy hearing; but let us say as the evil servant
   said, It will be long ere my master come.' This is pleasant. Let us
   beat our fellows; let us eat and drink with drunkards. Surely as oft as
   we do not take away the abuse of things, so oft we beat our fellows. As
   oft as we give not the people their true food, so oft we beat our
   fellows. As oft as we let them die in superstition, so oft we beat
   them. To be short, as oft as we blind lead them blind, so oft we beat,
   and grievously beat, our fellows. When we welter in pleasures and
   idleness, then we eat and drink with drunkards. But God will come, God
   will come; He will not tarry long away. He will come upon such a day as
   we nothing look for Him, and at such hour as we know not. He will come
   and cut us in pieces; He will reward us as He doth the hypocrites. He
   will set us where wailing shall be, my brethren; where gnashing of
   teeth shall be, my brethren. And let here be the end of our tragedy, if
   ye will. . . . But if ye will not thus be vexed, be ye not the children
   of the world. If ye will not die eternally, live not worldly. Come, go
   to, leave the love of your profit, study for the glory and profit of
   Christ: seek in your consultations such things as pertain to Christ,
   and bring forth at the last somewhat that may please Christ. Feed ye
   tenderly, with all diligence, the flock of Christ. Preach truly the
   Word of God. Love the light, walk in the light, and so be ye the
   children of the light while ye are in the world, that ye may shine in
   the world that is to come, bright as the Son with the Father, the Son
   and the Holy Ghost, to whom be all honour, praise, and glory.--Amen."

   The work of the Convocation thus opened was in many respects memorable.
   In this year of 1536, the same year in which Calvin entered Geneva, the
   English Reformation touched its highest point under Henry VIII. Cranmer
   and the King were now united hand in hand, and notwithstanding the
   gloomy displeasure of many of the clergy, a great advance was made. The
   opening sermons were indeed followed up by a memorial to the King on
   the subject of prevailing heresies, containing several thrusts at
   Latimer's supposed opinions. This sufficiently showed the temper of the
   Convocation; but it met in Henry, for the moment, a temper equally
   excited and far more authoritative. He addressed to them in reply a
   series of articles of religion, imposed with a view to the settlement
   of differences. These Articles (the King's own composition, it has been
   supposed [158] ) mark a decided progress of opinion. They still retain
   the cherished doctrine of the corporeal presence in the Eucharist, to
   which Henry's mind clung with a faithful tenacity, and in which both
   Cranmer and Latimer were as yet contented to rest; but the great
   Protestant doctrine of justification by faith is plainly and
   comprehensively asserted; purgatory, in any special sense, and as the
   basis of the gross papal corruption which had so widely prevailed,
   denied; while prayer for souls departed is merely commended as a good
   and charitable deed. "The Articles were debated in Convocation, and
   passed, because it was the King's will. No party was pleased. The
   Protestants exclaimed against the countenance given to superstition;
   the Anglo-Catholics lamented the visible taint of heresy, the reduced
   number of the sacraments, the doubtful language upon purgatory, and the
   silence, dangerously significant, on the nature of the priesthood."
   [159] They were signed, however, by all sides, and remain of great
   interest to this day, as the "first authoritative statement of doctrine
   in the Anglican Church."

   Besides the Articles thus passed, the power of the Pope to call general
   councils was expressly denied; directions were issued for the
   instruction of the people in the Paternoster, the Apostles' Creed, and
   the Commandments, lately published in England; and as the crowning and
   most important act of all, the English Bible was authorised in every
   parish. Every church was "to provide a book of the whole Bible in Latin
   and English, and lay the same in the quire for every man that will to
   read and look thereon." [160]

   Onwards from the point that we have now reached.--where we see Latimer
   in a distinct attitude of authority, as it were, heading the Anglican
   reform movement--it might be supposed that we would be able to trace
   his career in a clear light. This, however, is not the case. After his
   appearance in the Convocation of 1536, he withdraws again from public
   view, and his activity is mainly traceable in quiet works of reform.
   within his own diocese. It is characteristic of him, in comparison with
   all the other reformers, that he nowhere takes an active part in the
   political changes which attended the course of the Reformation. There
   is some reason to think that, not only now, but afterwards, he was a
   chief friend and counsellor of Cranmer, as he was a frequent resident
   at Lambeth; while his letters to Cromwell show what a lively interest
   he cherished in all that was going on, and what constant and ready
   service he continued to render to the Secretary. Still he does not,
   even during the time that he continued to hold his bishopric, stand out
   in any sense as a political leader. His influence seems everywhere
   present, but it does not obtrude itself, save at isolated points, upon
   public notice. We are the less reluctant, therefore, to be obliged to
   sum up in a very brief space the main facts of his future life, and to
   characterise them in general terms.

   First of all, we see him devoting himself with great zeal and diligence
   to his special duty as Bishop of Worcester. This is mainly the view we
   get of him in the vague and desultory notices of Foxe. His life is
   represented as a constant round of "study, readiness, and continual
   carefulness in teaching, preaching, exhorting, writing, correcting, and
   reforming, either as his ability would serve, or else the time would
   bear." This was his true nature; he was eminently practical, wise, and
   prudent, doing what he could, although "the days then were so dangerous
   and variable that he could not in all things do that he would." His
   zeal he reserved for the pulpit. All his episcopal acts were
   characterised by a cautious wisdom and moderation. Where he could not
   remove corruptions altogether, he did his best to amend them: he so
   wrought that they should be used with as little hurt and as much profit
   as might be. Holy water and holy bread, for example, must still be
   dispensed. Neither the priestly nor the popular feeling could
   understand or tolerate their disuse. But he prepared a few plain
   verses, embodying a significant Christian lesson in each case, which he
   instructed the clergy of his diocese to repeat to the people on
   delivering the old symbols. [161]

   In such sort of work we see the genuine spirit of the English
   Reformation--proceeding not from any dogmatic or comprehensive
   principle of an ideal right or good in the Church, but simply working
   onwards under a practical Christian impulse. The "sparkling relics" of
   the old superstition are got rid of for the most part gradually; and
   where, as in the case of some of the most flagrant ecclesiastical
   impostures, [162] we see them fall violently, even the violence is
   legalised--there is an order preserved in it; and the popular feeling,
   where it comes into play, is stimulated by a just indignation at the
   grossness of the delusion practised upon it, rather than by any
   polemical and anti-idolatrous excitement.

   Latimer's cheerful labours in his diocese were no doubt most to his
   heart. A shadow falls upon him so soon as we begin to contemplate him
   in any other capacity. He is in trouble, but ill-satisfied with his
   work; and, worse than all, he is a sharer--we gather from his own
   letter on the subject--a reluctant sharer in one, at least, of the most
   tragic and pathetic of the miserable and contradictory martyrdoms which
   signalise the period.

   In 1537 he was engaged, along with his brethren of the Episcopal bench
   and other divines, in the publication of the book known as The
   Institution of a Christian Man'--a book designed as a religious manual
   for the times. It consisted of an exposition of the Creed, the
   Sacraments, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer, [163] and was
   characterised by a mild and temperate spirit of devotion and great
   beauty of composition. Latimer, however, was but indifferently pleased
   with its doctrines, which formed a reaction rather than an advance upon
   the articles of the previous year. The bishops were obviously, from the
   manner in which he writes on the subject to Cromwell, [164] greatly
   divided about it. "It is a troublous thing," he says, "to agree upon a
   doctrine in things of such controversy with judgment of such diversity,
   every man (I trust) meaning well, and yet not all meaning one
   way. . . . If there be anything either uncertain or impure, I have good
   hope that the King's highness will separare quicquid est veteris
   fermenti; at least, may give it some note that it may appear he
   perceiveth, though he do tolerate it for a time--so giving place for a
   season to the frailty and gross capacity of his subjects."

   It is in the following year (1538) that we find him associated with the
   martyrdom of Friar Forrest. Forrest had been Prior of the Observants'
   Convent at Greenwich. His main offence, like that of Sir Thomas More
   and others, was resistance to the Royal Supremacy Act. He appears to
   have submitted, and been pardoned, and then to have recanted his
   submission. The peculiarity in his case was, that he was finally
   condemned, not under the treason law, according to which his sentence
   might have had some show of justice, but under the law of heresy.
   Certain monstrous articles were devised against him by Cranmer, and he
   was adjudged to the fate of heretics in its most aggravated form. The
   judgment was carried out with unmitigated severity. He was literally
   roasted alive in an iron cage. One shudders to read the account of it,
   and to think that the names of both Cranmer and Latimer remain
   associated with so foul an atrocity. For Cranmer's share in it there
   can be found no excuse, save the usual one of the spirit of the times.
   Latimer's connection with it appears to have been more accidental. He
   was appointed by Cromwell to preach the sermon on the occasion; and
   there is a strange sadness in the way he writes about it, his
   unrelenting humour playing, like a wintry gleam, around the tragic
   story. "And, sir, if it be your pleasure, as it is, that I shall play
   the fool after my customable manner when Forrest shall suffer, I would
   wish that my stage stood near unto Forrest; for I would endeavour
   myself so to content the people that therewith I might also convert
   Forrest, God so helping, or rather altogether working. Wherefore I
   would that he should hear what I shall say, si forte, &c. If he could
   yet with heart return to his abjuration, I would wish his pardon: such
   is my foolishness." [165] He is moved obviously for the unhappy wretch,
   and the work is painful to him; but he cannot help himself, and the
   utterance of pity almost dies on his lips, as if it were something to
   be ashamed of. [166] "Hard times," indeed! (as Foxe complains), which
   could so lock up the warm impulses in Latimer's honest heart.

   An ecclesiastical system which sought to prop itself by such means, was
   plainly in a very fluctuating and unstable condition. It was moved to
   and fro, in fact, by every changing impulse of the royal temper; and
   this temper reflected the agitated spirit of the times. To regard
   Henry's changes as mere brutal caprice, according to the
   long-prevailing traditionary views of his character, is probably what
   few would now do; but to recognise in them throughout a clear principle
   of conviction or intelligent guidance, seems no less absurd, on any
   fair construction of the facts. Henry was true to one thing, and one
   thing alone--his own supposed interest. This, in conjunction with his
   strong national feeling, was in many cases a sufficiently equitable
   rule of statecraft; but we cannot, without an amazing stretch of
   credulity, identify the royal will at all points with the national
   interest, and presume that the King acted from the higher principle.
   Henry is not the monster of the old and uncritical tradition; but he is
   not, even on his historian's own evidence, in the least the hero that
   he has been supposed to be.

   On the present occasion it is easy to understand how a reaction set in.
   The northern insurrections had proved how strong was the hold which the
   old superstitions still had upon the hearts of the people. The King
   himself, having secured his object against Rome, was disposed to cling
   to the Catholic doctrine in its completeness. It was very natural,
   therefore, that a party should spring up, attaching itself, on the one
   hand, to the Royal Supremacy Act, and, on the other hand, very strongly
   to the old ecclesiastical tradition--a party which has received the
   distinctive title of Anglo-Catholic, and which may be briefly
   characterised as doctrinally Romanist, but ecclesiastically Anglican.
   This party evidently represented a strong national feeling. The
   "Pilgrimage of grace," the insurrections in Yorkshire and Lancashire,
   testified to the strength of this feeling; it was such even as
   seriously to affect the stability of the throne; and Henry, true to the
   instinct of serving himself by a proper balance of parties, saw fit at
   this crisis to throw the weight of his influence into the rising party,
   headed in the Church by the well-known names of Gardiner and Bonner.
   The result of this was the six articles of 1539, [167] which undid as
   far as possible the work of the fourteen articles previously passed,
   and sought to check the reforming impulse communicated by them. Cranmer
   laboured with all his might to defeat them, but in vain; and so soon as
   they were confirmed, Latimer resigned his bishopric.

   During the remainder of Henry's reign, Latimer lived in great privacy.
   At first, indeed, he suffered a mild imprisonment in the house of Dr
   Sampson, the Bishop of Chichester: he then appears to have been
   permitted to retire to the country, where he received an injury from
   the fall of a tree, and, coming up to London for medical advice, "he
   was molested and troubled by the bishops"; and finally, in 1546, just
   before the close of Henry's reign, he was brought before the Privy
   Council, and cast into the Tower, where he remained prisoner till the
   time that "blessed King Edward entered his crown." [168] Such is the
   brief sum of all we know of this period of his life. Whether, during
   the time he was at liberty, he continued to preach, is not indicated;
   probably he did not. His imprisonment, his growing infirmities, and the
   dangers around him, may have damped his old ardour and kept him quiet.
   That he considered his own life in danger during his confinement, he
   himself tells us. He had a great interest, he says, to hear of the
   executions in the City, while he was in ward with the Bishop of
   Chichester, "because I looked that my part should have been herein. I
   looked every day to be called to it myself." [169]

   With the accession of Edward VI. he again emerged into public view. He
   remained, however, true to his old character, and not only did not mix
   himself up with political affairs, but declined to receive back his
   bishopric, which was offered to him in the second year of Edward's
   reign. The fact that this offer was made at the instance of the House
   of Commons, gives us a touching glimpse of the popularity of the great
   preacher. His honest character and eloquence had made a deep impression
   on the mind of the country, and it found a voice in this notable
   matter. We can only guess at his reasons for declining an offer so
   honourable to him. The state of his health, and his conscientious
   feeling of inadequacy to the multiplied duties that would devolve upon
   him, [170] probably form the explanation. He felt also that preaching
   was his peculiar vocation, and that he could do more good to the cause
   of the Reformation in this way than in any other. He devoted himself,
   therefore, to the pulpit, and to practical works of benevolence on
   behalf of the poor and the oppressed. Leaving the public ordering of
   the affairs of the Reformation to others, he made it his aim to arouse
   in all classes a practical spirit of reform. He found his most natural
   and powerful source of influence in the eloquence which moved
   congregated thousands, and by his sermons more than anything, his name
   remains memorably associated with the reign of Edward VI. Among the
   other actors of the time, he stands forth as the great reforming
   preacher. The old picture represents him with uplifted arm preaching in
   Whitehall Gardens in front of the young monarch, who is seated at a
   window, while a dense crowd in various attitudes testifies to the
   lively interest which greeted his sermons. "In the same place of the
   inward garden," says Foxe, "which was before applied to lascivious and
   courtly pastimes, there he dispensed the fruitful word of the glorious
   Gospel of Jesus Christ, preaching there before the King and his whole
   court, to the edification of many." [171] We trace him besides at
   Stamford, delivering a series of sermons on the Lord's Prayer before
   the Duchess of Suffolk; and again in Lincolnshire, and at Grimsthorpe.
   "In this his painful travail he occupied himself all King Edward's
   days, preaching for the most part every Sunday twice, to no small shame
   of all other loitering and unpreaching prelates, which occupy great
   rooms and do little good; and that so much more to their shame, because
   he being a sore bruised man, and above sixty-seven years of age [this
   is an exaggeration], took so little care and sparing of himself to do
   the people good. Not to speak of here his indefatigable travail, and
   diligence in his own private studies; who, notwithstanding both his
   years and other pains in preaching, every morning ordinarily, winter
   and summer, about two of the clock in the morning was at his book most
   diligently. So careful was his heart of the preservation of the Church,
   and the good success of the Gospel."

   Thus Latimer spent those years of blessing to England ere the evil days
   came, whose approach he seems to have foreseen; for, according to Foxe,
   he did "most evidently prophesy all these kinds of plagues which
   afterwards ensued."

   With the lamented death of Edward he felt that his work was done, and
   that he had only to prepare himself for the fate to which he had long
   looked forward. So soon as Mary was settled upon the throne, and the
   reactionary party, headed by their old leaders, had once more
   triumphed, he and the other chief agents of the Reformation were sought
   out, summoned to London before the Privy Council, and committed to the
   Tower. Latimer appears to have been in Worcestershire when a
   "pursuivant," in the language of the chronicler, was sent down into the
   country to call him up. He was duly apprised of his danger; and, to do
   the Government justice, they seem to have afforded him the fair means
   of escape, if he had been disposed to flee out of the country, like so
   many others. But flight was far from his thoughts. The one strength
   that remained to him was to bear the crown of martyrdom and passing
   through Smithfield on his way to the Council, he was heard, in his
   usual cheerful manner, to say that it "had long groaned for him." His
   health, already greatly weakened, was further injured by the hardships
   of his confinement in the Tower. He was kept "without fire in the
   frosty winter," and the picture is a bitterly touching one of the
   suffering old man, "wellnigh starved with cold," and jesting with his
   keeper on his chances of cheating his persecutors, "if they did not
   look better to him."

   In the April of the following year (1554) he was conveyed to Oxford,
   along with Cranmer and Ridley, for the purpose of holding disputations
   on the subject of the mass before certain commissioners appointed to
   examine them. We find him, on the 18th of April, in the presence of
   these commissioners, declining to dispute. He pleaded that he was an
   old man, and that he had not, during these twenty years, much used the
   Latin tongue. "Then replied to him Master Smith of Oriel College;
   Doctor Cartwright, Master Harpsfield, and divers others, had snatches
   at him, and gave him bitter taunts. He did not escape hisses and
   scornful laughing. He was very faint, and desired that he might not
   long tarry." [172] It is miserable spectacle: insolence and brutality
   on the one side, and weakness and old age on the other. If we could
   wonder at any disgrace perpetrated in the name of religion, we might
   wonder at the singular debasement which could prompt such conduct on
   the part of learned men towards one who, amidst the widest differences
   of opinion, had such claims upon their sympathy and respect. The
   disputation, as in all such cases, led to nothing. Latimer was
   permitted to give in a lengthened protestation of his faith, upon which
   there followed some discussion, terminating in a curiously emphatic
   denunciation of the Protestants by Dr Weston, who took the lead in the
   argument on behalf of the commissioners: "A sort of fling-brains and
   light-heads," he said they were, "which were never constant in any one
   thing; as it was to be seen in the turning of the table, where, like a
   sort of apes, they could not tell which way to turn their tails,
   looking one day west, and another day east--one that way, and another
   this way." [173]

   After this examination, Latimer was transferred to Bocardo, the common
   jail in Oxford, and there he lay, with his companions, imprisoned for
   more than a year. During this long imprisonment "they were most godly
   occupied either with brotherly conference, or with fervent prayer, or
   with fruitful writing, albeit Master Latimer, by reason of the
   feebleness of his age, wrote least of them all in this last time. But
   in prayer he was fervently occupied, wherein oftentimes so long he
   continued kneeling, that he was not able to rise without help." [174]
   At length, on the 30th of September 1555, he was again summoned before
   the commissioners. Ridley had preceded him in examination, and in the
   meantime he was kept waiting, as he complains, "gazing upon the cold
   walls." Suffering and poverty were depicted in his appearance as he
   bowed before them, "holding his hat in his hand, with a kerchief bound
   round his head, and upon it a nightcap or two, and a great cap, such as
   horsemen used in those days, with two broad flaps to button under the
   chin. He wore an old threadbare Bristol frieze gown, girded to his body
   with a penny leather girdle; his Testament was suspended from this
   girdle by a leather sling, and his spectacles, without a case, hung
   from his neck upon his breast." [175] He was exhorted to consider his
   estate, to remember his age and infirmity, and to spare his body by
   admitting the claims of the Papacy. He replied with something of his
   old spirit, taking up the special arguments urged by the Bishop of
   Lincoln, who had addressed him. Especially he exposed the unfairness of
   a book recently published by the Bishop of Gloucester, in which it was
   argued that the clergy possessed the same authority as the Levites; and
   whereas the Bible said that the Levites, if there arose any controversy
   among the people, should decide the matter according to the law of God,
   these words were left out in the book in question, and the text quoted
   as saying that as the priests should decide the matter, so it ought to
   be taken of the people--"A large authority, I assure you!" he
   exclaimed. "What gelding of Scripture is this? what clipping of God's
   coin?" [176] The Bishop of Gloucester, who happened to be one of the
   commissioners, came forward to defend his book and Latimer acknowledged
   that he did not know him, and was not aware of his presence. A scene of
   laughter ensued in the old brutal fashion. [177] The bishop reproached
   him with his want of learning. "Lo!" he exclaimed, in just indignation
   at the unworthy taunt, "you look for learning at my hand, which have
   gone so long to the school of oblivion, making the bare walls my
   library; keeping me so long in prison without book, or pen, or ink; and
   now you let me loose to come and answer to articles. You deal with me
   as though two were appointed to fight for life and death; and overnight
   the one, through friends and favour, is cherished and hath good counsel
   given him how to encounter with his enemy; the other, for envy or lack
   of friends, all the whole night is set in the stocks. In the morning,
   when they shall meet, the one is in strength and lively; the other is
   stark of his limbs, and almost dead for feebleness. Think you that to
   run through this man with a spear is not a goodly victory?" [178]

   The end of all was, that he and Ridley were condemned to suffer; and on
   the 16th of October 1555 they were led forth to martyrdom "without
   Bocardo gate," to a spot opposite Balliol College, where the splendid
   Martyrs' Memorial now stands. They embraced each other, knelt in
   prayer, and at last, when they were about to kindle the pile, he first
   thanked God audibly for His faithfulness to him, and then, turning to
   his companion, said, "Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the
   man: we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England,
   as I trust shall never be put out."

   Thus perished the great preacher reformer of England, closing his
   honest, laborious, and intrepid life by a heroic death, shedding its
   radiance back upon all his previous work, and transfiguring it into a
   higher glory.

   The character of Latimer presents a combination of noble and
   disinterested qualities, scarcely rising to greatness, but highly
   significant and interesting. The natural healthiness of his earlier
   years at the Leicestershire farm, of "three or four pounds by the year
   at the uttermost," reappears in all his future career as a student, a
   preacher, a bishop, a martyr. The same simple spirit, and honest
   temper, and cheery humour, and unresting faithfulness, are visible in
   all he said and did. The man is never lost sight of, in whatever
   special attitude he shows himself; nay, the rustic boy, who was the
   "father of the man," is scarcely ever forgotten. A fresh and rough
   fragrance of nature hangs about him everywhere, impregnating and
   purifying with a rare and happy heartiness all his work.

   A simplicity verging on originality is perhaps his most prominent
   characteristic--a simplicity as far as possible from that which we
   noted in Calvin: the one, the naked energy of intellect; the other, a
   guileless evenness of heart. The single way in which Latimer looks at
   life, with his eyes unblinded by conventional drapery of any kind, and
   his heart responsive to all its broadest and most common interests,--of
   which he speaks in language never nice and circumlocutory, but
   straight, plain, and forcible,--gives to his sermons their singular air
   of reality, and to his character the sort of piquancy which vie at once
   recognise as a direct birth of nature. He is a kind of Goldsmith in
   theology, exhibiting the same artless feeling and sunny temper in the
   midst of all difficulties--the same disregard of his own comforts, and
   warm and kindly play of benevolent humour meeting you at every turn,
   like a roving and gleeful presence, and flashing laughter in your face.
   It would be absurd, of course, to push this comparison further. There
   is beneath all the oddities of Latimer's character a deep and solemn
   consistency of purpose, and a spirit of righteous indignation against
   wrong which, apart from all dissimilarities of work, destroys any more
   essential analogy between the great humourist of the Reformation in
   England and the later humourist of its literature. Yet the same
   childlike transparency of character is beheld in both, and the same
   fresh stamp of nature, which, in its simple originality, is found to
   outlast far more brilliant and imposing, but artificially cultured
   qualities.

   In mere intellectual strength, Latimer can take no place beside either
   Luther or Calvin. His mind has neither the rich. compass of the one,
   nor the symmetrical vigour of the other. He is no master in any
   department of intellectual interest, or even of theological inquiry. We
   read his sermons, not for any light or reach of truth which they
   unfold, nor because they exhibit any peculiar depth of spiritual
   apprehension, but simply because they are interesting--and interesting
   mainly from the very absence of all dogmatic or intellectual
   pretensions. Yet, without any mental greatness, there is a pleasant and
   wholesome harmony of mental powers displayed in his writings, [179]
   which gives to them a wonderful vitality. There is a proportion and
   vigour, not of logic, but of sense and feeling, in them eminently
   English, and showing everywhere a high and well-toned capacity. He is
   coarse and low at times his familiarity occasionally descends to
   meanness but the living hold which he takes of reality at every point,
   often carries him also to the height of an indignant and burning
   eloquence.

   Of his private social life we learn comparatively little. His nature
   was one keenly susceptible of friendship, and must have everywhere
   drawn to itself objects of affection. We can mark in the dim traces of
   his life the surrounding footsteps of his friends--Bilney, and Cranmer,
   and Cromwell, and Dr Butts, and, at the last, Ridley. There is no
   glimmering, however, of any dearer and more intimate affection,--no
   light of love, flushing with its soft warm presence the hard and
   darkening course of his energetic and unwearied labours. The singleness
   of his aim as a reformer--his untiring spirit of self-sacrifice,
   "minding not his own things, but the things of others"--his
   self-sustaining vigour in his work, and equable delight in it may
   sufficiently account for this absence. It takes an interest from his
   life, but at the same time simplifies our view of it. The impression
   remains deepened of a simple and earnest, rather than of a broad and
   powerful character.

   In turning to estimate Latimer's work as a reformer, we are at first
   struck very much with the same peculiarity--that is to say, with its
   comparative simplicity and narrowness of meaning. It possesses neither
   the national grandeur of the work of Luther, nor the theological and
   spiritual influence of that of Calvin. It is practical rather than
   doctrinal; and deep and powerful and abiding as have been its traces,
   it never attains to that comprehensive sweep and issue which at once
   impress us in the work of each of our other reformers. And yet Latimer
   was a true leader in the great movement of the sixteenth century. He
   did not, indeed, and could not, take up and express the various and
   complex impulses that were then bearing the national life of England
   onwards in the direction of reform. There was no single teacher capable
   of doing this. There were far too great diversity and richness in the
   impulses then moving England to permit of their finding united
   expression in any one man. But while Latimer did not, like Luther or
   Calvin, sum up in himself the great principles of the movement of which
   he was a leader, he expressed, beyond doubt, the most characteristic
   features of that movement. He represented those qualities of
   earnestness, and yet of moderation, of Scriptural faithfulness, and yet
   traditionary respect,--at once reforming and conservative,--which
   peculiarly distinguish the English character, and have stamped their,
   impress more than any other upon the spirit of the Church of England.

   The spirit of this Church is not, and never has been, definite and
   consistent. From the beginning it repudiated the distinct guidance of
   any theoretical principles, however exalted and apparently Scriptural.
   It held fast to its historical position, as a great Institute still
   living and powerful under all the corruptions which had overlaid it;
   and while submitting to the irresistible influence of reform which
   swept over it, as over other churches in the sixteenth century, it
   refused to be refashioned according to any new model. It broke away
   from the medieval bondage, under which it had always been restless, and
   destroyed the gross abuses which had sprung from this bondage; it rose
   in an attitude of proud and successful resistance to Rome; but in doing
   all this, it did not go to Scripture, as if it had once more, and
   entirely anew, to find there the principles either of doctrinal truth
   or of practical government and discipline. Scripture was eminently the
   condition of its revival; but Scripture was not made anew the
   foundation of its existence. There was too much of old historical life
   in it to seek any new foundation; the new must grow out of the old, and
   fit itself into the old. The Church of England was to be reformed, but
   not reconstituted. Its life was too vast, its influence too varied, its
   relations too complicated,--touching the national existence in all its
   multiplied expressions at too many points,--to be capable of being
   reduced to any new and definite form in supposed uniformity with the
   model of Scripture, or the simplicity of the primitive Church. Its
   extensive and manifold organisation was to be reanimated by a new life,
   but not remoulded according to any arbitrary or novel theory.

   This spirit, at once progressive and conservative, comprehensive rather
   than intensive, historical, and not dogmatical, is one eminently
   characteristic of the English mind, and, as it appears to us, in the
   highest degree characteristic of the English Reformation. It is far,
   indeed, from being an exhaustive characteristic of it. Two distinct
   tendencies of a quite different character, expressly dogmatic in
   opposite extremes, are found running alongside this main and central
   tendency: on the one hand, a medieval dogmatism on the other hand, a
   puritanical dogmatism. The current of religious life in England, as it
   moved forward and took shape in the sixteenth century, is marked by
   this threefold bias, which has perpetuated itself to the present time.
   There was then, as there remains to this day, an upper, middle, and
   lower tendency--a theory of High-churchism, and a theory of
   Low-churchism--and between these contending dogmatic movements the
   great confluence of what was and is the peculiar type of English
   Christianity--a Christianity diffusive and practical rather than direct
   and theoretical--elevated and sympathetic rather than zealous and
   energetic--Scriptural and earnest in its spirit, but undogmatic and
   adaptive in its form.

   In the sixteenth century Latimer appears along with Cranmer--although
   in a more natural manner than the latter, as being comparatively free
   from the complications of political interest--to be the great
   representative of this middle movement in the Church of England while
   Gardiner and Bonner on one side, and Hooper and his followers on the
   other side, represent respectively the medieval and puritanical
   tendencies. It may be doubtful to some, whether there is not much in
   Latimer that seems to ally him with the latter school: whether his
   principles, in their natural development, would not have led him to
   join them, had he lived on till they came into more distinct prominence
   as opposed to the ecclesiastical despotisms of Elizabeth. [180] Such a
   question cannot be absolutely determined, and is, in fact, irrelevant.
   For it is idle to speculate what Latimer or any man might have become
   in very different circumstances from those in which we find him. It
   appears to us with sufficient clearness that Latimer never would, and
   never could have become a Puritan, without an entire change of the
   peculiar spirit of natural sense, of moderation, and of conciliatory
   doctrinism which distinguishes him. In the early dogmatic puritanism of
   the Church of England--of Hooper, for example, and subsequently of
   Travers and Cartwright--there was a distinct foreign element which
   Latimer, with his genuine English feeling, would have strongly
   repudiated; and there was, moreover, a dogmatic narrowness and an
   exaggerated importance attached to form and externality, which were
   entirely alien to his cast of mind, and the spirit of reform which
   animated him.

   This spirit was throughout pre-eminently practical. He had no special
   reforming schemes of any kind in view; he had no special doctrines even
   to urge once more into prominence. The Gospel did not come to him as it
   came to Luther, in the shape of a new truth; nor yet as it came to
   Calvin, in the shape of a new system. It came to him simply as a new
   spirit of life, and earnestness, and Christian activity. As he studied
   the Bible, and as Bilney and he prayed over it, it was not the fire of
   dogmatic zeal nor of disciplinary urgency that was kindled in him, but
   the glow of simple evangelical earnestness. He awoke as from a dream,
   in which the forms of superstition had haunted him as the only
   realities, to find that they were no realities at all, but the mere
   inventions and fancies of men, draping and concealing the great truths
   of God. The meaning of life and duty--of real service to God in holy
   obedience and works of mercy--in comparison with mere religious
   observances and will-works,--this was what dawned upon him. And this
   was, above all, the kind of reformation after which he sought, and for
   which he laboured,--a reformation of life--a Church of England once
   more animated by a Christian spirit, destroying by its very presence
   and power the gross medieval abuses which had fastened upon it till
   they seemed a part of its very existence; whereas, in truth, they were
   only corrupting excrescences. The Catholic faith seemed to him,
   scarcely less than to Sir Thomas More, to survive in England, and in
   the old Church of England, if it were only purified from such
   traditions and corruptions. His own preaching presented to himself
   nothing new, nor even contrary to the decrees of the Fathers. In his
   letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1533, we find such a
   reforming position exactly described as the one on which he considered
   himself to stand. "If any man has any fault to object against my
   preaching, as being obscure or uncautiously uttered, I am ready to
   explain my doctrine by further discourse; for I have never preached
   anything contrary to the truth, or contrary to the decrees of the
   Fathers, nor, as far as I know, contrary to the Catholic faith. I have
   desired, I own, and do desire, a reformation in the judgment of the
   vulgar. I have desired, and still desire, that they should make a
   distinction between duties, and regard and maintain each according to
   its proper value, its place and time, its rank and degree, in order
   that all men should know that there is a very great difference between
   those works which God hath prepared for each of us, zealously
   discharging the duties of our respective callings, to walk in, and
   those that are voluntary, which we undertake by our own strength and
   pleasure. It is lawful, I own, to make use of images, to go upon
   pilgrimages, to invoke the saints to be mindful of souls in purgatory;
   but those things which are voluntary are so to be moderated that God's
   commandments of necessary obligation, which bring eternal life to those
   who keep them, and eternal death to those who neglect them, be not
   deprived of their just value. . . . I therefore, hitherto, stand fixed
   on the side of the commandments of God, so aiming not at my own gain,
   but that of Christ; so seeking not my own glory, but that of God; and
   as long as life shall be permitted to me, I will not cease thus to
   continue imitating herein all true preachers of the Word that have
   hitherto lived in the world." [181]

   The same supremely practical tendency manifests itself more or less in
   all his sermons; and in none more than in those preached before Edward
   VI., which may be supposed to contain his mature views of reform. He is
   vigilant and urgent against all abuses, alike in Church and State, in
   society and in private life. He exposes them with homely and crushing
   invective, sparing no class, passing by no oppression, whether that of
   the poor vicar having an extensive cure in a market-town, on "but
   twelve or fourteen marks by the year," so "that he is not able to buy
   him books, nor give his neighbour drink"; [182] or that of the
   gentlewoman from whom a great man kept certain lands of hers, and who
   in a whole twelvemonth could only get one day for the hearing of her
   matter; or that of the poor widow lying in the Fleet. [183] He has a
   sound English heart, hating all evil, and especially all proud and
   lying evil, all dastardly mockeries of truth, all mere pretences in the
   Church or out of it, all disorders, all indifference and deadness. His
   spirit kindles, and his language rises into more concentrated pith and
   vigour, when he catches sight of some great wrong, or some social folly
   or immorality, and wishes that it lay in his poor tongue to explicate
   it "with such light of words that he might seem rather to paint it
   before their eyes than to speak it." It is this characteristic of
   Latimer's sermons that makes them still so fresh and living to us while
   we read them. Had they been more doctrinal, we should have examined
   them perhaps with equal or even greater curiosity, as serving to
   illustrate the state of Christian thought in his age, but we certainly
   should not have found in them that vivifying power with which they
   still touch us; for nothing becomes more dead in the course of
   transmission than the popular forms of doctrinal teaching, so that one
   generation finds mere barrenness in what greatly interested and
   delighted its predecessor. Even the doctrinal sermons of Luther are no
   exception to this.

   It is very much, therefore, because Latimer was no dogmatist that he
   remains so interesting to us, and his words still retain such a zest,
   and flavour, and power. He contends for no particular theory of the
   truth; his new-born life does not need any new doctrinal vehicle of
   expression; it is slow even to cast off the least worthy additions that
   have gathered round the Catholic faith, and out of which have sprung,
   by a sure process, the worst abuses which he deplores. He nowhere takes
   up an attitude of doctrinal hostility to the old Church, nor aims to
   set forth any specific doctrinal principles to which the whole line of
   the reform movement should be attached, and from which it ought to
   proceed. And yet it would be a total misapprehension of his spirit and
   position to suppose him latitudinarian, or indifferent to dogmatic
   truth; he simply does not realise its separate importance. Trained in
   the scholastic philosophy, he of all our reformers retains no trace of
   its rationalising and controversial spirit. He had obviously little or
   no faith in controversy--a wonderful point of advance for that age. He
   is no theologian: dogmas in and by themselves have no interest for his
   homely, healthy mind. He apprehends all, and clues for all, only in the
   concrete. Truth for him is not this or that view or theory, but the
   life of faithful obedience towards God, and of active charity towards
   man. This is the highest truth, and the only worthy reality or him in
   all the world--"To fear God, and keep His commandments." And it is his
   great mission as a reformer to awaken men everywhere to the need of
   this living truth, to recall them from shadows and-superstitions, from
   "inventions and fancies," from will-works and fantasies of their own,
   to the reality of true Christian work, and the glory of this only
   divine service.

   It was as a preacher, above all, that he discharged this great mission;
   and his sermons remain, as a whole, its most interesting and graphic
   expression. Their highest qualities are exactly those that characterise
   his general work--life, reality, and earnestness. He uses the pulpit
   not so much as a vehicle of instruction, but as a means of impulse and
   movement. He never uses it as a mere theatre of eloquence. He is
   eloquent, not because he thinks of being eloquent, and tries to be so,
   but simply because there is in him a living and honest meaning which he
   desires to communicate to others. The fire burned within him, and he
   spake as it moved him. His sermons, accordingly, while frequently
   deficient in all method, and sometimes--where they aim to be
   explanatory or argumentative--vague and unimpressive, are yet, in the
   main, instinct with a vigorous and fresh and happy interest. To
   interest, and so move and reform, was the great aim of all of them; and
   so everything is sacrificed to the necessity of making those whom he is
   addressing feel the truth and force of what he is saying. The most
   homely illustrations, and most startling and ludicrous conjunctions,
   headlong and unsparing invective, and wayward and joyous humour, are
   all given full play to--each impulse obeyed as it comes--in order that
   the hearers may be touched by his own obvious and irresistible
   inspiration. The result is what sometimes appears to us, reading them
   with the cold eye of criticism, coarseness rather than power, meanness
   of language rather than impressiveness of idea, and caricature rather
   than humour; but the manly and genial critic will acknowledge the
   natural healthiness and vigour even of many illustrations which have
   incurred the censure of more fastidious tastes--while there is a relish
   as of good old wine, sound and ripe after three centuries, in many
   more; and the intellectual appetite, jaded with the weak mixtures of
   modern religious sentiment, grows keen and glad over the numerous
   passages of vigorous and racy sense, homely and joyous picturesqueness,
   and pungent, earnest, and happy humour.

   It is difficult to give any adequate specimens of his style. The good
   things of such a preacher appear poor when extracted and apart from
   their setting. The reader, therefore, must study the sermons
   themselves, if he care to appreciate them. The following passage, in
   which irony mingles with earnestness and the picture, if somewhat low
   and audacious, is exceedingly graphic and powerful--may stand by itself
   perhaps as well as any other:--"But now for the fault of unpreaching
   prelates, methinks I could guess what might be said for excusing of
   them. They are so troubled with lordly living, they be so placed in
   palaces, couched in courts, ruffling in their rents, dancing in their
   dominions, burdened with embassages, pampering of their paunches, like
   a monk that maketh his jubilee, munching in their mangers, and moiling
   in their gay manors and mansions, and so troubled with looking on their
   lordships, that they cannot attend it. They are otherwise occupied,
   some in the King's matters, some are ambassadors, some of the Privy
   Council, some to furnish the court, some are lords of the Parliament,
   some are presidents and comptrollers of mints. Should we have ministers
   of the Church to be comptrollers of the mints? Is this a meet office
   for a priest that hath cure of souls? Is this his charge? I would here
   ask one question--I would fain know who controlleth the devil at home
   in his parish while he controlleth the mint? . . . Who is the most
   diligentest bishop and prelate in all England, that passeth all the
   rest in doing his office? I can tell, for I know him who it is--I know
   him well. But now I think I see you listening and hearkening that I
   should name him. There is one that passeth all the other, and is the
   most diligent prelate and preacher in all England. And will you know
   who it is? I will tell you--it is the devil. He is the most diligent
   preacher of all others. He is never out of his diocese, he is never
   from his cure; ye shall never find him unoccupied; he is ever in his
   parish; he keepeth residence at all times; ye shall never find him out
   of the way; call for him when you will, he is ever at home; he is ever
   at his plough, no lording nor loitering can hinder him--you shall never
   find him idle, I warrant you. And his office is to hinder religion, to
   maintain superstition, to set up idolatry. When the devil is resident
   and hath his plough going, then away with books, and up with candles;
   away with Bibles, and up with beads; away with the light of the Gospel,
   and up with the light of candles, yea at noonday. . . . Down with
   Christ's cross, and up with purgatory pick-purse, up with him--the
   Popish purgatory, I mean. Away with clothing the naked, the poor, and
   the impotent, up with the decking of images and gay garnishing of
   stocks and stones; up with man's traditions and his laws, down with
   God's traditions and His most holy Word; down with the old honour due
   to God, and up with the new god's honour." [184]

   There is no feature of Latimer's sermons more pervading than their
   invective. He is ever on the watch for wrong and abuses, and he pours
   out upon them the most free and startling rebukes. He spares no class,
   and he spurns no weapon of ridicule or denunciation against the powers
   of misrule, indolence, superstition, and bigotry, that he would strike
   down. It is now the bishops, and now the lawyers and judges, among whom
   he sends his swift and piercing arrows. "But I will be a suitor to your
   grace," he says, in his second sermon before King Edward VI., "that you
   will give your bishops charge, ere they go home, to look better to
   their flock, and to see your Majesty's injunctions better kept, and
   send your visitors in their tails; and if they be found negligent or
   faulty in their duties, out with them! I require it on God's behalf:
   make them quondams, all the pack of them. But peradventure ye will say,
   Where shall we have any to put in their rooms?' . . . If your Majesty's
   chaplains and my lord protectors be not able to furnish their places,
   there is in this realm (thanks be to God!) a great sight of laymen well
   learned in the Scriptures, and of virtuous and godly conversations,
   better learned than a great sight of us of the clergy." [185] Speaking
   of a certain bishop of Winchester in "King Henry VI.'s days," who
   opposed Humphrey, the "good Duke" of Gloucester, and to whom the Pope
   sent a cardinal's hat, he says, "He should have had a Tyburn tippet, a
   halfpenny halter, and all such proud prelates. These Romish hats never
   brought good into England." [186] "Bishops!" he cries, "nay, rather
   buzzards!" And ridiculing the mode of pronouncing the Episcopal
   blessing, he asks, "What is blessing? Not wagging of the fingers, as
   our bishops are wont." He does not hesitate, with a somewhat Dantesque
   severity, to lift the veil from the pit of suffering, and point to the
   unpreaching prelates in torments. "If one were admitted to view hell
   thus, and behold it thoroughly, the devil would cry, On yonder side are
   punished unpreaching prelates.'" [187] On turning to the judges and
   magistrates, his comments are not less outspoken. "They are
   bribe-takers," he says. "Nowadays they call them gentle rewards: let
   them leave their colouring, and call them by their Christian
   names--bribes. Wo worth these gifts! they subvert justice everywhere. A
   good fellow on a time bade another of his friends to breakfast, and
   said, If you will come you shall be welcome; but I tell you beforehand
   you shall have but one dish, and that is all.' What is that?' said he.
   A pudding, and nothing else.' Marry!' said he, you cannot please me
   better; of all meats, that is for mine own tooth: you may draw me round
   about the town with a pudding.' These bribing magistrates and judges
   follow gifts faster than the fellow would follow the pudding." [188]
   And in a higher vein he exclaims that the matters of the poor "are not
   heard: they are fain to go home with weeping tears that fall down by
   their cheeks and ascend up to heaven and cry for vengeance. Let judges
   look about them, for surely God will revenge His elect one day. . . .
   God hath pulled the judges' skins over their heads for the poor man's
   sake. Yea, the poor widow will one way do him more hurt with her poor
   paternoster in her mouth than any other weapon; and with two or three
   words she shall bring him down to the ground and destroy his jollity,
   and cause him to lose more in one day than he gat in seven years."
   [189]

   The increasing licentiousness of the age, the extravagance of ladies'
   attire, especially the laying out of the hair in "tussocks and tufts,"
   the assumptions of ladies themselves--"because they will be
   quartermasters with their husbands. Quarter-masters! Nay, half-masters;
   yea, some of them will be whole masters, and rule the roast as they
   list themselves." [190] The indolent effeminacy of the rich and noble,
   "who now have taken up whoring in town instead of shooting in the
   fields"--the misunderstood exactions of the aldermen, "who nowadays are
   become colliers--I would wish they might eat nothing but coals for a
   while till they had amended it"--are all painted by him with a breadth
   of brush, and a strong light of piquant satire, that enable us to
   understand his popularity. He never minces epithets: "dodipoles,"
   "hoddypecks," "velvet coats," "upskips,"--such are some of the round
   names that he scatters about; and we can imagine the thrilling effect
   with which they fell among auditories accustomed to monkish trifling or
   ecclesiastical commonplaces. It was as a denouncer of flagrant and
   widely felt abuses, and as an unceasing preacher of righteousness and
   benevolence against wrong and hardness of heart, that the people above
   all looked upon him and loved him; and the strength and prevalency of
   the popular feeling are sufficiently shown in the cry with which the
   boys used to follow him in the streets--"Have at them, Master Latimer!"
   In every time of extensive change, when old oppressions are relaxing
   and new responsibilities dawning, honest and hearty denunciation is
   sure to be popular; and it is easy, therefore, to imagine the
   enthusiasm which greeted the great preacher who had the courage in such
   an age to utter manful and unsparing words in the ears of the wealthy
   and powerful, the corrupt and tyrannical.

   The humour of the sermons is eminently notable--a pungent, nipping,
   pursuing humour, lacking the richness and depth and boisterous freedom
   of Luther's, but singularly funny, seizing one in the oddest ways and
   at the most unexpected turns. As when speaking of coming to church, he
   says: "I had rather ye should come, as the tale is by the gentlewoman
   of London. One of her neighbours met her on the street, and said,
   Mistress, whither go ye?' Marry,' said she, I am going to St Thomas of
   Acres, to the sermon; I could not sleep all this last night, and I am
   going now thither; I never failed of a good nap there.'" [191] Again,
   when in one of his perorations he adds, in allusion to Elias stopping
   the rain,--"I think there be some Elias about at this time, which
   stoppeth the rain; we have not had rain a good while." Such turns--some
   broader, some more delicate--flash upon us every now and then. You are
   never sure, even in the most solemn passages, that his humour will not
   peep out with its wayward and comic glance, and start a reactionary
   smile as the shadow of thought is beginning to steal over the
   countenance. Explosive and striking in its effect, it is gentle in its
   spirit. There is not a touch of ill-nature in it. It cuts to the quick,
   not because the preacher delights in giving offence, but because his
   keen eye and pure heart cannot help seeing through the mockeries and
   vanities and wrongs which he exposes. He sees always their absurdity as
   well as their iniquity, and he cannot help saying so. If stupidity is
   offended, and superstition alarmed, and oppression indignant, so much
   the worse for all of them. The preacher is not to blame who lights them
   up as he paints them with the lambent glances of a humorous scorn,
   which has merely searched them through and through. As with all other
   preaching humorists, his fun is no doubt sometimes out of place. A
   chill taste will shrink from some of its displays, and certain tempers
   may feel offended. Identifying religion not only with gloom but with
   stupidity, such tempers find harm where there is merely amusement, and
   wrong where there is merely the free play of innocent strength. A
   hearty religious feeling, though sometimes startled, will never be
   shocked by our Reformer's oddest sallies, but will recognise in them
   only the radiant sparks from an ever bright and warm heart looking out
   upon life with an intense gaze of reality, and apprehending its
   marvellous contrasts in the sunlight of an ever-cheerful temper.

   Nothing is more remarkable in Latimer than this cheerfulness. Ill in
   body, tried and persecuted, and cast down by many troubles, he is
   always cheerful,--cheerful at Cambridge, amidst the scowls of
   friars--cheerful in his parish, under Episcopal frowns, and in his
   diocese, amidst an obtuse and opposing clergy--cheerful in the Tower
   when nearly starved to death with cold--cheerful at the stake, in the
   thought of the illumining blaze that he and Ridley would make for the
   glory of the Gospel and the happiness of England. An earnest, hopeful,
   and happy man, honest, fearless, open-hearted, hating nothing but
   baseness, and fearing none but God--not throwing away his life, yet not
   counting it dear when the great crisis came--calmly yielding it up as
   the crown of his long sacrifice and struggle. There may be other
   reformers who more engage our admiration; there is no one who more
   excites our love.

   [147] This statement of Foxe, if we can rely at all upon his

   [149] There can be no doubt of this. He himself clearly implies so much
   in his letter to Henry--(Foxe); and there is no possible room for the
   conjecture of his having changed his mind between the date of the
   advice to the King and the issuing of the proclamation in December of
   the same year. The statement of the proclamation, that all gave their
   free "assent," cannot be held as valid against such evidence, and every
   presumption to the contrary.

   [154] This account is founded upon Wilkins's Concilia, as quoted in the

   It seems to present the most minute and faithful account of the matter,
   directly founded on the proceedings of Convocation; and Foxe's belief
   evidently is, that Latimer submitted and subscribed the articles,
   although he is reluctant to admit the idea of his retractation. Mr
   Froude (vol. ii. p. 106) apparently does not understand that Latimer's
   submission went so far, but calls in the interposition of the King at a
   previous stage. Latimer's own account of his examination before the
   bishops is found in a sermon preached by him at Stamford, many years
   after, in 1550. It is very characteristic, and proves the
   unscrupulousness of his enemies, but it does not throw any light on the
   course of his trial.--Sermons, p. 294.

   [155] Vol. vii. p. 477.--Strype's Account, vol. i. p. 245, is of the
   same character, only with the ludicrous features less prominent.

   [156] Cranmer was born at Aslacton, in Nottinghamshire, in 1489, and
   entered Jesus College, Cambridge, at the age of fourteen, only a year
   in advance of Latimer, in each case. He took his degree of Doctor of
   Divinity in 1623, just in the heat of Latimer's first reforming zeal as
   a university preacher.

   [157] Cranmer's remains, edit. Jenkyns, vol. i. p. 121.

   [158] The evidence seems very slight (except on his ground of believing
   implicitly in State documents) on which Mr Froude comes to this
   conclusion (vol. iii. p. 67). Cranmer, I should think, was the more
   likely author of the "Fourteen Articles," although the King may well
   have had a share in them, and even "put his own pen to the book" on the
   subject. But supposing the Articles were the production of the King
   himself, the inference Mr Froude would found upon this fact as to the
   moral position of the King at the moment in relation to Ann Boleyn's
   death (he had been married only three weeks to Jane Seymour), is, to
   say the least, of a very uncertain character. That a man is to be held
   less guilty of a great crime because he can busy himself, some few
   weeks after, with the dictation of a series of theological articles, is
   certainly warranted neither by the facts of evidence nor by the
   workings of human nature.

JOHN KNOX.

   THE Scottish Reformation, and the great central figure which it
   presents, remain for our consideration. The field opened to our view is
   comparatively limited, but it is singular in the completeness and
   intensity of its interest. The area over which the reforming movement
   is seen sweeping is but a narrow one in contrast with that of Germany
   or France or England, but it is more deeply moved; and the gathering
   impulses of the religious excitement swell into a highly expressed,
   definite, and powerful nationality.

   As we cast our glance upon Scotland towards the end of the first
   quarter of the sixteenth century, we see a very disturbed picture,--the
   King, the great nobles, and the clergy sharing between them an
   authority which has not worked itself into any consistent and
   beneficent form of national order. In comparison with the well
   developed, massive, and richly pictured life of England at the same
   period, there is great rudeness and disorder, and, in a word, barbarism
   in Scotland. This is obviously true of all elements of political
   strength and stability; while in regard to the Church it is no less
   really true. Poor and corrupt as the clergy were in England in the
   earlier reign of Henry VIII., they yet retained, in some instances, a
   moral spirit and influence of which we can detect no trace in the
   sister country.

   The Reformation in each is found strongly contrasted, according to
   these differing circumstances of the two countries. In England there
   were powerful forces both of political and moral resistance to it; but
   in Scotland, when the front of rude authority with which it was at
   first violently met was once broken down, there was no power left to
   stay nor even to guide it. The kingly influence was entirely prostrated
   in the untimely death of James V. after the disaster of Solway Moss;
   the nobles, in their savage enmities and factions, possessed no
   intelligent or steady power of control. The hierarchy was the single
   authority that remained to encounter a movement against which it was
   wholly incapable of effective resistance; its palsied and corrupt
   grandeur was no match for the rising spirit of national indignation.

   While in England, accordingly, we see a balanced movement proceeding
   gradually and under royal sanction, in Scotland we behold an
   insurrectionary impulse long repressed, but at length gathering force
   till it breaks down and sweeps away all barriers before it. It might
   seem on the first glance we get of the hierarchy of Scotland, that it
   constituted a formidable power: externally it appeared strong; it
   showed the craft, the subtlety, and the swift unrelenting vengeance
   which at first easily mastered and crushed its enemies. But these were
   in reality the mere fangs of a brute strength surviving the decay of
   all true national life in the system. The apparent influence and
   barbaric splendour of such men as the Beatons covered a rottenness at
   the heart more extreme than could be found in any other country of the
   Reformation. Nowhere else had the clergy reached such a pitch of
   flagrant and disgraceful immorality, and the Roman Catholic religion
   become such an utter corruption and mockery of all that is good and
   holy. The bishops and archbishops lived in open concubinage, and gave
   their daughters in marriage to the sons of the best families in the
   kingdom; livings were transmitted from father to son in the most
   shameless manner; the monasteries were, in popular belief and in
   reality, to a degree beyond what we can indicate, sinks of profligacy.
   A darker and more hideous picture, when we think of it as the formal
   representative of religion to a people, we cannot conceive, than that
   which is suggested in the scattered but sufficiently broad hints of
   Knox. [192]

   And while such was the moral state of the hierarchy, it scarcely
   preserved even the pretence of religious service. The churches, save on
   festival days, were abandoned the priests were unable to understand a
   single word of the prayers which they mumbled over; and preaching was
   entirely unknown. Every element of religion was materialised to the
   last degree and blessings sold for so much, and cursings for so much.
   The clergy were the traffickers--they seem really to have been little
   more--in such supposed spiritual charms the people were the victims, in
   some cases honestly so, but in others obviously with a sufficiently
   clear view of the absurdity, if not impiety, of the whole affair. Knox
   gives a ludicrous picture of what went on in this way, drawn from the
   preaching of William Airth, a friar of Dundee, who distinguished
   himself temporarily by his keen exposure of the papistical system. "The
   priest," said he, "whose duty and office it is to pray for the people,
   stands up on Sunday and cries, Ane has tynt a spurtill; there is a
   flail stollen beyond the burn; the goodwife of the other side of the
   gait has tynt a horn-spoon: God's malison and mine I give to those who
   know of this gear and restores it not." And the appreciation the people
   often had of this preaching is thus shown. After sermon that the friar
   "had at Dunfermline," Knox says, "he came to a house whare gossips were
   drinking their Sunday penny and he, being dry, asked drink. Yes,
   father,' said ane of the gossips, ye shall have drink; but ye must
   first resolve a doubt which has risen among us--to wit, what servant
   will serve a man best on least expense.' The good angel,' said I, who
   is man's keeper--who makes great service without expense.' Tush!' said
   the gossip, we mean no such high matters; we mean, what honest man will
   do greatest service for least expense?' And while I was musing, said
   the friar, what that should mean, she said, I see, father, that the
   greatest clerks are not the wisest men. Know ye not how the bishops and
   their officials serve us husbandmen? Will they not give us a letter of
   cursing for a plack to last for a year, to curse all that look over our
   dyke? and that keeps our corn better nor the sleepy boy that will have
   three shillings of fee, a sark, and a pair of shoon in the year.'"
   [193]

   A system whose most familiar and popular expressions had sunk into such
   absolute dotage, whose dishonesty and immorality were so widespread and
   prominent, might seem powerful, but in point of fact it had no
   permanent elements of strength. It was a mere repressive machinery
   lying on the heart of the nation, so far as there was in it any true
   heart and living growth of moral intelligence. And not only so,--not
   only had the Catholic hierarchy in Scotland become a mere incubus, but
   an incubus in no small degree of foreign character and pretensions.
   Many of the higher clergy received their education in France; [194]
   they had engrafted on their natural rudeness and fierceness of
   character the polish of a culture formed in the most licentious and
   perfidious Court in Europe--a polish which not only left their native
   and essential savageness untamed, but sharpened it into some of its
   worst features of cruelty and baseness, This may serve to explain the
   striking alienation between the Catholicism in Scotland and the genuine
   and growing national feeling. There were no points of attraction, nor
   even of tolerance, between them; only the hardest attitude of
   unreasoning authority on the one hand, and of utter contempt and hatred
   on the other. Among the poorest classes there may have been a kind of
   sympathy with the clergy, and certain relations of goodwill on the one
   side and the other. The monasteries, in the very worst point of view,
   must have been centres of beneficence, whose influence stretched
   towards many humble cottages; and the bishops had each their numerous
   dependants, who, with their friends and relatives, mingled among the
   people. Bad as the system was, it must have possessed such points of
   support, and might have strengthened itself in some degree on them, had
   any wisdom been left to it; but ignorance and mere selfish instinct
   were, after all, but a poor stay for profligacy, while all the
   intellectual and moral interests of the country were uniting against
   it.

   Standing between the clergy and the lowest orders, there had grown up
   during the preceding century or more, in Scotland, a class of traders
   in the towns and of gentry in the country, bound to each other by
   intimate ties and it was in the growing enlightenment of this class
   that the future of Scotland lay. These burghers and gentry constituted
   young Scotland in the. sixteenth century. They had the intelligence to
   understand to the full the corruptions of the Papacy; they had gathered
   to themselves such spiritual life as remained in the country, and this
   rose in horror at the immoralities which the Church embodied. They were
   a rising and vigorous class, proud of their sharp-wittedness and the
   influence which their position and resources gave them; they were well
   informed, through their connection with the Continent, with regard to
   the progress of the reformed doctrines; they had high character,
   earnest feelings, and political as well as religious aims; and they
   naturally ranged themselves against the hierarchy as its strong and
   avowed enemies.

   Between these two powers the conflict of the Scottish Reformation was
   really waged: It was a conflict not merely in the interest of religion,
   although this it was eminently, but moreover, and in a higher and more
   remarkable degree than elsewhere, a conflict on behalf of the
   independence and integrity of national life. The spiritual impulse was
   strongly present, but inseparably bound up, with it was a political
   feeling, which gave characteristic impress to the general movement.
   Amid the decay of the old political influences in the country, and the
   corruption of its social and ecclesiastical bonds, there was a fresh
   and compact vigour in the middle orders that rendered them more capable
   in moral strength than any party opposed to them; and not only did the
   reforming activity mainly proceed from them, but, in virtue of their
   self-consistency and hardihood of character, they retained the main
   guidance of it in their hands. They impressed their own character upon
   it; they gave to it, both as a doctrine and a discipline, a shape
   removed as far as possible from the hated hierarchical system which
   they subverted. Altogether unlike the growth of the English Church, the
   Scottish Reformed Kirk became an entirely new expression of religious
   life in Scotland. The old had passed away,--all things had become
   new,--when the reforming tide settled down, and the face of religious
   order reappeared. Scotland was not merely reformed, it was
   revolutionised. Catholicism had vanished into obscure corners, from
   which no royal nursing. could ever again evoke it, save as a poor ghost
   of its former self, destined to vanish again before every fresh
   outburst of the national feeling.

   This complete change, wrought by the Reformation in Scotland, can only
   be explained in the light of the peculiar crisis which the national
   history had then reached. A new political and social influence was at
   the time waiting to start into vigorous development: it met the
   Reformation, embraced it, moulded it to its own inspirations and aims,
   and carried itself triumphantly forward in its advance. It is very true
   that some of the greater nobles soon saw reason to join themselves to
   the reformed cause, and in various ways to aid or hinder it; but in the
   beginning, and at the end, the Scottish Reformation continued
   essentially a middle-class movement, with all the hardy virtue
   belonging to its parentage, yet also with the parental defects--sturdy
   and uncompromising in its faith, and free in its instincts, but with no
   sacred inheritance of traditionary story binding it by beautiful links.
   to the great Catholic past; and further, as has been long sadly
   apparent, with no sympathetic expansiveness capable of moulding into
   religious unity classes widely separated in material rank and in
   intellectual and artistic culture.

   It is sufficiently singular, and so far in corroboration of the view
   now presented, that the Scottish reformers, one and all of them of any
   note, sprung from the class of gentry to which we have referred.
   Patrick Hamilton, indeed, was immediately connected with the higher
   nobility, and, through his mother, with the royal family; [195] but the
   fact of his being a younger son, and the illegitimacy that attached to
   the descent of both his parents, rendered his own social position
   certainly not higher than that of the lairds or gentry. George Wishart,
   again, was brother to the Laird of Pittarrow, and Knox was the son of a
   younger brother of the house of Ranfurly.

   Patrick Hamilton is the first prominent name that meets us in the
   Scottish Reformation. His brief and sad, yet beautiful story, has been
   told anew in our day in a very interesting manner. [196] For the first
   time we are able to trace, in a clear and consistent light, the course
   of his education, first in Paris, then in St Andrews, and lastly in
   Germany, in the very heart of the reforming influences; his return to
   his native country, and marriage (a fact not previously known); and
   then his preaching, and seizure and trial by the elder Beaton,--a
   narrative which serves to deepen the affecting story of his martyrdom
   in front of the gate of the old college of St Andrews on the 29th of
   February 1528. Hamilton no doubt caught his first reforming impulse
   during the years that he studied in Paris (1519-20), when the
   university was all astir on the subject of Luther's doctrines. His
   subsequent studies in Germany confirmed the early impulse thus
   communicated; and the proto-reformer of Scotland was thus substantially
   Lutheran in the origin and character of his teaching.

   This foreign influence in the rise of the Reformation in Scotland
   deserves to be noticed. But it would be wrong to attribute too much
   importance to it. An awakening, half literary, half spiritual, had
   already begun during the preceding ten years in St Leonard's College,
   St Andrews; and Hamilton was in the very midst of this new excitement
   while pursuing his studies there. We get, also, in Knox's History, one
   clear glimpse of an earnest Lollardism towards the end of the preceding
   century, in the reign of James IV. [197] The spirit which he describes,
   and the articles which he gives in detail, recall strongly the spirit
   and doctrines which we have seen to characterise the surviving
   Wickliffite influence in England--the same broad and somewhat crude
   apprehension of Scriptural truth--the same scornful humour--the same
   strong, yet retiring piety--with the remarkable difference, that the
   "thirty persons" called "Lollards of Kylle" seem to have belonged, not
   to the peasantry, as in England, but to the better-classes of society.
   At this single point, a line of antecedent religious life in Scotland
   rises into brief and impressive prominency. And it no doubt continued
   to some extent during the next thirty years, and helped in the advance
   of the Reformation; but in what degree or through what connections it
   did this, we cannot distinctly trace, either in the case of Hamilton or
   of any of the chief reformers.

   The zeal of Patrick Hamilton, although quenched in cruel flames, lived
   after him. His teaching, enhanced by the noble and pathetic courage of
   his death, made a deep impression on the national mind. The reforming
   spirit spread on all sides. "Men began," says Knox, "very liberally to
   speak." The bishops had only one weapon with which to encounter the
   rising spirit. They bethought themselves of burning some more heretics.
   "New consultation was taken that some should be burned;" but a "merrie
   gentleman," a familiar of the bishop, was heard to say, "Gif ye burn
   more, let them be burnt in how cellars; for the reik of Mr Patrick
   Hamilton has infected as many as it did blow upon."

   Such was the state of affairs while Knox was rising into full manhood,
   and beginning with his steady and long-piercing glance to look forth
   upon the world, and note the circumstances and signs of the times
   amidst which he found himself. At the time of Hamilton's death he was
   twenty-three years of age, and about terminating his studies in the
   University of Glasgow. He was born in 1505, in Haddington or its
   neighbourhood, [198] of parents whose ancestry and social position have
   been subjects of dispute, although the evidence seems conclusive that
   his father belonged to the Knoxes of Ranfurly, an old and respectable
   family of Renfrewshire. [199] His own statement, that "his
   great-grandfather, gudeschir, and father, served under the Earls of
   Bothwell, and some of them have died under their standards," [200] is
   perfectly consistent with this. He received his preliminary education
   at the Grammar-School of Haddington, and in the year 1521 was sent to
   the University of Glasgow, where he had, therefore, been a considerable
   number of years at the time that the reforming opinions began to spread
   rapidly throughout the country.

   It is not very clear when or under what special influences Knox first
   began to incline towards these opinions. He had gone to Glasgow
   University with the view of being trained for the Church, and there,
   under Major, he soon proved himself an apt and distinguished pupil of
   the scholastic theology. He was considered as equalling, if not
   excelling, his master in the subtleties of the dialectic art. To this
   teacher also he probably owed the first impulse to that remarkable
   freedom of political opinion which afterwards characterised him. He is
   said to have been ordained before the year 1530; but at this time, and
   for twelve years onward, there is a great gap in his life, which his
   biographers have been wholly unable to fill up. We only know that, some
   time after taking his degree, he removed to St Andrews, and taught
   there; although in what college does not clearly appear; and that,
   about 1535, especially by the study of the Fathers, his traditionary
   opinions had become thoroughly shaken. Not till eight years later,
   however, or in 1543, did he become an avowed and marked reformer.

   This year is in every way memorable in the history of the Scottish
   Reformation. The death of the King, after the disastrous defeat of
   Solway Moss, in the end of the previous year, and the consequent
   accession of the Earl of Arian to the regency, produced at first a
   change favourable to the views of the reformers. Negotiations were
   renewed with England; Protestant preachers were taken under special
   protection by the Regent, and a measure passed the Committee of
   Parliament, known by the name of the Lords of the Articles, and
   received his sanction, authorising the reading of the Scriptures in the
   common tongue. Everything seemed for the moment to indicate the
   goodwill of the Regent, and to tend to the advance of the Reformation.
   The favour of Arran, however, was but short-lived. The French and Papal
   party, with Cardinal Beaton at their head, soon regained their
   ascendancy. Just as under the previous interregnum, fifteen years
   before, all the efforts of Henry VIII. defeated to some extent by his
   own injustice and violence--were unsuccessful to bind any section of
   the Scottish nobles permanently to his interest; and the renewed
   connection with France laid the foundation for confusion and misery to
   the country for more than another half-century.

   So soon as Beaton attained his object, and once more held the
   substantial power of the kingdom in his grasp, he resolved to crush his
   enemies with no sparing hand. His bloodthirsty vengeance had been
   baffled by the reluctant pity of the late king, who had shrunk with
   horror from the atrocity, suggested to him by the clergy, of
   exterminating by a single stroke two or three hundred of the most
   influential of the reformers, whose names they had presented to him in
   a list. [201] There seemed no obstacle now, however, to the full
   gratification of his vengeance, while the instinct of self-preservation
   probably combined with that of his natural imperiousness and cruelty to
   direct him to the special object of his attack. Whatever be the credit
   due to Tytler's special insinuations against Wishart--which appear to
   rest on very slender evidence--Beaton, no doubt, identified this
   courageous preacher with his political as well as religious enemies. He
   was the intimate associate, and, by his eloquence and activity, the
   most powerful support of the anti-Papal or English party. The cardinal
   knew this well, and aimed accordingly, by his apprehension and death,
   to strike the most fatal blow he could at the party.

   George Wishart, as he stands depicted in the pages of Knox and
   Calderwood, is a singularly interesting character; of gentle, winning,
   and unassuming disposition, with a strange wild tinge of enthusiasm, an
   intense spirit of devotion, and a commanding eloquence; "a man of sic
   graces as before him were never heard in this realm, yea, and rare to
   be found yet in ony man." Obliged to seek refuge some time before in
   England from the persecution of the Bishop of Brechin, he returned to
   Scotland in 1543, [202] with the commissioners who had been sent to
   negotiate a treaty with Henry VIII. He had been dwelling for some time
   in the very centre of the Anglican reform movement at Cambridge, where
   the influence of Bilney and Latimer still lived; and he seems to have
   caught some share of the spirit of both--the mild rapture of the one,
   and the hasty denunciatory zeal of the other. On his return to Scotland
   he travelled from town to town, and county to county; preaching the
   truth which had become precious to his own soul. He made a deep
   impression wherever he went. His words wrought with a marvellous
   persuasiveness on some even of the most hardened and wicked in the
   land--such men, for example, as the Laird of Schein, described by Knox,
   who, as the preacher on a "hette and pleasant day" of summer addressed
   the crowd from a "dyke on a muir edge, upon the south-west side of
   Mauchlin," was so affected that "the tears rane fra his eyne in sic
   abundance that all men wondered," and who by his future life, moreover,
   showed that "his conversion then wrought was without hypocrisy." [203]

   In his preaching excursions, Wishart gathered around him devoted
   followers, and was the inspiring mind of the Protestant party, now
   adding rapidly to its numbers. It is as one of these followers that
   Knox first clearly appears upon the scene of the Reformation, and in a
   very characteristic attitude. He tells us himself, that from the time
   that the zealous preacher came to Lothian, he waited carefully upon
   him, bearing "a twa-handed sword." This precaution had been used since
   an attempt had been made to assassinate the preacher; and the bold
   spirit of Knox, now kindling into its full ardour, rejoiced in the
   attendant post of danger. At this very time, however, the machinations
   of the Cardinal against Wishart had reached their completion; and while
   he rested at Ormiston, after his last remarkable sermon at Haddington,
   he was made a prisoner by the Earl of Bothwell; while Beaton himself
   lay within a mile, at the head of 500 men, in case any attempt should
   be made to rescue him. There is a strange weird interest in Knox's
   description of his last interview with the preacher, and his final
   sermon. Disappointed at not meeting with the friends he expected,--the
   Earl of Cassius and others,--and disheartened by the apparent decline
   of the popular interest in the reformed cause, he spoke to his intrepid
   sword-bearer of his weariness with the world, and "as he pacit up and
   doun behind the hie altar, mair than half an hour before sermon, his
   verie countenance and visage declarit the grief and alteration of his
   mind." The shadow of his approaching doom had crept upon him; and when
   Knox wished to share his fate, and accompany him to Ormiston, he said,
   "Nay, return to your bairnes, and God bless you; ane is sufficient for
   a sacrifice." [204]

   Knox's "bairnes" were his pupils, the sons of the lairds of Niddrie and
   Ormiston. In default of any more definite occupation, he had settled as
   a quiet tutor to the sons of these families. From the time of his
   quitting St Andrews up to this time, when, in his fortieth year, he
   first publicly appears in connection with Wishart, we can scarcely be
   said to know anything further of him. As has been pointed out, there is
   considerable significance in this long period of silence in Knox's
   history. It speaks strongly of his naturally peaceful disposition, of
   the patient maturity with which he formed his opinions, and of the
   consequent absurdity of the notion that would fix him down at once as a
   mere ambitious and turbulent partisan. It may serve also to explain the
   singular decision and completeness of his views when the outburst of
   his reforming zeal at length came.

   Now, after the apprehension of Wishart, he seems to have remained
   cautiously in his retirement, mourning the dreadful fate of his friend,
   till the great event, perpetrated at the old castle of St Andrews, on
   the morning of the 29th May 1546, summoned him from his privacy, and
   imparted a new direction and a nobler interest to his life. This event
   lives nowhere so vividly and powerfully as in his own wonderful
   narrative, [205] in which the horror of the circumstances is wildly
   relieved by a stern glee, kindling in the writer as he tells them in
   careful outline. It is equally needless to condemn the spirit of the
   historian, or to find excuses for it. If the horror of the transaction
   obscures in our minds all feeling of pleasantry as we look back upon
   it, we have to thank Knox, and such men as Knox, that there is left to
   us no occasion of any other feeling. To him, and to all honest and
   patriot hearts in Scotland in the middle of the sixteenth century, the
   death of Cardinal Beaton, under whatever circumstances of atrocity,
   could not, unfortunately, be anything else but a circumstance of
   gratulation. It is the divine doom of tyranny, in whatever shape, that
   men should rejoice at its murder, even if that murder be "foully done."
   The joy is not in fault, but the cause of it. The former is a pure
   manifestation of human feeling, the latter an eternal blasphemy and
   violation of human right. Knox is gleeful, therefore, with a scornful
   laughter, over the assassination of Beaton, simply because he realised
   all the meaning of the event for his country, and could not see the
   downfall of a power so hateful without a natural impulse of jubilee. As
   we look back into the dim grey of that May morning, we only see the
   solitary and helpless man raised from his bed, and in the murderous
   grip of his assassins. Knox remembered, as if it had happened
   yesterday, the proud and imperious tyrant, who reclined on velvet
   cushions at the castle window, to feast his eyes on the torments of his
   martyred friend. A life of such dazzling strength as Beaton's,
   terminating so swiftly in an abject and miserable death, may well move
   us to pity--it could only move Knox to irony; and if the event be not
   one for irony, we may say with Mr Froude, "we do not, know what irony
   is for."

   Nearly a year subsequent to the death of Beaton (April 1547), Knox took
   refuge with his pupils in the castle of St Andrews, which continued to
   be held against the Regent notwithstanding his efforts to reduce it. It
   became the temporary stronghold of the reforming interest, and many
   resorted to it for protection. Here Knox began, he tells us, "to
   exercise his pupils after his accustomed manner. Besides their grammar
   and other human authors, he read unto them a Catechism, account whereof
   he caused them to give publickly in the parish kirk of St Andrews. He
   read, moreover, unto them the evangel of John, proceeding where he had
   left at his departing from Langniddrie, and that lecture he read in the
   chapel within the castle at a certain hour." In this modest way Knox
   introduces us to the great epoch of his life which was approaching. Now
   in his forty-second. year, with his convictions fully formed, and with
   obvious powers of expressing and defending them beyond those of any
   other man of his time, he had yet remained, as we have seen, silent.
   The awe and responsibility of speaking to the people in God's stead
   weighed heavily on his mind as on Luther's, and the arguments of his
   friends failed to move him. Struck with the "manner of his doctrine,"
   they "began earnestly to travail with him that he would take the
   preaching place upon him." John Rough, who was preacher in the castle,
   and who seems honestly to have felt his own weakness in comparison with
   the gifts of the reformer, and Henry Balnaves, a Lord of Session, and
   one of the most influential of the early reformers, joined in urging
   this request. But he tells us "he utterly refused, alleging that he
   would not run where God had not called him." This refusal, however,
   only sharpened the desire of his friends to see him in his natural
   vocation, and they devised, in company with Sir David Lindsay of the
   Mount, equally eager with themselves, a plan by which they hoped to
   surprise him into compliance with their designs. The story is one of
   the most singular and characteristic in all the reformer's life, and
   can only be told in his own language: "Upon a certain day a sermon was
   had of the election of ministers, what power the congregation (how
   small soever it was, passing the number of two or three) had above any
   man in whom they supposed and espied the gifts of God to be, and how
   dangerous it was to refuse, and not to hear the voice of such as desire
   to be instructed. These and other heads declared, the said John Rough,
   preacher, directed his words to the said John Knox, saying, Brother, ye
   shall not be offended, albeit that I speak unto you that which I have
   in charge even from all those that are here present, which is this: In
   the name of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, and in the name of these
   that presently call you by my mouth, I charge you that you refuse not
   this holy vocation, but as ye tender the glory of God, the increase of
   Christ's kingdom, the edification of your brethren, and the comfort of
   me, whom ye understand well enough to be oppressed by the multitude of
   labours, that ye take upon you the public office and charge of
   preaching, even as ye look to avoid God's heavy displeasure, and desire
   that He shall multiply His graces with you.' And in the end he said to
   those who were present, Was not this your charge to me, and do you not
   approve the vocation?' They answered, It was, and we approve it.'
   Whereat the said John, abashed, burst forth in most abundant tears, and
   withdrew himself to his chamber; his countenance and behaviour from
   that day till the day that he was compelled to present himself to the
   public place of preaching, did sufficiently declare the grief and
   trouble of his heart; for no man saw any sign of mirth of him, neither
   yet had he pleasure to accompany any man many days together." [206]

   A special necessity soon occurred to him to enter upon his vocation.
   Dean John Arran, "a rotten Papist, had long troubled John Rough in his
   preaching," and Knox was roused to vindicate the doctrine of his friend
   "in open audience in the parish church of St Andrews." The people heard
   him gladly, and called upon him with one consent to give them by his
   preaching "probation of what he had affirmed; for if it was true, they
   had been miserably deceived." And so the next Sunday Knox preached the
   parish church, and expounded at length his views of the Papacy. He at
   once urged the most decided opinions, and supported his assertions
   under the different heads of life, doctrine, laws, and subjects. The
   sermon made a great noise, as may be imagined; and on the remonstrance
   of Hamilton, the bishop-elect (not yet "execrated"--"consecrated," they
   call it, bitterly remarks Knox), with Winram, the sub-prior and
   vicar-general during the vacancy of the see, Knox and Rough were
   summoned to give an account of their doctrine in a convention of
   grey-friars and black-friars appointed in St Leonard's Yards. Certain
   articles were read to them, and are admitted by Knox to contain a fair
   representation of his views. They are preserved in his History, and
   enable us to understand very clearly, in connection with the dispute
   which followed, the position which he now occupied. The Pope is
   asserted to be Antichrist, the mass abominable idolatry, purgatory a
   falsehood, and bishops, except as ordinary preachers, to have no
   function, When we contrast such views with those of Luther or Latimer
   at the outset, we perceive at once what comparatively clear and
   determinate ground, as opposed to the old Catholic system, was taken up
   by our reformer. He offered no points of mere advance and improvement
   upon that system; he showed no regretful dealing nor sympathetic
   connection with it--but a complete and decisive reaction against it. It
   was not merely corrupt, but absolutely abandoned to evil--the Church
   not of God, but of the devil. "Ye will leave us no kirk," said the
   grey-friar (Arbugkill) who rashly entered the lists with the reformer
   on the occasion, and, driven to shifts by his arguments, had nothing to
   reply but that "the apostles had not receaved the Holy Ghost when they
   did write their Epistles"--"Ye will leave us no kirk," urged the friar.
   "Indeed," said Knox, "in David I read that there is a Church of the
   malignants; for he says, Odi Ecclesiam Malignantium.'" It was clear
   that there was no room for compromise here. Knox could recognise no
   authority, no sanctity, no respectability in the Papacy of his country.
   The, very order of bishops, as identified with it, had already become
   undivine to his mind. He was a Presbyterian, all at once, by the mere
   force of antipathy to Catholicism as it presented itself to his view.
   The absence of positive doctrinal sentiments in these articles is
   observable; but too much is not to be made of this. The points of
   definite negation to the papal system were necessarily those which came
   into most prominence; and in the sermon which was the occasion of them,
   he tells us that he spoke also of the "doctrine of justification
   expressed in Scripture, which teach that man is justified by faith
   alone--that the blood of Jesus Christ purges us from all our sins."
   [207]

   Knox's activity at this period was but shortlived. A French squadron
   appeared before the Castle of St Andrews in the end of June of the same
   year; and the brave garrison who had held out so long, being now
   pressed both by sea and land, were forced to capitulate. The honourable
   terms on which they had surrendered were speedily violated; and Knox,
   who had shared the fate of his comrades, was transported along with
   them to France, and then confined as a prisoner on board the French
   galleys.

   This may be said to close the first great period in Knox's life--the
   period of his preparation for, and commencement of, his reforming work.
   The second period, which embraces his more or less complete exile from
   Scotland for a space of twelve years, or on to 1559, shows the working
   of his reforming zeal on an extended field, and amid the most strange
   vicissitudes. We can only here indicate its various points of interest.

   His imprisonment in the French galleys for two years, and the
   sufferings he there endured, served to deepen, and render still more
   dear to him, his religious convictions, and also to give some tinge of
   sadness and asperity to his character. Then his residence in England
   for four years, from 1549 to the beginning of 1554, was a time fruitful
   to him in work and experience. He was brought, as one of Edward VI.'s
   chaplains, into immediate contact with the great agents of the Anglican
   Reformation--with Cranmer--probably (nay, certainly, we may say) with
   Latimer, who during this period was a regular inmate of Cranmer's house
   at Lambeth. If they did meet, the two bold preachers, they must have
   talked, and talked with a heartiness and a vehemence that doubtless did
   the archbishop, among his court movements, some good to hear. It is
   understood that Knox had considerable influence in producing the
   liberal changes in the service and prayer-book of the Church of England
   which characterised the last years of Edward's reign. Unquestionably,
   any influence he did exert must have been in this direction, and indeed
   in a still more radical direction for he leaves us in no doubt as to
   his views of the partial and imperfect character of the English
   Reformation. Both he himself and Beza lead us to suppose that he was
   offered a bishopric; [208] but his conscientious doubts as to the
   divine authority of the Episcopal order, and his general
   dissatisfaction with the state of ecclesiastical affairs in England,
   led him to reject this as well as another offer which was shortly
   afterwards made to him. It was proposed to present him to the "vicarage
   or parsonage of All-hallows," vacant by "the preferment of Thomas.
   Sampson to the deanery of Chichester." Knox's refusal to accept this
   latter promotion was made a subject of inquiry before the Privy
   Council, when he urged his scruples as to the existing order of the
   Church of England, and after "some gentle speeches" was dismissed. He
   had no such scruples as to preaching. In Berwick--where we first hear
   of him after his liberation--in Newcastle, in London before the King
   and Council, in Buckinghamshire, where he seems to have spent a
   considerable part of the summer of 1553, he preached with incessant
   activity, awakening a wide interest everywhere, as we may gather from
   his future letters and admonition to the faithful in England. Long
   afterwards he especially congratulated himself on the review of his
   labours in Berwick, and the success which attended his efforts to
   maintain order among the lawless garrisons of the Border. [209]

   At Berwick our reformer fell in love, and entered into an engagement
   which, some years after, notwithstanding the strong opposition of
   certain relatives of the lady, terminated in marriage. The lady was a
   Miss Marjory Bowes, daughter of Richard Bowes, the youngest son of Sir
   Ralph Bowes of Streatham. Her mother was the daughter and one of the
   co-heirs of Sir Richard Aske of Aske, and Knox's connection with the
   family seeing to have arisen through this lady. It is to Mrs Bowes that
   his letters, which have been recently published in full in the edition
   of Dr Laing, [210] are chiefly written. She is addressed as his mother,
   and in the most confidential and intimate terms. The letters as a whole
   are remarkable. They prove the deep sincerity of Knox's piety,--his
   intense absorption in the realities of the spiritual life, while yet
   mingling with so busy and apparently combative an activity in the
   affairs of the world around him. They are, in truth, rather the
   communings of one earnest and strongly moved soul with another, than
   letters in any ordinary sense. We certainly miss in them some mixture
   of mere human interest with the uniform and intense cast of the
   religious phraseology in which they abound. The world is out of sight
   altogether, save as the stern battle-ground of certain shadowy forms of
   good and evil; at least the forms have become shadowy to us, although
   no doubt they were more real and living than anything else to Knox. In
   vain we try to catch any sunlight of happy feeling--any lively trace of
   the affection associated with them, if not originating them--any
   glimpse of her to whom his heart was bound. The mother appears in a
   sufficiently distinct aspect, a timid, self-conscious, and despairing
   soul, ever seeking strength and counsel from the more assured spirit of
   the reformer. The unyielding insolence of the uncle (Sir Robert Bowes)
   also comes into light: his "disdainful, yea, despiteful words," Knox
   writes to his "dear mother," "have so pierced my heart, that my life is
   bitter unto me. I bear a good countenance with a sore troubled heart;
   while he that ought to consider matters with a deep judgment is become
   not only a despiser, but also a taunter of God's messengers. (God be
   merciful unto him!) Among other his most unpleasing words, while that I
   was about to have declared my part in the whole matter, he said, Away
   with your rhetorical reasons, for I will not be persuaded with them.'
   God knows I did use no rhetoric or coloured speech, but would have
   spoken the truth, and that in most simple manner. It is supposed that
   all the matter comes by you and me." [211] There would almost seem some
   ground for this suspicion of the uncle, in the comparative obscurity
   which surrounds the daughter throughout the correspondence. She
   scarcely comes into faint outline--scarcely moves even in shadow across
   the scene; and we nowhere learn anything of her. There are no surviving
   traits in his letters or elsewhere that enable us to start any picture
   of her. Calvin, indeed, talks of her as "suavissima," in a letter to
   Christopher Goodman after her death; and the manner in which he
   deplores to Knox himself her loss, indicates his very high opinion of
   her worth and amiability; but still we do not get any living likeness
   of her anywhere. Their marriage is supposed to have taken place in
   1553, just before he was driven abroad by the Marian persecution. [212]

   On the accession of Queen Mary, Knot was driven from England. He was
   reluctant to take flight--for "never could he die," he said, "in a more
   honest quarrel;" but some of his friends impelled him, "partly by
   advice and partly by tears," to consult his own safety. He took refuge
   in Dieppe, where we find him at frequent intervals during the next four
   years of his life. Many of his letters, and his "Admonition to the
   Professors of God's Faith in England," bear the date of Dieppe. It
   served to him as a convenient post of observation, as well as a secure
   place of shelter: he could hear of his friends in England and Scotland,
   and hold intercourse with them from this place more readily than from
   any other point of the Continent. After his arrival he wrote to his
   mother-in-law, anxious to hear of her steadfastness in the faith--her
   "continuance with Christ Jesus, in the day of this His battle," and to
   vindicate himself from the charge of cowardice in flying from the scene
   of danger. "Some will ask," he says, "then why did I flee? Assuredly, I
   cannot tell; but of one thing I am sure, the fear of death was not the
   chief cause of my fleeing."

   After making a brief journey through Switzerland, visiting the
   different churches, and conferring with "all the pastors and many other
   excellently learned men," he returned to his place of refuge, with some
   intention of hazarding a visit to his friends in Berwick; but he was
   dissuaded from this, and appears to have settled for some months in
   Dieppe, [213] from which we find him sending forth in July (1554) his
   "Admonition." This famous tract is written with great vehemence, rising
   here and there into fierce objurgation, called forth by the threatening
   aspect of affairs in England. Cranmer and Ridley and Latimer had been
   imprisoned; the Queen was on the eve of her marriage with Philip of
   Spain. Knox deeply felt for the sufferings of the faithful; he groaned
   to think of the trials to which their constancy would be exposed; he
   saw no less all the calamities and dangers of the Spanish alliance; and
   he gives full vent to his feelings on both subjects. He spares no
   language that may awaken and impress his friends, or convey his sense
   of the wickedness of the royal combination against their liberties and
   religion. A tone of wild sadness mingles with his violence, under the
   influence of which he judges himself as well as others. There is a
   grave severity in his personal strictures that may at least convince us
   of his honesty. If he was harsh to others, he was no less so to
   himself: "Alas! this day," he says, "my conscience accuseth me that I
   spake not so plainly as my duty was to have done. . . . The blind love
   that I did bear to this my wicked carcass was the chief cause that I
   was not fervent and faithful enough in that behalf. Remaining in one
   place, I was not so diligent as my office required; but sometime, by
   counsel of carnal friends, I spared the body; some time I spent in
   worldly business; and some time in taking recreation and pastime by
   exercise of the body. And besides," he adds, "I was assaulted, yea
   infected with more gross sins--that is, my wicked nature desired the
   favours, the estimation, and praise of men; and so privily and craftily
   did they enter into my breast, that I could not perceive myself to be
   wounded till vainglory almost got the upper hand." These are surely
   clear and honest words, if ever there were such, Speaking of the
   unselfish simplicity and stern conscientiousness of the man!

   Returning to Switzerland in the end of summer, he remained there only a
   short time when he set out for Frankfort-on-the-Main, on an invitation
   from a party of English Protestant exiles who had settled in this city,
   to become one of their ministers. Having formed themselves into a
   congregation, these exiles had obtained from the magistrates the joint
   use of the French Protestant church for their worship, on the condition
   that it should conform as nearly as possible to that of the French
   Church. This arrangement was displeasing to many of the exiles in other
   places, and became the source of a very painful and perplexing series
   of "troubles." Knox would seem to have had apprehensions of the
   difficulty of the position, and to have manifested accordingly some
   reluctance to embrace the invitation addressed to him; but his assent
   was secured through the intervention of Calvin, and in October 1554 he
   arrived in Frankfort. The seeds of discord had been already sown before
   his arrival; but he had, through the timely and sensible
   representations of Calvin, [214] wellnigh succeeded in arranging the
   matter satisfactorily, when all his efforts were interrupted and
   brought to an end. A new party of exiles among the most conspicuous of
   whom was Dr Cox, who had been preceptor to Edward VI., [215] arrived in
   Frankfort in March. They were violently determined to uphold the order
   of service as it had been "set forth by King Edward." On the very first
   Sunday after their arrival they made the responses aloud, contrary to
   what had been agreed upon; and on the following Sunday one of their
   number intruded into the pulpit and read the Litany, to which Cox and
   his companions responded audibly. The result, as may be imagined, was a
   violent contention between the parties. It was nothing less than the
   Puritan quarrel, already begun in King Edward's reign, carried abroad;
   and Knox did not hesitate, in his sermon in the afternoon of the
   same-day, to characterise it as such, and to condemn the whole spirit
   and manner of the English Reformation as inadequate. Cox and his
   friends, finding themselves unable to contend with the reformer,
   supported as he was by the chief body of the congregation, had recourse
   to a somewhat disgraceful act to get rid of them. They represented to
   the magistrates that in his "Admonition," published the year before, he
   had used treasonable language regarding the Queen of England and her
   husband, Philip of Spain. The magistrates, after some perplexity,
   requested Whittingham to advise Knox to take his departure; and he
   accordingly returned to Geneva again for a brief interval.

   These "Frankfort Troubles," it must be confessed, form a somewhat
   melancholy illustration of the pettiness as well as violence of
   religious feeling which marked some of the English reformers; and
   whatever may have been the unjustifiable vehemence of Knox's language
   in the "Admonition," and in some of his other writings, his conduct
   certainly appears with advantage on the present occasion in contrast
   with that of his opponents. He was far more magnanimous in his defeat
   than they were in their equivocal victory. The only excuse that can be
   urged for them is the feeling of just resentment which they may have
   had towards Knox for his unwarrantable language in the "Admonition,"
   which, so far from proving of service to the cause of the Reformation
   in England, there is reason to believe had excited the Government to
   more violent persecution, and helped to kindle the fires of martyrdom
   that consumed Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley. [216]

   Knox had scarcely once more settled in Geneva when he received
   information which led him to undertake a visit to his native country.
   Amid all his journeyings and troubles he had, never forgotten the
   interests of religion in Scotland. The thought which had sustained him
   amidst his captivity in the galleys, as he saw in the distance the
   spires of St Andrews, where God had first opened his mouth in public to
   His glory--"And I am fully persuaded that I shall not depart this life
   till that my tongue shall glorify His godly name in the same
   place"--this thought, no doubt, often recurred to him; and
   circumstances seemed now to point towards its fulfilment. The accession
   of the Queen-Dowager to the regency in 1554 had proved partially
   favourable to Protestantism. The persecutions of Mary in England, and
   her alliance with Spain in opposition to France, and the natural
   interests of the Queen-Dowager, had contributed in some degree to the
   same end. A spirit of inquiry, for the time unrestrained, was spreading
   among many of the nobles and burgesses. These favourable signs drew
   Knox to the scene of movement. He arrived in Scotland in the end of
   autumn 1555, and soon after repaired to Edinburgh, where he held many
   private conferences with Erskine of Dun, young Maitland of Lethington,
   and others. His reception was very warm, and the desire to hear the
   truth from his lips very encouraging, according to his own statement in
   his letters to his mother-in-law. "The fervency here doth far exceed
   all others that I have seen. If I had not seen it with my eyes in my
   own country, I could not have believed it." He held a remarkable debate
   with Maitland on the subject of the mass, [217] in which he disputed
   the opinion ingeniously held by the latter that it was warrantable for
   the Protestants to continue their attendance upon it. He succeeded in
   convincing his hearers, and even Maitland acknowledged himself refuted;
   but we may trace already in their respective positions, and the
   arguments used by each, the strong contrasts of character which
   separated the subtle and accommodating politician from the outspoken
   and unbending reformer.

   Knox continued throughout the winter in Scotland, and earnestly
   prosecuted the work on which he had entered. He came into contact with
   all or most of the men who were afterwards associated with the progress
   of the Scottish Reformation,--Lord Lorn (Argyll), the Prior of St
   Andrews (Murray), the Earl of Glencairn, and others. Under the
   protection of the latter, he preached in Kyle and Cunningham, where the
   still unspent spirit of Lollardism must have proved a receptive soil
   for the new doctrines. Erskine carried him to Angus, where the feeling
   of dislike and opposition to the corrupt prelacy, which was lording it
   over the country, was of a peculiarly strong and intelligent character.
   His preaching in Angus especially appears to have aroused the clergy.
   He was summoned before a convention of them appointed to meet in
   Edinburgh in May, and so strongly did he feel himself supported for the
   time, that he made up his mind to obey the summons. This was more than
   they anticipated, and setting aside the summons, they deserted the
   diet. His success for a while seemed to carry everything before it, and
   his heart was lifted up at the prospect with more joy than he could
   express. "O sweet were the death," he writes to his mother-in-law,
   "that should follow such forty days in Edinburgh as here I have had
   three! Rejoice, mother: the time of our deliverance approacheth."

   Calmer reflection, however, convinced Knox that this "time of
   deliverance" was not so closely at hand. He had ventured to address a
   letter to the Queen-Regent, urging the necessity of a reform of
   religion, and representing the hopelessness of any improvement in the
   existing prelacy. The Earl Marischal, along with Glencairn, had urged
   this duty upon him, and the latter delivered it into her hand. Glancing
   carelessly over it, she handed it to the Archbishop of Glasgow beside
   her, with the remark, "Please you, my lord, to read a pasquil." Knox
   was very indignant when this remark was reported to him, and
   afterwards, in publishing the letter, he made some additions to it in a
   less courtly and specious style than had characterised the original.
   In, the meantime, an invitation from the English exiles at Geneva had
   reached him, to undertake the pastoral charge among them; and he does
   not appear to have hesitated in accepting the offer. Doubtless he felt
   the expediency of it, not merely in reference to his own comfort, but
   to the progress of the Reformation in Scotland. He felt that the spirit
   which he had kindled would live on, and less provoke interference in
   his absence, till the time for a more effective movement came. The
   imputation of anything like cowardice on Knox's part is ridiculous. He
   was the last man to shrink from a struggle where it was necessary and
   likely to prove useful. Accompanied by his wife and mother-in-law, and
   "a pupil named Patrick," he accordingly set out from Scotland, and
   arrived in Geneva on the 13th September 1556. With a true instinct of
   cowardly vengeance, the clergy renewed their summons against him when
   he had left the country, and passed sentence on him, adjudging his body
   to the flames, and his soul to damnation.

   The years that our reformer now spent at Geneva, were probably among
   the happiest of his life. Calvin had just then attained to the summit
   of his power after the expulsion of the Libertines. He and Beza
   exercised virtual rule in all things civil and ecclesiastical; and the
   city, under their control, had assumed an order and apparent purity of
   manners that rejoiced the heart of Knox. He wrote to a friend that it
   was "the most perfect school of Christ that ever was on earth since the
   days of the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly
   preached; but manners and religion, to be so sincerely reformed, I have
   not yet seen in any other place beside."

   In Calvin and Beza, and his colleague Christopher Goodman, Knox found a
   thoroughly congenial society, and they found in him an earnest and
   devoted fellow-labourer. It would be interesting to contemplate their
   relation more narrowly, and to speculate on the influence, they may
   have exerted on one another. Especially it would be important as well
   as interesting to trace the connection between the two great
   reformers--to what extent the Scottish reformer may have been
   influenced by the Genevan, and a Calvinistic impress stamped upon him
   in the home of Calvinism. It cannot be said that we have any adequate
   means of reaching clear and definite conclusions an this subject. We
   have already seen that Knox's Presbyterianism was in some degree at
   least of native growth. He did not need to go to Geneva to learn to
   doubt the divine authority of Episcopacy. A certain hostility to the
   episcopal office mingled itself with his very first views of reform,
   and so far from being moderated, seems rather to have been increased by
   his English experience. Probably, however, he had formed no definite
   and well-conceived plan of Church polity, as opposed to Episcopacy,
   before his residence in Geneva; and there is every reason to believe
   that the system he beheld in operation there with so much admiration,
   served to give consistency and plan to his own previously vague
   conceptions. As to the doctrinal influence of Calvinism upon him, we
   can appreciate this, perhaps, still less accurately. It met in him a
   kindred soil--the same bent of religious thought, and especially that
   deep feeling of sin, out of which its most distinctive doctrines grew;
   and here too, therefore, we may suppose a certain clearness and
   coherence to have been given to his views. Yet Knox's mind was not
   characteristically doctrinal. Theological controversy could never
   absorb him as it did Calvin. Subtle as he may have once been as a
   scholastic teacher, dialectics was a play in which he had little
   delight, and his writings discover few traces of it. A healthy reality
   and honest sense, and living practical interest, are everywhere
   conspicuous, and banish out of view the mere controversialist and
   logician.

   It is to be remembered, too, in estimating the relation between Knox
   and Calvin, that Knox was really the older man of the two (a fact
   somehow apt to be forgotten), and that he had at this time reached an
   age--upwards of fifty--when men are not easily moulded by influences
   that may be even akin to them. [218] We must certainly hold, therefore,
   that there is no sense in which Geneva can be said to have made Knox,
   although it found him of kindred material, and fashioned him more
   completely into its own likeness. Especially, we are inclined to think,
   it strengthened in him a certain sternness of moral spirit, and its own
   strong theocratic confidence, so that he went forth from it more fully
   equipped for the great work before him in Scotland. Calvin and Knox
   suggest not so much the relation of disciple and master as of brother
   disciples in the same school, with the same severe type of character,
   and many of the same religious tendencies; but the one more
   intellectual, the other more passionate--the one more consistent and
   powerful in argument, the other more intrepid and masterly in
   action--the one the greater mind, the other the larger heart.

   Knox returned to Scotland in the beginning of May 1559. During his
   absence the Reformation had been making silent but sure progress. The
   war with England required the Queen-Regent to temporise with its
   leaders, and to allow a certain liberty of opinion and worship. A
   letter which Knox had addressed to the Protestant Lords in 1557, from
   Dieppe (whither he had proceeded so far with the intention of returning
   to his native country), had exercised a happy influence in uniting them
   more firmly, and inspiring them with a more courageous resolution in
   defence of the truth. At a meeting which they held in Edinburgh, in
   December 1557, they mutually bound themselves to uphold the common
   cause, [219] and at the same time renewed the invitation which they had
   formerly given to the reformer to return to his native country. It was
   in compliance with this invitation, which did not reach Geneva till the
   following year, that Knox now reappeared finally in Scotland. Nothing
   could be more opportune than his arrival. The course of events seemed
   prepared as if to give to it the greatest importance. A crisis was at
   hand; a leader was needed. It was the very turning-point in the balance
   of parties which had been swaying to and fro during the last four
   years, and Knox's strong hand was the only one which could have carried
   aloft the cause of reform, and give to it the triumph which, through
   all temporary reverses, it has ever since maintained.

   The Queen-Regent, relieved from the political pressure which had
   induced her to temporise, had at length thrown off all disguise. United
   cordially with the Hamiltons, she appeared in her true colours as a
   determined opponent of the Reformation, and at this very moment had,
   with the well-dissembled craft of her race, laid her plans for its
   forcible overthrow. Certain preachers who, during the previous year,
   had become objects of marked hostility to the clergy, were summoned to
   take their trial at Stirling for usurping the ministerial office, and
   seducing the people by erroneous doctrines. A convention of the
   nobility and clergy was held in Edinburgh, where the very moderate
   demands of the Protestants were not only refused, but all the main
   abuses of the Popish system were confirmed, and an inquisition
   appointed to be made of all who absented themselves from mass, or were
   in any way privy to the new worship. It was obvious that a struggle
   could no longer be delayed. Parties were taking their sides, and
   resolutely awaiting its outbreak. Knox congratulated himself that he
   had come at the very hour of need. "I see the battle shall be great,"
   he wrote to his wife, who remained behind at Geneva, "but I am come, I
   thank my God, even in the brunt of the battle."

   He resolved to appear at Stirling on the 10th of May, along with the
   reforming preachers. He hastened to Dundee, where the chiefs of the
   party were assembled in great numbers, Erskine of Dun at their head--a
   wise and moderate as well as intrepid counsellor in this great
   exigency. From Dundee the reformers proceeded to Perth, and instead of
   advancing directly to Stirling, paused here, apparently at the
   suggestion of Erskine, who went forward by himself to intimate to the
   Queen-Regent the peaceable intentions of the party, formidable as they
   might seem in numbers and combination. Alarmed at the prospect of such
   an invasion, she had recourse to her usual tactics of dissimulation,
   persuaded Erskine to write to his friends in Perth to check their
   advance, and promised to put a stop to the trial. On the day of trial,
   however, the accused ministers were summoned, and outlawed for not
   appearing, and all who should harbour them denounced as rebels. The
   national excitement, which had continued to gather force, was greatly
   strengthened by this flagrant act of perfidy; and an event which now
   occurred in Perth served to kindle it into a flame.

   On the very day on which the news of the Regent's conduct came, Knox
   preached a sermon on the idolatry of the mass and of image-worship. At
   the close of the sermon, and while the people still lingered under the
   warm emotion of the preacher's words, an encounter took place between a
   boy and a priest, who, with a singular deadness to the signs around
   him, had uncovered a rich altar-piece, and was making preparations to
   celebrate mass. The boy threw a stone, which overturned and destroyed
   one of the images. The act operated like a spark laid to a train. The
   suppressed indignation of the multitude burst forth beyond all control:
   the consecrated imagery was broken in pieces; the holy recesses
   invaded; the pictures and ornaments torn from the walls and trampled in
   the dust; and, rising with the agitation, the spirit of disorder spread
   and the "rascal multitude," as Knox afterwards called them, having
   completed their work of destruction in the church, proceeded to the
   houses of the Grey and Black Friars, and the Charterhouse or Carthusian
   Monastery, and violently ransacked them and laid them in ruins.

   This iconoclasm is a notable feature in the Scottish Reformation.
   Something of the same sort is to be found in Germany, and even in
   England; but in Scotland this destructive aspect of the Reformation was
   more general, prominent, and lawless than elsewhere,. and nothing
   connected with it has given rise to more invidious and severe
   animadversion. To our educated feelings and artistic sympathies, it can
   only appear as a very ugly and sad blot in a great cause. We mourn, and
   cannot but mourn, a mere violence of demolition, in which God was not
   served, while the fair work of man was dishonoured and destroyed. There
   is no friend of the Reformation called upon to defend such excesses,
   even on Knox's plea, that the "best way to keep the rooks from
   returning, was to pull down their nests;" for, on the one hand, we know
   that the rooks. will return even if you pull down their nests; and, on
   the other hand, it is a poor revenge against a living evil to attack
   its dead symbol. The spirit of the highest reform is everywhere the
   reverse of this. It attacks the corrupt life, or seeks to breathe
   health into it. It busies itself with essentials, and lets alone
   accidents. The forms will by-and-by adapt themselves to the altered and
   higher spirit. It was not merely a misfortune, therefore--it was a
   mistake, this iconoclasm of the Reformation. There is nothing to say
   for it on any general grounds of reason.

   But the explanation of it, and so far the defence of it, as a
   historical adjunct of the Reformation, is its very irrationality. Who
   were to blame for such a state of irrational and violent feeling among
   the people? Surely not Knox. Even if it be allowed that he did not
   discountenance, but rather approved of, the iconoclastic excitement,
   this merely shows that he did not so far rise above the rude social
   spirit of his country. He can in no way be held responsible for the
   existence and outbreak of the spirit. In point of fact, the blame of
   this, if it lie anywhere save with the general barbarism of the people,
   must lie with the very system against which it was directed: It was
   this system which, after centuries of unlimited rule, had left the
   people so untrained in orderly instinct--so coarse and undisciplined in
   moral feeling. This was all that its elaborate training and service,
   its conventual education and beneficence, had come to. It had inspired
   the people so little with any spirit of order, or respect even to the
   usages of worship, that when for the first time they heard of a living
   God and Saviour, and a divine righteousness and truth in the world,
   they could do nothing but rise up against the churches and demolish
   them. If this be not one of the worst condemnations of the old
   Catholicism of Scotland, condemnation certainly ceases to have any
   meaning. It is hard, certainly, to blame the Reformation for an odious
   inheritance of social disorder transmitted to it by the corrupt system
   which it displaced. A system which not only left a people unblessed
   with truth, but failed even to animate them with any instincts of
   self-control, is twice condemned, and was well hurled from its' place
   of pride and power with an indignation not more than it merited, and a
   lawlessness which had grown up under its own shadow.

   The same scenes which had occurred at Perth followed at Stirling,
   Lindores, Cupar, St Andrews, and elsewhere. Knox almost immediately
   repaired to St Andrews, rejoicing to verify his own prediction, that he
   would yet again glorify the name of God in that place. Here, in the
   very centre of the old ecclesiastical influence, and under the very
   eyes of Hamilton, the Reformation proceeded with an equal vehemence and
   completeness. The magistracy took the lead in it. The cathedral was
   devastated; the monasteries pulled down; and the reformed discipline
   began to be established.

   In the meantime, and as the consequence of these movements, a civil war
   raged throughout the kingdom--the Regent on the one hand, assisted by
   French troops; and the Lords of the Congregation, as the heads of the
   Protestant party were called, on the other hand, backed by Elizabeth.
   The details of this conflict are beyond our scope. Knox not only joined
   in it, but was the great animating spirit of the reformed
   army--counselling its leaders, writing letters to Cecil, maintaining
   his dignity in the midst of entreaty, and, upon the whole, his fairness
   and uprightness in the midst of intrigue. Some unfortunate expressions
   indeed escaped him, in a letter to Sir James Croft, about the mode of
   sending English troops into Scotland, without incurring a breach of
   treaty with France; but the necessities of his position must excuse, if
   not altogether justify, any "political casuistry" to which he was
   driven. At length, after not a few reverses sustained by the Protestant
   party, the vigorous assistance rendered by Elizabeth, and the death of
   the Queen-Regent at the very time that the English troops had invested
   Edinburgh, led to a truce, and the summons of a Free Parliament to
   settle differences. All the triumph remained in the hands of the
   reformers. So soon as the withdrawal of the French troops, according to
   the conditions of the treaty, took place, the ecclesiastical interests
   which they had upheld fell prostrate. A tyranny, unnational in spirit
   and disreputable in character, collapsed before the free breath of the
   country, like an old and mouldy garment upon which the air has been let
   in. Scarcely anywhere else is there an instance of a national
   revolution at once so summary and complete; and instead of wondering
   that blood was shed while a corrupt system sought to maintain itself by
   foreign interference, the wonder really is, that so soon as this
   interference was withdrawn, so great a change should have taken place,
   upon the whole, so peacefully and well.

   The Reformation, which had now triumphed in Scotland, immediately
   sought to establish itself by a series of important acts. At the
   command of Parliament, which met in August (1560), "certain barons and
   ministers" drew up, in the course of four days, a Confession of Faith,
   which, having been submitted to Parliament, and "read every article by
   itself over again," was, with the exception of one or two dissentient
   voices, [220] universally accepted as a dogmatic basis of the Reformed
   Church. Three measures of a negative character were also forthwith
   passed,--one for the abolition of the power and jurisdiction of the
   Pope; a second, for the repeal of all former statutes in favour of the
   Roman Catholic Church; and a third, for the infliction of severe
   penalties, even to the extent of death, upon all who should either say
   mass or be present at its celebration. The intolerance of this last
   enactment may fill us with pain, but can scarcely surprise us. In the
   Scottish Reformation, still more than in the Lutheran or Genevan, the
   struggle was not between mere freedom on the one hand and
   ecclesiastical oppression on the other; but between two positive
   systems of religious opinion, equally dogmatic in their presumed
   possession of the truth. We have seen how, from the beginning, Knox had
   identified the mass with idolatry; and in now interdicting its
   celebration under such stringent penalties, he and others conceived
   themselves to be merely carrying out the denunciations of the Divine
   Word against idolatry. Any suspicions that these denunciations could be
   no fair weapons in their fallible hands, and in wholly dissimilar
   circumstances, never crossed them. The Bible was to Knox, as it was to
   Calvin, and perhaps even more strongly, a modern statute-book, of which
   he and his brethren were the authorised interpreters. They had no
   perception of the hopeless confusion and difficulty involved in such a
   notion. They had no idea of any religious dissent from their opinions.
   They knew (and this is their only justification) that the
   re-establishment of the mass would prove ruinous both to the political
   and religious welfare of their country; and so they denounced against
   it confiscation, banishment, and finally death.

   These measures, conclusive as they were so far, by no means satisfied
   the ministers and more zealous reformers. It was not enough to destroy
   the old ecclesiastical fabric, and lay the dogmatic foundation of a new
   one; they desired, moreover, to define' and confirm the plan of the new
   Reformed Kirk. They urged upon Parliament, accordingly, the necessity
   of establishing a new rule of worship and discipline, and with this
   view prepared the well-known "Book of Policy," or "First Book of
   Discipline." The greedy barons of Scotland, however, were by no means
   disposed to relax their hold of the Church revenues to the extent which
   would have been necessary in carrying out some of the wise and
   enlightened provisions of this scheme of Church polity; [221] and
   notwithstanding, the urgency of the clergy, it never received the
   sanction of Parliament. The great designs of the reformer in the
   arrangement of Church offices, in the maintenance of discipline, and,
   above all, in the reform and re-endowment of the universities and the
   institution of parish schools, were termed in the "mockage" of such
   members of Parliament as young Maitland of Lethington, [222] "Devout
   imaginations." And so Knox was made to feel thus early the difficulties
   which from such men were soon to spring up around the progress of
   Protestantism in Scotland, and plunge him anew into contention.
   Disappointed in his hopes so far, however, he had the satisfaction of
   seeing the Book of Discipline approved of by the General Assembly,
   [223] and ratified by a considerable proportion of the members of the
   Privy Council.

   We cannot pause to criticise at length the special features of the
   Scottish Reformation as exhibited in the Confession of Faith and Book
   of Discipline, whose origin has been now described. Doctrinally and
   ecclesiastically, it bears an analogy to the Genevan Reformation,
   although by no means a close and servile analogy. It presents, upon the
   whole, a milder type of doctrine, of which every student may satisfy
   himself by the study of the different articles of the "Confession," as
   contained in Knox's History. The eighth article on Election is itself
   decisive upon this point. Not only is the rigour of the Calvinistic
   tenet modified, but it can scarcely be said to come into prominence.
   The language has a Biblical softness and simplicity, by no means
   recalling the stern, logical phraseology of Geneva. The sacramental
   doctrine, and the views as to the duties of the "civil magistrate," are
   more closely allied to those of Calvin;--there is the same strong
   assertion of the reality of a spiritual presence of Christ in the
   Eucharist, and the same confusion as to the relation of the political
   power to the purgation and chastisement of religious error.

   In the system of Church government presented in the Book of Discipline,
   there is at least equal evidence of a free and independent spirit.
   Instead of the mere pastors, doctors, and elders of the Genevan polity,
   there are superintendents and pastors and readers, and then elders and
   deacons. The superintendents were certainly not bishops in the old and
   Catholic sense of the word. Knox, we have already seen, was hostile to
   the pretensions of the episcopal order from the beginning, and neither
   now nor at any time did he regard with the slightest feelings of
   complacency its institution in the Protestant Church of Scotland.
   Still, apart from such priestly usurpations as had become strongly
   identified with the episcopal office in his mind, he evidently
   recognised, in the appointment of superintendents, the right of a
   semi-episcopal function of supervision and arrangement throughout the
   Church. If no believer in the divine right of Episcopacy, he was no
   more a believer in the divine right of Presbyterian parity; but he, and
   those who acted with him, "thought it a thing most expedient at this
   time, that from the whole number of godly and learned men, now
   presently in this realme, should be selected ten or twelve (for in so
   many provinces we have divided the whole), to whom charge and
   commandment should be given to plant and erect kirks, to set order, and
   appoint ministers as the former order prescribes, to the countries that
   shall be appointed to their care where none are now." [224] Against the
   recognition of this semi-episcopal function in the early Reformed Kirk
   of Scotland, it is not of the least importance to urge, as Dr MCrie has
   done, that it was a mere temporary expedient--for, in point of fact,
   the ground of Christian expediency is distinctly laid down in the
   twentieth article of the Confession of Faith, as the main guide of
   Church order and policy altogether. "In the Church, as in the house of
   God," it bears, "it becometh all things to be done decently and in
   order--not that we think that one policy and one order in ceremonies
   can be appointed for all ages, times, and places; for as ceremonies
   such as men have devised are but temporal, so may and ought they to be
   changed when they rather foster superstition than edify the Church
   using the same."

   In the more special arrangements of public worship there is the same
   flexible and adaptive freedom within certain limits. Certain things are
   stated to be utterly necessary, "as that the Word be truly preached,
   the sacraments rightly administered, common prayers publickly made,
   that children and rude persons be instructed in the chief points of
   religion, and that offences be corrected and punished." [225] Without
   these things, "there is no face of a visible kirk." But as to further
   details of service, the singing of psalms, the reading of certain
   places of Scripture when there was no sermon "this day or that, or how
   many days in the week the kirk should assemble," there is no certain
   order laid down, except that "in every notable town it is required that
   one day beside Sunday be appointed to the sermon, which, during the
   time of sermon and prayer, must be kept free from all exercise of
   labour." Baptism was allowed to be ministered "wheresoever the Word was
   preached." The administration of the Lord's Supper was to take place
   four times in the year; the Scriptures were to be read in order; and
   both in public and private worship the "common prayers" were to be
   used.

   It becomes a question what was meant by the expression "common
   prayers," so frequently used in the Book of Discipline. Does it refer
   to the service-book of Edward VI., the Book of Common Prayer? This view
   has been vigorously defended, and is supported by the language used in
   the resolution of the heads of the Congregation in 1557, that "the
   common prayer be read weekly on Sunday, and on other festival days, in
   the churches, with the lessons of the Old and New Testament, conform to
   the order of the Book of Common Prayer." According to this view, the
   English service-book is supposed to have been used by the Scottish
   Protestants during a period of seven years--viz., from 1557 to 1564,
   when it was superseded by the "Order of Geneva," [226] or what is
   called John Knox's Liturgy, which he had prepared for the use of the
   Church at Frankfort, and subsequently employed in his congregation in
   Geneva. In any case there can be doubt that the early Presbyterian
   service of Scotland, as in the case of every other Reformed Church, was
   in the main liturgical,--that certain "common prayers," carefully
   prepared and stamped with the sanction of the reformers, were generally
   used throughout the Church. The idea of extemporaneous prayer as an
   appropriate vehicle of public devotion was one quite unknown to the
   Reformation. In the reformed Discipline which sprang from Geneva, a
   certain latitude was permitted to the minister; but in no Church of the
   Reformation was public religious service entirely liberated from
   authorised forms of devotional expression. Freedom carried to this
   extent was a growth of later Puritanism, already beginning to corrupt
   in its arbitrary excesses; and in Scotland the general tendency was
   hardened into a fierce and defiant negativism by the insane prelatical
   despotism of Laud and his associates.

   (But we must how hasten onwards in our sketch. On the 19th of August
   1561, Queen Mary arrived in Scotland. French in education and Popish in
   religion--accustomed to the refinements of a luxurious court, the
   polish of artificial manners, and the admiration and flatteries which
   her youthful beauty had everywhere excited--Mary certainly entered on a
   task of unusual difficulty when she assumed the reins of government in
   her native country. The sorrow that darkened her heart as she watched,
   from the vessel that conveyed her, the receding shores of her beloved
   France, was only too sure a presage of the perils and calamities of her
   new career. Scarcely had she settled in her palace at Holyrood when
   difficulties arose. Was she to be permitted to celebrate mass, against
   which the punishment of death had been denounced? "Shall that idol be
   suffered again to take place within this realm?" [227] The difficulty
   was not a new one. It had presented itself to Knox from the first; and
   when the invitation was sent her to return to Scotland, he had strongly
   urged upon her brother, the prior of St Andrews, that she should be
   required to discontinue the offensive rite. Neither the prior nor the
   rest of the council, however, entered into Knox's views, anti he
   predicted that "her liberty would prove their thraldom." On the Sunday
   after her arrival she gave orders for a solemn mass to be performed in
   the chapel of Holyrood. Some of the more violent of the Protestants
   threatened to interfere by force to prevent it; but the discretion of
   her brother in stationing himself at the entrance to the chapel door
   was successful in preserving peace. Knox discountenanced all violence;
   but in his sermon on the following Sunday he entered upon the subject,
   and vehemently inveighed against the evils of idolatry.

   Mary was no doubt well informed of the influence of the bold reformer,
   and she sent for him to the palace, and held a long interview with him
   in the presence of her brother, "the Lord James." His famous book, The
   First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women,'
   which had no less provoked Elizabeth, was the first subject of her
   animadversion. It was a delicate topic, beyond doubt, for the reformer;
   but he defended himself with great skill and sense. "Please your
   Majesty," said he, "learned men in all ages have had their judgments
   free, and most commonly disagreeing from the common judgments of the
   world. Such also have they published, both with pen and tongue; and
   yet, notwithstanding, they themselves have lived in the common society
   with others, and have borne patiently with the errors and imperfections
   which they could not amend. . . . Even so, madam, am I content to do in
   uprightness of heart and with a testimony of a good conscience." He
   enforced this by a not very happy allusion to Paul's living under Nero,
   and then explained that his book was written especially "against that
   wicked Jezebel of England." "But ye speak of women in general,"
   retorted the Queen. "Most true it is, madam," was his reply; "and yet
   it appeareth to me that wisdom should persuade your Grace never to
   raise trouble for that which to this day has not troubled your Majesty
   neither in person nor in authority." The topic was then changed to the
   more pressing one of the rights of subjects towards their princes in
   the matter of religion. Knox firmly expressed his well-known
   sentiments, and referred to the case of the Hebrews in Babylon and the
   early Christians under the Roman Emperors. The Queen could not deny the
   force of the representation; but she urged, "Yea, but none of these men
   raised the sword against their princes." "Yet, madam," said he, "ye
   cannot deny but that they resisted, for those that obey not the
   commandments given them do in some sort resist." "But yet," she
   replied, "they resisted not by the sword." "God had not given them the
   power," said the reformer. "Think you," asked Mary, "that subjects
   having the power may resist their princes?" "If princes exceed their
   bounds, madam," unhesitatingly answered the reformer, "no doubt they
   may be resisted even by power."

   The whole of this interview, as well as the others that took place
   between Knox and Mary, are very interesting, and serve to bring into
   strong relief the characters of the two speakers. They clearly enough
   show Knox's suspicions of the Queen from the first, but they do not at
   all warrant the picture that has been sometimes drawn from them to the
   prejudice and disadvantage of the reformer. A beautiful and
   accomplished woman, and that woman a queen, confronted in her
   hereditary palace by a gloomy and frowning preacher, is an interesting
   and exciting picture of the imagination; but it is in reality nothing
   more. The mind that cannot see deeper below the surface than the mere
   grace and beauty and queenly majesty of Mary on the one side, and the
   rigour and uncourtly rudeness of Knox on the other, proves itself so
   little capable of historical penetration, that it must be allowed
   simply to please itself with its own delusions. The slightest glimpse
   below the' surface reveals to us in Mary and in Knox respectively the
   impersonation of two great principles then fighting for mastery not
   only in Scotland, but throughout Europe. Mary was not merely herself a
   Romanist by education, by sympathy, by that intense and unreasoning
   instinct with which a certain kind of nature always clings to
   traditionary beliefs and associations--she might have been all this,
   and been, if not a happy and beneficent, yet a tolerated governor of
   Scotland; and in such a view Knox's molestation of her for her own
   opinions, and the private observances of. her own religion, would have
   excited our indignation and pity. But Mary was far more than this, and
   no man knew it better than John Knox. She was the niece of the Guises,
   and the daughter-in-law of Catherine de Medicis; and she was. not only
   sympathetic with their aims, but. It is impossible to doubt she was
   privy to their most deeply laid schemes. She knew the great and crafty
   game they were then playing, and she was prepared, with profound skill
   and persevering energy, to aid it. [228]

   It requires us, in order rightly to appreciate the position of either,
   thus to look below their immediate circumstances, and bring into view
   the principles they represented, and. especially the character of that
   great Catholic reaction which had now set in so strongly against the
   Reformation. There is nothing more certain, and few things more
   terrible in history, than this movement, in the deliberate villany with
   which it was planned, and the secret, powerful, and elaborate perfidy
   and cold-blooded massacre with which it was so far prosecuted. Its
   centre was in Paris, although its inspiration was from Rome; and
   Italian craft and subtlety in the Guises were its leaders. Scotland
   possessed a peculiar and unexampled interest to it, not only or chiefly
   from its old relations to France, but especially as a basis and means
   of operation against England. The stock of Henry VIII. seemed likely to
   die out; Elizabeth alone, in her solitary majesty, stood between Mary.
   and the throne of England; and with Mary as sovereign head of England
   and Scotland, the triumph of Rome was again secure over all the West.
   Mary's position, then, was in reality the key to the whole
   movement,--the full combination, treachery, and strength of which Knox
   saw and Calvin saw, as but few men of their time did. [229] It is no
   great wonder, then, that the reformer was suspicious from the first,
   and that he tried to animate the milder Murray with a persuasion of the
   danger which he himself understood and felt. He knew that the only
   security of Scotland was in its complete exemption from papal
   influence, and that the mass, once re-established by the Court, would
   certainly prove an opening for the reascendancy of this influence. This
   was the secret of his strong protestations to Murray, and of his
   saying, in the clear knowledge of all that it meant, and towards which
   it pointed, that "one mass was more fearful to him than ten thousand
   armed enemies."

   It must be observed that it is not here a question of toleration
   between man and man, or party and party, but a question of urgent
   national expediency. Scotland could then be only peaceably governed. as
   a Protestant country, and Mary of Guise had virtually admitted this as
   with her last breath. She deplored the fatal advice of her brothers
   which she had followed, and counselled the removal of the French troops
   from the kingdom. A free and lawful Parliament had since then
   established the new religion, and interdicted the old; and whatever may
   be the intolerance of this interdiction in our modern point of
   view--and neither this nor any intolerance is to be defended, however
   it may be explained--yet practically, so far as the head of the
   Government was concerned, it was impossible to set it aside, or even
   infringe or show disrespect to it, without utter confusion and
   disorder, as the events proved, and everything showed at the time to
   those who had any eyes to see. Apart from all ideas of modern
   constitutionalism, it was yet only possible to be a sovereign even in
   Mary's time, at the expense of some personal liberty, and as
   representing a predominant national feeling. War was the only
   alternative of the disturbance of the practical representative
   relations of sovereign and people. But Mary had no perception of this,
   and notwithstanding her pretences, showed no honest desire to govern
   the country in the spirit of its own will declared through Parliament,
   and set before her in the counsels of her brother. How could she, when
   her movements were secretly dictated from Paris, and her whole aim was
   to advance Catholicism through the subversion of the existing
   ecclesiastical order of the country? Had she been less crafty and more
   wise--had she recognised her position and accepted it with its
   restraints, and sought to rule according to them--Knox's interferences
   might have continued to annoy, but could not have imperilled her. No
   Stewart, however, was capable of this; and that Mary acted as she did,
   and embroiled the country in worse confusion than before her mother's
   death, simply proved that there was no possible, not to say no
   rightful, place for her at that time in Scotland. A "divine power to
   govern ill" had become even then intolerable to the Scottish people;
   and surely we are not to blame but to commend Knox and others, that
   they saw thus early through so false and miserable a fiction as the
   divine right of kings. In Mary's question and Knox's reply as to the
   mutual relations of power between subjects and princes, we see the
   essential contrast presented by the two, and the principles which they
   professed. "Power is mine," Mary meant: "God has given it to me, and I
   can use it as I will. It is divine simply according to my best judgment
   and opinion of its mode of exercise." "Not in the least," urged Knox;
   "first right and then might, national interest and then royal pleasure;
   and there is no other way of governing the world."

   In all we have six interviews recorded by Knox himself as occurring
   between the Queen and him. And in all his own accounts of these
   interviews, or of Randolph the English ambassador's allusions, there is
   no evidence of incivility or rudeness on the part of the reformer.
   There is harshness in his tone afterwards, and in the way in which he
   speaks of her "owling," but--in so far as his own speech and action in
   her presence are concerned--there appears a dignified courtesy in the
   manners of the reformer, and a sincere and respectful regard to her
   lawful authority. [230] The violence of debate and passion of speech
   are more on her side than on his, as she tried in vain to move his calm
   resoluteness. "But what have you to do with my marriage?" she angrily
   urged in their fifth interview, after he had preached a sermon
   reflecting on her proposed marriage, "or what are you in this
   commonwealth?" "A subject born within the same, madam," calmly replied
   the reformer; "and albeit I be neither, earl, lord, nor baron in it,
   yet has God made me (how abject that ever I be in your eyes) a
   profitable member within the same." If this be not courtesy combined
   with dignity under all the circumstances, we are at a loss to
   understand what the qualities mean.

   It is not to be denied that Knox was stern and uncomplying, and to some
   extent unfeeling, in his dealings with the Queen. There was much that
   was really beautiful and interesting in Mary and her position that the
   reformer did not and could not comprehend. The gay festivities of her
   life, the grace of her exquisite manners, the charms of her queenly
   womanhood, and the social elegancies of her Court, were unintelligible
   to him. He could see nothing in the gay gear, the garnishing,
   targetting, and pearls of the Court ladies, as he stood in Mary's
   ante-chamber, but the fleshly vanity destined to be consumed by "that
   knave death, that will come whether we will or not." It was the same
   narrow spirit that kept him from pitying her fallen beauty and forlorn
   helplessness when her day of adversity came--when her fair name lay
   sullied in the dust, and her beauty was no more a power to steal men's
   hearts away. Then, beyond doubt, his judgments were unpityingly severe.
   But to condemn him for this harsh sternness, and to forget all the
   genuine feeling and heartiness and patriotism of the man, is to be
   guilty at once of a crying injustice, and a weak, unhistorical
   judgment. Knox was not, indeed, a man in gay clothing, to be found in
   kings' palaces, nor fitted for them; but he was a true man,--he saw the
   reality of life, although not all that reality. Mary saw something in
   it that he did not see; but she missed the living fact, which was clear
   and open to his honest vision. With her higher tastes, she was
   false,--false to herself and her position; with his narrower
   sympathies, he was faithful to his country, to his God, to his own
   dignity and self-respect.

   So long as Mary committed herself to the advice of her brother, her
   affairs prospered upon the whole; and there is every reason to
   conjecture that if she had persevered in this course of conduct, she
   might have averted the disasters of her reign. But then such a course
   would have implied totally different views and intentions from those we
   have ascribed to her. It would have required her to break with her
   uncles and their schemes, and to lay aside, if not her religion, yet
   her blind devotion to its ascendancy. It would have required, in fact,
   a quite different spirit and character from what she really possessed.
   So long as it seemed to serve her purposes, she maintained her
   cordiality with her brother and the Protestant nobles; she could even
   condescend, as in her fourth interview with him at Kinross, to flatter
   Knox, and try to put to sleep his vigilance--an effort in which she was
   partially successful. To take the most favourable view of her motives
   and conduct during the first eighteen months of her reign, she may as
   yet have been somewhat unfixed as to her plans. Her claims to the crown
   of England, and the necessities of her position in Scotland, made it
   necessary for her to temporise; but there is no evidence that she had
   ever really made up her mind to accept her position in good faith--to
   sanction the establishment of the Protestant religion, and to govern in
   the spirit suggested by this legislation. On the contrary, the
   Parliament of 1563 conclusively showed that she desired to evade the
   ratification of all that had passed in 1560, and to leave things in the
   state of suspense that might ultimately form a pretext for the reversal
   of the whole religious policy of the country.

   What took place at this Parliament fully opened the eyes of Knox, if
   they had ever been shut, to the real meaning of the course of events.
   He saw at once "that nothing was meant but deceit"; and so strongly did
   he resent the temporising conduct of Murray and the Protestant nobles,
   that he had a hot altercation with him and "others of the Court," which
   estranged him from them for more than a year and a half. [231] Not only
   in private but in public he denounced what he considered their
   vacillation and weakness; and in the fervent excess of his mournful
   feeling, never was he more wildly eloquent than in the sermon which he
   preached before the dissolution of the Parliament, in presence of "the
   most part of the nobility." [232]

   A circumstance which occurred in the summer of the same year brought
   the Queen and the reformer into open collision. She had gone to
   Stirling, and in her absence the Popish service had been performed at
   the palace with more openness and extravagance than before. A riot had
   ensued; and the Queen, expressing great indignation when she. heard
   what had occurred, refused to return to Edinburgh unless the chief
   rioters were punished. Two burgesses of Edinburgh were accordingly
   summoned to take their trial for "felony, hamesucken, and violent
   invasion of the Queen's palace." The "Brethren" consulted with Knox on
   the subject, and at their advice he addressed a circular letter to the
   chief Protestant noblemen and gentlemen throughout the country, giving
   information how the matter stood, and requiring their assistance. This
   was, beyond doubt, a bold step on the part of the reformer. Mary
   resented it as a treasonable interference with her prerogative, and
   prepared to make the most of it to his prejudice. He was indicted for
   the offence, and a meeting of council convened in Edinburgh for his
   trial. Every formality was given to the meeting. The Queen took her
   seat at the head of the council-table with no "little worldly pomp";
   the reformer stood at the other end of the table, with his head
   uncovered; while Maitland conducted the prosecution. The Queen plainly
   thought that she had secured her tormentor, and could not conceal her
   satisfaction. [233] But whether it was that her undue eagerness to have
   him condemned excited the suspicions of the Lords; or that the
   distinctions urged by the reformer in his defence between "lawful" and
   "unlawful" convocations really impressed them; [234] or that the
   excitement of the "Brethren of the Kirk," who had followed Knox to the
   palace, and crowded the inner close and "all the stairs," was somewhat
   alarming; or probably all the three causes combined,--the council
   refused unanimously to condemn him. Lethington was enraged, and tried
   to overawe them by the presence of the Queen; but this only
   strengthened them in their resolution. "That night," concludes Knox,
   "was neither dancing nor fiddling in the Court; for Madam was
   disappointed of her purpose."

   Notwithstanding this deliverance, Knox's alienation from Murray and
   many of his old friends continued. He had taken up an attitude of
   unyielding opposition the Queen, and in his sermons and prayers
   indulged freely in the expression of his feelings. They could not
   approve his conduct, and he would not abandon the freedom of preaching
   as he considered it. The consequence was that, during the next few
   years, he retired comparatively from the scene of affairs. Maitland,
   along with others, evidently aimed for some time to construct a
   Protestant party in connection with the Court--a party opposed to the
   extreme views of the ministers; and in the Assembly of 1564 he
   attended, and vigorously and ingeniously defended his course of policy.
   If we look at the matter with a merely speculative eye, it was no doubt
   an instinct of larger freedom that animated Maitland than that which
   governed Knox and the ministers; but scarcely any doubt can exist that
   the latter far more clearly appreciated the character of Mary, and
   discerned the real necessities of the times.

   During the crowning series of events which followed Mary's marriage
   with Darnley (July 1565)--the revolt of the dissatisfied nobles, with
   Murray at their head--Mary's brief dream of happy wedlock; and then the
   rapid turns of the gloomy tragedy--the murder of Rizzio the murder of
   Darnley (Feb. 1567)--the marriage of the Queen with Bothwell--her
   defeat at Carberry Hill and imprisonment at Lochleven Castle--our
   reformer nowhere appeared prominent. He had become reconciled to Murray
   on the eve of his revolt, the necessity for which he would feel to be a
   vindication of his conduct during the preceding years. He was no doubt
   privy to the schemes of the revolted nobles, and their negotiations
   with the English Court. Suspicions even attach to his name and Craig's
   in regard to the murder of Rizzio, which, it must be confessed, are not
   without foundation, countenanced as they are by his subsequent' absence
   from Edinburgh. Throughout this dreadful period, however, he was by no
   means an active or notable figure. Characters far more fierce and
   turbulent than him occupy the scene, and bring to a close the dark
   procession of events which terminated in Mary's flight to England and
   the establishment of a regency under Murray.

   The two years that followed (Aug. 1567-Jan. 1570) were the happiest
   that the reformer knew in Scotland. Murray and he were perfectly
   reconciled, and their policy at one. The kingdom enjoyed comparative
   quietness, and the work of reform proceeded with regularity. At a
   Parliament held on the 18th of December 1567, the power and
   jurisdiction of the Pope were finally abolished; all the enactments of
   the reformed Parliament of 1560 were for the first time ratified, and
   an important Act added, to the effect that every future sovereign of
   the realm should swear to maintain the Protestant religion in its
   purity. Favourable, although still imperfect, arrangements were made as
   to the endowment of the clergy, and regulations passed as to their
   induction. The General Assembly followed up the work of the Parliament,
   and rectified divers social and ecclesiastical abuses which had been
   long subjects of complaint with the reformers. Knox felt for a time as
   if his work was accomplished, and the idea crossed him of returning to
   Geneva and ending his days in peace.

   But dark and stormy days yet awaited the reformer. After somewhat more
   than two years' firm and peaceable possession of the government, Murray
   was assassinated. No event perhaps in all the reformer's life filled
   him with deeper and more painful sorrow. His heart was crushed by the
   suddenness of the blow, and he poured forth the anguish that he felt in
   a wild and pathetic prayer that has been preserved. [235]

   Things returned to their old confusion under the regency of Lennox
   (who, too, was soon murdered), and then of Mar. Friends who had been
   dear to him--Kirkcaldy of Grange, and others--forsook the cause of the
   Reformation altogether, and sought to re-establish a Marian party in
   Edinburgh. He had the misfortune, also, to differ from his brethren in
   the Assembly about praying for the Queen. Maitland tried to improve
   this difference to his own advantage: dark charges were uttered against
   the reformer, as to his having wished to betray his country to the
   English; an attempt was even made to assassinate him, by firing a ball
   in at the window of the room where he usually sat. The heart of the old
   man, weakened as he was by paralysis, was deeply wounded. He felt
   bitterly the cowardice of the accusations made against him, and
   answered in the proud and noble words"--What I have been to my country
   albeit this unthankful age will not know, yet the age to come will be
   compelled to bear witness to the truth; and thus I cease, requiring all
   men that have anything to oppose against me, that they will do it so
   plainly as I make myself and all my doings so manifest to the world;
   for to me it seems a thing most unreasonable that in this, my decrepid
   age, I shall be compelled to fight against shadows and howlettes that
   dare not abide the light."

   In May (5th) 1571 he left Edinburgh for St Andrews reluctantly, urged
   by his-friends to take some-means for his safety. James Melville was
   then a student in. St Leonard's College, and we are indebted to his
   gossipy pen for a very graphic and interesting account of Knox's
   appearance and preaching. The picture--of the old man in the College
   Yards of St Leonard's calling the students about him, and blessing
   them; his weakness, needing the support of his servant on his way to
   preach; his vigour and warmth when once in the pulpit and kindled with
   his theme--is very striking and memorable. "He lodged down in the Abbey
   beside our college," says Melville, "and would some time come in and
   repose him in our college yard, and call us scholars unto him, and
   bless us, and exhort us to know God and His work in our country, and
   stand by the good cause. Our whole college was sound and zealous for
   the good cause; the other two colleges not so. . . . I heard him preach
   the prophecies of Daniel that summer and the winter following. I had my
   pen and my little book, and took away such things as I could
   comprehend. In the opening of the text he was moderate the space of
   half-an-hour; but when he entered to application, he made me so to grew
   and tremble that I could not hold a pen to write. . . . He was very
   weak. I saw him every day of his doctrine go hulie and fear [slowly and
   warily], with a furring of martriks about his neck, a staff in the one
   hand, and good godly Richard Ballanden, his servant, holding up the
   other oxter, from the Abbey to the parish kirk, and by the said Richard
   and another servant lifted up to the pulpit, where he behoved to lean
   at his first entry; but ere he has done with his sermon he was so
   active and vigorous that he was lyke to ding the pulpit in blads
   and.flie out of it."

   Such is the living glimpse we get of the reformer in these last days.
   Weak and ill, his last energies were expended in the cause so dear to
   him. He flinched not then from the battle that he had waged so long;
   and yet at heart he was sick, and "wearie of the world." He subscribed
   himself to a book which he now published against a Scottish Jesuit of
   the name of Tyrie, "John Knox, the servant of Jesus Christ, now wearie
   of the world, and daily looking for the resolution of this my earthly
   tabernacle," and asked his brethren to pray for him, "that God would
   put an end to his long and painful battle; for now being unable to
   fight as God some time gave strength, I thirst an end."

   In August 1572, he was enabled, by a truce between the contending
   parties, to return to Edinburgh. He was no longer able to preach in his
   old church, and the Tolbooth was fitted up for him. Here, in the course
   of September, he thundered his dying denunciations against the
   perpetrators of the massacre of St Bartholomew. This crowning stroke of
   the great reactionary party in France touched him to the quick,
   verifying all his predictions, and plunging him in the deepest sadness
   for his many martyred friends. He imprecated, with his last breath, the
   vengeance of Heaven upon the accursed murderers; and his cry, with that
   of others, went up before the throne with an "Avenge, O Lord, Thy
   slaughtered saints."

   In the second week of November he was seized with a severe cough, and
   his end visibly drew near. He arranged his affairs, paid his servants'
   wages, with twenty shillings over, as the last they would ever receive
   from him; and so set his house in order. There was no darkness in these
   last moments: although the sadness of the time touched him, his own
   spirit was cheerful, as the eternal day began to break, and the shadows
   to flee away. Two friends, not knowing of his illness, came to dine
   with him, and he insisted upon being present at table, and piercing for
   them a hogshead of wine which was in the cellar, and which might as
   well be drunk by his friends, now that he was going the way when he
   would no more need it. "He willed them to send for the same so long as
   it lasted, for that he would not tarry till it was drunken";--as
   beautiful a picture of generous friendliness and "cheery social"
   disposition, as one can anywhere contemplate. On the 17th, and some of
   the following days, he received his friends, his colleague, his
   brethren in the ministry, and among others the Earl of Morton, whom he
   charged to be faithful to God and the Evangel in the elevation to the
   regency which he saw was awaiting him. On the evening before his death
   he was tempted to think of himself and of what he had done. But he
   repelled the temptation with the sentence, Quid habes, quod non
   accepisti? The next day, the 24th, he got up and partially dressed
   himself--put on his hose and doublet: but the effort was too much;
   weakness overcame him, and he was forced to lie down again. His wife
   and faithful servant sat beside him reading the Bible. He asked his
   wife to read the 15th chapter of 1st Corinthians, and said when it was
   finished, "Is not that a beautiful chapter? What sweet consolation the
   Lord hath given me!" Later he said, "Go, read where I first cast
   anchor"; and she read the 17th chapter of St John's Gospel. He fell
   into a trance at the time of evening prayer, and when the physician
   inquired if he had heard their prayers, he replied, "Would God that you
   and all men had heard them as I have heard them. I praise God for that
   heavenly sound." About eleven o'clock he gave a deep sigh, and said,
   "Now it is come." Then Richard Bannatyne, sitting down before him,
   said, "Now, sir, the time that you have long called for--to wit, an end
   of your battle--is come; and seeing all natural power now fails,
   remember the comfortable promise which ofttime ye have shown to us of
   our Saviour Christ: and that we may understand and know that ye hear
   us, make us some sign;" and so he lifted up his hand, and incontinent
   thereafter rendered up the spirit, and slept away without any pain.

   A stern reality, a vivid and strong and somewhat harsh sense, lies at
   the basis of Knox's character. He saw life equally in its individual
   and national aspects as a great fact before God--a fact which could
   only be falsified or trifled away and abused in blasphemy of Him who
   gave it, and who would require an account of it. It was this feeling of
   the awful reality and responsibility of life as a divine trust and
   discipline which, growing up in that long time of quietness and
   obscurity from about his twentieth to his fortieth year, served more
   than anything else to kindle his undying zeal against the. Papacy of
   his country. Strong religious convictions no doubt animated him in his
   reforming career. It is impossible. to read the ac- count he himself
   has given of his early sermons in St Andrews, as well as his subsequent
   letters to his mother-in-law, and not see that the fresh and living
   study of Scripture had led him to very definite conclusions as to the
   unchristian character of Romanism, and the perversion of doctrinal
   truth that its teaching and practices presented. Still he did not, like
   Luther, primarily attack Romanism from a dogmatic point of view, nor
   perhaps were its doctrinal perversions ever the main' cause of his
   intense and growing hatred of it. It was rather its utter immorality
   and godlessness as a practical governing institution--its
   contradictions to the truth of life and the plainest instincts of duty
   at every point--that provoked his indignation and nerved his
   destructive energy. He felt that in his own time and country it had
   become a great embodied lie, dead in trespasses and sins, out of which
   no good could come, and that therefore it could only be trodden down
   and buried out of sight.

   This was no doubt a stern view of life and of the world around him. It
   is a view with which we may have some difficulty in sympathising, as we
   look back upon it from the free and tolerant atmosphere of this
   nineteenth century. It covers an element of iconoclasm which could only
   justify itself in the face of the most obvious and unquestionable
   facts. But the facts are beyond question. The view was one sternly
   demanded by the necessities of Scotland in the sixteenth century.
   Nothing but its absolute truthfulness forced it upon Knox. Other men,
   of less power and penetration than he was--of a less open and piercing
   glance, searching not only the manifest but the hidden things of
   dishonesty amidst which he stood--might have been deceived by certain
   fair appearances in the aspects of Scottish Romanism; but no
   varnishings and no artifices could beguile him. No social pretensions,
   no conventional dignities, could impose upon him, or blind his strong,
   clear vision. He had learned plainly and boldly, as he himself says, to
   "call wickedness by its own terms, a fig a fig, and a spade a spade."
   The Roman hierarchy, therefore, was Antichrist, and the mass idolatry,
   simply because, in Scotland et least, they had in his time become
   absolutely unmoral. All divine good they had ever possessed had gone
   out of them, and left only a noxious carcass--a mere tyranny in the one
   case, a mere falsehood in the other.

   This spirit of severe reality animated him alike in his political as in
   his religious views. It gave a hardness, some will say a harshness, to
   his personal demeanour. No form of civil polity was anything to him,
   save in so far as it conserved the true dignity and earnest and pious
   uses of life. Mary was only Queen in so far as her government was good
   for the country. He recognised no divine right in her or any one to
   govern, save in so far as they were fit for it. The mere trappings of
   rule, its artificial splendours, its proud adornments, had no interest,
   and certainly no awe for him. He stood unmoved before them, and his
   stern simplicity remained imperturbable alike under the blandishments
   and the tears of royalty. As on one occasion he left the room where he
   had been holding interview with the Queen, and passed out with a
   "reasonable merry countenance," some of them whispered, "He is not
   afraid." "What! should the pleasing face of a gentlewoman affray me?"
   was his reply. "I have looked in the face of many angry men, and yet
   have not been afraid above measure." He did not know, indeed, what fear
   meant, and his heart leapt up at the sound of danger. Never were truer
   words than those of the Earl of Morton, as they laid him in the old
   churchyard of St Giles, "He never feared the face of man." Even Luther
   was not more courageous in the midst of actual conflict and in the
   boldness of consistent self-respect, and of undeviating adhesion to
   what he considered principle, Knox was the superior of Luther. Knox
   would never have written such letters as Luther did, both to the Pope
   and Henry VIII. and he never would have acted as the German reformer
   did in the affair of the Landgrave of Hesse. No consideration ever
   moved him to servility, and no power on earth would have extorted from
   him unchristian submission.

   Out of this fundamental feature of strong truthfulness sprang alike his
   humour and his bitterness--different manifestations of the same spirit.
   That Knox possessed a thoroughly hearty humour, it is impossible for
   any one to doubt who has ever read his History. Its narrative is
   touched everywhere by a humorous presence, giving life and colour and
   movement to it--lighting up, in picturesque and vivid gleams, the very
   image of the times. It is not indeed a simple humour, whose expressions
   you can detach, and look at, and feel their laughing charm by
   themselves, as are the manifold utterances of Luther's rare and fertile
   power, or of Latimer's narrower sympathy. It is rather, as we have
   said, a presence--a way in general of looking at things and telling
   about them, which shows you the deep nature of the man, and how keenly
   all the real aspects of life, its comedy as well as its tragedy, its
   familiarities as well as its grandeurs, touched him. There is but
   little geniality, and scarcely any tenderness in it. It is grotesque
   and scornful rather than smiling and kindly--passing, by an easy
   transition, into frequent bursts of bitter, and what we would now call
   violent and abusive invective. Still, even the bitterness is hearty,
   and not cold and merely mocking. It springs from the same full fountain
   of sympathy with all that is real in life; and where he scorns, and is
   wild with a kind of savage glee, it is in the main only against things
   that really deserved scorn, and were dead to all milder or more
   tolerant treatment. His soul was wearied with falsehoods; and if the
   sacred association was not spared in the fierce denunciation, it was
   simply because it had lost utterly for him all truth or beauty of
   holiness. Mr Carlyle's version of his throwing an image of the Virgin
   into the Loire exactly illustrates this. "Mother! Mother of God, did
   you say? This is no mother of God, but a painted bredd--a piece of
   wood, I tell you, with paint on it;" and suiting the action to the
   language, he dashed the consecrated symbol into the water.

   It must at once be admitted that there are aspects of life beautiful
   and really good that had little or no interest for Knox. The sweetness
   and grace and cultured refinement and charm of social politeness, that
   so mingle in our modern existence, and. which, from the polished
   capital where she had spent her youth, Mary sought to transplant into
   the harsher clime of her native land--those festive exuberances and
   "unconfined joys" and decorated gaieties, that, amid all their
   frivolity, speak of a right-hearted human gladness--and of which Mary,
   in her mere womanly perfections, may be said to remain the ideal and
   type--were unfelt and unacknowledged by him. Mere beauty in nature or
   in life had few attractions for him. Calvin is scarcely more insensible
   to such attractions, although Knox has a wider sympathy with the varied
   interests of humanity, and a far deeper and more appreciative feeling.
   There is a comparatively keen though rugged sensibility in the heart of
   the Scottish reformer, as passages in his sermons, and many facts of
   his life, show; and if he could be stern and even cruel as Calvin, he
   is yet never so cold and self-sustained in his polemical rigour. His
   harshness and narrowness were as much the misfortune of his time as his
   fault as a man; and while they cast a shade into his portrait, they yet
   ought not to destroy the noble and impressive lines that mark it.

   His eloquence partook of the same stern, powerful, and scornful
   character: it must have been a grand thing to hear in those days, when
   great national interests hung upon his single utterances. His
   preaching, the English ambassador said, "put more life into him than
   six hundred trumpets,"--a headlong, vehement, swelling energy, ringing
   like a slogan cry, bursting in explosive shouts, and moving with
   passionate convictions thousands of hearts. A single brief passage from
   his famous sermon before the dissolution of the Parliament of 1563,
   when the arts of Mary were so successful in deluding the Protestant
   nobles, may give some idea of it. He is appealing to old associations,
   and his close union with the nobles in past times when he had shared
   their risks and dangers; and his wounded feelings swell into an
   impassioned sublimity, in which there mingles a wild yet softening
   touch of pathos. "I have been with you," he says, "in your most
   desperate temptations in your most extreme dangers I have been with
   you. St Johnstone, Cupar Moor, and the Crags of Edinburgh are yet
   recent in my heart--yea, and that dark and dolorous night, wherein all
   ye, my lords, with shame and fear, left this town, is yet in my mind,
   and God forbid that I ever forget it. What was, I say, my exhortation
   to you, and what has fallen in vain of all that ever God promised unto
   you by my mouth, ye yourselves live to testify. . . . Shall this be the
   thankfulness that ye shall render unto God, to betray His cause, when
   ye have it in your hands to establish it?" There is something of the
   same pathetic sublimity in his prayer after the assassination of the
   Regent Murray.

   Altogether, if we estimate him, as we are bound to do, in his
   historical position and circumstances, Knox appears a very great and
   heroic man--no violent demagogue, or mere stern dogmatist--although
   violence and sternness and dogmatism were all parts of his character.
   These coarser elements mingled with but did not obscure the fresh,
   living, and keenly sympathetic humanity beneath. Inferior to Luther in
   tenderness and breadth and lovableness, he is greatly superior to
   Calvin in the same qualities. You feel that he had a strong and loving
   heart under all his harshness, and that you can get near to it, and
   could have spent a cheery social evening with him in his house at the
   head of the Canongate, over. that good old wine that he had stored in
   his cellar, and which he was glad and proud to dispense to his friends.
   It might not have been a very pleasant thing to differ with him eyen in
   such circumstances; but, upon the whole, it would have been a
   pleasanter and safer audacity than to have disputed some favourite
   tenet with Calvin. There was in Knox far more of human feeling and of
   shrewd worldly sense, always tolerant of differences; and you could
   have fallen back upon these, and felt yourself comparatively safe in
   the utterance of some daring sentiment. And in this point of view it
   deserves to be noticed that Knox alone of the reformers, along with
   Luther, is free from all stain of violent persecution. Intolerant he
   was towards the mass, towards Mary, and towards the old Catholic
   clergy; yet he was no persecutor. He was never cruel in act, cruel as
   his language sometimes is, and severe as were some of his judgments.
   Modern enlightenment and scientific indifference we have no right to
   look for in him. His superstitions about the weather and witches were
   common to him with all men of his time. Nature was not to these men an
   elevated and beneficent idea, but a capricious manifestation of
   arbitrary supernatural forces. This was part of the intellectual
   furniture of the time, of which they could no more get rid than they
   could get rid of their social dress or usages. And Knox was here, as in
   other things, only a man of his time.

   As a thinker, save, perhaps, on political subjects, he takes no rank;
   and his political views, wise and enlightened as they were, seem rather
   the growth of his manly instinctive sense than reasoned from any
   fundamental principles. Earnest, intense, and powerful in every
   practical direction, he was not in the least characteristically
   reflective or speculative. Everywhere the hero, he is nowhere the
   philosopher or sage. He was, in short, a man for his work and
   time--knowing what was good for his country there and then, when the
   old Catholic bonds had rotted to the very core. A man of God, yet with
   sinful weaknesses like us all. There is something in him we can no
   longer love,--a harshness and severity by no means beautiful or
   attractive; but there is little in him that we cannot in the retrospect
   heartily respect, and even admiringly cherish.

   Of his special work we have already so far spoken. It was truly a great
   and noble work, though with harsh features in it, like the man himself.
   It was the result of no mere party motives, but the expression of a
   revived Christian interest, and of a new and healthy national feeling.
   Nowhere does the spiritual principle appear more prominently as the
   spring of the Reformation than in Scotland. The reawakened idea of
   individual relation and responsibility to God, and of the only possible
   realisation of both in Christ, is everywhere the living impulse,
   originating and carrying forward the movement. But there is also more
   than this. Alongside of the spiritual influence, and bound up with it
   in a very notable, expressive, and more complete form than elsewhere,
   is the principle of Nationalism. The Scottish Reformation was not
   merely a spiritual insurrection; it was a national revolution--the
   expression of a new social life, which now in the sixteenth century had
   become the most educated and intelligent in the country. The two
   influences, civil and religious, intersected and moulded one another in
   a marked degree, though in what degree exactly it is difficult to say.
   In no other way can we explain the radical change that then passed upon
   the face of Scotland, than by the fact that new social forces, which
   had been for some time working in the country, came now to the surface,
   and stamped themselves definitely upon its expanding civilisation. Knox
   was at once the preacher of a free Gospel, and the representative of
   this broader and freer nationality. And correspondently with this
   character, the movement which he headed, and which practically he
   carried forward to triumph, assumed from the beginning a marked
   political aspect, and sought to guarantee itself in new modes of
   political as well as spiritual action. The General Assembly of the
   Church was in reality a Commons' House of Parliament, discussing the
   most varied interests of the country, and giving effect to the popular,
   or at least the middle-class feeling, on all the urgent questions of
   the day. It was the substantial national power which the Assemblies
   thus enjoyed which made them so prized on the one hand, and so feared
   and hated on the other. The clergy, and barons united with them, felt
   that with the right of free assembly they were powerful against any
   combination of their enemies. The sovereign and great nobles knew that
   in the face of these Assemblies they could never hold the country by
   the old feudal bonds of government. It was a life-and-death contention
   on either side; and Scottish Presbytery became thus, in the very
   circumstances of its origin, and still more in the progress of its
   history, intensely political, and could not help becoming so.

   A Calvinistic creed and a Presbyterian ritual were the shapes into
   which the Scottish Reformation, not at once, but very soon, and from
   the growing necessities of its position, hardened itself. At first, we
   have seen, it did not bear any strong impress of Calvinism; the
   affinity was apparent, but the likeness was far from rigorous; and had
   it been left to its own free national development, undisturbed by royal
   despotism and ecclesiastical arbitrariness, it might have matured, both
   doctrinally and ritually, into a form comparatively expansive and
   catholic. It might have gradually penetrated the old historical
   families of the kingdom which had hitherto stood aloof from it, and
   moulded the nation,--people, barons, and nobles,--into religious unity.
   This, however, was not to be its fate. It was not destined to a quiet
   career of diffusion and growth, but to a career of tragic storm and
   struggle, in the course of which, while it kept its own with a brave
   tenacity and a grand heroism, which shed an undying glory amid the
   stormy gloom of its eventful history, it yet never fused itself more
   deeply than at first into the outlying sections of the national life.
   The original oppositions, after the lapse of a hundred and twenty
   years, reappear at the Revolution only more intensified and defined
   than ever; and to this day they remain uneffaced, and probably
   uneffaceable. Scotland presents, in this respect, a singular and
   original spectacle. While Presbyterianism, in its scarcely differing
   shades, keeps a vigorous and immovable hold of the heart of the nation,
   there are yet traces of genuine sentiment in the country transmitted by
   clear lines of descent from the sixteenth century, that not merely lie
   outside of it, but show no inclination to mingle with the main current
   of the national religious feeling.

   In the course of the opposition which it encountered, Calvinism, in its
   most rigorous form, naturally became the dogmatic stronghold of the
   Scottish Reformation. Clearness, definiteness, and a bold and ready
   audacity of doctrinal opinion, became necessary elements of strength as
   the struggle went on; and when the Protestant influence in Scotland
   allied itself with English Puritanism, and, in fact, became one of the
   most prominent phases of the great Puritanic movement, it took up, of
   course, the doctrinal as well as the anti-ritual peculiarities of this
   movement, and the "Confession of Faith" and "Directory of Public
   Worship" are the remarkable monuments of this second stage of its
   history. Beyond doubt, also, the more rigorous Calvinism of the
   Confession was a natural expression of the Scottish mind applied to
   religious subjects, sharing, as this mind strongly does, with the
   French, in that "logical directness" which delights in constructive
   systems, and in the exhibition of coherency and theoretical order,
   rising from some single principle, rather than in an adaptive
   earnestness and manifoldness of opinion. It is nevertheless strange,
   considering the marked nationality of the religion of Scotland, that it
   is an English and not a Scottish document that remains the historical
   expression of the National Faith.

   The Calvinism of Scotland seems at first sight to have enjoyed a more
   consistent and vigorous life than that either of Geneva or of Holland;
   but a nearer inspection proves that the difference is more apparent
   than real. Scottish Theology has, in truth, undergone a series of
   singular modifications during the last two hundred years, from the
   polemical hardness and spiritual sentimentalisms of Rutherfurd--the
   devotional and apologetic mildness of Halyburton--the fervid but
   untempered earnestness of Boston--the polite moralisms of Blair--and
   the conciliatory doctrinism of Hill and Campbell--to the genial but
   inconsistent theories of Chalmers. And of all these modifications none
   is more singular, and certainly none less understood, than that which
   sprang from the admission of Jonathan Edwards's doctrine of
   philosophical necessity as constituting a renewed basis and point of
   defence for Calvinism. A meagre rationalism, under the name of
   moderatism, had in the last century eaten away the heart of the old
   Calvinistic religious when the cold breath of this new doctrine came as
   a bracing restorative to the logical mind of Scotland, and it was
   eagerly seized upon and embraced as a supposed mediatrix between
   philosophy and faith. It had an intrinsic charm to such a mind as
   Chalmers's, and more than anything seemed to strengthen him in the old
   dogmatic pathways; but a union so unnatural could not even be blessed
   by his strong genius, and this theological necessitarianism is already
   giving place before the progress of a more spiritual philosophy.

   Whether the Scottish mind is likely at length to free itself from its
   intense logical tendencies, and to expand into a broader, more learned,
   and more genial and comprehensive theological literature, it is
   somewhat difficult to say. Undoubtedly the higher intelligence of the
   country has shaken itself largely free from the old dogmatic bonds. A
   disintegrating process is at work in the forms of both its religious
   thought and life; and many, where their fathers found living wells,
   find only empty cisterns. The danger of this temper is, that it may
   become impatient and destructive, rather than inquiring and freely
   conservative, and thus, as in last century, that dogmatism may pass
   into rationalism, and spiritual earnestness into indifference. The
   best, indeed the only, safeguard against this is the growth of a
   critical and historical spirit, which, while looking back with
   reverence to the past, and appreciating all that is good and holy and
   great in it, is not yet absolutely wedded to it as a formula beyond
   which, or apart from which, there can be no life. There is some hopeful
   evidence of the rise of such a spirit spreading from the richer soil of
   the English theological mind, and quickened by the fertile seeds from
   Continental scholarship and thought. It were well that this spirit
   should ripen free from German arbitrariness or audacious
   self-confidence of any kind.

   Perhaps the living study of such men as these pages have feebly
   endeavoured to sketch may be helpful in this direction--men whose
   example of Christian energy, and patriotism, and piety, is so much
   greater than their mere dogmatisms. The world may outlive the
   latter--nay, in so far as they were merely personal or intellectual, it
   has already outlived them; but the former are. the needful salt of its
   ever-freshening life. We have entered into the labours of these men,
   and fruits have sprung from them. in some respects of a richer and more
   enduring strength than they themselves dreamed of. Ours is the
   inheritance; theirs was the labour. While we rejoice in our higher
   heritage, let us not forget those who first broke the bonds of
   spiritual tyranny. Thought must advance, and none need try to check it.
   But while we move forward, let us revere the Past; and as we enter
   within the gates of a New era, let us look back with admiration, and,
   so far as we can, with love, if not with regret, to the great figures
   that stand at the illuminated portals of the Old.

   [208] There is no doubt that the Duke of Northumberland urged his
   appointment to the bishopric of Rochester. In a letter of his to
   Secretary Cecil, preserved in the Records, he says, "I would to God it
   might please the King's Majesty to appoint Mr Knox to the office of
   Rochester bishopric, which for three purposes would be very well." The
   "purposes" are remarkable, and well deserve to be quoted as
   illustrative of the reformer's character and position: "First, He would
   not only be a whetstone to quicken and sharp the Bishop of Canterbury,
   whereof he hath need, but also he would be a great confounder of the
   Anabaptists lately sprung up in Kent. Secondly, He should not continue
   his ministrations contrary to those set forth here. Thirdly, The family
   of the Scots now in Berwick and in Newcastle, chiefly for his
   fellowship, would not continue there."

   [211] Works, vol. iii. p. 378, Laing's Edition.

   [212] Dr Laing seems to think (Knox's Works, vol. p. 334) that the
   marriage did not take place till the summer of 1555, when Knox visited
   Scotland. The point must remain doubtful. It is a singular enough fact
   that both Knox's sons by this his first marriage went to England, were
   educated at Cambridge, and entered the English Church. They both died
   comparatively young, without issue. Knox married as his second wife
   Margaret Stewart, daughter of Lord Ochiltree, so that both his wives
   were of superior rank; and indeed the superiority of rank in the latter
   case gave rise to the most ridiculous rumours (see Nicol Burne's
   "Disputation," quoted by MCrie in his Appendix, and Chambers in his
   Domestic Annals of Scotland). This second marriage took place in 1564,
   when the reformer was in his fifty-eighth year; and Mrs Welch (whose
   heroic answer to King James is well known) and two other daughters were
   the fruit of this marriage.

   [213] Dr MCrie considers him to have made an additional journey to
   Switzerland, and to have returned to Dieppe, for the second time, in
   July (1554); but Dr Laing has shown (Works of Knox, vol. iii. p. 253)
   that there is no adequate ground for this second journey during the
   same summer to Switzerland.

   January 1555.

   [215] Jewel was also of the party, and Lever, Bale, and Turner.

   [216] See the evidence of this in Original Letters relative to the
   English Reformation, vol. p. 672, quoted by Dr Laing, Knox's Works,
   vol. iii.

   [217] History, Book I.

   [218] Knox's famous First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous
   Regiment of Women' serves clearly to prove the intellectual
   independence of the Scottish reformer--under the very shadow of Calvin.
   It was published anonymously at Geneva, in the beginning of the year
   1558; and, according to Calvin's own statement (Zurich Letters, second
   series, p. 35), he knew nothing of it at the time, nor "for a whole
   year afterwards." He adds, "When I was informed by certain parties, I
   sufficiently showed my displeasure that such paradoxes should be
   published." The whole tone as well as argument of this remarkable book
   was evidently displeasing to Calvin; and when he found that its
   publication at Geneva interfered with the reception of his own works by
   the Queen of England, he did not hesitate, in allusion to it, to speak
   of the "thoughtless arrogance of one individual." Calvin himself could
   be sufficiently vehement in argument, but he had no toleration for such
   unreasoning and impolitic vehemence as that of Knox. The First Blast,'
   &c., is often a mere passionate tirade, obscuring all sense and reason.
   Its publication was beyond doubt a blunder, the inconvenience of which
   Knox felt repeatedly in the course of his after career. "My first
   blast," he himself said, "has blown all my friends in England from me."

   [219] The beginning of those covenants which make, for more than a
   century, such a marked feature in the history of Scottish
   Protestantism.

   [220] History, Book III. Knox's statement is, "Of the temporal estate,
   only voted in the contrary the Earl of Atholl, the Lords Somerville and
   Borthwick; and yet for their dissenting they produced no better reason
   but we will beleve as our fathers beleved. The bishops (papistical we
   mean) spake nothing."

   [221] "Some were licentious," says Knox, "some had greedily gripped to
   the possessions of the Kirk, and others thought they would not lack
   their part of Christ's coat."

   [222] When Knox first proposed his schemes of Church reform, Maitland
   is reported to have said, "Heh, then, we must forget ourselves now; we
   mun a' bear the barrow, and build the house of God."

   [223] The five ministers besides himself engaged in the composition of
   the Book of Discipline are said by Knox to have been John Winram, John
   Spottiswoode, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row. It is supposed
   to have been first approved by the General Assembly which met 5th
   January 1561.

   [224] First Book of Discipline, chap. vi. I.

   [225] First Book of Discipline, chap. xi.

   [226] It seems beyond question that the Book of Common Prayer' referred
   to by the heads of the Congregation was the Service of the Church of
   England according to King Edward's book.' A letter from Cecil to
   Throgmorton (July 1559) plainly states this.--(Forbes's State Papers,
   i. 155, quoted by Dr M'Crie in the notes to his Life of Knox, p. 425.)
   This does not, however, settle the question whether the Common Prayers'
   of the Book of Discipline referred to the same Service.' It is certain
   that the Book of Common Order' is called the Order of Geneva' and the
   Book of our Common Order' by the compilers of the Book of Discipline
   (chaps. vii. and xi.); and that the Order of Geneva' is expressly
   stated to be "used in some of our churches" (chap. ii.) This strongly
   suggests the identity of the Common Prayers' with the Genevan Order';
   and the evidence appears to me clearly to incline to this conclusion.

   [227] Knox, History, Book IV.

   [228] Mary's letters leave no doubt of this.--Labanoff, vol. i. pp.
   200, 282. Her signature of the treaty of Bayonne (1566), for the
   extirpation of the Protestant religion, was merely a formal step in a
   course in which she had been long engaged.

   [229] Knox "had then great intelligence both with the Kirk and some of
   the court of France."--History, Book IV.

   [230] It is clear, however, that Randolph interpreted her weeping in
   the same way as Knox: "Knox hath spoken to the Queen, and he made her
   weep, as well you know there be of that sex that will do that for anger
   or for grief."

   [231] "In all that time, the Earl of Murray was so formed to John Knox
   that neither by word nor writing was there any communication between
   them."--Knox's History, Book IV.

   [232] This Parliament of 1563 was evidently a sore subject with Knox at
   the time and afterwards. It opened his eyes completely, not only to the
   real designs of the Queen, but also to the very selfish aims of many of
   the nobles and professed friends of the Reformation. He speaks very
   bitterly of what he considered their weak enthusiasm, and devotion to
   Mary. "There might have been heard vox Diana, the voice of a goddess,
   and not of a woman: God save that sweet face!" "Such stinking pride of
   women as was teen at that Parliament, was never seen before in
   Scotland."--History, Book IV.

   [233] "Her pomp," says Knox himself, "lacked one principal point, to
   wit, womanlie gravity for when she saw John Knox at the other end of
   the table, she first smiled, and after gave ane gawf lauchter. Yon man
   gart me greit,' she said, and grat never teir himself: I will see gif I
   can gar him greit.'"--History, Book IV.

   [234] Knox implies that they were all influenced by his "plain and
   sensible answers."

   [235] "O Lord, in what misery and confusion found he this realm! To
   what rest and quietness now by his labours suddenly he brought the
   same, all the estates, but especially the poor commons, can witness.
   Thy image, O Lord, did so clearly shine in that personage, that the
   devil and the people to whom he is prince could not abide it; and so to
   punish our sins and our ingratitude (who did not so rightly esteem so
   precious a gift), Thou hast permitted him to fall, to our great grief,
   in the hands of cruel and traitorous murderers. He is at rest, O Lord;
   we are left in extreme misery!"
