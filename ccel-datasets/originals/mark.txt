                             THE LAST TWELVE VERSES

  OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO

S. MARK

   ON the next page is exhibited an exact Fac-simile, obtained by
   Photography, of fol. 28 b of the Codex Sinaiticus at S. Petersburg,
   (Tischendorf's '): shewing the abrupt termination of S. Mark's Gospel
   at the words EPhOBOUNTO GAR (chap. xvi. 8), as explained at p. 70, and
   pp. 86-8. The original Photograph, which is here reproduced on a
   diminished scale, measures in height full fourteen inches and
   one-eighth; in breadth, full thirteen inches. It was procured for me
   through the friendly and zealous offices of the English Chaplain at S.
   Petersburg, the Rev. A. S. Thompson, B.D.; by favour of the Keeper of
   the Imperial Library, who has my hearty thanks for his liberality and
   consideration.

   It will be perceived that the text begins at S. Mark xvi. 2, and ends
   with the first words of S. Luke i. 18.

   Up to this hour, every endeavour to obtain a Photograph of the
   corresponding page of the Codex Vaticanus, B, (NÂº. 1209, in the
   Vatican,) has proved unavailing. If the present Vindication of the
   genuineness of Twelve Verses of the everlasting Gospel should have the
   good fortune to approve itself to his Holiness, Pope Pius IX., let me
   be permitted in this unadorned and unusual manner,--(to which I would
   fain add some circumstance of respectful ceremony if I knew how,)--very
   humbly to entreat his Holiness to allow me to possess a Photograph,
   corresponding in size with the original, of the page of Codex B (it is
   numbered fol. 1303,) which exhibits the abrupt termination of the
   Gospel according to S. Mark.

  TO

SIR ROUNDELL PALMER, Q.C., M.P.,

  &c., &c., &c

   Dear Sir Roundell,

   I do myself the honour of inscribing this volume to you. Permit me to
   explain the reason why.

   It is not merely that I may give expression to a sentiment of private
   friendship which dates back from the pleasant time when I was Curate to
   your Father,--whose memory I never recal without love and
   veneration;--nor even in order to afford myself the opportunity of
   testifying how much I honour you for the noble example of conscientious
   uprightness and integrity which you set us on a recent public occasion.
   It is for no such reason that I dedicate to you this vindication of the
   last Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark.

   It is because I desire supremely to submit the argument contained in
   the ensuing pages to a practised judicial intellect of the loftiest
   stamp. Recent Editors of the New Testament insist that these "last
   Twelve Verses" are not genuine. The Critics, almost to a man, avow
   themselves of the same opinion. Popular Prejudice has been for a long
   time past warmly enlisted on the same side. I am as convinced as I am
   of my life, that the reverse is the truth. It is not even with me as it
   is with certain learned friends of mine, who, admitting the adversary's
   premium, content themselves with denying the validity of his inference.
   However true it may be,--and it is true,--that from those premium the
   proposed conclusion does not follow, I yet venture to deny the
   correctness of those premisses altogether. I insist, on the contrary,
   that the Evidence relied on is untrustworthy,--untrustworthy in every
   particular.

   How, in the meantime, can such an one as I am hope to persuade the
   world that it is as I say, while the most illustrious Biblical Critics
   at home and abroad are agreed, and against me Clearly, the first thing
   to be done is to secure for myself a full and patient hearing. With
   this view, I have written a book. But next, instead of waiting for the
   slow verdict of Public Opinion, (which yet, I know, must come after
   many days,) I desiderate for the Evidence I have collected, a competent
   and an impartial Judge. And that is why I dedicate my book to you. If I
   can but get this case fairly tried, I have no doubt whatever about the
   result.

   Whether you are able to find time to read these pages, or not, it shall
   content me to have shewn in this manner the confidence with which I
   advocate my cause; the kind of test to which I propose to bring my
   reasonings. If I may be allowed to say so,--S. Mark's last Twelve
   Verses shall no longer remain a subject of dispute among men. I am able
   to prove that this portion of the Gospel has been declared to be
   spurious on wholly mistaken grounds: and this ought in fairness to
   close the discussion. But I claim to have done more. I claim to have
   shewn, from considerations which have been hitherto overlooked, that
   its genuineness must needs be reckoned among the things that are
   absolutely certain.

   I am, with sincere regard and respect,

   Dear Sir Rounden,

   Very faithfully yours,

   JOHN W. BURGON.

PREFACE.

   THIS volume is my contribution towards the better understanding of a
   subject which is destined, when it shall have grown into a Science, to
   vindicate for itself a mighty province, and to enjoy paramount
   attention. I allude to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament
   Scriptures.

   That this Study is still in its infancy, all may see. The very
   principles on which it is based are as yet only imperfectly understood.
   The reason is obvious. It is because the very foundations have not yet
   been laid, (except to a wholly inadequate extent,) on which the future
   superstructure is to rise. A careful collation of every extant Codex,
   (executed after the manner of the Rev. F. H. Scrivener's labours in
   this department,) is the first indispensable preliminary to any real
   progress. Another, is a revised Text, not to say a more exact
   knowledge, of the oldest Versions. Scarcely of inferior importance
   would be critically correct editions of the Fathers of the Church and
   these must by all means be furnished with far completer Indices of
   Texts than have ever yet been attempted.--There is not a single Father
   to be named whose Works have been hitherto furnished with even a
   tolerably complete Index of the places in which he either quotes, or
   else clearly refers to, the Text of the New Testament: while scarcely a
   tithe of the known MSS. of the Gospels have as yet been satisfactorily
   collated. Strange to relate, we are to this hour without so much as a
   satisfactory Catalogue of the Copies which are known to be extant.

   But when all this has been done,--(and the Science deserves, and
   requires, a little more public encouragement than has hitherto been
   bestowed on the arduous and--let me not be ashamed to add the
   word--unremunerative labour of Textual Criticism,)--it will be
   discovered that the popular and the prevailing Theory is a mistaken
   one. The plausible hypothesis on which recent recensions of the Text
   have been for the most part conducted, will be seen to be no longer
   tenable. The latest decisions will in consequence be generally
   reversed.

   I am not of course losing sight of what has been already achieved in
   this department of Sacred Learning. While our knowledge of the uncial
   MSS. has been rendered tolerably exact and complete, an excellent
   beginning has been made, (chiefly by the Rev. F. H. Scrivener, the most
   judicious living Master of Textual Criticism,) in acquainting us with
   the contents of about seventy of the cursive MSS. of the New Testament.
   And though it is impossible to deny that the published Texts of Doctors
   Tischendorf and Tregelles as Texts are wholly inadmissible, yet is it
   equally certain that by the conscientious diligence with which those
   distinguished Scholars have respectively laboured, they have erected
   monuments of their learning and ability which will endure for ever.
   Their Editions of the New Testament will not be superseded by any new
   discoveries, by any future advances in the Science of Textual
   Criticism. The MSS. which they have edited will remain among the most
   precious materials for future study. All honour to them! If in the
   warmth of controversy I shall appear to have spoken of them sometimes
   without becoming deference, let me here once for all confess that I am
   to blame, and express my regret. When they have publicly begged S.
   Mark's pardon for the grievous wrong they have done him, I will very
   humbly beg their pardon also.

   In conclusion, I desire to offer my thanks to the Rev. John Wordsworth,
   late Fellow of Brasenose College, for his patient perusal of these
   sheets as they have passed through the press, and for favouring me with
   several judicious suggestions. To him may be applied the saying of
   President Routh on receiving a visit from Bishop Wordsworth at his
   lodgings,--"I see the learned son of a learned Father, sir!"--Let me be
   permitted to add that my friend inherits the Bishop's fine taste and
   accurate judgment also.

   And now I dismiss this Work, at which I have conscientiously laboured
   for many days and many nights; beginning it in joy and ending it in
   sorrow. The College in which I have for the most part written it is
   designated in the preamble of its Charter and in its Foundation
   Statutes, (which are already much more than half a thousand years old,)
   as Collegium Scholarium in SacrÃ¢ TheologiÃ¢ studentium,--perpetuis
   temporibus duraturum. Indebted, under God, to the pious munificence of
   the Founder of Oriel for my opportunities of study, I venture, in what
   I must needs call evil days, to hope that I have to some extent
   "employed my advantages,"--(the expression occurs in a prayer used by
   this Society on its three solemn anniversaries,) as our Founder and
   Benefactors "would approve if they were now upon earth to witness what
   we do."

   DEDICATION p. iii
   PREFACE p. v
   CHAPTER I.

   THE CASE OF THE LAST TWELVE VERSES OF S. MARK'S GOSPEL, STATED.

   These Verses generally suspected at the present time. The popularity of
   this opinion accounted for
   p. 1
   CHAPTER II.

   THE HOSTILE VERDICT OF BIBLICAL CRITICS SHEWN TO BE QUITE OF RECENT
   DATE.

   Griesbach the first to deny the genuineness of these Verses (p.
   6).--Lachmann's fatal principle (p. 8) the clue to the unfavourable
   verdict of Tischendorf (p. 9), of Tregelles (p. 10), of Alford (p. 12);
   which has. been generally adopted by subsequent Scholars and Divines
   (p. 13).--The nature of the present inquiry explained (p. 15).

   importance of such evidence explained (p. 21).--Nineteen Patristic
   witnesses to these Verses, produced (p. 23).--Summary (p. 30)

   p. 32
   CHAPTER V.

   THE ALLEGED HOSTILE WITNESS OF CERTAIN OF THE EARLY FATHERS PROVED TO
   BE AN IMAGINATION OF THE CRITICS.

   The mistake concerning Gregory of Nyssa (p.39).--The misconception
   concerning Eusebius (p.41).--The oversight concerning Jerome (p. 51);
   also concerning Hesychius of Jerusalem, (or else Severus of Antioch)
   (p. 57);--and the mis-statement concerning Victor of Antioch (p. 59).
   p. 38
   CHAPTER VI.

   MANUSCRIPT TESTIMONY SHEWN TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF THESE
   VERSES.--PART I.

   S. Mark xvi. 9-20, contained in every MS. in the world except
   two,--Irrational claim to Infallibility set up on behalf of Cod. B (p.
   73) and Cod. ' (p.76).--These two Codices shewn to be full of gross
   Omissions (p.78),--Interpolations (p. 80),--Corruptions of the Text
   (p.81),--and Perversions of the Truth (p. 83).--The testimony of Cod. B
   to S. Mark xvi. 9-20, shewn to be favourable, notwithstanding (p. 86).
   p. 70
   CHAPTER VII.

   MANUSCRIPT TESTIMONY SHEWN TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF THESE
   VERSES.--PART II.

   the words en Epheso from Ephes. i. 1) considered.--Antiquity
   unfavourable to the omission of those words (p. 93).--The Moderns
   infelicitous in their attempts to account for their omission (p.
   100).--Marcion probably the author of this corruption of the Text of
   Scripture (p. 106).--Other peculiarities of Codex ' disposed of, and
   shewn to be errors (p. 109).
   p. 91
   CHAPTER VIII.

   THE PURPORT OF ANCIENT SCHOLIA AND NOTES IN MSS. ON THE SUBJECT OF
   THESE VERSES, SHEWN TO BE THE REVERSE OF WHAT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED.

   Later Editors of the New Testament the victims of their predecessors'
   inaccuracies.--Birch's unfortunate mistake (p. 117).--Scholz' serious
   blunders (p. 119 and pp. 120-1).--Griesbach's sweeping misstatement
   (pp. 121-2).--The grave misapprehension which has resulted from all
   this inaccuracy of detail (pp. 122-3).
   p. 114

   Codex L (p. 123).--Ammonius not the author of the so-called "Ammonian"
   Sections (p.125).--Epiphanius (p. 132).--"Caesarius," a misnomer.--"The
   Catenae" misrepresented (p. 133).
   CHAPTER IX.

   INTERNAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED TO BE THE VERY REVERSE OF UNFAVOURABLE
   TO THESE VERSES.

   The "Style" and "Phraseology" of these Verses declared by Critics to be
   not S. Mark's.--Insecurity of such Criticism (p.140).--The "Style" of
   chap. xvi. 9-20 shewn to be the same as the style of chap. i. 9-20
   (p.142).--The "Phraseology" examined in twenty-seven particulars, and
   shewn to be suspicious in none (p.145),--but in twenty-seven
   particulars shewn to be the reverse (p.170).--Such remarks fallacious
   (p. 173).--Judged of by a truer, a more delicate and philosophical
   Test, these Verses proved to be most probably genuine (p. 175)
   p. 136
   CHAPTER X.

   THE TESTIMONY OF THE LECTIONARIES SHEWN TO BE ABSOLUTELY DECISIVE AS TO
   THE GENUINENESS OF THESE VERSES.

   The Lectionary of the East shewn to be a work of extraordinary
   antiquity (p.195).--Proved to be older than any extant MS. of the
   Gospels, by an appeal to the Fathers (p.198).--In this Lectionary, (and
   also in the Lectionary of the West,) the last Twelve Verses of S.
   Mark's Gospel have, from the first, occupied a most conspicuous, as
   well as most honourable place (p.204).--Now, this becomes the testimony
   of ante-Nicene Christendom in their favour, and is therefore decisive
   (p. 209).
   p. 191
   CHAPTER XI.

   THE OMISSION OF THESE TWELVE VERSES IN CERTAIN ANCIENT COPIES OF THE
   GOSPELS, EXPLAINED AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

   The Text of our five oldest Uncials proved, by an induction of
   instances, to have suffered depravation throughout by the operation of
   the ancient Lectionary system of the Church (p. 217).--The omission of
   S. Mark's "last Twelve Verses," (constituting an integral
   Ecclesiastical Lection,) shewn by an appeal to ancient MSS. to be
   probably only one more example of the same depraving influence (p.
   224).

   This solution of the problem corroborated by the language of Eusebius
   and of Hesychius (p. 232); as well as favoured by the "Western" order
   of the Gospels (p. 239).
   p.212
   CHAPTER XII.

   GENERAL REVIEW OF THE QUESTIONS SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE; AND CONCLUSION
   OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT:

   This discussion narrowed to a single issue (p. 244).--That S. Mark's
   Gospel was imperfect from the very first, a thing altogether incredible
   (p. 246).--But that at some very remote period Copies have suffered
   mutilation, a supposition probable in the highest degree (p.
   248).--Consequences of this admission (p.252).--Parting words (p. 254).

   (9) Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He
   appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.
   (10) And she went and told them that had been with Him, as they mourned
   and wept. (11) And they, when they had heard that He was alive, and had
   been seen of her, believed not.

   (12) After that He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
   walked, and went into the country. (13) And they went and told it unto
   the residue: neither believed they them.

   (14) Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
   upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
   believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen. (15) And He
   said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
   every creature. (16) He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
   but he that believeth not shall be damned. (17) And these signs shall
   follow them that believe; In My Name shall they cast out devils; they
   shall speak with new tongues; (18) they shall take up serpents; and if
   they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay
   hands on the sick, and they shall recover."

   (19) So then after the Loan had spoken unto them, He was received up
   into Heaven, and sat on the Right Hand of God. (20) And they went
   forth, and preached every where, the LORD working with them, and
   confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

  THE CASE OF THE LAST TWELVE VERSES OF S. MARK'S GOSPEL, STATED.

   These Verses generally suspected at the present time. The popularity of
   this opinion accounted for.

   IT has lately become the fashion to speak of the last Twelve Verses of
   the Gospel according to S. Mark, as if it were an ascertained fact that
   those verses constitute no integral part of the Gospel. It seems to be
   generally supposed, (1) That the evidence of MSS. is altogether fatal
   to their claims; (2) That "the early Fathers" witness plainly against
   their genuineness; (3) That, from considerations of "internal evidence"
   they must certainly be given up. It shall be my endeavour in the
   ensuing pages to show, on the contrary, That manuscript evidence is so
   overwhelmingly in their favour that no room is left for doubt or
   suspicion:--That there is not so much as one of the Fathers, early or
   late, who gives it as his opinion that these verses are spurious:--and,
   That the argument derived from internal considerations proves on
   inquiry to be baseless and unsubstantial as a dream.

   But I hope that I shall succeed in doing more. It shall be my endeavour
   to show not only that there really is no reason whatever for calling in
   question the genuineness of this portion of Holy Writ, but also that
   there exist sufficient reasons for feeling confident that it must needs
   be genuine. This is clearly as much as it is possible for me to
   achieve. But when this has been done, I venture to hope that the verses
   in dispute will for the future be allowed to retain their place in the
   second Gospel unmolested.

   It will of course be asked,--And yet, if all this be so, how does it
   happen that both in very ancient, and also in very modern times, this
   proposal to suppress twelve verses of the Gospel has enjoyed a certain
   amount of popularity? At the two different periods, (I answer,) for
   widely different reasons.

   (1.) In the ancient days, when it was the universal belief of
   Christendom that the Word of God must needs be consistent with itself
   in every part, and prove in every part (like its Divine Author)
   perfectly "faithful and true," the difficulty (which was deemed all but
   insuperable) of bringing certain statements in S. Mark's last Twelve
   Verses into harmony with certain statements of the other Evangelists,
   is discovered to have troubled Divines exceedingly. "In fact," (says
   Mr. Scrivener,) "it brought suspicion upon these verses, and caused
   their omission in some copies seen by Eusebius." That the maiming
   process is indeed attributable to this cause and came about in this
   particular way, I am unable to persuade myself; but, if the desire to
   provide an escape from a serious critical difficulty did not actually
   occasion that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were mutilated, it certainly
   was the reason why, in very early times, such mutilated copies were
   viewed without displeasure by some, and appealed to with complacency by
   others.

   (2.) But times are changed. We have recently been assured on high
   authority that the Church has reversed her ancient convictions in this
   respect: that now, "most sound theologians have no dread whatever of
   acknowledging minute points of disagreement" (i.e. minute errors) "in
   the fourfold narrative even of the life of the Redeemer [1] ." There
   has arisen in these last days a singular impatience of Dogmatic Truth,
   (especially Dogma of an unpalatable kind,) which has even rendered
   popular the pretext afforded by these same mutilated copies for the
   grave resuscitation of doubts, never as it would seem seriously
   entertained by any of the ancients; and which, at all events for 1300
   years and upwards, have deservedly sunk into oblivion.

   Whilst I write, that "most divine explication of the chiefest articles
   of our Christian belief," the Athanasian Creed [2] , is made the object
   of incessant assaults [3] . But then it is remembered that statements
   quite as "uncharitable" as any which this Creed contains are found in
   the 16th verse of S. Mark's concluding chapter; are in fact the words
   of Him whose very Name is Love. The precious warning clause, I say,
   (miscalled "damnatory [4] ,") which an impertinent officiousness is for
   glossing with a rubric and weakening with an apology, proceeded from
   Divine lips,--at least if these concluding verses be genuine. How shall
   this inconvenient circumstance be more effectually dealt with than by
   accepting the suggestion of the most recent editors, that S. Mark's
   concluding verses are an unauthorised addition to his Gospel? "If it be
   acknowledged that the passage has a harsh sound," (remarks Dean
   Stanley,) "unlike the usual utterances of Him who came not to condemn
   but to save, the discoveries of later times have shown, almost beyond
   doubt, that it is not a part of S. Mark's Gospel, but an addition by
   another hand; of which the weakness in the external evidence coincides
   with the internal evidence in proving its later origin [5] ."

   Modern prejudice, then,--added to a singularly exaggerated estimate of
   the critical importance of the testimony of our two oldest Codices,
   (another of the "discoveries of later times," concerning which I shall
   have more to say by-and-by,)--must explain why the opinion is even
   popular that the last twelve verses of S. Mark are a spurious appendix
   to his Gospel.

   Not that Biblical Critics would have us believe that the Evangelist
   left off at verse 8, intending that the words,--"neither said they
   anything to any man, for they were afraid," should be the conclusion of
   his Gospel. "No one can imagine," (writes Griesbach,) "that Mark cut
   short the thread of his narrative at that place [6] ." It is on all
   hands eagerly admitted, that so abrupt a termination must be held to
   mark an incomplete or else an uncompleted work. How, then, in the
   original autograph of the Evangelist, is it supposed that the narrative
   proceeded? This is what no one has even ventured so much as to
   conjecture. It is assumed, however, that the original termination of
   the Gospel, whatever it may have been, has perished. We appeal, of
   course, to its actual termination: and,--Of what nature then, (we ask,)
   is the supposed necessity for regarding the last twelve verses of S.
   Mark's Gospel us a spurious substitute for what the Evangelist
   originally wrote? What, in other words, has been the history of these
   modern doubts; and by what steps have they established themselves in
   books, and won the public ear?

   To explain this, shall be the object of the next ensuing chapters.

CHAPTER II.

  THE HOSTILE VERDICT OF BIBLICAL CRITICS SHEWN TO BE QUITE OF RECENT DATE.

   Griesbach the first to deny the genuineness of these Verses (p.
   6.)--Lachmann's fatal principle (p. 8) the clue to the unfavourable
   verdict of Tischendorf (p. 9), of Tregelles (p. 10), of Alford (p. 12);
   which has been generally adopted by subsequent Scholars and Divines (p.
   13).--The nature of the present inquiry explained (p. 15.)

   IT is only since the appearance of Griesbach's second edition
   [1796-1806] that Critics of the New Testament have permitted themselves
   to handle the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel with disrespect.
   Previous critical editions of the New Testament are free from this
   reproach. "There is no reason for doubting the genuineness of this
   portion of Scripture," wrote Mill in 1707, after a review of the
   evidence (as far as lie was acquainted with it) for and against.
   Twenty-seven years later, appeared Bengel's edition of the New
   Testament (1734); and Wetstein, at the end of another seventeen years
   (1751-2), followed in the same field. Both editors, after rehearsing
   the adverse testimony in extenso, left the passage in undisputed
   possession of its place. Alter in 1786-7, and Birch in 1788 [7] ,
   (suspicious as the latter evidently was of its genuineness,) followed
   their predecessors' example. But Matthaei, (who also brought his
   labours to a close in the year 1788,) was not content to give a silent
   suffrage. He had been for upwards of fourteen years a laborious
   collator of Greek MSS. of the New Testament, and was so convinced of
   the insufficiency of the arguments which had been brought against these
   twelve verses of S. Mark, that with no ordinary warmth, no common
   acuteness, he insisted on their genuineness.

   "With Griesbach," (remarks Dr. Tregelles [8] ,) "Texts which may be
   called really critical begin;" and Griesbach is the first to insist
   that the concluding verses of S. Mark are spurious. That he did not
   suppose the second Gospel to have always ended at verse 8, we have seen
   already [9] . He was of opinion, however, that "at some very remote
   period, the original ending of the Gospel perished,--disappeared
   perhaps from the Evangelist's own copy,--and that the present ending
   was by some one substituted in its place." Griesbach further invented
   the following elaborate and extraordinary hypothesis to account for the
   existence of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.

   He invites his readers to believe that when, (before the end of the
   second century,) the four Evangelical narratives were collected into a
   volume and dignified with the title of "The Gospel,"--S. Mark's
   narrative was furnished by some unknown individual with its actual
   termination in order to remedy its manifest incompleteness; and that
   this volume became the standard of the Alexandrine recension of the
   text: in other words, became the fontal source of a mighty family of
   MSS. by Griesbach designated as "Alexandrine." But there will have been
   here and there in existence isolated copies of one or more of the
   Gospels; and in all of these, S. Mark's Gospel, (by the hypothesis,)
   will have ended abruptly at the eighth verse. These copies of single
   Gospels, when collected together, are presumed by Griesbach to have
   constituted "the Western recension." If, in codices of this family
   also, the self-same termination is now all but universally found, the
   fact is to be accounted for, (Griesbach says,) by the natural desire
   which possessors of the Gospels will have experienced to supplement
   their imperfect copies as best they might. "Let this conjecture be
   accepted," proceeds the learned veteran,--(unconscious apparently that
   he has been demanding acceptance for at least half-a-dozen wholly
   unsupported as well as entirely gratuitous conjectures,)--"and every
   difficulty disappears; and it becomes perfectly intelligible how there
   has crept into almost every codex which has been written, from the
   second century downwards, a section quite different from the original
   and genuine ending of S. Mark, which disappeared before the four
   Gospels were collected into a single volume."--In other words, if men
   will but be so accommodating as to assume that the conclusion of S.
   Mark's Gospel disappeared before any one had the opportunity of
   transcribing the Evangelist's inspired autograph, they will have no
   difficulty in understanding that the present conclusion of S. Mark's
   Gospel was not really written by S. Mark.

   It should perhaps be stated in passing, that Griesbach was driven into
   this curious maze of unsupported conjecture by the exigencies of his
   "Recension Theory;" which, inasmuch as it has been long since exploded,
   need not now occupy us. But it is worth observing that the argument
   already exhibited, (such as it is,) breaks down under the weight of the
   very first fact which its learned author is obliged to lay upon it.
   Codex B.,--the solitary manuscript witness for omitting the clause in
   question, (for Codex ' had not yet been discovered,)--had been already
   claimed by Griesbach as a chief exponent of his so-called "Alexandrine
   Recension." But then, on the Critic's own hypothesis, (as we have seen
   already,) Codex B. ought, on the contrary, to have contained it. How
   was that inconvenient fact to be got over? Griesbach quietly remarks in
   a foot-note that Codex B. "has affinity with the Eastern family of
   MSS."--The misfortune of being saddled with a worthless theory was
   surely never more apparent. By the time we have reached this point in
   the investigation, we are reminded of nothing so much as of the weary
   traveller who, having patiently pursued an ignis fatuus through half
   the night, beholds it at last vanish; but not until it has conducted
   him up to his chin in the mire.

   Neither Hug, nor Scholz his pupil,--who in 1808 and 1830 respectively
   followed Griesbach with modifications of his
   recension-theory,--concurred in the unfavourable sentence which their
   illustrious predecessor had passed on the concluding portion of S.
   Mark's Gospel. The latter even eagerly vindicated its genuinenesss [10]
   . But with Lachmann,--whose unsatisfactory text of the Gospels appeared
   in 1842,--originated a new principle of Textual Revision; the
   principle, namely, of paying exclusive and absolute deference to the
   testimony of a few arbitrarily selected ancient documents; no regard
   being paid to others of the same or of yet higher antiquity. This is
   not the right place for discussing this plausible and certainly most
   convenient scheme of textual revision. That it leads to conclusions
   little short of irrational, is certain. I notice it only because it
   supplies the clue to the result which, as far as S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is
   concerned, has been since arrived at by Dr. Tischendorf, Dr. Tregelles,
   and Dean Alford [11] --the three latest critics who have formally
   undertaken to reconstruct the sacred Text.

   They agree in assuring their readers that the genuine Gospel of S. Mark
   extends no further than ch. xvi. ver. 8: in other words, that all that
   follows the words ephobounto ga'r is an unauthorized addition by some
   later hand; "a fragment,"--distinguishable from the rest of the Gospel
   not less by internal evidence than by external testimony. This verdict
   becomes the more important because it proceeds from men of undoubted
   earnestness and high ability; who cannot be suspected of being either
   unacquainted with the evidence on which the point in dispute rests, nor
   inexperienced in the art of weighing such evidence. Moreover, their
   verdict has been independently reached; is unanimous; is unhesitating;
   has been eagerly proclaimed by all three on many different occasions as
   well as in many different places [12] ; and may be said to be at
   present in all but undisputed possession of the field [13] . The
   first-named Editor enjoys a vast reputation, and has been generously
   styled by Mr. Scrivener, "the first Biblical Critic in Europe." The
   other two have produced text-books which are deservedly held in high
   esteem, and are in the hands of every student. The views of such men
   will undoubtedly colour the convictions of the next generation of
   English Churchmen. It becomes absolutely necessary, therefore, to
   examine with the utmost care the grounds of their verdict, the direct
   result of which is to present us with a mutilated Gospel. If they are
   right, there is no help for it but that the convictions of eighteen
   centuries in this respect must be surrendered. But if Tischendorf and
   Tregelles are wrong in this particular, it follows of necessity that
   doubt is thrown over the whole of their critical method. The case is a
   crucial one. Every page of theirs incurs suspicion, if their deliberate
   verdict in this instance shall prove to be mistaken.

   1. Tischendorf disposes of the whole question in a single sentence.
   "That these verses were not written by Mark," (he says,) "admits of
   satisfactory proof." He then recites in detail the adverse external
   testimony which his predecessors had accumulated; remarking, that it is
   abundantly confirmed by internal evidence. Of this he supplies a
   solitary sample; but declares that the whole passage is "abhorrent" to
   S. Mark's manner. "The facts of the case being such," (and with this he
   dismisses the subject,) "a healthy piety reclaims against the
   endeavours of those who are for palming off as Mark's what the
   Evangelist is so plainly shewn to have known nothing at all about [14]
   ." A mass of laborious annotation which comes surging in at the close
   of verse 8, and fills two of Tischendorf's pages, has the effect of
   entirely divorcing the twelve verses in question from the inspired text
   of the Evangelist. On the other hand, the evidence in favour of the
   place is despatched in less than twelve lines. What can be the reason
   that an Editor of the New Testament parades elaborately every
   particular of the evidence, (such as it is,) against the genuineness of
   a considerable portion of the Gospel; and yet makes summary work with
   the evidence in its favour? That Tischendorf has at least entirely made
   up his mind on the matter in hand is plain. Elsewhere, he speaks of the
   Author of these verses as "Pseudo Marcus [15] ."

   2. Dr. Tregelles has expressed himself most fully on this subject in
   his "Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament" (1854).
   The respected author undertakes to show "that the early testimony that
   S. Mark did not write these verses is confirmed by existing monuments."
   Accordingly, he announces as the result of the propositions which he
   thinks he has established, "that the book of Mark himself extends no
   further than ephobounto ga'r." He is the only critic I have met with to
   whom it does not seem incredible that S. Mark did actually conclude his
   Gospel in this abrupt way: observing that "perhaps we do not know
   enough of the circumstances of S. Mark when he wrote his Gospel to say
   whether he did or did not leave it with a complete termination." In
   this modest suggestion at least Dr. Tregelles is unassailable, since we
   know absolutely nothing whatever about "the circumstances of S. Mark,"
   (or of any other Evangelist,) "when he wrote his Gospel:" neither
   indeed are we quite sure who S. Mark was. But when he goes on to
   declare, notwithstanding, "that the remaining twelve verses, by
   whomsoever written, have a full claim to be received as an authentic
   part of the second Gospel;" and complains that "there is in some minds
   a kind of timidity with regard to Holy Scripture, as if all our notions
   of its authority depended on our knowing who was the writer of each
   particular portion; instead of simply seeing and owning that it was
   given forth from God, and that it is as much His as were the
   Commandments of the Law written by His own finger on the tables of
   stone [16] ;"--the learned writer betrays a misapprehension of the
   question at issue, which we are least of all prepared to encounter in
   such a quarter. We admire his piety but it is at the expense of his
   critical sagacity. For the question is not at all one of authorship,
   but only one of genuineness. Have the codices been mutilated which do
   not contain these verses? If they have, then must these verses be held
   to be genuine. But on the contrary, Have the codices been supplemented
   which contain them? Then are these verses certainly spurious. There is
   no help for it but they must either be held to be an integral part of
   the Gospel, and therefore, in default of any proof to the contrary, as
   certainly by S. Mark as any other twelve verses which can be named; or
   else an unauthorized addition to it. If they belong to the
   post-apostolic age it is idle to insist on their Inspiration, and to
   claim that this "authentic anonymous addition to what Mark himself
   wrote down" is as much the work of God "as were the Ten Commandments
   written by His own finger on the tables of stone." On the other hand,
   if they "ought as much to be received as part of our second Gospel as
   the last chapter of Deuteronomy (unknown as the writer is) is received
   as the right and proper conclusion of the book of Moses,"--it is
   difficult to understand why the learned editor should think himself at
   liberty to sever them from their context, and introduce the
   subscription KATA MARKON after ver. 8. In short, "How persons who
   believe that these verses did not form a part of the original Gospel of
   Mark, but were added afterwards, can say that they have a good claim to
   be received as an authentic or genuine part of the second Gospel, that
   is, a portion of canonical Scripture, passes comprehension." It passes
   even Dr. Davidson's comprehension; (for the foregoing words are his;)
   and Dr. Davidson, as some of us are aware, is not a man to stick at
   trifles [17] .

   3. Dean Alford went a little further than any of his predecessors. He
   says that this passage "was placed as a completion of the Gospel soon
   after the Apostolic period,--the Gospel itself having been, for some
   reason unknown to us, left incomplete. The most probable supposition"
   (he adds) "is, that the last leaf of the original Gospel was torn
   away." The italics in this conjecture (which was originally
   Griesbach's) are not mine. The internal evidence (declares the same
   learned writer) "preponderates vastly against the authorship of Mark;"
   or (as he elsewhere expresses it) against "its genuineness as a work of
   the Evangelist." Accordingly, in his Prolegomena, (p. 38) he describes
   it as "the remarkable fragment at the end of the Gospel." After this,
   we are the less astonished to find that he closes the second Gospel at
   ver. 8; introduces the Subscription there; and encloses the twelve
   verses which follow within heavy brackets. Thus, whereas from the days
   of our illustrious countryman Mill (1707), the editors of the N. T.
   have either been silent on the subject, or else have whispered only
   that this section of the Gospel is to be received with less of
   confidence than the rest,--it has been reserved for the present century
   to convert the ancient suspicions into actual charges. The latest to
   enter the field have been the first to execute Griesbach's adverse
   sentence pronounced fifty years ago, and to load the blessed Evangelist
   with bonds.

   It might have been foreseen that when Critics so conspicuous permit
   themselves thus to handle the precious deposit, others would take
   courage to hurl their thunderbolts in the same direction with the less
   concern. "It is probable," (says Abp. Thomson in the Bible Dictionary,)
   "that this section is from a different hand, and was annexed to the
   Gospels soon after the times of the Apostles [18] ."--The Rev. T. S.
   Green [19] , (an able scholar, never to be mentioned without respect,)
   considers that "the hypothesis of very early interpolation satisfies
   the body of facts in evidence,"--which "point unmistakably in the
   direction of a spurious origin."--"In respect of Mark's Gospel,"
   (writes Professor Norton in a recent work on the Genuineness of the
   Gospels,) "there is ground for believing that the last twelve verses
   were not written by the Evangelist, but were added by some other writer
   to supply a short conclusion to the work, which some cause had
   prevented the author from completing [20] ."--Professor Westcott--who,
   jointly with the Rev. F. J. A. Hort, announces a revised Text--assures
   us that "the original text, from whatever cause it may have happened,
   terminated abruptly after the account of the Angelic vision." The rest
   "was added at another time, and probably by another hand." "It is in
   vain to speculate on the causes of this abrupt close." "The remaining
   verses cannot be regarded as part of the original narrative of S. Mark
   [21] ."--Meyer insists that this is an "apocryphal fragment," and
   reproduces all the arguments, external and internal, which have ever
   been arrayed against it, without a particle of misgiving. The "note"
   with which he takes leave of the subject is even insolent [22] . A
   comparison (he says) of these "fragments" (ver. 9-18 and 19) with the
   parallel places in the other Gospels and in the Acts, shews how
   vacillating and various were the Apostolical traditions concerning the
   appearances of our Lord after His Resurrection, and concerning His
   Ascension. ("Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?")

   Such, then, is the hostile verdict concerning these last twelve verses
   which I venture to dispute, and which I trust I shall live to see
   reversed. The writers above cited will be found to rely (1.) on the
   external evidence of certain ancient MSS.; and (2.) on Scholia which
   state "that the more ancient and accurate copies terminated the Gospel
   at ver. 8." (3.) They assure us that this is confirmed by a formidable
   array of Patristic authorities. (4.) Internal proof is declared not to
   be wanting. Certain incoherences and inaccuracies are pointed out. In
   fine, "the phraseology and style of the section" are declared to be
   "unfavourable to its authenticity;" not a few of the words and
   expressions being "foreign to the diction of Mark."--I propose to shew
   that all these confident and imposing statements are to a great extent
   either mistakes or exaggerations, and that the slender residuum of fact
   is about as powerless to achieve the purpose of the critics as were the
   seven green withs of the Philistines to bind Samson.

   In order to exhibit successfully what I have to offer on this subject,
   I find it necessary to begin (in the next chapter) at the very
   beginning. I think it right, however, in this place to premise a few
   plain considerations which will be of use to us throughout all our
   subsequent inquiry; and which indeed we shall never be able to afford
   to lose sight of for long.

   The question at issue being simply this,--Whether it is reasonable to
   suspect that the last twelve verses of S. Mark are a spurious accretion
   and unauthorized supplement to his Gospel, or not?--the whole of our
   business clearly resolves itself into an examination of what has been
   urged in proof that the former alternative is the correct one. Our
   opponents maintain that these verses did not form part of the original
   autograph of the Evangelist. But it is a known rule in the Law of
   Evidence that the burthen of proof lies on the party who asserts the
   affirmative of the issue [23] . We have therefore to ascertain in the
   present instance what the supposed proof is exactly worth; remembering
   always that in this subject-matter a high degree of probability is the
   only kind of proof which is attainable. When, for example, it is
   contended that the famous words in S. John's first Epistle (1 S. John
   v. 7, 8,) are not to be regarded as genuine, the fact that they are
   away from almost every known Codex is accepted as a proof that they
   were also away from the autograph of the Evangelist. On far less
   weighty evidence, in fact, we are at all times prepared to yield the
   hearty assent of our understanding in this department of sacred
   science.

   And yet, it will be found that evidence of overwhelming weight, if not
   of an entirely different kind, is required in the present instance: as
   I proceed to explain.

   1. When it is contended that our Lord's reply to the young ruler (S.
   Matt. xix. 17) was not Ti' me le'geis agathon? oudei`s agatho`s, ei me`
   heis, o Theo's,--it is at the same time insisted that it was Ti' me
   erotas peri` tou agathou? heis estin o agatho's. It is proposed to omit
   the former words only because an alternative clause is at hand, which
   it is proposed to substitute in its room.

   2. Again. When it is claimed that some given passage of the Textus
   Receptus,--S. Mark xv. 28, for example, (kai` eplero'the e graphe` e
   le'gousa, Kai` meta` ano'mon elogi'sthe,) or the Doxology in S. Matth.
   vi. 13,--is spurious, all that is pretended is that certain words are
   an unauthorized addition to the inspired text; and that by simply
   omitting them we are so far restoring the Gospel to its original
   integrity.--The same is to be said concerning every other charge of
   interpolation which can be named. If the celebrated "pericopa de
   adulterÃ¢," for instance, be indeed not genuine, we have but to leave
   out those twelve verses of S. John's Gospel, and to read chap. vii. 52
   in close sequence with chap. viii. 12; and we are assured that we are
   put in possession of the text as it came from the hands of its inspired
   Author. Nor, (it must be admitted), is any difficulty whatever
   occasioned thereby; for there is no reason assignable why the two
   last-named verses should not cohere; (there is no internal
   improbability, I mean, in the supposition;) neither does there exist
   any Ã  priori reason why a considerable portion of narrative should be
   looked for in that particular part of the Gospel.

   3. But the case is altogether different, as all must see, when it is
   proposed to get rid of the twelve verses which for 1700 years and
   upwards have formed the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel; no alternative
   conclusion being proposed to our acceptance. For let it be only
   observed what this proposal practically amounts to and means.

   (a.) And first, it does not mean that S. Mark himself, with design,
   brought his Gospel to a close at the words ephobounto ga'r. That
   supposition would in fact be irrational. It does not mean, I say, that
   by simply leaving out those last twelve verses we shall be restoring
   the second Gospel to its original integrity. And this it is which makes
   the present a different case from every other, and necessitates a
   fuller, if not a different kind of proof.

   (I.) What then? It means that although an abrupt and impossible
   termination would confessedly be the result of omitting verses 9-20, no
   nearer approximation to the original autograph of the Evangelist is at
   present attainable. Whether S. Mark was interrupted before he could
   finish his Gospel,--(as Dr. Tregelles and Professor Norton
   suggest;)--in which case it will have been published by its Author in
   au unfinished state: or whether "the last leaf was torn away" before a
   single copy of the original could be procured,--(a view which is found
   to have recommended itself to Griesbach;)--in which case it will have
   once had a different termination from at present; which termination
   however, by the hypothesis, has since been irrecoverably lost;--(and to
   one of these two wild hypotheses the critics are logically
   reduced;)--this we are not certainly told. The critics are only agreed
   in assuming that S. Mark's Gospel was at first without the verses which
   at present conclude it.

   But this assumption, (that a work which has been held to be a complete
   work for seventeen centuries and upwards was originally incomplete,) of
   course requires proof. The foregoing improbable theories, based on a
   gratuitous assumption, are confronted in limine with a formidable
   obstacle which must be absolutely got rid of before they can be thought
   entitled to a serious hearing. It is a familiar and a fatal
   circumstance that the Gospel of S. Mark has been furnished with its
   present termination ever since the second century of the Christian Ã¦ra
   [24] . In default, therefore, of distinct historical evidence or
   definite documentary proof that at some earlier period than that it
   terminated abruptly, nothing short of the utter unfitness of the verses
   which at present conclude S. Mark's Gospel to be regarded as the work
   of the Evangelist, would warrant us in assuming that they are the
   spurious accretion of the post-apostolic age: and as such, at the end
   of eighteen centuries, to be deliberately rejected. We must absolutely
   be furnished, I say, with internal evidence of the most unequivocal
   character; or else with external testimony of a direct and definite
   kind, if we are to admit that the actual conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel
   is an unauthorized substitute for something quite different that has
   been lost. I can only imagine one other thing which could induce us to
   entertain such an opinion; and that would be the general consent of
   MSS., Fathers, and Versions in leaving these verses out. Else, it is
   evident that we are logically forced to adopt the far easier
   supposition that (not S. Mark, but) some copyist of the third century
   left a copy of S. Mark's Gospel unfinished; which unfinished copy
   became the fontal source of the mutilated copies which have come down
   to our own times [25] .

   I have thought it right to explain the matter thus fully at the outset;
   not in order to prejudge the question, (for that could answer no good
   purpose,) but only in order that the reader may have clearly set before
   him the real nature of the issue. "Is it reasonable to suspect that the
   concluding verses of S. Mark are a spurious accretion and unauthorized
   supplement to his Gospel, or not?" That is the question which we have
   to consider,--the one question. And while I proceed to pass under
   careful review all the evidence on this subject with which I am
   acquainted, I shall be again and again obliged to direct the attention
   of my reader to its bearing on the real point at issue. In other words,
   we shall have again and again to ask ourselves, how far it is rendered
   probable by each fresh article of evidence that S. Mark's Gospel, when
   it left the hands of its inspired Author, was an unfinished work; the
   last chapter ending abruptly at ver. 8?

   I will only point out, before passing on, that the course which has
   been adopted towards S. Mark xvi. 9-20, by the latest Editors of the
   New Testament, is simply illogical. Either they regard these verses as
   possibly genuine, or else as certainly spurious. If they entertain (as
   they say they do) a decided opinion that they are not genuine, they
   ought (if they would be consistent) to banish them from the text [26] .
   Conversely, since they do not banish them from the text, they have no
   right to pass a fatal sentence upon them; to designate their author as
   "pseudo-Marcus;" to handle them in contemptuous fashion. The plain
   truth is, these learned men are better than their theory; the
   worthlessness of which they are made to feel in the present most
   conspicuous instance. It reduces them to perplexity. It has landed them
   in inconsistency and error.--They will find it necessary in the end to
   reverse their convictions. They cannot too speedily reconsider their
   verdict, and retrace their steps.

   [11] I find it difficult to say what distress the sudden removal of
   this amiable and accomplished Scholar occasions me, just as I am
   finishing my task. I consign these pages to the press with a sense of
   downright reluctance,--(constrained however by the importance of the
   subject,)--seeing that he is no longer among us either to accept or to
   dispute a single proposition. All I can do is to erase every word which
   might have occasioned him the least annoyance; and indeed, as seldom as
   possible to introduce his respected name. An open grave reminds one of
   the nothingness of earthly controversy; as nothing else does, or indeed
   can do.

   [12] Tischendorf; besides eight editions of his laborious critical
   revision of the Greek Text, has edited our English "Authorized Version"
   (Tauchnitz, 1869,) with an "Introduction" addressed to unlearned
   readers, and the various readings of Codd. ', B and A, set down in
   English at the foot of every page.--Tregelles, besides his edition of
   the Text of the N. T., is very full on the subject of S. Mark xvi.
   9-20, in his "Account of the Printed Text," and in his "Introduction to
   the Textual Criticism of the N. T." (vol. iv. of Horne's Introd.)--Dean
   Alford, besides six editions of his Greek Testament, and an abridgment
   "for the upper forms of Schools and for passmen at the Universities,"
   put forth two editions of a "N. T. for English Readers," and three
   editions of "the Authorized Version newly compared with the original
   Greek and revised;"--in every one of which it is stated that these
   twelve verses are "probably an addition, placed here in very early
   times."

   [13] The Rev. P. H. Scrivener, Bp. Ellicott, and Bp. Wordsworth, are
   honourable exceptions to this remark. the last-named excellent Divine
   reluctantly admitting that "this portion may not have been penned by S.
   Mark himself;" and Bishop Ellicott (Historical Lectures, pp. 26-7)
   asking "Why may not this portion have been written by S. Mark at a
   later period?;"--both alike resolutely insist on its genuineness and
   canonicity. To the honour of the best living master of Textual
   Criticism, the Rev. F. H. Scrivener, (of whom I desire to be understood
   to speak as a disciple of his master,) he it stated that he has never
   at any time given the least sanction to the popular outcry against this
   portion of the Gospel. "Without the slightest misgiving" he has
   uniformly maintained the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.

   the 7th Leipsic ed.; but in Tischendorf's 8th ed. (1866, pp. 403, 406,)
   the same verdict is repeated, with the following addition:--"Quae quum

CHAPTER III,

  THE EARLY FATHERS APPEALED TO, AND OBSERVED TO BEAR FAVOURABLE WITNESS.

   Patristic evidence sometimes .the most important of any (p. 20).--The
   importance of such evidence explained (p. 21).--Nineteen Patristic
   witnesses to these Verses, produced (p. 23).--Summary (p. 30).

   THE present inquiry must be conducted solely on grounds of Evidence,
   external and internal. For the full consideration of the former, seven
   Chapters will be necessary [27] : for a discussion of the latter, one
   seventh of that space will suffice [28] . We have first to ascertain
   whether the external testimony concerning S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is of such
   a nature as to constrain us to admit that it is highly probable that
   those twelve verses are a spurious appendix to S. Mark's Gospel.

   1. It is well known that for determining the Text of the New Testament,
   we are dependent on three chief sources of information: viz. (1.) on
   Manuscripts,--(2.) on Versions,--(3.) on Fathers. And it is even
   self-evident that the most ancient MSS.,--the earliest Versions,--the
   oldest of the Fathers, will probably be in every instance the most
   trustworthy witnesses.

   2. Further, it is obvious that a really ancient Codex of the Gospels
   must needs supply more valuable critical help in establishing the
   precise Text of Scripture than can possibly be rendered by any
   Translation, however faithful: while Patristic citations are on the
   whole a less decisive authority, even than Versions. The reasons are
   chiefly these:--(a.) Fathers often quote Scripture loosely, if not
   licentiously; and sometimes allude only when they seem to quote. (b.)
   They appear to have too often depended on their memory, and sometimes
   are demonstrably loose and inaccurate in their citations; the same
   Father being observed to quote the same place in different ways. (c.)
   Copyists and Editors may not be altogether depended upon for the exact
   form of such supposed quotations. Thus the evidence of Fathers must
   always be to some extent precarious.

   3. On the other hand, it cannot be too plainly pointed out that
   when,--instead of certifying ourselves of the actual words employed by
   an Evangelist, their precise form and exact sequence,--our object is
   only to ascertain whether a considerable passage of Scripture is
   genuine or not; is to be rejected or retained; was known or was not
   known in the earliest) ages of the Church; then, instead of supplying
   the least important evidence, Fathers become by far the most valuable
   witnesses of all. This entire subject may be conveniently illustrated
   by an appeal to the problem before us.

   4. Of course, if we possessed copies of the Gospels coeval with their
   authors, nothing could compete with such evidence. But then unhappily
   nothing of the kind is the case. The facts admit of being stated within
   the compass of a few lines. We have one Codex (the Vatican, B) which is
   thought to belong to the first half of the iv^th century; and another,
   the newly discovered Codex Sinaiticus, (at St. Petersburg, ') which is
   certainly not quite so old,--perhaps by 50 years. Next come two famous
   codices; the Alexandrine (in the British Museum, A) and the Codex
   Ephraemi (in the Paris Library, C), which are probably from 50 to 100
   years more recent still. The Codex Bezae (at Cambridge, D) is
   considered by competent judges to be the depository of a recension of
   the text as ancient as any of the others. Notwithstanding its strangely
   depraved condition therefore,--the many "monstra potius quam variae
   lectiones" which it contains,--it may be reckoned with the preceding
   four, though it must be 50 or 100 years later than the latest of them.
   After this, we drop down, (as far as S. Mark is concerned,) to 2 uncial
   MSS. of the viii^th century,--7 of the ix^th,--4 of the ix^th or x^th
   [29] , while cursives of the xi^th and xii^th centuries are very
   numerous indeed,--the copies increasing in number in a rapid ratio as
   we descend the stream of Time. Our primitive manuscript witnesses,
   therefore, are but five in number at the utmost. And of these it has
   never been pretended that the oldest is to be referred to an earlier
   date than the beginning of the iv^th century, while it is thought by
   competent judges that the last named may very possibly have been
   written quite late in the vi^th.

   5. Are we then reduced to this fourfold, (or at most fivefold,)
   evidence concerning the text of the Gospels,--on evidence of not quite
   certain date, and yet (as we all believe) not reaching further back
   than to the iv^th century of our Ã¦ra? Certainly not. Here, Fathers come
   to our aid. There are perhaps as many as an hundred Ecclesiastical
   Writers older than the oldest extant Codex of the N.T.: while between
   A.D. 300 and A.D. 600, (within which limits our five oldest MSS. may be
   considered certainly to fall,) there exist about two hundred Fathers
   more. True, that many of these have left wondrous little behind them;
   and that the quotations from Holy Scripture of the greater part may
   justly be described as rare and unsatisfactory. But what then? From the
   three hundred, make a liberal reduction; and an hundred writers will
   remain who frequently quote the New Testament, and who, when they do
   quote it, are probably as trustworthy witnesses to the Truth of
   Scripture as either Cod. ' or Cod. B. We have indeed heard a great deal
   too much of the precariousness of this class of evidence: not nearly
   enough of the gross inaccuracies which disfigure the text of those two
   Codices. Quite surprising is it to discover to what an extent Patristic
   quotations from the New Testament have evidently retained their exact
   original form. What we chiefly desiderata at this time is a more
   careful revision of the text of the Fathers, and more skilfully
   elaborated indices of the works of each: not one of them having been
   hitherto satisfactorily indexed. It would be easy to demonstrate the
   importance of bestowing far more attention on this subject than it
   seems to have hitherto enjoyed: but I shall content myself with citing
   a single instance; and for this, (in order not to distract the reader's
   attention), I shall refer him to the Appendix [30] . What is at least
   beyond the limits of controversy, whenever the genuineness of a
   considerable passage of Scripture is the point in dispute, the
   testimony of Fathers who undoubtedly recognise that passage, is beyond
   comparison the most valuable testimony we can enjoy.

   6. For let it be only considered what is implied by a Patristic appeal
   to the Gospel. It amounts to this:--that a conspicuous personage,
   probably a Bishop of the Church,--one, therefore, whose history, date,
   place, are all more or less matter of notoriety,--gives us his written
   assurance that the passage in question was found in that copy of the
   Gospels which he was accustomed himself to employ; the uncial codex,
   (it has long since perished) which belonged to himself, or to the
   Church which he served. It is evident, in short, that any objection to
   quotations from Scripture in the writings of the ancient Fathers can
   only apply to the form of those quotations; not to their substance. It
   is just as certain that a verse of Scripture was actually read by the
   Father who unmistakedly refers to it, as if we had read it with him;
   even though the gravest doubts may be entertained as to the ipsissima
   verba' which were found in his own particular copy. He may have trusted
   to his memory: or copyists may have taken liberties with his writings:
   or editors may have misrepresented what they found in the written
   copies. The form of the quoted verse, I repeat, may have suffered
   almost to any extent. The substance, on the contrary, inasmuch as it
   lay wholly beyond their province, may be looked upon as an indisputable
   fact.

   7. Some such preliminary remarks, (never out of place when quotations
   from the Fathers are to be considered,) cannot well be withheld when
   the most venerable Ecclesiastical writings are appealed to. The
   earliest of the Fathers are observed to quote with singular
   licence,--to allude rather than to quote. Strange to relate, those
   ancient men seem scarcely to have been aware of the grave
   responsibility they incurred when they substituted expressions of their
   own for the utterances of the Spirit. It is evidently not so much that
   their memory is in fault, as their judgment,--in that they evidently
   hold themselves at liberty to paraphrase, to recast, to reconstruct
   [31] .

   I. Thus, it is impossible to resist the inference that Papias refers to
   S. Mark xvi. 18 when he records a marvellous tradition concerning
   "Justus surnamed Barsabas," "how that after drinking noxious poison,
   through the Lord's grace he experienced no evil consequence [32] ." He
   does not give the words of the Evangelist. It is even surprising how
   completely he passes them by; and yet the allusion to the place just
   cited is manifest. Now, Papias is a writer who lived so near the time
   of the Apostles that he made it his delight to collect their
   traditional sayings. His date (according to Clinton) is A.D. 100.

   II. Justin Martyr, the date of whose first Apology is A.D. 151, is
   observed to say concerning the Apostles that, after our Lord's
   Ascension,--exeltho'ntes pantachou eke'ruxan [33] : which is nothing
   else but a quotation from the last verse of S. Mark's Gospel,--ekeinoi
   de` exeltho'ntes eke'ruxan pantachou. And thus it is found that the
   conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel was familiarly known within fifty years
   of the death of the last of the Evangelists.

   III. When IrenÃ¦us, in his third Book against Heresies, deliberately
   quotes and remarks upon the 19th verse of the last chapter of S. Mark's
   Gospel [34] , we are put in possession of the certain fact that the
   entire passage now under consideration was extant in a copy of the
   Gospels which was used by the Bishop of the Church of Lyons sometime
   about the year A.D. 180, and which therefore cannot possibly have been
   written much more than a hundred years after the date of the Evangelist
   himself: while it may have been written by a contemporary of S. Mark,
   and probably was written by one who lived immediately after his
   time.--Who sees not that this single piece of evidence is in itself
   sufficient to outweigh the testimony of any codex extant? It is in fact
   a mere trifling with words to distinguish between "Manuscript" and
   "Patristic" testimony in a case like this: for (as I have already
   explained) the passage quoted from S. Mark's Gospel by IrenÃ¦us is to
   all intents and purposes a fragment from a dated manuscript; and that
   MS., demonstrably older by at least one hundred and fifty years than
   the oldest copy of the Gospels which has come down to our times.

   IV. Take another proof that these concluding verses of S. Mark were in
   the second century accounted an integral part of his Gospel.
   Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus near Rome (190-227), a contemporary of
   IrenÃ¦us, quotes the 17^th and 18^th verses in his fragment Peri
   Charismaton [35] . Also in his Homily on the heresy of Noetus [36] ,
   Hippolytus has a plain reference to this section of S. Mark's Gospel.
   To an inattentive reader, the passage alluded to might seem to be only
   the fragment of a Creed; but this is not the case. In the Creeds,
   Christ is invariably spoken of as anelthonta: in the Scriptures,
   invariably as analephthenta [37] . So that when Hippolytus says of Him,
   analambanetai eis ouranous kai ek dexion Patros kathizetai, the
   reference must needs be to S. Mark xvi. 19.

   V. At the Seventh Council of Carthage held under Cyprian, A.D. 256, (on
   the baptizing of Heretics,) Vincentius, Bishop of Thibari, (a place not
   far from Carthage,) in the presence of the eighty-seven assembled
   African bishops, quoted two of the verses under consideration [38] ;
   and Augustine, about a century and a half later, in his reply, recited
   the words afresh [39] .

   VI. The Apocryphal Acta Pilati (sometimes called the "Gospel of
   Nicodemus") Tischendorf assigns without hesitation to the iii^rd
   century; whether rightly or wrongly I have no means of ascertaining. It
   is at all events a very ancient forgery, and it contains the 15th,
   16th, 17th and 18th verses of this chapter [40] .

   VII. This is probably the right place to mention that ver. 15 is
   clearly alluded to in two places of the (so-called) "Apostolical
   Constitutions [41] ;" and that verse 16 is quoted (with no variety of
   reading from the Textus receptus [42] ) in an earlier part of the same
   ancient work. The "Constitutions" are assigned to the iii^rd or the
   iv^th century [43] .

   VIII and IX. It will be shown in Chapter V. that Eusebius, the
   Ecclesiastical Historian, was profoundly well acquainted with these
   verses. He discusses them largely, and (as I shall prove in the chapter
   referred to) was by no means disposed to question their genuineness.
   His Church History was published A.D. 325.

   Marinus also, (whoever that individual may have been,) a contemporary
   of Eusebius,--inasmuch as he is introduced to our notice by Eusebius
   himself as asking a question concerning the last twelve verses of S.
   Mark's Gospel without a trace of misgiving as to the genuineness of
   that about which he inquires,--is a competent witness in their favor
   who has hitherto been overlooked in this discussion.

   X. Tischendorf and his followers state that Jacobus Nisibenus quotes
   these verses. For "Jacobus Nisibenus" read "Aphraates the Persian
   Sage," and the statement will be correct. The history of the mistake is
   curious.

   Jerome, in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical writers, makes no mention of
   Jacob of Nisibis,--a famous Syrian Bishop who was present at the
   Council of NicÃ¦a, A.D. 325. Gennadius of Marseille, (who carried on
   Jerome's list to the year 495) asserts that the reason of this omission
   was Jerome's ignorance of the Syriac language; and explains that Jacob
   was the author of twenty-two Syriac Homilies [44] . Of these, there
   exists a very ancient Armenian translation; which was accordingly
   edited as the work of Jacobus Nisi-bonus with a Latin version, at Rome,
   in 1756. Gallandius reprinted both the Armenian and the Latin; and to
   Gallandius (vol. v.) we are referred whenever "Jacobus Nisibenus" is
   quoted.

   But the proposed attribution of the Homilies in question,--though it
   has been acquiesced in for nearly 1400 years,--is incorrect. Quite
   lately the Syriac originals have come to light, and they prove to be
   the work of Aphraates, "the Persian Sage,"--a Bishop, and the earliest
   known Father of the Syrian Church. In the first Homily, (which bears
   date A.D. 337), verses 16, 17, 18 of S. Mark xvi. are quoted [45]
   ,--yet not from the version known as the Curetonian Syriac, nor yet
   from the Peshito exactly [46] .--Here, then, is another wholly
   independent witness to the last twelve verses of S. Mark, coeval
   certainly with the two oldest copies of the Gospel extant,--B and '.

   XI. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan. (A.D. 374-397) freely quotes this
   portion of the Gospel,--citing ver. 15 four times: verses 16, 17 and
   18, each three times: ver. 20, once [47] .

   XII. The testimony of Chrysostom (A.D. 400) has been all but
   overlooked. In part of a Homily claimed for him by his Benedictine
   Editors, he points out that S. Luke alone of the Evangelists describes
   the Ascension: S. Matthew and S. John not speaking of it,--S. Mark
   recording the event only. Then he quotes verses 19, 20. "This" (he
   adds) "is the end of the Gospel. Mark makes no extended mention of the
   Ascension [48] ." Elsewhere he has an unmistakable reference to S. Mark
   xvi. 9 [49] .

   XIII. Jerome, on a point like this, is entitled to more attention than
   any other Father of the Church. Living at a very early period, (for he
   was born in 331 and died in 420,)--endowed with extraordinary Biblical
   learning,--a man of excellent judgment,--and a professed Editor of the
   New Testament, for the execution of which task he enjoyed extraordinary
   facilities,--his testimony is most weighty. Not unaware am I that
   Jerome is commonly supposed to be a witness on the opposite side:
   concerning which mistake I shall have to speak largely in Chapter V.
   But it ought to be enough to point out that we should not have met with
   these last twelve verses in the Vulgate, had Jerome held them to be
   spurious [50] . He familiarly quotes the 9th verse in one place of his
   writings [51] ; in another place he makes the extraordinary statement
   that in certain of the copies, (especially the Greek,) was found after
   ver. 14 the reply of the eleven Apostles, when our Saviour "upbraided
   them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed
   not them which had seen Him after He was risen [52] ." To discuss so
   weak and worthless a forgery,--no trace of which is found in any MS. in
   existence, and of which nothing whatever is known except what Jerome
   here tells us,--would be to waste our time indeed. The fact remains,
   however, that Jerome, besides giving these last twelve verses a place
   in the Vulgate, quotes S. Mark xvi. 14, as well as ver. 9, in the
   course of his writings.

   XIV. It was to have been expected that Augustine would quote these
   verses: but he more than quotes them. He brings them forward again and
   again [53] ,--discusses them as the work of S. Mark,--remarks that "in
   diebus Paschalibus," S. Mark's narrative of the Resurrection was
   publicly read in the Church [54] . All this is noteworthy. Augustine
   flourished A.D. 395-430.

   XV. and XVI. Another very important testimony to the genuineness of the
   concluding part of S. Mark's Gospel is furnished by the unhesitating
   manner in which Nestorius, the heresiarch, quotes ver. 20; and Cyril of
   Alexandria. accepts his quotation, adding a few words of his own [55] .
   Let it be borne in mind that this is tantamount to the discovery of two
   dated codices containing the last twelve verses of S. Mark,--and that
   date anterior (it is impossible to say by how many years) to A.D. 430.

   Victor of Antioch, (concerning whom I shall have to speak very largely
   in Chapter V.,) flourished about A.D. 425. The critical testimony which
   he bears to the genuineness of these verses is more emphatic than is to
   be met with in the pages of any other ancient Father. It may be
   characterized as the most conclusive testimony which it was in his
   power to render.

   Hesychius of Jerusalem, by a singular oversight, has been reckoned
   among the impugners of these verses. He is on the contrary their eager
   advocate and champion. It seems to have escaped observation that
   towards the close of his "Homily on the Resurrection," (published in
   the works of Gregory of Nyasa, and erroneously ascribed to that
   Father,) Hesychius appeals to the 19th verse, and quotes it as S.
   Mark's at length [56] . The date of Hesychius is uncertain; but he may,
   I suppose, be considered to belong to the vi^th century. His evidence
   is discussed in Chapter V.

   XIX. This list shall be brought to a close with a reference to the
   Synopsis Scripturae Sacrae,--an ancient work ascribed to Athanasius
   [57] , but probably not the production of that Father. It is at all
   events of much older date than any of the later uncials; and it
   rehearses in detail the contents of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 [58] .

   It would be easy to prolong this enumeration of Patristic authorities;
   as, by appealing to Gregentius in the vi^th century, and to Gregory the
   Great, and. Modestus, patriarch of Constantinople in the vii^th;--to
   Ven. Bede and John Damascene in the viii^th;--to Theophylact in the
   xi^th;--to Euthymius in the xii^th [59] : but I forbear. It would add
   no strength to my argument that I should by such evidence support it;
   as the reader will admit when he has read my X^th chapter.

   It will be observed then that three competent Patristic witnesses of
   the ii^nd century,--four of the iii^rd,--six of the iv^th,--four of the
   v^th,--and two (of uncertain date, but probably) of the vi^th,--have
   admitted their familiarity with these "last Twelve Verses." Yet do they
   not belong to one particular age, school, or country. They come, on the
   contrary, from every part of the ancient Church: Antioch and
   Constantinople,--Hierapolis, CÃ¦sarea and Edessa,--Carthage, Alexandria
   and Hippo,--Rome and Portus. And thus, upwards of nineteen early mama
   have been to all intents and purposes inspected for us in various lands
   by unprejudiced witnesses,--seven of them at least of more ancient date
   than the oldest copy of the Gospels extant.

   I propose to recur to this subject for an instant when the reader has
   been made acquainted with the decisive testimony which ancient Versions
   supply. But the Versions deserve a short Chapter to themselves.

   [35] First published as his by Fabricius (vol. i. 245.) Its authorship
   has never been disputed. In the enumeration of the works of Hippolytus
   (inscribed on the chair of his marble effigy in the Lateran Museum at
   Rome) is read,--PERI ChARISMATON; and by that name the fragment in
   question is actually designated in the third chapter of the (so called)
   "Apostolical Constitutions," (ta men odn prota tou logou exethemetha
   peri ton Charismaton. k.t.l.),--in which singular monument of Antiquity
   the fragment itself is also found. It is in fact nothing else but the
   first two chapters of the "Apostolical Constitutions;" of which the
   iv^th chapter is also claimed for Hippolytus, (though with evidently
   far less reason,) and as such appears in the last edition of the
   Father's collected works, (Hippolyti Romani qua ferentur omnia GrÃ¦ce,
   ed. Lagarde, 1858,)--p. 74. The work thus assigned to Hippolytus,
   (evidently on the strength of the heading,--Diataxeis ton auton hagion
   Apostolon peri cheirotonion, dia Hippolutou,) is part of the
   "Octateuchus Clementines," concerning which Lagarde has several remarks
   in the preface to his ReliquiÃ¦ Juris Ecclesiastici AntiquissimÃ¦, 1856.
   The composition in question extends from p. 5 to p. 18 of the
   last-named publication. The exact correspondence between the
   "Octateuchus Clementinus" and the Pseudo-Apostolical Constitutions will
   be found to extend no further than the single chapter (the iv^th)
   specified in the text. In the meantime the fragment peri charismaton
   (containing S. Mark xvi. 17, 18,) is identical throughout. It forms the
   first article in Lagarde's ReliquiÃ¦, extending from p. 1 to p. 4, and
   is there headed Didaskalia ton hagion Apostolon peri charismaton.

   [58] In dismissing this enumeration, let me be allowed to point out
   that there must exist many more Patristic citations which I have
   overlooked. The necessity one is under, on occasions like the present,
   of depending to a great extent on "Indices," is fatal; so scandalously
   inaccurate is almost every Index of Texts that can be named. To judge
   from the Index in Oehler's edition of Tertullian, that Father quotes
   these twelve verses not less than eight times. According to the
   Benedictine Index, Ambrose does not quote them so much as once.
   Ambrose, nevertheless, quotes five of these verses no less than
   fourteen times; while Tertullian, as far as I am able to discover, does
   not quote S. Mark xvi. 9-20 at all. Again. One hoped that the Index of
   Texts in Dindorf's new Oxford ed. of Clemens Alex. was going to remedy
   the sadly defective Index in Potter's ed. But we are still exactly
   where we were. S. John i. 3 (or 4), so remarkably quoted in vol. iii.
   433, l. 8: S. John i. 18, 50, memorably represented in vol. iii. 412,
   l. 26: S. Mark i. 13, interestingly referred to in vol. iii. 455, lines
   6, 6, 7:--are nowhere noticed in the Index. The Voice from Heaven at
   our Saviour's Baptism,--a famous misquotation (vol. i. 145, l.
   14),--does not appear in the Index of quotations from S. Matthew (iii.
   17), S. Mark (i. 11), or S. Luke (iii. 22.)

CHAPTER IV.

  THE EARLY VERSIONS EXAMINED, AND FOUND TO YIELD UNFALTERING TESTIMONY TO THE
  GENUINENESS OF THESE VERSES.

   The Peshito,--the Curetonian Syriac,--and the Recension of Thomas of
   Markel (p. 33.)--The Vulgate (p. 34)--and the Vetus Itala (p. 35)--the
   Gothic (p. 35)--and the Egyptian Versions (p. 35).--Review of the
   Evidence up to this point, (p. 36).

   IT was declared at the outset that when we are seeking to establish in
   detail the Text of the Gospels, the testimony of Manuscripts is
   incomparably the most important of all. To early Versions, the second
   place was assigned. To Patristic citations, the third. But it was
   explained that whenever (as here) the only question to be decided is
   whether a considerable portion of Scripture be genuine or not, then,
   Patristic references yield to no class of evidence in importance. To
   which statement it must now be added that second only to the testimony
   of Fathers on such occasions is to be reckoned the evidence of the
   oldest of the Versions. The reason is obvious. (a.) We know for the
   most part the approximate date of the principal ancient Versions of the
   New Testament:--(b.) Each Version is represented by at least one very
   ancient Codex:--and (c.) It may be safely assumed that Translators were
   never dependant on a single copy of the original Greek when they
   executed their several Translations. Proceed we now to ascertain what
   evidence the oldest of the Versions bear concerning the concluding
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel: and first of all for the Syriac.

   I. "Literary history," (says Mr. Scrivener,) "can hardly afford a more
   powerful case than has been established for the identity of the Version
   of the Syriac now called the Peshito' with that used by the Eastern
   Church long before the great schism had its beginning, in the native
   land of the blessed Gospel." The Peshito is referred by common consent
   to the ii^nd century of our Ã¦ra; and is found to contain the verses in
   question.

   II. This, however, is not all. Within the last thirty years, fragments
   of another very ancient Syriac translation of the Gospels, (called from
   the name of its discoverer "The Curetonian Syriac,") have come to light
   [60] : and in this translation also the verses in question are found
   [61] . This fragmentary codex is referred by Cureton to the middle of
   the v^th century. At what earlier date the Translation may have been
   executed,--as well as how much older the original Greek copy may have
   been which this translator employed,--can of course only be
   conjectured. But it is clear that we are listening to another truly
   primitive witness to the genuineness of the text now under
   consideration;--a witness (like the last) vastly more ancient than
   either the Vatican Codex B, or the Sinaitic Codex '; more ancient,
   therefore, than any Greek copy of the Gospels in existence. We shall
   not be thought rash if we claim it for the iii^rd century.

   III. Even this, however, does not fully represent the sum of the
   testimony which the Syriac language bears on this subject. Philoxenus,
   Monophysite Bishop of Mabug (Hierapolis) in Eastern Syria, caused a
   revision of the Peshito Syriac to be executed by his Chorepiscopus
   Polycarp, A.D. 508; and by the aid of three [62] approved and accurate
   Greek manuscripts, this revised version of Polycarp was again revised
   by Thomas of Hharkel, in the monastery of Antonia at Alexandria, A.D.
   616. The Hharklensian Revision, (commonly called the "Philoxenian,") is
   therefore an extraordinary monument of ecclesiastical antiquity indeed:
   for, being the Revision of a revised Translation of the New Testament
   known to have been executed from MSS. which must have been at least as
   old as the v^th century, it exhibits the result of what may be called a
   collation of copies made at a time when only four of our extant uncials
   were in existence. Here, then, is a singularly important accumulation
   of manuscript evidence on the subject of the verses which of late years
   it has become the fashion to treat as spurious. And yet, neither by
   Polycarp nor by Thomas of Hharkel, are the last twelve verses of S.
   Mark's Gospel omitted [63] .

   To these, if I do not add the "Jerusalem version,"--(as an independent
   Syriac translation of the Ecclesiastical Sections, perhaps of the v^th
   century, is called [64] ,)--it is because our fourfold Syriac evidence
   is already abundantly sufficient. In itself, it far outweighs in
   respect of antiquity anything that can be shewn on the other side. Turn
   we next to the Churches of the West.

   IV. That Jerome, at the bidding of Pope Damasus (A.D. 382), was the
   author of that famous Latin version of the Scriptures called The
   Vulgate, is known to all. It seems scarcely possible to overestimate
   the critical importance of such a work,--executed at such a
   time,--under such auspices,--and by a man of so much learning and
   sagacity as Jerome. When it is considered that we are here presented
   with the results of a careful examination of the best Greek Manuscripts
   to which a competent scholar had access in the middle of the fourth
   century,--(and Jerome assures us that he consulted several,)--we learn
   to survey with diminished complacency our own slender stores (if indeed
   any at all exist) of corresponding antiquity. It is needless to add
   that the Vulgate contains the disputed verses: that from no copy of
   this Version are they away. Now, in such a matter as this, Jerome's
   testimony is very weighty indeed.

   V. The Vulgate, however, was but the revision of a much older
   translation, generally known as the Vetus Itala. This Old Latin, which
   is of African origin and of almost Apostolic antiquity, (supposed of
   the ii^nd century,) conspires with the Vulgate in the testimony which
   it bears to the genuineness of the end of S. Mark's Gospel [65] :--an
   emphatic witness that in the African province, from the earliest time,
   no doubt whatever was entertained concerning the genuineness of these
   last twelve verses.

   The next place may well be given to the venerable version of the Gothic
   Bishop Ulphilas,--A.D. 350. Himself a Cappadocian, Ulphilas probably
   derived his copies from Asia Minor. His version is said to have been
   exposed to certain corrupting influences; but the unequivocal evidence
   which it bears to the last verses of S. Mark is at least unimpeachable,
   and must be regarded as important in the highest degree [66] . The
   oldest extant copy of the Gothic of Ulphilas is assigned to the v^th or
   early in the vi^th century: and the verses in question are there also
   met with.

   VII. and VIII. The ancient Egyptian versions call next for notice:
   their testimony being so exceedingly ancient and respectable. The
   Memphitic, or dialect of Lower Egypt, (less properly called the
   "Coptic" version), which is assigned to the iv^th or v^th century,
   contains S. Mark xvi. 9-20.--Fragments of the Thebaic, or dialect of
   Upper Egypt, (a distinct version and of considerably earlier date, less
   properly called the "Sahidic,") survive in MSS. of very nearly the same
   antiquity: and one of these fragments happily contains the last verse
   of the Gospel according to S. Mark. The Thebaic version is referred to
   the iii^rd century.

   After this mass of evidence, it will be enough to record concerning the
   Armenian version, that it yields inconstant testimony: some of the MSS.
   ending at ver. 8; others putting after these words the subscription,
   (euangelion kata Markon,) and then giving the additional verses with a
   new subscription: others going on without any break to the end. This
   version may be as old as the v^th century; but like the Ethiopic
   [iv--vii?] and the Georgian [vi?] it comes to us in codices of
   comparatively recent date. All this makes it impossible for us to care
   much for its testimony. The two last-named versions, whatever their
   disadvantages may be, at least bear constant witness to the genuineness
   of the verses in dispute.

   1. And thus we are presented with a mass of additional evidence,--so
   various, so weighty, so multitudinous, so venerable,--in support of
   this disputed portion of the Gospel, that it might well be deemed in
   itself decisive.

   2. For these Versions do not so much chew what individuals held, as
   what Churches have believed and taught concerning the sacred
   Text,--mighty Churches in Syria and Mesopotamia, in Africa and Italy,
   in Palestine and Egypt.

   3. We may here, in fact, conveniently review the progress which has
   been hitherto made in this investigation. And in order to bar the door
   against dispute and cavil, let us be content to waive the testimony of
   Papias as precarious, and that of Justin Martyr as too fragmentary to
   be decisive. Let us frankly admit that the citation of Vincentius Ã 
   Thibari at the vii^th Carthaginian Council is sufficiently inexact to
   make it unsafe to build upon it. The "Acta Pilati" and the "Apostolical
   Constitutions," since their date is somewhat doubtful, shall be claimed
   for the iv^th century only, and not for the iii^rd. And now, how will
   the evidence stand for the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?

   (a) In the v^th century, to which Codex A and Codex C are referred,
   (for Codex D is certainly later,) at least three famous Greeks and the
   most illustrious of the Latin Fathers,--(four authorities in all,)--are
   observed to recognise these verses.

   (b) In the iv^th century, (to which Codex B and Codex ' probably
   belong, five Greek writers, one Syriac, and two Latin Fathers,--besides
   the Vulgate, Gothic and Memphitic Versions,--(eleven authorities in
   all,)--testify to familiar acquaintance with this portion of S. Mark's
   Gospel.

   (c) In the iii^rd century, (and by this time MS. evidence has entirely
   forsaken us,) we find Hippolytus, the Curetonian Syriac, and the
   Thebaic Version, bearing plain testimony that at that early period, in
   at least three distinct provinces of primitive Christendom, no
   suspicion whatever attached to these verses. Lastly,--

   (d) In the find century, IrenÃ¦us, the Peshito, and the Italic Version
   as plainly attest that in Gaul, in Mesopotamia and in the African
   province, the same verses were unhesitatingly received within a century
   (more or less) of the date of the inspired autograph of the Evangelist
   himself.

   4. Thus, we are in possession of the testimony of at least six
   independent witnesses, of a date considerably anterior to the earliest
   extant Codex of the Gospels. They are all of the best class. They
   deliver themselves in the most unequivocal way. And their testimony to
   the genuineness of these Verses is unfaltering.

   5. It is clear that nothing short of direct adverse evidence of the
   weightiest kind can sensibly affect so formidable an array of
   independent authorities as this. What must the evidence be which shall
   set it entirely aside, and induce us to believe, with the most recent
   editors of the inspired Text, that the last chapter of S. Mark's
   Gospel, as it came from the hands of its inspired author, ended
   abruptly at ver. 8?

   The grounds for assuming that his "last Twelve Verses" are spurious,
   shall be exhibited in the ensuing chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] Dr. Wright informs me (1871) that some more leaves of this Version
   have just been recovered.

   [61] By a happy providence, one of the fragments contains the last four
   verses.

   [62] In the margin, against S. Matth. xxviii. 5, Thomas writes,--"In
   tribus codicibus GrÃ¦cis, et in uno Syriaco antiquÃ¦ versionis, non
   inventum est nomen, Nazarenus.'"--Cf. ad xxvii. 85.--Adler's N.T.
   Verss. Syrr., p. 97.

   [63] That among the 437 various readings and marginal notes on the
   Gospels relegated to the Philoxenian margin, should occur the worthless
   supplement which is only found besides in Cod. L. (see ch. viii.)--is
   not at all surprising. Of these 437 readings and notes, 91 are not
   found: in White's Edition; while 105 (the supplement in question being
   one of them) are found in White only. This creates a suspicion that in
   part at least the Philoxenian margin must exhibit traces of the
   assiduity of subsequent critics of the Syriac text. (So Adler on S.
   Matth. xxvi. 40.) To understand the character of some of those marginal
   notes and annotations, the reader has but to refer to Adler's learned
   work, (pp. 79-184) and examine the notes on the following places:--S.
   Matth. xv. 21: xx. 28 ( = D): xxvi. 7. S. Mk. i. 16: xii. 42. S. Lu. x.
   17 (= B D): 42 ( = B ' L): xi. 1: 63. S. Jo. ii. 1 [3] (= '): iii. 26:
   vii. 39 (partly = B): x. 8, &c. &c.

   [64] This work has at last been published in 2 vols. 4to., Verona,
   1861-4, under the following title:--Evangeliarium Hierosolymitanum ex
   Codice Vaticano Palaestino demprompsit, edidit, Latine vertit,
   Prolegomenis et Glossario adornavit, Comes Franciscus Miniscalchi
   Erizzo.

   [65] It does not sensibly detract from the value of this evidence that
   one ancient codex, the "Codex Bobbiensis" (k), which Tregelles
   describes as "a revised text, in which the influence of ancient MSS. is
   discernible," [Printed text, &c. p. 170.] and which therefore may not
   be cited in the present controversy,--exhibits after ver. 8 a Latin
   translation of the spurious words which are also found in Cod. L.

CHAPTER V.

  THE ALLEGED HOSTILE WITNESS OF CERTAIN OF THE EARLY FATHERS PROVED TO BE AN
  IMAGINATION OF THE CRITICS.

   The mistake concerning Gregory of Nyssa (p. 89).--The misconception
   concerning Eusebius (p. 41).--The oversight concerning Jerome (p.
   51);--also concerning Hesychius of Jerusalem, (or else Severus of
   Antioch) (p. 57);--and concerning Victor of Antioch (p. 59).

   IT would naturally follow to shew that manuscript evidence confirms the
   evidence of the ancient Fathers and .of the early Versions of
   Scripture. But it will be more satisfactory that I should proceed to
   examine without more delay the testimony, which, (as it is alleged,) is
   borne by a cloud of ancient Fathers against the last twelve verses of
   S. Mark. "The absence of this portion from some, from many, or from
   most copies of his Gospel, or that it was not written by S. Mark
   himself," (says Dr. Tregelles,) "is attested by Eusebius, Gregory of
   Nyasa, Victor of Antioch, Severus of Antioch, Jerome, and by later
   writers, especially Greeks [67] ." The same Fathers are appealed to by
   Dr. Davidson, who adds to the list Euthymius; and by Tischendorf and
   Alford, who add the name of Hesychius of Jerusalem. They also refer to
   "many ancient Scholia." "These verses" (says Tischendorf) "are not
   recognised by the sections of Ammonius nor by the Canons of Eusebius:
   Epiphanius and CÃ¦sarius bear witness to the fact [68] ." "In the CatenÃ¦
   on Mark" (proceeds Davidson) "the section is not explained. Nor is
   there any trace of acquaintance with it on the part of Clement of Rome
   or Clement of Alexandria;"--a remark which others have made also; as if
   it were a surprising circumstance that Clement of Alexandria, who
   appears to have no reference to the last chapter of S. Matthew's
   Gospel, should be also without any reference to the last chapter of S.
   Mark's: as if, too, it were an extraordinary, thing that Clement of
   Rome should have omitted to quote from the last chapter of S.
   Mark,--seeing that the same Clement does not quote from S. Mark's
   Gospel at all. . . . The alacrity displayed by learned writers in
   accumulating hostile evidence, is certainly worthy of a better cause.
   Strange, that their united industry should have been attended with such
   very unequal success when their object was to exhibit the evidence in
   favour of the present portion of Scripture.

   (1) Eusebius then, and (2) Jerome; (3) Gregory of Nyssa and (4)
   Hesychius of Jerusalem; (5) Severus of Antioch, (6) Victor of Antioch,
   and (7) Euthymius:--Do the accomplished critics just quoted,--Doctors
   Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Davidson, really mean to tell us that "it
   is attested" by these seven Fathers that the concluding section of S.
   Mark's Gospel "was not written by S. Mark himself?" Why, there is not
   one of them who says so: while some of them say the direct reverse. But
   let us go on. It is, I suppose, because there are Twelve Verses to be
   demolished that the list is further eked out with the names of (8)
   Ammonius, (9) Epiphanius, and (10) CÃ¦sarius,--to say nothing of (11)
   the anonymous authors of CatenÃ¦, and (12) "later writers, especially
   Greeks."

   I. I shall examine these witnesses one by one: but it will be
   convenient in the first instance to call attention to the evidence
   borne by,

   Gregory of Nyssa.

   This illustrious Father is represented as expressing himself as follows
   in his second "Homily on the Resurrection [69] :"--"In the more
   accurate copies, the Gospel according to Mark has its end at for they
   were afraid.' In some copies, however, this also is added,--Now when He
   was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary
   Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.'"

   That this testimony should have been so often appealed to as proceeding
   from Gregory of Nyssa [70] , is little to the credit of modern
   scholarship. One would have supposed that the gravity of the
   subject,--the importance of the issue,--the sacredness of Scripture,
   down to its minutest jot and tittle,--would have ensured extraordinary
   caution, and induced every fresh assailant of so considerable a portion
   of the Gospel to be very sure of his ground before reiterating what his
   predecessors had delivered. And yet it is evident that not one of the
   recent writers on the subject can have investigated this matter for
   himself. It is only due to their known ability to presume that had they
   taken ever so little pains with the foregoing quotation, they would
   have found out their mistake.

   (1.) For, in the first place, the second "Homily on the Resurrection"
   printed in the iii^rd volume of the works of Gregory of Nyssa, (and
   which supplies the critics with their quotation,) is, as every one may
   see who will take the trouble to compare them, word for word the same
   Homily which Combefis in his "Novum Auctarium," and Gallandius in his
   "Bibliotheca Patrum" printed as the work of Hesychius, and vindicated
   to that Father, respectively in 1648 and 1776 [71] . Now, if a critic
   chooses to risk his own reputation by maintaining that the Homily in
   question is indeed by Gregory of Nyssa, and is not by Hesychius,--well
   and good. But since the Homily can have had but one author, it is
   surely high time that one of these two claimants should be altogether
   dropped from this. discussion.

   (2.) Again. Inasmuch as page after page of the same Homily is observed
   to reappear, word for word, under the name of "Severus of Antioch," and
   to be unsuspiciously printed as his by Montfaucon in his "Bibliotheca
   Coisliniana" (1715), and by Cramer in his "Catena [72] "
   (1844),--although it may very reasonably become a question among
   critics whether Hesychius of Jerusalem or Severna of Antioch was the
   actual author of the Homily in question [73] , yet it is plain that
   critics must make their election between the two names; and not bring
   them both forward. No one, I say, has any right to go on quoting
   "Severus" and "Hesychius,"--as Tischendorf and Dr. Davidson are
   observed to do:--"Gregory of Nyssa" and "Severus of Antioch,"--as Dr.
   Tregelles is found to prefer.

   (3.) In short, here are three claimants for the authorship of one and
   the same Homily. To whichever of the three we assign it,--(and
   competent judges have declared that there are sufficient reasons for
   giving it to Hesychius rather than to Severus,--while no one is found
   to suppose that Gregory of Nyssa was its author,)--who will not admit
   that no further mention must be made of the other two?

   (4.) Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that henceforth the. name
   of "Gregory of Nyssa" must be banished from this discussion. So must
   the name of "Severus of Antioch." The memorable passage which
   begins,--"In the more accurate copies, the Gospel according to Mark has
   its end at for they were afraid,'"--is found in a Homily which was
   probably written by Hesychius, presbyter of Jerusalem,--a writer of the
   vi^th century. I shall have to recur to his work by-and-by. The next
   name is

   Eusebius,

   II. With respect to whom the case is altogether different. What that
   learned Father has delivered concerning the conclusion of S. Mark's
   Gospel requires to be examined with attention, and must be set forth
   much more in detail. And yet, I will so far anticipate what is about to
   be offered, as to say at once that if any one supposes that Eusebius
   has anywhere plainly "stated that it is wanted in many MSS. [74] ,"--he
   is mistaken. Eusebius nowhere says so. The reader's attention is
   invited to a plain tale.

   It was not until 1825 that the world was presented by Cardinal Angelo
   Mai [75] with a few fragmentary specimens of a lost work of Eusebius on
   the (so-called) Inconsistencies in the Gospels, from a MS. in the
   Vatican [76] . These, the learned Cardinal republished more accurately
   in 1847, in his "Nova Patrum Bibliotheca [77] ;" and hither we are
   invariably referred by those who cite Eusebius as a witness against the
   genuineness of the concluding verses of the second Gospel.

   It is much to be regretted that we are still as little as ever in
   possession of the lost work of Eusebius. It appears to have consisted
   of three Books or Parts; the former two (addressed "to Stephanus")
   being discussions of difficulties at the beginning of the Gospel,--the
   last ("to Marinus") relating to difficulties in its concluding chapters
   [78] . The Author's plan, (as usual in such works), was, first, to set
   forth a difficulty in the form of a Question; and straightway, to
   propose a Solution of it,--which commonly assumes the form of a
   considerable dissertation. But whether we are at present in possession
   of so much as a single entire specimen of these "Inquiries and
   Resolutions" exactly as it came from the pen of Eusebius, may
   reasonably be doubted. That the work which Mai has brought to light is
   but a highly condensed exhibition of the original, (and scarcely that,)
   its very title shows; for it is headed,--"An abridged selection from
   the a Inquiries and Resolutions [of difficulties] in the Gospels' by
   Eusebius [79] ." Only some of the original Questions, therefore, are
   here noticed at all: and even these have been subjected to so severe a
   process of condensation and abridgment, that in some instances
   amputation would probably be a more fitting description of what has
   taken place. Accordingly, what were originally two Books or Parts, are
   at present represented by XVI. "Inquiries," &c., addressed "to
   Stephanus;" while the concluding Book or Part is represented by IV.
   more, "to Marinus,"--of which, the first relates to our Lord's
   appearing to Mary Magdalene after His Resurrection. Now, since the work
   which Eusebius addressed to Marinus is found to have contained
   "Inquiries, with their Resolutions, concerning our Saviour's Death and
   Resurrection [80] ,"--while a quotation professing to be derived from
   "the thirteenth chapter" relates to Simon the Cyrenian bearing our
   Saviour's Cross [81] ;--it is obvious that the original work must have
   been very considerable, and that what Mai has recovered gives an
   utterly inadequate idea of its extent and importance [82] . It is
   absolutely necessary that all this should be clearly apprehended by any
   one who desires to know exactly what the alleged evidence of Eusebius
   concerning the last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel is worth,--as I will
   explain more fully by-and-by. Let it, however, be candidly admitted
   that there seems to be no reason for supposing that whenever the lost
   work of Eusebius comes to light, (and it has been seen within about 300
   years [83] ) it will exhibit anything essentially different from what
   is contained in the famous passage which has given rise to so much
   debate, and which may be exhibited in English as follows. It is put in
   the form of a reply to one "Marinus," who is represented as asking,
   first, the following question:--

   "How is it, that, according to Matthew [xxviii. 1], the Saviour appears
   to have risen in the end of the Sabbath;' but, according to Mark [xvi.
   9], early the first day of the week'?"--Eusebius answers,

   "This difficulty admits of a twofold solution. He who is for getting
   rid of the entire passage [84] , will say that it is not met with in
   all the copies of Mark's Gospel: the accurate copies, at all events,
   making the end of Mark's narrative come after the words of the young
   man who appeared to the women and said, Fear not ye! Ye seek Jesus of
   Nazareth,' &c.: to which the Evangelist adds,--And when they heard it,
   they fled, and said nothing to any man, for they were afraid.' For at
   those words, in almost all copies of the Gospel according to Mark,
   comes the end. What follows, (which is met with seldom, [and only] in
   some copies, certainly not in all,) might be dispensed with; especially
   if it should prove to contradict the record of the other Evangelists.
   This, then, is what a person will say who is for evading and entirely
   getting rid of a gratuitous problem.

   "But another, on no account daring to reject anything whatever which
   is, under whatever circumstances, met with in the text of the Gospels,
   will say that here are two readings, (as is so often the case
   elsewhere;) and that both are to be received,--inasmuch as by the
   faithful and pious, this reading is not held to be genuine rather than
   that; nor that than this."

   It will be best to exhibit the whole of what Eusebius has written on
   this subject,--as far as we are permitted to know it,--continuously. He
   proceeds:--

   "Well then, allowing this piece to be really genuine, our business is
   to interpret the sense of the passage [85] . And certainly, if I divide
   the meaning into two, we shall find that it is not opposed to what
   Matthew says of our Saviour's having risen in the end of the Sabbath.'
   For Mark's expression, (Now when He was risen early the first day of
   the week,' ) we shall read with a pause, putting a comma after Now when
   He was risen,' --the sense of the words which follow being kept
   separate. Thereby, we shall refer [Mark's] when He was risen' to
   Matthew's in the end of the Sabbath,' (for it was then that He rose);
   and all that comes after, expressive as it is of a distinct notion, we
   shall connect with what follows; (for it was early, the first day of
   the week,' that He appeared to Mary Magdalene.') This is in fact what
   John also declares; for he too has recorded that early,' the first day
   of the week,' [Jesus] appeared to the Magdalene. Thus then Mark also
   says that He appeared to her early: not that He rose early, but long
   before, (according to that of Matthew, in the end of the Sabbath:' for
   though He rose then, He did not appear to Mary then, but early.') In a
   word, two distinct seasons are set before us by these words: first, the
   season of the Resurrection,--which was in the end of the Sabbath?
   secondly, the season of our Saviour's Appearing,--which was early.' The
   former [86] , Mark writes of when he says, (it requires to be read with
   a pause,)--Now, when He was risen.' Then, after a comma, what follows
   is to be spoken,--Early, the first day of the week, He appeared to Mary
   Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils [87] '"--Such is the
   entire passage. Little did the learned writer anticipate what bitter
   fruit his words were destined to bear!

   1. Let it be freely admitted that what precedes is calculated at first
   sight to occasion nothing but surprise and perplexity. For, in the
   first place, there really is no problem to solve. The discrepancy
   suggested by "Marinus" at the outset, is plainly imaginary, the result
   (chiefly) of a strange misconception of the meaning of the Evangelist's
   Greek,--as in fact no one was ever better aware than Eusebius himself.
   "These places of the Gospels would never have occasioned any
   difficulty," he writes in the very next page, (but it is the
   commencement of his reply to the second question of Marinus,)--"if
   people would but abstain from assuming that Matthew's phrase (opse
   sabbaton) refers to the evening of the Sabbath-day: whereas, (in
   conformity with the established idiom of the language,) it obviously
   refers to an advanced period of the ensuing night [88] ." He
   proceeds:--"The self-same moment therefore, or very nearly the
   self-same, is intended by the Evangelists, only under different names:
   and there is no discrepancy whatever between Matthew's,--in the end of
   the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,' and
   John's--The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalen early, when it
   was yet dark.' The Evangelists indicate by different expressions one
   and the same moment of time, but in a broad and general way." And yet,
   if Eusebius knew all this so well, why did he not say so at once, and
   close the discussion? I really cannot tell; except on one
   hypothesis,--which, although at first it may sound somewhat
   extraordinary, the more I think of the matter, recommends itself to my
   acceptance the more. I suspect, then, that the discussion we have just
   been listening to, is, essentially, not an original production: but
   that Eusebius, having met with the suggestion in some older writer, (in
   Origen probably,) reproduced it in language of his own,--doubtless
   because he thought it ingenious and interesting, but not by any means
   because he regarded it as true. Except on some such theory, I am
   utterly unable to understand how Eusebius can have written so
   inconsistently. His admirable remarks just quoted, are obviously a full
   and sufficient answer,--the proper answer in fact,--to the proposed
   difficulty: and it is a memorable circumstance that the ancients
   generally were so sensible of this, that they are found to have
   invariably [89] substituted what Eusebius wrote in reply to the second
   question of Marinus for what he wrote in reply to the first; in other
   words, for the dissertation which is occasioning us all this
   difficulty.

   2. But next, even had the discrepancy been real, the remedy for it
   which is here proposed, and which is advocated with such tedious
   emphasis, would probably prove satisfactory to no one. In fact, the
   entire method advocated in the foregoing passage is hopelessly vicious.
   The writer begins by advancing statements which, if he believed them to
   be true, he must have known are absolutely fatal to the verses in
   question. This done, he sets about discussing the possibility of
   reconciling an isolated expression in S. Mark's Gospel with another in
   S. Matthew's: just as if on that depended the genuineness or
   spuriousness of the entire context: as if, in short, the major premiss
   in the discussion were some such postulate as the following:--"Whatever
   in one Gospel cannot be proved to be entirely consistent with something
   in another Gospel, is not to be regarded as genuine." Did then the
   learned Archbishop of CÃ¦sarea really suppose that a comma judiciously
   thrown into the empty scale might at any time suffice to restore the
   equilibrium, and even counterbalance the adverse testimony of almost
   every MS. of the Gospels extant F Why does he not at least deny the
   truth of the alleged facts to which lie began by giving currency, if
   not approval; and which, so long as they are allowed to stand
   uncontradicted, render all further argumentation on the subject simply
   nugatory P As before, I really cannot tell,--except on the hypothesis
   which has been already hazarded.

   3. Note also, (for this is not the least extraordinary feature of the
   case,) what vague and random statements those are which we have been
   listening to. The entire section (S. Mark xvi. 9-20,) "is not met with
   in all the copies:" at all events not "in the accurate" ones. Nay, it
   is "met with seldom." In fact, it is absent from "almost all" copies.
   But,--Which of these four statements is to stand P The first is
   comparatively unimportant. Not so the second. The last two, on the
   contrary, would be absolutely fatal,--if trustworthy? But are they
   trustworthy?

   To this question only one answer can be returned. The exaggeration is
   so gross that it refutes itself. Had it been merely asserted that the
   verses in question were wanting in many of the copies,--even had it
   been insisted that the best copies were without them,--well and good:
   but to assert that, in the beginning of the fourth century, from
   "almost all" copies of the Gospels they were away,--is palpably untrue.
   What had become then of the MSS. from which the Syriac, the Latin, all
   the ancient Versions were made? How is the contradictory evidence of
   every copy of the Gospels in existence but two to be accounted for?
   With IrenÃ¦us and Hippolytus, with the old Latin and the Vulgate, with
   the Syriac, and the Gothic, and the Egyptian versions to refer to, we
   are able to assert that the author of such a statement was guilty of
   monstrous exaggeration. We are reminded of the loose and random way in
   which the Fathers,--(giants in Interpretation, but very children in the
   Science of Textual Criticism,)--are sometimes observed to speak about
   the state of the Text in their days. We are reminded, for instance, of
   the confident assertion of an ancient Critic that the true reading in
   S. Luke xxiv. 13 is not "three-score" but "an hundred and three-score;"
   for that so "the accurate copies" used to read the place, besides
   Origen and Eusebius. And yet (as I have elsewhere explained) the
   reading hekaton kai hexekonta is altogether impossible. "Apud nos mixta
   sunt omnia," is Jerome's way of adverting to an evil which, serious as
   it was, was yet not nearly so great as he represents; viz. the
   unauthorized introduction into one Gospel of what belongs of right to
   another. And so in a multitude of other instances. The Fathers are, in
   fact, constantly observed to make critical remarks about the ancient
   copies which simply cannot be correct.

   And yet the author of the exaggeration under review, be it observed, is
   clearly not Eusebius. It is evident that he has nothing to say against
   the genuineness of the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel. Those random
   statements about the copies with which he began, do not even purport to
   express his own sentiments. Nay, Eusebius in a manner repudiates them;
   for he introduces them with a phrase which separates them from himself:
   and, "This then is what a person will say,"--is the remark with which
   he finally dismisses them. It would, in fact, be to make this learned
   Father stultify himself to suppose that he proceeds gravely to discuss
   a portion of Scripture which he had already deliberately rejected as
   spurious. But, indeed, the evidence before us effectually precludes any
   such supposition. "Here are two readings," he says, "(as is so often
   the case elsewhere:) both of which are to be received,--inasmuch as by
   the faithful and pious, this reading is not held to be genuine rather
   than that; nor that than this." And thus we seem to be presented with
   the actual opinion of Eusebius, as far as it can be ascertained from
   the present passage,--if indeed he is to be thought here to offer any
   personal opinion on the subject at all; which, for my own part, I
   entirely doubt. But whether we are at liberty to infer the actual
   sentiments of this Father from anything here delivered or not, quite
   certain at least is it that to print only the first half of the
   passage, (as Tischendorf and Tregelles have done,) and then to give the
   reader to understand that he is reading the adverse testimony of
   Eusebius as to the genuineness of the end of S. Mark's Gospel, is
   nothing else but to misrepresent the facts of the case; and, however
   unintentionally, to deceive those who are unable to verify the
   quotation for themselves.

   It has been urged indeed that Eusebius cannot have recognised the
   verses in question as genuine, because a scholium purporting to be his
   has been cited by Matthaei from a Catena at Moscow, in which he appears
   to assert that "according to Mark," our Saviour "is not recorded to
   have appeared to His Disciples after His Resurrection:" whereas in S.
   Mark xvi. 14 it is plainly recorded that "Afterwards He appeared unto
   the Eleven as they sat at meat." May I be permitted to declare that I
   am distrustful of the proposed inference, and shall continue to feel
   so, until I know something more about the scholium in question? Up to
   the time when this page is printed I have not succeeded in obtaining
   from Moscow the details I wish for: but they must be already on the
   way, and I propose to embody the result in a "Postscript" which shall
   form the last page of the Appendix to the present volume.

   Are we then to suppose that there was no substratum of truth in the
   allegations to which Eusebius gives such prominence in the passage
   under discussion? By no means. The mutilated state of S. Mark's Gospel
   in the Vatican Codex (B) and especially in the Sinaitic Codex (')
   sufficiently establishes the contrary. Let it be freely conceded, (but
   in fact it has been freely conceded already,) that there must have
   existed in the time of Eusebius many copies of S. Mark's Gospel which
   were without the twelve concluding verses. I do but insist that there
   is nothing whatever in that circumstance to lead us to entertain one
   serious doubt as to the genuineness of these verses. I am but concerned
   to maintain that there is nothing whatever in the evidence which has
   hitherto come before us,--certainly not in the evidence of
   Eusebius,--to induce us to believe that they are a spurious addition to
   S. Mark's Gospel.

   III. We have next to consider what

   Jerome

   has delivered on this subject. So great a name must needs command
   attention in any question of Textual Criticism: and it is commonly
   pretended that Jerome pronounces emphatically against the genuineness
   of the last twelve verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark. A little
   attention to the actual testimony borne by this Father will, it is
   thought, suffice to exhibit it in a wholly unexpected light; and induce
   us to form an entirely different estimate of its practical bearing upon
   the present discussion.

   It will be convenient that I should premise that it is in one of his
   many exegetical Epistles that Jerome discusses this matter. A lady
   named Hedibia, inhabiting the furthest extremity of Gaul, and known to
   Jerome only by the ardour of her piety, had sent to prove him with hard
   questions. He resolves her difficulties from Bethlehem [90] : and I may
   be allowed to remind the reader of what is found to have been Jerome's
   practice on similar occasions,--which, to judge from his writings, were
   of constant occurrence. In fact, Apodemius, who brought Jerome the
   Twelve problems from Hedibia, brought him Eleven more from a noble
   neighbour of hers, Algasia [91] . Once, when a single messenger had
   conveyed to him out of the African province a quantity of similar
   interrogatories, Jerome sent two Egyptian monks the following account
   of how he had proceeded in respect of the inquiry,--(it concerned 1
   Cor. xv. 51,)--which they had addressed to him:--"Being pressed for
   time, I have presented you with the opinions of all the Commentators;
   for the most part, translating their very words; in order both to get
   rid of your question, and to put you in possession of ancient
   authorities on the subject." This learned Father does not even profess
   to have been in the habit of delivering his own opinions, or speaking
   his own sentiments on such occasions. "This has been hastily dictated,"
   he says in conclusion,--(alluding to his constant practice, which was
   to dictate, rather than to write,)--"in order that I might lay before
   you what have been the opinions of learned men on this subject, as well
   as the arguments by which they have recommended their opinions. My own
   authority, (who am but nothing,) is vastly inferior to that of our
   predecessors in the Lord." Then, after special commendation of the
   learning of Origen and Eusebius, and the valuable Scriptural
   expositions of many more, "My plan," (he says,) "is to read the
   ancients; to prove all things, to hold fast that which is good; and to
   abide stedfast in the faith of the Catholic Church.--I must now dictate
   replies, either original or at second-hand, to other Questions which
   lie before me [92] ." We are not surprised, after this straightforward
   avowal of what was the method on such occasions with this learned
   Father, to discover that, instead of hearing Jerome addressing
   Hedibia,--(who had interrogated him concerning the very problem which
   is at present engaging our attention,)--we find ourselves only
   listening to Eusebius over again, addressing Marinus.

   "This difficulty admits of a two-fold solution," Jerome begins as if
   determined that no doubt shall be entertained as to the source of his
   inspiration. Then, (making short work of the tedious disquisition of
   Eusebius,)--"Either we shall reject the testimony of Mark, which is met
   with in scarcely any copies of the Gospel,--almost all the Greek
   codices being without this passage:--(especially since it seems to
   narrate what contradicts the other Gospels:)--or else, we shall reply
   that both Evangelists state what is true: Matthew, when he says that
   our LORD rose late in the week:' Mark,--when he says that Mary
   Magdalene saw Him early, the first day of the week.' For the passage
   must be thus pointed,--When He was risen:' and presently, after a
   pause, must be added,--Early, the first day of the week, He appeared to
   Mary Magdalene.' He therefore who had risen late in the week, according
   to Matthew,--Himself, early the first day of the week, according to
   Mark, appeared to Mary Magdalene. And this is what John also means,
   shewing that it was early on the next day that He appeared."--To
   understand how faithfully in what precedes Jerome treads in the
   footsteps of Eusebius, it is absolutely necessary to set the Latin of
   the one over against the Greek of the other, and to compare them. In
   order to facilitate this operation, I have subjoined both originals at
   foot of the page: from which it will be apparent that Jerome is here
   not so much adopting the sentiments of Eusebius as simply translating
   his words [93] .

   This, however, is not by any means the strangest feature of the case.
   That Jerome should have availed himself ever so freely of the materials
   which he found ready to his hand in the pages of Eusebius cannot be
   regarded as at all extraordinary, after what we have just heard from
   himself of his customary method of proceeding. It would of course have
   suggested the gravest doubts as to whether we were here listening to
   the personal sentiment of this Father, or not; but that would have been
   all. What are we to think, however, of the fact that Hedibia's question
   to Jerome proves on inspection to be nothing more than a translation of
   the very question which Marinus had long before addressed to Eusebius?
   We read on, perplexed at the coincidence; and speedily make the notable
   discovery that her next question, and her next, are also translations
   word for word of the next two of Marinus. For the proof of this
   statement the reader is again referred to the foot of the page [94] .
   It is at least decisive: and the fact, which admits of only one
   explanation, can be attended by only one practical result. It of course
   shelves the whole question as far as the evidence of Jerome is
   concerned. Whether Hedibia was an actual personage or not, let those
   decide who have considered more attentively than it has ever fallen in
   my way to do that curious problem,--What was the ancient notion of the
   allowable in Fiction? That different ideas have prevailed in different
   ages of the world as to where fiction ends and fabrication
   begins;--that widely discrepant views are entertained on the subject
   even in our own age;--all must be aware. I decline to investigate the
   problem on the present occasion. I do but claim to have established
   beyond the possibility of doubt or cavil that what we are here
   presented with is not the testimony of Jerome at all. It is evident
   that this learned Father amused himself with translating for the
   benefit of his Latin readers a part of the (lost) work of Eusebius;
   (which, by the way, he is found to have possessed in the same abridged
   form in which it has come down to ourselves:)--and he seems to have
   regarded it as allowable to attribute to "Hedibia" the problems which
   he there met with. (He may perhaps have known that Eusebius before him
   had attributed them, with just as little reason, to "Marinus.") In that
   age, for aught that appears to the contrary, it may have been regarded
   as a graceful compliment to address solutions of Scripture difficulties
   to persons of distinction, who possibly had never heard of those
   difficulties before; and even to represent the Interrogatories which
   suggested them as originating with themselves. I offer this only in the
   way of suggestion, and am not concerned to defend it. The only point I
   am concerned to establish is that Jerome is here a translator, not an
   original author: in other words, that it is Eusebius who here speaks,
   and not Jerome. For a critic to pretend that it is in any sense the
   testimony of Jerome which we are here presented with; that Jerome is
   one of those Fathers "who, even though they copied from their
   predecessors, were yet competent to transmit the record of a fact [95]
   ,"--is entirely to misunderstand the case. The man who translates,--not
   adopts, but translates,--the problem as well as its solution: who
   deliberately asserts that it emanated from a Lady inhabiting the
   furthest extremity of Gaul, who nevertheless was demonstrably not its
   author: who goes on to propose as hers question after question verbatim
   as he found them written in the pages of Eusebius; and then resolves
   them one by one in the very language of the same Father:--such a writer
   has clearly conducted us into a region where his individual
   responsibility quite disappears from sight. We must hear no more about
   Jerome, therefore, as a witness against the genuineness of the
   concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel.

   On the contrary. Proof is at hand that Jerome held these verses to be
   genuine. The proper evidence of this is supplied by the fact that he
   gave them a place in his revision of the old Latin version of the
   Scriptures. If he had been indeed persuaded of their absence from
   "almost all the Greek codices," does any one imagine that he would have
   suffered them to stand in the Vulgate? If he had met with them in
   "scarcely any copies of the Gospel,"--do men really suppose that he
   would yet have retained them? To believe this would, again, be to
   forget what was the known practice of this Father; who, because he
   found the expression "without a cause" (eike,--S. Matth. v. 22,) only
   "in certain of his codices," but not "in the true ones," omitted it
   from the Vulgate. Because, however, he read "righteousness" (where we
   read "alms") in S. Matth. vi. 1, he exhibits "justitiam" in his
   revision of the old Latin version. On the other hand, though he knew of
   MSS. (as he expressly relates) which read "works" for "children" (ergon
   for teknon) in S. Matth. xi. 19, he does not admit that (manifestly
   corrupt) reading,--which, however, is found both in the Codex Vaticanus
   and the Codex Sinaiticus. Let this suffice. I forbear to press the
   matter further. It is an additional proof that Jerome accepted the
   conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel that he actually quotes it, and on more
   than one occasion: but to prove this, is to prove more than is here
   required [96] . I am concerned only to demolish the assertion of
   Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and Alford, and Davidson, and so many more,
   concerning the testimony of Jerome; and I have demolished it. I pass
   on, claiming to have shewn that the name of Jerome as an adverse
   witness must never again appear in this discussion.

   IV. and V. But now, while the remarks of Eusebius are yet fresh in the
   memory, the reader is invited to recal for a moment what the author of
   the "Homily on the Resurrection," contained in the works of Gregory of
   Nyssa (above, p. 39), has delivered on the same subject. It will be
   remembered that we saw reason for suspecting that not

   Severus of Antioch, but
   Hesychius of Jerusalem

   (both of them writers of the vi^th century,) has the better claim to
   the authorship of the Homily in question [97] ,--which, however, cannot
   at all events be assigned to the illustrious Bishop of Nyssa, the
   brother of Basil the Great. "In the more accurate copies," (says this
   writer,) "the Gospel according to Mark has its end at for they were
   afraid.' In some copies, however, this also is added,--Now when He was
   risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary
   Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.' This, however, seems
   to contradict to some extent what we before delivered; for since it
   happens that the hour of the night when our Saviour rose is not known,
   how does it come to be here written that He rose early?' But the saying
   will prove to be no ways contradictory, if we read with skill. We must
   be careful intelligently to introduce a comma after, Now when He was
   risen:' and then to proceed,--Early in the Sabbath He appeared first to
   Mary Magdalene:' in order that when He was risen' may refer (in
   conformity with what Matthew says) to the foregoing season; while
   early' is connected with the appearance to Mary." [98] --I presume it
   would be to abuse a reader's patience to offer any remarks on all this.
   If a careful perusal of the foregoing passage does not convince him
   that Hesychius is here only reproducing what he had, read in Eusebius,
   nothing that I can say will .persuade him of the fact. The words indeed
   are by no means the same; but the sense is altogether identical. He
   seems to have also known the work of Victor of Antioch. However, to
   remove all doubt from the reader's mind that the work of Eusebius was
   in the hands of Hesychius while he wrote, I have printed in two
   parallel columns and transferred to the Appendix what must needs be
   conclusive [99] ; for it will be seen that the terms are only not
   identical in which Eusebius and Hesychius discuss that favourite
   problem with the ancients,--the consistency of S. Matthew's opse ton
   sabbaton with the proi of S. Mark.

   It is, however, only needful to read through the Homily in question to
   see that it is an attempt to weave into one piece a quantity of foreign
   and incongruous materials. It is in fact not a Homily at all, (though
   it has been thrown into that form;) but a Dissertation,--into which,
   Hesychius, (who is known to have been very curious in questions of that
   kind [100] ,) is observed to introduce solutions of most of those
   famous difficulties which cluster round the sepulchre of the world's
   Redeemer on the morning of the first Easter Day [101] ; and which the
   ancients seem to have delighted in discussing,--as, the number of the
   Marys who visited the sepulchre; the angelic appearances on the morning
   of the Resurrection; and above all the seeming discrepancy, already
   adverted to, in the Evangelical notices of the time at which our Lord
   rose from the dead. .I need not enter more particularly into an
   examination of this (so-called) Homily': but I must not dismiss it
   without pointing out that its author at all events cannot be thought to
   have repudiated the concluding verses of S. Mark: for at the end of his
   discourse, he quotes the 19th verse entire, without hesitation, in
   confirmation of one of his statements, and declares that the words are
   written by S. Mark [102] .

   I shall not be thought unreasonable, therefore, if I contend that
   Hesychius is no longer to be cited as a witness in this behalf: if I
   point out that it is entirely to misunderstand and misrepresent the
   case to quote a passing allusion of his to what Eusebius had long
   before delivered on the same subject, as if it exhibited his own
   individual teaching. It is demonstrable [103] that he is not bearing
   testimony to the condition of the MSS. of S. Mark's Gospel in his own
   ago: neither, indeed, is he bearing testimony at all. He is simply
   amusing himself, (in what is found to have been his favourite way,)
   with reconciling an apparent discrepancy in the Gospels; and he does it
   by adopting certain remarks of Eusebius. Living so late as the vi^th
   century; conspicuous neither for his judgment nor his learning; a
   copyist only, so far as his remarks on the last verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel are concerned;--this writer does not really deserve the space
   and attention we have been compelled to bestow upon him.

   VI. We may conclude, by inquiring for the evidence borne by

   Victor of Antioch.

   And from the familiar style in which this Father's name is always
   introduced into the present discussion, no less than from the
   invariable practice of assigning to him the date "A.D. 401," it might
   be supposed that "Victor of Antioch" is a well-known personage. Yet is
   there scarcely a Commentator of antiquity about whom less is certainly
   known. Clinton (who enumerates cccxxii "Ecclesiastical Authors" from
   A.D. 70 to A.D. 685 [104] ) does not even record his name. The recent
   "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography" is just as silent concerning
   him. Cramer (his latest editor) calls his very existence in question;
   proposing to attribute his Commentary on S. Mark to Cyril of Alexandria
   [105] . Not to delay the reader needlessly,--Victor of Antioch is an
   interesting and unjustly neglected Father of the Church; whose
   date,--(inasmuch as he apparently quotes sometimes from Cyril of
   Alexandria who died A.D. 444, and yet seems to have written soon after
   the death of Chrysostom, which took place A.D. 407), may be assigned to
   the first half of the fifth century,--suppose A.D. 425-450. And in
   citing him I shall always refer to the best (and most easily
   accessible) edition of his work,--that of Cramer (1840) in the first
   volume of his "Catenae."

   But a far graver charge is behind. From the confident air in which
   Victor's authority is appealed to by those who deem the last twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel spurious, it would of course be inferred
   that his evidence is hostile to the verses in question; whereas his
   evidence to their genuineness is the most emphatic and extraordinary on
   record. Dr. Tregelles asserts that "his testimony to the absence of
   these twelve verses from some or many copies, stands in contrast to his
   own opinion on the subject" But Victor delivers no "opinion:" and his
   "testimony" is the direct reverse of what Dr. Tregelles asserts it to
   be. This learned and respected critic has strangely misapprehended the
   evidence [106] .

   I must needs be brief in this place. I shall therefore confine myself
   to those facts concerning "Victor of Antioch," or rather concerning his
   work, which are necessary for the purpose in hand [107] .

   Now, his Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel,--as all must see who will be
   at the pains to examine it, is to a great extent a compilation. The
   same thing may be said, no doubt, to some extent, of almost every
   ancient Commentary in existence. But I mean, concerning this particular
   work, that it proves to have been the author's plan not so much to give
   the general results of his acquaintance with the writings of Origen,
   Apollinarius, Theodorus of Mopsuestia, Eusebius, and Chrysostom; as,
   with or without acknowledgment, to transcribe largely (but with great
   license) from one or other of these writers. Thus, the whole of his
   note on S. Mark xv. 38, 39, is taken, without any hint that it is not
   original, (much of it, word for word,) from Chrysostom's 88th Homily on
   S. Matthew's Gospel [108] . The same is to be said of the first twelve
   lines of his note on S. Mark xvi. 9. On the other hand, the latter half
   of the note last mentioned professes to give the substance of what
   Eusebius had written on the same subject. It is in fact an extract from
   those very "Quaestiones ad Marinum" concerning which so much has been
   offered already. All this, though it does not sensibly detract from the
   interest or the value of Victor's work, must be admitted entirely to
   change the character of his supposed evidence. He comes before us
   rather in the light of a Compiler than of an Author: his work is rather
   a "Catena" than a Commentary; and as such in fact it is generally
   described. Quite plain is it, at all events, that the sentiments
   contained in the sections last referred to, are not Victor's at all.
   For one half of them, no one but Chrysostom is responsible; for the
   other half, no one but Eusebius.

   But it is Victor's familiar use of the writings of
   Eusebius,--especially of those Resolutions of hard Questions
   "concerning the seeming Inconsistencies in the Evangelical accounts of
   the Resurrection," which Eusebius addressed to Marinus,--on which the
   reader's attention is now to be concentrated. Victor cites that work of
   Eusebius by name in the very first page of his Commentary. That his
   last page also contains a quotation from it, (also by name), has been
   already pointed out [109] . Attention is now invited to what is found
   concerning S. Mark xvi. 9-20 in the last page but one (p. 444) of
   Victor's work. It shall be given in English; because I will convince
   unlearned as well as learned readers. Victor, (after quoting four lines
   from the 89^th Homily of Chrysostom [110] ), reconciles (exactly as
   Eusebius is observed to do [111] ) the notes of time contained
   severally in S. Matth. xxviii. 1, S. Mark xvi. 2, S. Luke xxiv. 1, and
   S. John xx. 1. After which, he proceeds as follows:--

   "In certain copies of Mark's Gospel, next comes,--Now when [Jesus] was
   risen early the first day of the week, He appeared to Mary
   Magdalene;'--a statement which seems inconsistent with Matthew's
   narrative. This might be met by asserting, that the conclusion of
   Mark's Gospel, though found in certain copies, is spurious, However,
   that we may not seem to betake ourselves to an off-hand answer, we
   propose to read the place thus:--Now when [Jesus] was risen:' then,
   after a comma, to go on--early the first day of the week He appeared to
   Mary Magdalene.' In this way we refer [Mark's] Now when [Jesus] was
   risen' to Matthew's in the end of the sabbath,' (for then we believe
   Him to have risen;) and all that comes after, expressive as it is of a
   different notion, we connect with what follows. Mark relates that He
   who arose (according to Matthew) in the end of the Sabbath,' was seen
   by Mary Magdalene early.' This is in fact what John also declares; for
   he too has recorded that early,' the first day of the week,' [Jesus]
   appeared to the Magdalene. In a word, two distinct seasons are set
   before us by these words: first, the season of the Resurrection,--which
   was in the end of the Sabbath;' secondly, the season of our Saviour's
   Appearing,--which was early [112] .'"

   No one, I presume, can read this passage and yet hesitate to admit that
   he is here listening to Eusebius "ad Marinum" over again. But if any
   one really retains a particle of doubt on the subject, he is requested
   to cast his eye to the foot of the present page; and even an unlearned
   reader, surveying the originals with attention, may easily convince
   himself that Victor is here nothing else but a copyist [113] . That the
   work in which Eusebius reconciles "seeming discrepancies in the
   Evangelical narratives," was actually lying open before Victor while be
   wrote, is ascertained beyond dispute. He is observed in his next
   ensuing Comment to quote from it, and to mention Eusebius as its
   author. At the end of the present note he has a significant allusion to
   Eusebius:-- "I know very well," he says, "what has been suggested by
   those who are at the pains to remove the apparent inconsistencies in
   this place [114] ." But when writing on S. Mark xvi. 9-20, he does
   more. After abridging, (as his manner is,) what Eusebius explains with
   such tedious emphasis, (giving the substance of five columns in about
   three times as many lines,) he adopts the exact expressions of
   Eusebius,--follows him in his very mistakes,--and finally transcribes
   his words. The reader is therefore requested to bear in mind that what
   he has been listening to is not the testimony of Victor at all: but the
   testimony of Eusebius. This is but one more echo therefore of a passage
   of which we are all beginning by this time to be weary; so exceedingly
   rash are the statements with which it is introduced, so utterly
   preposterous the proposed method of remedying a difficulty which proves
   after all to be purely imaginary.

   What then is the testimony of Victor? Does he offer any independent
   statement on the question in dispute, from which his own private
   opinion (though nowhere stated) may be lawfully inferred? Yes indeed.
   Victor, though frequently a Transcriber only, is observed every now and
   then to come forward in his own person, and deliver his individual
   sentiment [115] . But nowhere throughout his work does he deliver such
   remarkable testimony as in this place. Hear him!

   "Notwithstanding that in very many copies of the present Gospel, the
   passage beginning, Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first day of
   the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene,' be not found,--(certain
   individuals having supposed it to be spurious,)--yet WE, at all events,
   inasmuch as in very many we have discovered it to exist, have, out of
   accurate copies, subjoined also the account of our Lord's Ascension,
   (following the words for they were afraid,' ) in conformity with the
   Palestinian exemplar of Mark which exhibits the Gospel verity: that is
   to say, from the words, Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first day
   of the week,' &c., down to with signs following. Amen [116] ."--And
   with these words Victor of Antioch brings his Commentary on S. Mark to
   an end.

   Here then we find it roundly stated by a highly intelligent Father,
   writing in the first half of the v^th century,--

   (1.) That the reason why the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark are absent
   from some ancient copies of his Gospel is because they have been
   deliberately omitted by Copyists:

   (2.) That the ground for such omission was the subjective judgment of
   individuals,--not the result of any appeal to documentary evidence.
   Victor, therefore, clearly held that the Verses in question had been
   expunged in consequence of their (seeming) inconsistency with what is
   met with in the other Gospels:

   (3.) That he, on the other hand, had convinced himself by reference to
   "very many" and "accurate" copies, that the verses in question are
   genuine:

   (4.) That in particular the Palestinian Copy, which enjoyed the
   reputation of "exhibiting the genuine text of S. Mark," contained the
   Verses in dispute.--To Opinion, therefore, Victor opposes Authority. He
   makes his appeal to the most trustworthy documentary evidence with
   which he is acquainted; and the deliberate testimony which he delivers
   is a complete counterpoise and antidote to the loose phrases of
   Eusebius on the same subject:

   (5.) That in consequence of all this, following the Palestinian
   Exemplar, he had from accurate copies furnished his own work with the
   Twelve Verses in dispute;--which is a categorical refutation of the
   statement frequently met with that the work of Victor of Antioch is
   without them.

   We are now at liberty to sum up; and to review the progress which has
   been hitherto made in this Inquiry.

   Six Fathers of the Church have been examined who are commonly
   represented as bearing hostile testimony to the last Twelve Verses of
   S. Mark's Gospel; and they have been easily reduced to one. Three of
   them, (Hesychius, Jerome, Victor,) prove to be echoes, not voices. The
   remaining two, (Gregory of Nyssa and Severus,) are neither voices nor
   echoes, but merely names: Gregory of Nyssa having really no more to do
   with this discussion than Philip of Macedon; and "Severus" and
   "Hesychius" representing one and the same individual. Only by a Critic
   seeking to mislead his reader will any one of these five Fathers be in
   future cited as witnessing against the genuineness of S. Mark xvi.
   9-20. Eusebius is the solitary witness who survives the ordeal of exact
   inquiry [117] . But,

   I. Eusebius, (as we have seen), instead of proclaiming his distrust of
   this portion of the Gospel, enters upon an elaborate proof that its
   contents are not inconsistent with what is found in the Gospels of S.
   Matthew and S. John. His testimony is reducible to two innocuous and
   wholly unconnected propositions: the first,--That there existed in his
   day a vast number of copies in which the last chapter of S. Mark's
   Gospel ended abruptly at ver. 8; (the correlative of which of course
   would be that there also existed a vast number which were furnished
   with the present ending.) The second,--That by putting a comma after
   the word Anastas, S. Mark xvi. 9, is capable of being reconciled with
   S. Matth. xxviii. 1 [118] . . . . . I profess myself unable to
   understand how it can be pretended that Eusebius would have subscribed
   to the opinion of Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest, that the Gospel
   of S. Mark was never finished by its inspired Author, or was mutilated
   before it came abroad; at all events, that the last Twelve Verses are
   spurious.

   II. The observations of Eusebius are found to have been adopted, and in
   part transcribed, by an unknown writer of the vi^th century,--whether
   Hesychius or Severus is not certainly known: but if it were Hesychius,
   then it was not Severus; if Severus, then not Hesychius. This writer,
   however, (whoever he may have been,) is careful to convince us that
   individually he entertained no doubt whatever about the genuineness of
   this part of Scripture, for he says that he writes in order to remove
   the (hypothetical) objections of others, and to silence their
   (imaginary) doubts. Nay, be freely quotes the verses as genuine, and
   declares that they were read in his day on a certain Sunday night in
   the public Service of the Church. . . . To represent such an one,--(it
   matters nothing, I repeat, whether we call him "Hesychius of Jerusalem"
   or "Severus of Antioch,")--as a hostile witness, is simply to
   misrepresent the facts of the case. He is, on the contrary, the
   strenuous champion of the verses which he is commonly represented as
   impugning.

   III. As for Jerome, since that illustrious Father comes before us in
   this place as a translator of Eusebius only, he is no more responsible
   for what Eusebius says concerning S. Mark xvi. 9-20, than Hobbes of
   Malmesbury is responsible for anything that Thucydides has related
   concerning the Peloponnesian war. Individually, however, it is certain
   that Jerome was convinced of the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20: for
   in two different places of his writings he not only quotes the 9th and
   14th verses, but he exhibits all the twelve in the Vulgate.

   IV. Lastly, Victor of Antioch, who wrote in an age when Eusebius was
   held to be an infallible oracle on points of Biblical
   Criticism,--having dutifully rehearsed, (like the rest,) the feeble
   expedient of that illustrious Father for harmonizing S. Mark xvi. 9
   with the narrative of S. Matthew,--is observed to cite the statements
   of Eusebius concerning the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark, only in order
   to refute them. Not that he opposes opinion to opinion,--(for the
   opinions of Eusebius and of Victor of Antioch on this behalf were
   probably identical;) but statement he meets with
   counter-statement,--fact he confronts with fact. Scarcely can anything
   be imagined more emphatic than his testimony, or more conclusive.

   For the reader is requested to observe that here is an Ecclesiastic,
   writing in the first half of the v^th century, who expressly witnesses
   to the genuineness of the Verses in dispute. He had made reference, he
   says, and ascertained their existence in very many MSS. (hos en
   pleistois). He had derived his text from "accurate" ones: (ex akribon
   antigraphon.) More than that: he leads his reader to infer that he had
   personally resorted to the famous Palestinian Copy, the text of which
   was held to exhibit the inspired verity, and had satisfied himself that
   the concluding section of S. Mark's Gospel was there. He had,
   therefore, been either to Jerusalem, or else to Caesarea; had inquired
   for those venerable records which had once belonged to Origen and
   Pamphilus [119] ; and had inspected them. Testimony more express, more
   weighty,--I was going to say, more decisive,--can scarcely be imagined.
   It may with truth be said to close the present discussion.

   With this, in fact, Victor lays down his pen. So also may I. I submit
   that nothing whatever which has hitherto come before us lends the
   slightest countenance to the modern dream that S. Mark's Gospel, as it
   left the hands of its inspired Author, ended abruptly at ver. 8.
   Neither Eusebius nor Jerome; neither Severus of Antioch nor Hesychius
   of Jerusalem; certainly not Victor of Antioch; least of all Gregory of
   Nyssa,--yield a particle of support to that monstrous fancy. The notion
   is an invention, a pure imagination of the Critics ever since the days
   of Griesbach.

   It remains to be seen whether the MSS. will prove somewhat less
   unaccommodating.

   VII. For it can be of no possible avail, at this stage of the
   discussion, to appeal to

   Euthymius Zigabenus,

   the Author of an interesting Commentary, or rather Compilation on the
   Gospels, assigned to A.D. 1116. Euthymius lived, in fact, full five
   hundred years too late for his testimony to be of the slightest
   importance. Such as it is, however, it is not unfavourable. He
   says,--"Some of the Commentators state that here," (viz. at ver. 8,)
   "the Gospel according to Mark finishes; and that what follows is a
   spurious addition." (Which clearly is his version of the statements of
   one or more of the four Fathers whose testimony has already occupied so
   large a share of our attention.) "This portion we must also interpret,
   however," (Euthymius proceeds,) "since there is nothing in it
   prejudicial to the truth [120] ."--But it is idle to linger over such a
   writer. One might almost as well quote "Poli Synopsis," and then
   proceed to discuss it. The cause must indeed be desperate which seeks
   support from a quarter like this. What possible sanction can an
   Ecclesiastic of the xii^th century be supposed to yield to the
   hypothesis that S. Mark's Gospel, as it left the hands of its inspired
   Author, was an unfinished work?

   It remains to ascertain what is the evidence of the MSS. on this
   subject. And the MSS. require to be the more attentively studied,
   because it is to them that our opponents are accustomed most
   confidently to appeal. On them in fact they rely. The nature and the
   value of the most ancient Manuscript testimony available, shall be
   scrupulously investigated in the next two Chapters.

   We are there informed that the work of Eusebius extends from fol. 61 to
   96 of the Codex.

   [77] Vol. iv. pp. 219-309.

   [78] See Nova P. P. Bibliotheca, iv. 255.--That it was styled
   "Inquiries with their Resolutions" (Zetemata kai Luseis), Eusebius
   leads us to suppose by himself twice referring to it under that name,
   (Demonstr. Evang. lib. vii. 3: also in the Preface to Marinus, Mai, iv.
   255:) which his abbreviator is also observed to employ (Mai, iv. 219,
   255.) But I suspect that he and others so designate the work only from
   the nature of its contents; and that its actual title is correctly
   indicated by Jerome,--De Evangeliorum DiaphoniÃ¢: "Edidit" (he says) "de
   Evangeliorum DiaphoniÃ¢," (De Scriptt. Illustt. c. 81.) Again, Diaphonia
   Euangelion, (Hieron. in Matth. i. 16.) Consider also the testimony of
   Latinus Latinius, given below, p. 44, note (q). Indicated' by Jerome, I
   say: for the entire title was probably, Peri tes dokouses en tois
   euangeliois k.t.l. diaphonias. The Author of the Catena on S. Mark
   edited by Cramer (i. p. 266), quotes an opinion of Eusebius an to pros
   Marinon peri tes dokouses en tois euangeliois teri tes anastaseos
   diaphonias: extracted from the same MS. by Simon, Hist. Crit. N.T. p.
   89.

   [79] Ekloge en suntomo ek ton suntethenton hupo Eusebiou pros Stephanon

   Ibid. pp. 219, 255.--(See the plate of fac-similes facing the title of
   vol. i. ed. 1825.)

   [80] Eusebios . . . . en tais pros Marinon epi tais peri tou theiou
   pathous kai tes anastaseos zetesesi kai eklusesi, k.t.l. I quote the
   place from the less known Catena of Cramer, (ii. 389,) where it is
   assigned to Severus of Antioch: but it occurs also in Corderii Cat. in
   Joan. p. 436. (See Mai, iv. 299.)

   [81] This passage is too grand to be withheld:--Ou gar en axios tis en
   te polei Ioudaion, (hos phesin Eusebios kephalaio ig' pros Marinon,) to
   kata tou diabolou tropaion ton stauron bastasai; all' ho ex agrou, hos
   meden epikekoinoneke te kata Christou miaiphonia. (Possini Cat. in
   Marcum, p. 343.)

   [82] Mai, iv. p. 299.--The CatenÃ¦, inasmuch as their compilers are
   observed to have been very curious in such questions, are evidently
   full of disjecta membra of the work. These are recognisable for the
   most part by their form; but sometimes they actually retain the name of
   their author. Accordingly, CatenÃ¦ have furnished Mai with a
   considerable body of additional materials; which (as far as a MS.
   Catena of Nicetas on S. Luke, [Cod. A. seu Vat. 1611,] enabled him,) he
   has edited with considerable industry; throwing them into a kind of
   Supplement. (Vol. iv. pp. 268-282, and pp. 283-298.) It is only
   surprising that with the stores at his command, Mai has not contrived
   to enlighten us a little more on this curious subject. It would not be
   difficult to indicate sundry passages which he has overlooked. Neither
   indeed can it be denied that the learned Cardinal has executed his task
   in a somewhat slovenly manner. He does not seem to, have noticed that
   what he quotes at pp.357-8--262--283--295, is to be found in the Catena
   of Corderius at pp. 448-9--449--450--457.--He quotes (p. 300) from an
   unedited Homily of John Xiphilinus, (Cod. Vat. p. 160,) what he might
   have found in Possinus; and in Cramer too, (p. 446.) He was evidently
   unacquainted with Cramer's work, though it had been published 3 (if not
   7) years before his own,--else, at p. 299, instead of quoting Simon, he
   would have quoted Cramer's CatenÃ¦, i. 266.--It was in his power to
   solve his own shrewd doubt, (at p. 299,--concerning the text of a
   passage in Possinus, p. 343,) seeing that the Catena which Possinus
   published was transcribed by Corderius from a MS. in the Vatican.
   (Possini PrÃ¦fat. p. ii.) In the Vatican, too, he might have found the
   fragment he quotes (p. 300) from p. 364 of the Catena of Possinus. In
   countless places he might, by such references, have improved his often
   manifestly faulty text.

   [83] Mai quotes the following from Latinus Latinius (Opp. ii. 116.) to
   Andreas Masius. Sirletus (Cardinalis) "scire te vult in SiciliÃ¢
   inventos esse . . . libros tres Eusebii CÃ¦sariensis de Evangetiorum
   DiaphoniÃ¢, qui ut ipse sperat brevi in lucem prodibunt." The letter is
   dated 1663. I suspect that when the original of this work is recovered,
   it will be found that Eusebius digested his "Questions" under heads:
   e.g. peri tou taphou, kai tes dokouses diaphonias (p. 264): peri tes
   dokouses peri tes anastaseos diaphonias. (p. 299.)

   [84] I translate according to the sense,--the text being manifestly
   corrupt. Ten touto phaskousan perikopen is probably a gloss,
   explanatory of to kephalaion auto. In strictness, the kephalaion begins
   at ch. xv. 42, and extends to the end of the Gospel. There are 48 such
   kephalaia in S. Mark. But this term was often loosely employed by the
   Greek Fathers, (as "capitulum" by the Latins,) to denote a passage of
   Scripture, and it is evidently so used here. Perikopen, on the
   contrary, in this place seems to have its true technical meaning, and
   to denote the liturgical section, or "lesson."

   [85] Anagnosma (like perikope, spoken of in the foregoing note,) seems
   to be here used in its technical sense, and to designate the liturgical
   section, or "lectio." See Suicer, in voce.

   [86] The text of Eusebius seems to have experienced some disarrangement
   and depravation here.

   original of this passage is given in the Appendix (B).

CHAPTER VI.

  MANUSCRIPT TESTIMONY SHEWN TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF THESE
  VERSES.--Part I.

   S. Mark xvi. 9-20, contained in every HS. in the world except
   two.--Irrational Claim to Infallibility set up on behalf of Cod. B (p.
   73) and Cod. ' (p. 75).--These two Codices shewn to be full of gross
   Omissions (p. 78),--Interpolations (p. 80),--Corruptions of the Text
   (p. 81),--and Perversions of the Truth (p. 83).--The testimony of Cod.
   B to S. Mark xvi. 9-20, shewn to be favorable, notwithstanding (p. 86).

   THE two oldest Copies of the Gospels in existence are the famous Codex
   in the Vatican Library at Rome, known as "Codex B;" and the Codex which
   Tischendorf brought from Mount Sinai in 1859, and which he designates
   by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet ('). These two manuscripts
   are probably not of equal antiquity [121] . An interval of fifty years
   at least seems to be required to account for the marked difference
   between them. If the first belongs to the beginning, the second may be
   referred to the middle or latter part of the iv^th century. But the two
   Manuscripts agree in this,--that they are without the last twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel. In both, after ephobounto gar (ver. 8),
   comes the subscription: in Cod. B,--KATA MARKON; in Cod. ',--EUAGGELION
   KATA MARKON.

   Let it not be supposed that we have any more facts of this class to
   produce. All has been stated. It is not that the evidence of
   Manuscripts is one,--the evidence of Fathers and Versions another. The
   very reverse is the case. Manuscripts, Fathers, and Versions alike, are
   only not unanimous in bearing consistent testimony. But the consentient
   witness of the MSS. is even extraordinary. With the exception of the
   two uncial MSS. which have just been named, there is not one Codex in
   existence, uncial or cursive,--(and we are acquainted with, at least,
   eighteen other uncials [122] , and about six hundred cursive Copies of
   this Gospel,)--which leaves out the last twelve verses of S. Mark.

   The inference which an unscientific observer would draw from this fact,
   is no doubt in this instance the correct one. He demands to be shewn
   the Alexandrine (A) and the Parisian Codex (C),--neither of them
   probably removed by much more than fifty years from the date of the
   Codex Sinaiticus, and both unquestionably derived from different
   originals;--and he ascertains that no countenance is lent by either of
   those venerable monuments to the proposed omission of this part of the
   sacred text. He discovers that the Codex Bezae (D), the only remaining
   very ancient MS. authority,--notwithstanding that it is observed on
   most occasions to exhibit an extraordinary sympathy with the Vatican
   (B),--here sides with A and C against B and '. He inquires after all
   the other uncials and all the cursive MSS. in existence, (some of them
   dating from the x^th century,) and requests to have it explained to him
   why it is to be supposed that all these many witnesses,--belonging to
   so many different patriarchates, provinces, ages of the Church,--have
   entered into a grand conspiracy to bear false witness on a point of
   this magnitude and importance But he obtains no intelligible answer to
   this question. How, then, is an unprejudiced student to draw any
   inference but one from the premisses? That single peculiarity (he tells
   himself) of bringing the second Gospel abruptly to a close at the 8th
   verse of the xvi^th chapter, is absolutely fatal to the two Codices in
   question. It is useless to din into his ears that those Codices are
   probably both of the iv^th century,--unless men are prepared to add the
   assurance that a Codex of the iv^th century is of necessity a more
   trustworthy witness to the text of the Gospels than a Codex of the
   v^th. The omission of these twelve verses, I repeat, in itself,
   destroys his confidence in Cod. B and Cod. ': for it is obvious that a
   copy of the Gospels which has been so seriously mutilated in one place
   may have been slightly tampered with in another. He is willing to
   suspend his judgment, of course. The two oldest copies of the Gospels
   in existence are entitled to great reverence because of their high
   antiquity. They must be allowed a most patient, most unprejudiced, most
   respectful, nay, a most indulgent hearing. But when all this has been
   freely accorded, on no intelligible principle can more be claimed for
   any two MSS. in the world.

   The rejoinder to all this is sufficiently obvious. Mistrust will no
   doubt have been thrown over the evidence borne to the text of Scripture
   in a thousand other places by Cod. B and Cod. ', after demonstration
   that those two Codices exhibit a mutilated text in the present place.
   But what else is this but the very point requiring demonstration? Why
   may not these two be right, and all the other MSS. wrong?

   I propose, therefore, that we reverse the process. Proceed we to
   examine the evidence borne by these two witnesses on certain other
   occasions which admit of no difference of opinion; or next to none. Let
   us endeavour, I say, to ascertain the character of the Witnesses by a
   patient and unprejudiced examination of their Evidence,--not in one
   place, or in two, or in three; but on several important occasions, and
   throughout. If we find it invariably consentient and invariably
   truthful, then of course a mighty presumption will have been
   established, the very strongest possible, that their adverse testimony
   in .respect of the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel must needs be worthy
   of all acceptation. But if, on the contrary, our inquiries shall
   conduct us to the very opposite result,--what else can happen but that
   our confidence in these two MSS. will be hopelessly shaken? We must in
   such case be prepared to admit that it is just as likely as not that
   this is only one more occasion on which these "two false witnesses"
   have conspired to witness falsely. If, at this juncture, extraneous
   evidence of an entirely trustworthy kind can be procured to confront
   them: above all, if some one ancient witness of unimpeachable veracity
   can be found who shall bear contradictory evidence: what other
   alternative will be left us but to reject their testimony in respect of
   S. Mark xvi. 9-20 with something like indignation; and to acquiesce in
   the belief of universal Christendom for eighteen hundred years that
   these twelve verses are just as much entitled to our unhesitating
   acceptance as any other twelve verses in the Gospel which can be named?

   I. It is undeniable, in the meantime, that for the last quarter of a
   century, it has become the fashion to demand for the readings of. Codex
   B something very like absolute deference. The grounds for this
   superstitious sentiment, (for really I can describe it in no apter
   way,) I profess myself unable to discover. Codex B comes to us without
   a history: without recommendation of any kind, except that of its
   antiquity. It bears traces of careless transcription in every page. The
   mistakes which the original transcriber made are of perpetual
   recurrence. "They are chiefly omissions, of one, two, or three words;
   but sometimes of half a verse, a whole verse, or even of several verses
   . . . . I hesitate not to assert that it would be easier to find a
   folio containing three or four such omissions than to light on one
   which should be without any [123] ." In the Gospels alone, Codex B
   leaves out words or whole clauses no less than 1,491 times [124] : of
   which by far the largest proportion is found in S. Mark's Gospel. Many
   of these, no doubt, are to be accounted for by the proximity of a "like
   ending [125] ." The Vatican MS. (like the Sinaitic [126] ) was
   originally derived from an older Codex which contained about twelve or
   thirteen letters in a line [128] . And it will be found that some of
   its omissions which have given rise to prolonged discussion are
   probably to be referred to nothing else but the oscitancy of a
   transcriber with such a codex before him [129] : Without having
   recourse to any more abstruse hypothesis; without any imputation of bad
   faith;--certainly without supposing that the words omitted did not
   exist in the inspired autograph of the Evangelist. But then it is
   undeniable that some of the omissions in Cod. B are not to be so
   explained. On the other hand, I can testify to the fact that the codex
   is disfigured throughout with repetitions. The original scribe is often
   found to have not only written the same words twice over, but to have
   failed whenever he did so to take any notice with his pen of what he
   had done.

   What then, (I must again inquire,) are the grounds for the
   superstitious reverence which is entertained in certain quarters for
   the readings of Codex B? If it be a secret known to the recent Editors
   of the New Testament, they have certainly contrived to keep it wondrous
   close.

   II. More recently, a claim to co-ordinate primacy has been set up on
   behalf of the Codex Sinaiticus. Tischendorf is actually engaged in
   remodelling his seventh Leipsic edition, chiefly in conformity with the
   readings of his lately discovered MS. [130] And yet the Codex in
   question abounds with "errors of the eye and pen, to an extent not
   unparalleled, but happily rather unusual in documents of first-rate
   importance." On many occasions, 10, 20, 30, 40 words are dropped
   through very carelessness [131] . "Letters and words, even whole
   sentences, are frequently written twice over, or begun and immediately
   cancelled: while that gross blunder ... whereby a clause is omitted
   because it happens to end in the same words as the clause preceding,
   occurs no less than 115 times in the New Testament. Tregelles has
   freely pronounced that the state of the text, as proceeding from the
   first scribe, may be regarded as very rough [132] .'" But when "the
   first scribe" and his "very rough" performance have been thus
   unceremoniously disposed of, one would like to be informed what remains
   to command respect in Codex '? Is, then, manuscript authority to be
   confounded with editorial caprice,--exercising itself upon the
   corrections of "at least ten different revisers," who, from the vi^th
   to the xii^th century, have been endeavouring to lick into shape a text
   which its original author left "very rough?"

   The co-ordinate primacy, (as I must needs call it.,) which, within the
   last few years, has been claimed for Codex B and Codex ', threatens to
   grow into a species of tyranny,--from which I venture to predict there
   will come in the end an unreasonable and unsalutary recoil. It behoves
   us, therefore, to look closely into this matter, and to require a
   reason for what is being done. The text of the sacred deposit is far
   too precious a thing to be sacrificed to an irrational, or at least a
   superstitious devotion to two MSS.,--simply because they may possibly
   be older by a hundred years than any other which we possess. "Id verius
   quod prius," is an axiom which holds every bit as true in Textual
   Criticism as in Dogmatic Truth. But on that principle, (as I have
   already shewn,) the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel are fully
   established [133] ; and by consequence,. the credit of Codd. B and '
   sustains a severe shock. Again, "Id verius quod prius;" but it does not
   of course follow that a Codex of the iv^th century shall exhibit a more
   correct text of Scripture than one written in the vth, or even than one
   written in the x^th. For the proof of this statement, (if it can be
   supposed to require proof,) it is enough to appeal to Codex D. That
   venerable copy of the Gospels is of the vi^th century. It is, in fact,
   one of our five great uncials. No older MS. of the Greek Text is known
   to exist,--excepting always A, B, C and '. And yet no text is more
   thoroughly disfigured by corruptions and interpolations than that of
   Codex D. In the Acts, (to use the language of its learned and accurate
   Editor,) "it is hardly an exaggeration to assert that it reproduces the
   textus receptus much in the same way that one of the best Chaldee
   Targums does the Hebrew of the Old Testament: so wide are the
   variations in the diction, so constant and inveterate the practice of
   expanding the narrative by means of interpolations which seldom
   recommend themselves as genuine by even a semblance of internal
   probability [134] ." Where, then, is the Ã  priori probability that two
   MSS. of the iv^th century shall have not only a superior claim to be
   heard, but almost an exclusive right to dictate which readings are to
   be rejected, which retained?

   How ready the most recent editors of the New Testament have shown
   themselves to hammer the sacred text on the anvil of Codd. B and
   ',--not unfrequently in defiance of the evidence of all other MSS., and
   sometimes to the serious detriment of the deposit,--would admit of
   striking illustration were this place for such details. Tischendorf's
   English "New Testament,"--"with various readings from the three most
   celebrated manuscripts of the Greek Text" translated at the foot of
   every page,--is a recent attempt (1869) to popularize the doctrine that
   we have to look exclusively to two or three of the oldest copies, if we
   would possess the Word of God in its integrity. Dean Alford's constant
   appeal in his revision of the Authorized Version (1870) to "the oldest
   MSS.," (meaning thereby generally Codd. ' and B with one or two others
   [135] ), is an abler endeavour to familiarize the public mind with the
   same belief. I am bent on chewing that there is nothing whatever in the
   character of either of the Codices in question to warrant this servile
   deference.

   (a) And first,--Ought it not sensibly to detract from our opinion of
   the value of their evidence to discover that it is easier to find two
   consecutive verses in which the two MSS. differ, the one from the
   other, than two consecutive verses in which they entirely agree? Now
   this is a plain matter of fact, of which any one who pleases may easily
   convince himself. But the character of two witnesses who habitually
   contradict one another has been accounted, in every age, precarious. On
   every such occasion, only one of them can possibly be speaking the
   truth. Shall I be thought unreasonable if I confess that these
   perpetual inconsistencies between Codd. B and ',--grave
   inconsistencies, and occasionally even gross ones,--altogether destroy
   my confidence in either?

   (b) On the other hand, discrepant as the testimony of these two MSS. is
   throughout, they yet, strange to say, conspire every here and there in
   exhibiting minute corruptions of such an unique and peculiar kind as to
   betray a (probably not very remote) common corrupt original. These
   coincidences in fact are so numerous and so extraordinary as to
   establish a real connexion between those two codices; and that
   connexion is fatal to any claim which might be set up on their behalf
   as wholly independent witnesses [136] .

   (c) Further, it is evident that both alike have been subjected,
   probably during the process of transcription, to the same depraving
   influences. But because such statements require to be established by an
   induction of instances, the reader's attention must now be invited to a
   few samples of the grave blemishes which disfigure our two oldest
   copies of the Gospel.

   1. And first, since it is the omission of the end of S. Mark's Gospel
   which has given rise to the present discussion, it becomes a highly
   significant circumstance that the original scribe of Cod. ' had also
   omitted the end of the Gospel according to S. John [137] . In this
   suppression of ver. 25, Cod. ' stands alone among MSS. A cloud of
   primitive witnesses vouch for the genuineness of the verse. Surely, it
   is nothing else but the reductio ad absurdum of a theory of recension,
   (with Tischendorf in his last edition,) to accommodate our printed text
   to the vicious standard of the original penman of Cod. ', and bring the
   last chapter of S. John's Gospel to a close at ver. 24!

   Cod. B, on the other hand, omits the whole of those two solemn verses
   wherein S. Luke describes our Lord's "Agony and bloody Sweat," together
   with the act of the ministering Angel [138] . As to the genuineness of
   those verses, recognised as they are by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus,
   Hippolytus, Epiphanius, Didymus, Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom,
   Theodoret, by all the oldest versions, and by almost every MS. in
   existence, including Cod. ',--it admits of no doubt. Here then is proof
   positive that in order to account for omissions from the Gospel in the
   oldest of the uncials, there is no need whatever to resort to the
   hypothesis that such portions of the Gospel are not the genuine work of
   the Evangelist. "The admitted error of Cod. B in this place," (to quote
   the words of Scrivener,) "ought to make some of its advocates more
   chary of their confidence in cases where it is less countenanced by
   other witnesses than in the instance before us."

   Cod. B (not Cod. ') is further guilty of the "grave error" (as Dean
   Alford justly styles it,) of omitting that solemn record of the
   Evangelist:--"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not
   what they do." It also withholds the statement that the inscription on
   the Cross was "in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew [139] ." Cod
   ', on the other hand, omits the confession of the man born blind (o de`
   e'phe, pisteu'o, ku'rie; kai` proseku'nesen auto) in S. John ix.
   38.--Both Cod. ' and Cod. B retain nothing but the word huion of the
   expression to`n uio'n autes to`n proto'tokon, in S. Matth. i. 25; and
   suppress altogether the important doctrinal statement o o'n en to
   ouranoo, in S. John iii. 13: as well as the clause dieltho`n dia`
   me'ssou auton; kai` paregen ou'tos in S. John viii. 59. Concerning all
   of which, let it be observed that I am neither imputing motives nor
   pretending to explain the design with which these several serious
   omissions were made. All that is asserted is, that they cannot be
   imputed to the carelessness of a copyist, but were intentional: and I
   insist that they effectually dispose of the presumption that when an
   important passage is observed to be wanting from Cod. B or Cod. ', its
   absence is to be accounted for by assuming that it was also absent from
   the inspired autograph of the Evangelist.

   2. To the foregoing must be added the many places where the text of B
   or of ', or of both, has clearly been interpolated. There does not
   exist in the whole compass of the New Testament a more monstrous
   instance of this than is furnished by the transfer of the incident of
   the piercing of our Redeemer's side from S. John xix. 24 to S. Matth.
   xxvii., in Cod. B and Cod. ', where it is introduced at the end of ver.
   49, in defiance of reason as well as of authority [140] . "This
   interpolation" (remarks Mr. Scrivener) "which would represent the
   Saviour as pierced while yet living, is a good example of the fact that
   some of our highest authorities may combine in attesting a reading
   unquestionably false [141] ." Another singularly gross specimen of
   interpolation, in my judgment, is supplied by the purely apocryphal
   statement which is met with in Cod. ', at the end of S. Matthew's
   account of the healing of the Centurion's servant,--kai upostrepsas o
   ekatontarchos eis ton oikon autou en aute te ora, euren ton paida
   ugiainonta viii. 13.)--Nor can anything well be weaker than the
   substitution (for ustere'santos oi'nou, in S. John ii. 3) of the
   following [142] , which is found only in Cod. ':--oinon ouk eichon, oti
   sunetelesthe o oinos tou gamou.

   But the inspired text has been depraved in the same licentious way
   throughout, by the responsible authors of Cod. B and Cod. ', although
   such corruptions have attracted little notice from their comparative
   unimportance. Thus, the reading (in ') emas dei ergazesthai ta erga tou
   pempsantos emas (S. John ix. 4) carries with it its own sufficient
   condemnation; being scarcely rendered more tolerable by B's
   substitution of me for the second emas.--Instead of tethemelioto gar
   epi ten petran (S. Luke vi. 48), B and ' present us with the insipid
   gloss, dia to kalos oikodomeisthai auten.--In the last-named codex, we
   find the name of "Isaiah" (esaiou) thrust into S. Matth. xiii. 35, in
   defiance of authority and of fact.--Can I be wrong in asserting that
   the reading o monogenes theos (for huios) in S. John i. 18, (a reading
   found in Cod. B and Cod. ' alike,) is undeserving of serious
   attention?--May it not also be confidently declared that, in the face
   of all MS. evidence [143] , no future Editors of the New Testament will
   be found to accept the highly improbable reading o anthropos o
   legomenos Iesous, in S. John ix. 11, although the same two Codices
   conspire in exhibiting it?--or, on the authority of one of them ('), to
   read en auto zoe estin [144] (for en auto zoe` en) in S. John i.
   4?--Certain at least it is that no one will ever be found to read (with
   B) ebdomekonta duo in S. Luke x. 1,--or (with ') o ekkektos t9ou theou
   (instead of ho huios tou theou in S. John i. 34.--But let me ask, With
   what show of reason can the pretence of Infallibility, (as well as the
   plea of Primacy), be set up on behalf of a pair of MSS. licentiously
   corrupt as these have already been proved to be? For the readings above
   enumerated, be it observed, are either critical depravations of the
   inspired Text, or else unwarrantable interpolations. They cannot have
   resulted from careless transcription.

   3. Not a few of the foregoing instances are in fact of a kind to
   convince me that the text with which Cod. B and Cod. ' were chiefly
   acquainted, must have been once and again subjected to a clumsy process
   of revision. Not unfrequently, as may be imagined, the result (however
   tasteless and infelicitous) is not of serious importance; as when, (to
   give examples from Cod. ',) for to`n o'chlon epikeisthai auto aim? (in
   S. Luke v. 1) we are presented with sunachthenai ton ochlon:--when for
   zon aso'tos (in S. Luke xv. 13) we read eis choran makran; and for oi
   exousia'zontes auton (in S. Luke xxii. 25), we find oi archontes ton
   [ethnon] exousiazousin auton, kai, (which is only a weak reproduction
   of S. Matth. xx. 25):--when again, for skoti'a e'de egego'nei (in S.
   John vi. 17), we are shewn katelaben de autous e skotia: and when, for
   kai` ti's estin o parado'son auto'n (in S. John vi. 64) we are invited
   to accept kai tis en o mellon auton paradidonai [145] . But it requires
   very little acquaintance with the subject to foresee that this kind of
   license may easily assume serious dimensions, and grow into an
   intolerable evil. Thus, when the man born blind is asked by the Holy
   One if he believes epi to`n uio`n tou Theou (S. John. ix. 35), we are
   by no means willing to acquiesce in the proposed substitute, ton uion
   tou anthropou: neither, when the Saviour says, gino'skomai upo` ton
   emon (S. John x. 14) are we at all willing to put up with the weak
   equivalent ginoskousi me ta ema. Still less is kai emoi autous edokas
   any equivalent at all for kai` ta` ema` pa'nta sa' esti, kai` ta` sa`
   ema', in S. John xvii. 10: or, alloi zosousin se, kai poiesousin soi
   osa ou theleis, for a'llos se zo'sei. kai` oi'sei o'pou ou the'leis, in
   S. John xxi. 18. Indeed, even when our Lord is not the speaker, such
   licentious depravation of the text is not to be endured. Thus, in S.
   Luke xxiii. 15, Cod. B and Cod. ' conspire in substituting for
   ane'pempsa ga`r umas pro`s auto`n,--anepempsen gar auton pros emas;
   which leads one to suspect the copyist was misled by the narrative in
   ver. 7. Similar instances might be multiplied to an indefinite extent.

   Two yet graver corruptions of the truth of the Gospel, (but they belong
   to the same category,) remain to be specified. Mindful, I suppose, of
   S. James' explanation "how that by works a man is justified," the
   author of the text of Codices B and ' has ventured to alter our Lord's
   assertion (in S. Matth. xi. 19,) "Wisdom is justified of her children,"
   into "Wisdom is justified by her works;" and, in the case of Cod. ',
   his zeal is observed to have so entirely carried him away, that he has
   actually substituted ergon for teknon in the parallel place of S.
   Luke's Gospel.--The other example of error (S. Matth. xxi. 31) is
   calculated to provoke a smile. Finding that our Saviour, in describing
   the conduct of the two sons in the parable, says of the one,--u'steron
   de` metamelethei`s apelthen, and of the other,--kai` ouk apelthen; some
   ancient scribe, (who can have been but slenderly acquainted with the
   Greek language,) seems to have conceived the notion that a more precise
   way of identifying the son who "afterwards repented and went," would be
   to designate him as ho husteros. Accordingly, in reply to the
   question,--ti's ek ton du'o epoi'esen to` the'lema tou patro's; we are
   presented (but only in Cod. B) with the astonishing
   information,--legousin o usteros. And yet, seeing clearly that this
   made nonsense of the parable, some subsequent critic is found to have
   transposed the order of the two sons: and in that queer condition the
   parable comes down to us in the famous Vatican Codex B.

   4. Some of the foregoing instances of infelicitous tampering with the
   text of the Gospels are, it must be confessed, very serious. But it is
   a yet more fatal circumstance in connexion with Cod. B and Cod. ' that
   they are convicted of certain perversions of the truth of Scripture
   which must have been made with deliberation and purpose. Thus, in S.
   Mark xiv, they exhibit a set of passages--(verses 30, 68, 72)--"which
   bear clear marks of wilful and critical correction, thoroughly carried
   out in Cod. ', only partially in Cod. B; the object being so far to
   assimilate the narrative of Peter's denial with those of the other
   Evangelists, as to suppress the fact, vouched for by S. Mark only, that
   the cock crowed twice. (In Cod. ', dis is omitted in ver. 30,"--ek
   deuterou and dis in ver. 72,--"and kai` ale'ktor epho'nese in ver. 68:
   the last change being countenanced by B [146] .") One such discovery, I
   take leave to point out, is enough to destroy all confidence in the
   text of these two manuscripts: for it proves that another kind of
   corrupting influence,--besides carelessness, and accident, and
   tasteless presumption, and unskilful assiduity,--has been at work on
   Codices B and '. We are constrained to approach these two manuscripts
   with suspicion in all cases where a supposed critical difficulty in
   harmonizing the statements of the several Evangelists will account for
   any of the peculiar readings which they exhibit.

   Accordingly, it does not at all surprise me to discover that in both
   Codices the important word exelthousai (in S. Matth. xxviii. 8) has
   been altered into apelthousai. I recognise in that substitution of apo
   for ex the hand of one who was not aware that the women, when addressed
   by the Angel, were inside the sepulchre; but who accepted the belief
   (it is found to have been as common in ancient as in modern times) that
   they beheld him "sitting on the stone [147] ."--In consequence of a
   similar misconception, both Codices are observed to present us with the
   word "wine" instead of "vinegar" in S. Matthew's phrase oxos meta
   choles memigmenon: which results from a mistaken endeavour on the part
   of some ancient critic to bring S. Matth. xxvii. 34 into harmony with
   S. Mark xv. 23. The man did not perceive that the cruel insult of the
   "vinegar and gall" (which the Saviour tasted but would not drink) was
   quite a distinct thing from the proffered mercy of the "myrrhed wine"
   which the Saviour put away from Himself altogether.

   So again, it was in order to bring S. Luke xxiv. 13 into harmony with a
   supposed fact of geography that Cod. ' states that Emmaus, (which
   Josephus also places at sixty stadia from Jerusalem), was "an hundred
   and sixty" stadia distant. The history of this interpolation of the
   text is known. It is because some ancient critic (Origen probably)
   erroneously assumed that Nicopolis was the place intended. The
   conjecture met with favour, and there are not wanting scholia to
   declare that this was the reading of "the accurate"
   copies,--notwithstanding the physical impossibility which is involved
   by the statement [148] .--Another geographical misconception under
   which the scribe of Cod. Cod. ' is found to have laboured was that
   Nazareth (S. Luke i. 26) and Capernaum (S. Mark i. 28) were in Judaea.
   Accordingly he has altered the text in both the places referred to, to
   suit his private notion [149] .--A yet more striking specimen of the
   preposterous method of the same scribe is supplied by his substitution
   of Kaisarias for Samareias in Acts viii. 5,-- evidently misled by what
   he found in viii. 40 and xxi. 8.--Again, it must have been with a view
   of bringing Revelation into harmony with the (supposed) facts of
   physical Science that for the highly significant Theological record kai
   eskotisthe ho helios at the Crucifixion [150] , has been substituted
   both in B and ', tou eliou eklipontos,--a statement which (as the
   ancients were perfectly well aware [151] ) introduces into the
   narrative an astronomical contradiction.--It may be worth adding, that
   Tischendorf with singular inconsistency admits into his text the
   astronomical contradiction, while he rejects the geographical
   impossibility.--And this may suffice concerning the text of Codices B
   and '.

   III. We are by this time in a condition to form a truer estimate of the
   value of the testimony borne by these two manuscripts in respect of the
   last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel. If we were disposed before to
   regard their omission of an important passage as a serious matter, we
   certainly cannot any longer so regard it. We have by this time seen
   enough to disabuse our minds of every prejudice. Codd. B and ' are the
   very reverse of infallible guides. Their deflections from the Truth of
   Scripture are more constant, as well as more licentious by far, than
   those of their younger brethren: their unauthorized omissions from the
   sacred text are not only far more frequent but far more flagrant also.
   And yet the main matter before us,--their omission of the last twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel,--when rightly understood, proves to be an
   entirely different phenomenon from what an ordinary reader might have
   been led to suppose. Attention is specially requested for the remarks
   which follow.

   IV. To say that in the Vatican Codex (B), which is unquestionably the
   oldest we possess, S. Mark's Gospel ends abruptly at the 8th verse of
   the xvi^th chapter, and that the customary subscription (KATA MARKON)
   follows,--is true; but it is far from being the whole truth. It
   requires to be stated in addition that the scribe, whose plan is found
   to have been to begin every fresh book of the Bible at the top of the
   next ensuing column to that which contained the concluding words of the
   preceding book, has at the close of S. Mark's Gospel deviated from his
   else invariable practice. lie has left in this place one column
   entirely vacant. It is the only vacant column in the whole
   manuscript;--a blank space abundantly sufficient to contain the twelve
   verses which he nevertheless withheld. Why did he leave that column
   vacant? What can have induced the scribe on this solitary occasion to
   depart from his established rule? The phenomenon,--(I believe I was the
   first to call distinct attention to it,)--is in the highest degree
   significant, and admits of only one interpretation. The older MS. from
   which Cod. B was copied must have infallibly contained the twelve
   verses in dispute. The copyist was instructed to leave them out,--and
   he obeyed: but he prudently left a blank space in memoriam rei. Never
   was blank more intelligible! Never was silence more eloquent! By this
   simple expedient, strange to relate, the Vatican Codex is made to
   refute itself even while it seems to be bearing testimony against the
   concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel, by withholding them: for it
   forbids the inference which, under ordinary circumstances, must have
   been drawn from that omission. It does more. By leaving room for the
   verses it omits, it brings into prominent notice at the end of fifteen
   centuries and a half, a more ancient witness than itself. The venerable
   Author of the original Codex from which Codex B was copied, is thereby
   brought to view. And thus, our supposed adversary (Codex B) proves our
   most useful ally: for it procures us the testimony of an hitherto
   unsuspected witness. The earlier scribe, I repeat, unmistakably comes
   forward at this stage of the inquiry, to explain that he at least is
   prepared to answer for the genuineness of these Twelve concluding
   Verses with which the later scribe, his copyist, from his omission of
   them, might unhappily be thought to have been unacquainted.

   It will be perceived that nothing is gained by suggesting that the
   scribe of Cod. B. may have copied from a MS. which exhibited the same
   phenomenon which he has himself reproduced. This, by shifting the
   question a little further back, does but make the case against Cod. '
   the stronger.

   But in truth, after the revelation which has been already elicited from
   Cod. B, the evidence of Cod. ' may be very summarily disposed of. I
   have already, on independent grounds, ventured to assign to that Codex
   a somewhat later date than is claimed for the Codex Vaticanus [152] .
   My opinion is confirmed by observing that the Sinaitic contains no such
   blank space at the end of S. Mark's Gospel as is conspicuous in the
   Vatican Codex. I infer that the Sinaitic was copied from a Codex which
   had been already mutilated, and reduced to the condition of Cod. B; and
   that the scribe, only because he knew not what it meant, exhibited S.
   Mark's Gospel in consequence as if it really had no claim to those
   twelve concluding verses which, nevertheless, every authority we have
   hitherto met with has affirmed to belong to it of right.

   Whatever may be thought of the foregoing suggestion, it is at least
   undeniable that Cod. B and Cod. ' are at variance on the main point.
   They contradict one another concerning the twelve concluding verses of
   S. Mark's Gospel. For while Cod. ' refuses to know anything at all
   about those verses, Cod. B admits that it remembers them well, by
   volunteering the statement that they were found in the older codex, of
   which it is in every other respect a faithful representative. The older
   and the better manuscript (B), therefore, refutes its junior ('). And
   it will be seen that logically this brings the inquiry to a close, as
   far as the evidence of the manuscripts is concerned. We have referred
   to the oldest extant copy of the Gospels in order to obtain its
   testimony: and,--"Though without the Twelve Verses concerning which you
   are so solicitous," (it seems to. say,) "I yet hesitate not to confess
   to you that an older copy than myself,--the ancient Codex from which I
   was copied,--actually did contain them."

   The problem may, in fact, be briefly stated as follows. Of the four
   oldest Codices of the Gospels extant,--B, ', A, C,--two (B and ') are
   without these twelve verses: two (A and C) are with them. Are these
   twelve verses then an unauthorized addition to A and C? or are they an
   unwarrantable omission from B and '? B itself declares plainly that
   from itself they are an omission. And B is the oldest Codex of the
   Gospel in existence. What candid mind will persist in clinging to the
   solitary fact that from the single Codex ' these verses are away, in
   proof that "S. Mark's Gospel was at first without the verses which at
   present conclude it?"

   Let others decide, therefore, whether the present discussion has not
   already reached a stage at which an unprejudiced Arbiter might be
   expected to address the prosecuting parties somewhat to the following
   effect:--

   "This case must now be dismissed. The charge brought by yourselves
   against these Verses was, that they are an unauthorized addition to the
   second Gospel; a spurious appendix, of which the Evangelist S. Mark can
   have known nothing. But so far from substantiating this charge, you
   have not adduced a single particle of evidence which renders it even
   probable.

   "The appeal was made by yourselves to Fathers and to MSS. It has been
   accepted. And with what result?

   (a) "Those many Fathers whom you represented as hostile, prove on
   investigation to be reducible to one, viz. Eusebius: and Eusebius, as
   we have seen, does not say that the verses are spurious, but on the
   contrary labours hard to prove that they may very well be genuine. On
   the other hand, there are earlier Fathers than Eusebius who quote them
   without any signs of misgiving. In this way, the positive evidence in
   their favour is carried back to the ii^nd century.

   (b) "Declining the testimony of the Versions, you insisted on an appeal
   to MSS. On the MSS., in fact, you still make your stand,--or rather you
   rely on the oldest of them; for, (as you are aware,) every MS. in the
   world except the two oldest are against you.

   "I have therefore questioned the elder of those two MSS.; and it has
   volunteered the avowal that an older MS. than itself--the Codex from
   which it was copied--was furnished with those very Verses which you
   wish me to believe that some older MS. still must needs have been
   without. What else can be said, then, of your method but that it is
   frivolous? and of your charge, but that it is contradicted by the
   evidence to which you yourselves appeal?

   "But it is illogical; that is, it is unreasonable, besides.

   "For it is high time to point out that even if it so happened that the
   oldest known MS. was observed to be without these twelve concluding
   verses, it would still remain a thing unproved (not to say highly
   improbable) that from the autograph of the Evangelist himself they were
   also away. Supposing, further, that no Ecclesiastical writer of the
   ii^nd or iii^rd century could be found who quoted them: even so, it
   would not follow that there existed no such verses for a primitive
   Father to quote. The earliest of the Versions might in addition yield
   faltering testimony; but even so, who would be so rash as to raise on
   such a slender basis the monstrous hypothesis, that S. Mark's Gospel
   when it left the hands of its inspired Author was without the verses
   which at present conclude it? How, then, would you have proposed to
   account for the consistent testimony of an opposite kind yielded by
   every other known document in the world?

   "But, on the other hand, what are the facts of the case? (1) The
   earliest of the Fathers,--(2) the most venerable of the Versions,--(3)
   the oldest MS. of which we can obtain any tidings,--all are observed to
   recognise these Verses. Cadit quaestio' therefore. The last shadow of
   pretext has vanished for maintaining with Tischendorf that Mark the
   Evangelist knew nothing of these verses:--with Tregelles that The book
   of Mark himself extends no further than ephobounto gar:'--with
   Griesbach that the last leaf of the original Gospel was probably torn
   away.' . . . It is high time, I say, that this case were dismissed. But
   there are also costs to be paid. Cod. B and Cod. ' are convicted of
   being two false witnesses,' and must be held to go forth from this
   inquiry with an injured reputation."

   This entire subject is of so much importance that I must needs yet
   awhile crave the reader's patience and attention.

   Jesus," (as both Tischendorf and Tregelles assume;) but "Respondit
   ille, Homo," &c.,--as in verses 25 and 36.

   [144] This rending will be found discussed in a footnote (p) at the end
   of Chap. V1I.,--p. 110.

   [145] The following may be added from Cod. ':--megaloi auton (in S.

   heorakas:--in all which four readings Cod. ' is without support.
   [Scrivener, Coll. Cod. Sin. p. li.] The epithet megan, introduced (in
   the same codex) before lithon in S. Mark xv. 46; and kai patrias
   inserted into the phrase ex oikou Dabid in S. Lu. i. 27,--are two more
   specimens of mistaken officiousness. In the same infelicitous spirit,
   Cod. B and Cod. ' concur in omitting ischuron (S. Matt. xiv. 30), and
   in substituting pukna for pugme, and rantisontai for baptisontai in S.
   Mark vii. 3 and 4:--while the interpolation of tassomenos after
   exousian in S. Matth. viii. 9, because, of the parallel place in S.
   Luke's Gospel; and the substitution of anthropos austepos ei (from S.
   Luke xix. 21) for sklero`s ei a'nthropos in S. Matth. xxv. 24, are
   proofs that yet another kind of corrupting influence has been here at
   work besides those which have been already specified.

   [146] Scrivener, Coll. Cod. Sin. p. xlvii.

   [147] Add to the authorities commonly appealed to for exelth.
   Chrys.^834 (twice,) (also quoted in Cramer's Cat.^241). The mistake
   adverted to in the text is at least as old as the time of Eusebius,
   (Mai, iv. p. 264 = 287), who asks,--Pos para to Matthaio he Magdalene
   Maria meta tes alles Marias exo tou mnematos heoraken ton hena angelon
   epikathemenon to litho tou mnematos, k.t.l.

   [148] Tischendorf accordingly is forced, for once, to reject the
   reading of his oracle ',--witnessed to though it be by Origen and
   Eusebius. His discussion of the text in this place is instructive and
   even diverting. How is It that such an instance as the present does not
   open the eyes of Prejudice itself to the danger of pinning its faith to
   the consentient testimony even of Origen, of Eusebius, and of Cod. '?
   . . . . The reader is reminded of what was offered above, in the lower
   part of p. 49.

   [149] A similar perversion of the truth of Scripture is found at S.
   Luke iv. 44, (cf. the parallel place, S. Matth. iv. 23: S. Mark i. 39).
   It does not mend the matter to find ' supported this time by Codd. B,
   C, L, Q, R.

   [150] S. Lu. xxiii. 45:--hoper oudepote proteron sunebe, all' e en
   Aigupto monon, hote to pascha teleisthai emelle; kai gar ekeina touton

   [151] hopos de me eiposi tines ekleipsin einai to gegenemenon, en te
   tessareskaidekate hemera tes selenes gegone to skotos:--hote ekleipsin

   Possin.) He makes the remark twice: first (p. 351) in the midst of an
   abridgment of the beginning of Chrysostom's 88th Homily on S. Matthew:
   next (p. 352) more fully, after quoting "the great Dionysius" of
   Alexandria. See also an interesting passage on the same subject in
   Cramer's Catena is Matth. p. 237,--from whom derived, I know not; but
   professing to be from Chrysostom. (Note, that the 10 lines ex
   anepigraphou, beginning p. 236, line 33 = Chrys. vii. 824, D, E.) The
   very next words in Chrysostom's published Homily (p. 825 A.) are as
   follows:---Hote gor ouk en ekleipsis, all' orge te kai aganaktesis, ouk
   enteuthen monon d?lon en, alla kai apo tou kairou; treis gar horas
   paremeinen, he de ekleipsis en mia ginetai kairou rhope.--Anyone who
   would investigate this matter further should by all means read
   Matthaei's long note on S. Luke xxiii. 45.

CHAPTER VII.

  MANUSCRIPT TESTIMONY SHEWN TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF THESE
  VERSES.--Part II.

   The other chief peculiarity of Codices B and ' (viz. the omission of
   the words en Epheso from Ephes. i. 1) considered.--Antiquity
   unfavourable to the omission of those words (p. 93).--The Moderns
   infelicitous in their attempts to account for their omission (p.
   100).--Marcion probably the author of this corruption of the Text of
   Scripture (p. 106).--Other peculiarities of Codex ' disposed of (p.
   109).

   THE subject which exclusively occupied our attention throughout the
   foregoing chapter admits of apt and powerful illustration. Its vast
   importance will be a sufficient apology for the particular disquisition
   which follows, and might have been spared, but for the plain challenge
   of the famous Critic to be named immediately.

   "There are two remarkable readings," (says Tischendorf, addressing
   English readers on this subject in 1868,) "which are very instructive
   towards determining the age of the manuscripts [' and B), and their
   authority." He proceeds to adduce,--

   1. The absence from both, of the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel,--concerning which, the reader probably thinks that by this time
   he has heard enough. Next,--

   2. He appeals to their omission of the words en Epheso from the first
   verse of S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians,--another peculiarity, in
   which Codd. ' and B stand quite alone among MSS.

   I. Here is an extraordinary note of sympathy between two copies of the
   New Testament indeed. Altogether unique is it: and that it powerfully
   corroborates the general opinion of their high antiquity, no one will
   deny. But how about "their authority"? Does the coincidence also raise
   our opinion of the trustworthiness of the Text, which these two MSS.
   concur in exhibiting? for that is the question which has to be
   considered,--the only question. The ancientness of a reading is one
   thing: its genuineness, (as I have explained elsewhere,) quite another.
   The questions are entirely distinct. It may even be added that while
   the one is really of little moment, the latter is of all the importance
   in the world. I am saying that it matters very little whether Codd. '
   and B were written in the beginning of the iv^th century, or in the
   beginning of the v^th: whereas it matters much, or rather it matters
   everything, whether they exhibit the Word of God faithfully, or
   occasionally with scandalous license. How far the reading which results
   from the suppression of the last two words in the phrase tois hagiois
   tois ousin en Epheso, is critically allowable or not, I forbear to
   inquire. That is not the point which we have to determine. The one
   question to be considered is,--May it possibly be the true reading of
   the text after all? Is it any way credible that S. Paul began his
   Epistle to the Ephesians as follows:--Paulos apo'stolos Iesou Christou
   dia` thele'matos Theou, tois agi'ois tois ousin kai` pistois en Christo
   Iesou? . . . If it be eagerly declared in reply that the thing is
   simply incredible: that the words en Ephe'so are required for the
   sense; and that the commonly received reading is no doubt the correct
   one: then,--there is an end of the discussion. Two extraordinary notes
   of sympathy between two Manuscripts will have been appealed to as
   crucial proofs of the trustworthiness of the Text of those Manuscripts:
   (for of their high Antiquity, let me say it once more, there can be no
   question whatever:) and it will have been proved in one case,--admitted
   in the other,--that the omission is unwarrantable.--If, however, on the
   contrary, it be maintained that the words en Ephe'so probably had no
   place in the original copy of this Epistle, but are to be regarded as
   an unauthorized addition to it,--then, (as in the case of the Twelve
   Verses omitted from the end of S. Mark's Gospel, and which it was also
   pretended are an unauthorized supplement,) we demand to be shewn the
   evidence on the strength of which this opinion is maintained, in order
   that we may ascertain what it is precisely worth.

   Tischendorf,--the illustrious discoverer and champion of Codex ', and
   who is accustomed to appeal triumphantly to its omission of the words
   en Ephe'so as the other conclusive proof of the trustworthiness of its
   text,--may be presumed to be the most able advocate it is likely to
   meet with, as well as the man best acquainted with what is to be urged
   in its support. From him, we learn that the evidence for the omission
   of the words in question is as follows:--"In the beginning of the
   Epistle to the Ephesians we read, to the saints which are at Ephesus;'
   but Marcion (A.D. 130-140), did not find the words at Ephesus' in his
   copy. The same is true of Origen (A.D. 185-254); and Basil the Great
   (who died A.D. 379), affirmed that those words were wanting in old
   copies. And this omission accords very well with the encyclical or
   general character of the Epistle. At the present day, our ancient Greek
   MSS., and all ancient Versions, contain the words at Ephesus;' yea
   (sic), even Jerome knew no copy with a different reading. Now, only the
   Sinaitic and the Vatican correspond with the old copies of Basil, and
   those of Origen and Marcion [153] ."--This then is the sum of the
   evidence. Proceed we to examine it somewhat in detail.

   (1) And first, I take leave to point out that the learned writer is
   absolutely without authority for his assertion that "Marcion did not
   find the words en Ephe'so in his copy" of S. Paul's Epistle to the
   Ephesians. Tischendorf's one pretence for saying so is Tertullian's
   statement that certain heretics, (Marcion he specifies by name,) had
   given to S. Paul's "Epistle to the Ephesians" the unauthorized title of
   "Epistle to the Laodiceans [154] ." This, (argues Tischendorf,) Marcion
   could not have done had he found en Ephe'so in the first verse [155] .
   But the proposed inference is clearly invalid. For, with what show of
   reason can Marcion,--whom Tertullian taxes with having dared "titulum
   interpolare" in the case of S. Paul's "Epistle to the Ephesians,"--be
   therefore, assumed to have read the first verse differently from
   ourselves? Rather is the directly opposite inference suggested by the
   very language in which Tertullian (who was all but the contemporary of
   Marcion) alludes to the circumstance [156] .

   Those, however, who would really understand the work of the heretic,
   should turn from the African Father,--(who after all does but say that
   Marcion and his crew feigned concerning S. Paul's Epistle to the
   Ephesians, that it was addressed to the Laodiceans,)--and betake
   themselves to the pages of Epiphanius, who lived about a century and a
   half later. This Father had for many years made Marcion's work his
   special study [157] , and has elaborately described it, as well as
   presented us with copious extracts from it [158] . And the account in
   Epiphanius proves that Tischendorf is mistaken in the statement which
   he addresses to the English reader, (quoted above;) and that he would
   have better consulted for his reputation if he had kept to the "ut
   videtur" with which (in his edition of 1859) he originally broached his
   opinion. It proves in fact to be no matter of opinion at all.
   Epiphanius states distinctly that the Epistle to the Ephesians was one
   of the ten Epistles of S. Paul which Marcion retained. In his
   "Apostolicon," or collection of the (mutilated) Apostolical Epistles,
   the "Epistle to the Ephesians," (identified by the considerable
   quotations which Epiphanius makes from it [159] ,) stood (he says)
   seventh in order; while the (so called) "Epistle to the Laodiceans,"--a
   distinct composition therefore,--had the eleventh, that is, the last
   place assigned to it [160] . That this latter Epistle contained a
   corrupt exhibition of Ephes. iv. 5 is true enough. Epiphanius records
   the fact in two places [161] . But then it is to be borne in mind that
   he charges Marcion with having derived that quotation from the
   Apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans [162] ; instead of taking it, as
   he ought to have done, from the genuine Epistle to the Ephesians. The
   passage, when faithfully exhibited, (as Epiphanius points out,) by its
   very form refutes the heretical tenet which the context of Marcion's
   spurious epistle to the Laodiceans was intended to establish; and which
   the verse in question, in its interpolated form, might seem to favour
   [163] .--I have entered into this whole question more in detail perhaps
   than was necessary: but I was determined to prove that Tischendorf's
   statement that "Marcion (A.D. 130-140) did not find the words at
   Ephesus' in his copy,"--is absolutely without foundation. It is even
   contradicted by the known facts of the case. I shall have something
   more to say about Marcion by-and-by; who, it is quite certain, read the
   text of Ephes. i. 1 exactly as we do.

   (2.) The only Father who so expresses himself as to warrant the
   inference that the words en Epheso were absent from his copy, is
   Origen, in the beginning of the third century. "Only in the case of the
   Ephesians," (he writes), "do we meet with the expression the Saints
   which are:' and we inquire,--Unless that additional phrase be simply
   redundant, what can it possibly signify? Consider, then, whether those
   who have been partakers of His nature who revealed Himself to Moses by
   the Name of I am, may not, in consequence of such union with Him, be
   designated as those which are:' persons, called out, of a state of
   not-being, so to speak, into a state of being [164] ."--Origen had read
   tois hagiois tois ousin en Epheso in his copy, it is to me incredible
   that he would have gone so very far out of his way to miss the sense of
   such a plain, and in fact, unmistakable an expression. Bishop
   Middleton, and Michaelis before him,--reasoning however only from the
   place in Basil, (to be quoted immediately,)--are unwilling to allow
   that the words en Epheso were ever away from the text. It must be
   admitted as the obvious inference from what Jerome has delivered on
   this subject (infrÃ , p. 98 note (s)) that he, too, seems to know
   nothing of the reading (if reading it can be called) of Codd. B and '.

   (3) The influence which Origen's writings exercised over his own and
   the immediately succeeding ages of the Church, was prodigious. Basil,
   bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, writing against the heresy of
   Eunomius about 150 years later,--although he read en Epheso in his own
   copy of S. Paul's Epistles,--thought fit to avail himself of Origen's
   suggestion. It suited his purpose. He was proving the eternal existence
   of the Son of God. Even not to know God (he remarks) is not to be: in
   proof of which, he quotes S. Paul's words in 1 Cor. i. 28:--"Things
   which are not, hath God chosen." "Nay," (he proceeds,) the same S.
   Paul, "in his Epistle to the Ephesians, inasmuch as he is addressing
   persons who by intimate knowledge were truly joined to Him who is,'
   designates them specially as those which are:' saying,--To the Saints
   which are, and faithful in Christ Jesus." That this fancy was not
   original, Basil makes no secret. He derived it, (he says,) from those
   who were before us;" a plain allusion to the writings of Origen. But
   neither was the reading his own, either. This is evident. He had found
   it, he says,--(an asseveration indispensable to the validity of his
   argument,)--but only after he had made search [165] ,--"in the old
   copies [166] ." No doubt, Origen's strange fancy must have been even
   unintelligible to Basil when first he met with it. In plain terms, it
   sounds to this day incredibly foolish,--when read apart from the
   mutilated text which alone suggested it to Origen's fervid imagination.
   --But what there is in all this to induce us to suspect that Origen's
   reading was after all the right one, and ours the wrong, I profess
   myself wholly at a loss to discover. Origen himself complains bitterly
   of the depraved state of the copies in his time; and attributes it (1)
   to the carelessness of the scribes: (2) to the rashness of correctors
   of the text: (3) to the licentiousness of individuals, adopting some of
   these corrections and rejecting others, according to their own private
   caprice [167] .

   (4) Jerome, a man of severer judgment in such matters than either
   Origen or Basil, after rehearsing the preceding gloss, (but only to
   reject it,) remarks that "certain persons" had been "over-fanciful" in
   putting it forth. He alludes probably to Origen, whose Commentary on
   the Ephesians, in three books, he expressly relates that he employed
   [168] : but he does not seem to have apprehended that Origen's text was
   without the words en Epheso. If he was acquainted with Origen's text,
   (of which, however, his writings afford no indication,) it is plain
   that he disapproved of it. Others, he says, understand S. Paul to say
   not "the Saints which are:" but,--"the Saints and faithful which are at
   Ephesus [169] ."

   (5) The witnesses have now all been heard: and I submit that there has
   been elicited from their united evidence nothing at all calculated to
   shake our confidence in the universally received reading of Ephesians
   i. 1. The facts of the case are so scanty that they admit of being
   faithfully stated in a single sentence. Two MSS. of the iv^th century,
   (exhibiting in other respects several striking notes of vicious
   sympathy,) are found to conspire in omitting a clause in Ephesians i.
   1, which, (necessary as it is to the sense,) may be inferred to have
   been absent from Origen's copy: and Basil testifies that it was absent
   from "the old copies" to which he himself obtained access. This is
   really the whole of the matter: in which it is much to be noted that
   Origen does not say that he approved of this reading. Still less does
   Basil. They both witness to the fact that the words en ?Ephe'so were
   omitted from some copies of the iii^rd century, just as Codd. B and ';
   witness to the same fact in the iv^th. But what then? Origen is known
   occasionally to go out of his way to notice readings confessedly
   worthless; and, why not here? For not only is the text all but
   unintelligible if the words en ?Ephe'so be omitted: but (what is far
   more to the purpose) the direct evidence of all the copies, whether
   uncial or cursive [170] ,--and of all the Versions,--is against the
   omission. In the face of this overwhelming mass of unfaltering evidence
   to insist that Codd. B and ' must yet be accounted right, and all the
   rest of Antiquity wrong, is simply irrational. To uphold the authority,
   in respect of this nonsensical reading, of two MSS. confessedly
   untrustworthy in countless other places,--against all the MSS.--all the
   Versions,--is nothing else but an act of vulgar prejudice. I venture to
   declare,--(and with this I shall close the discussion and dismiss the
   subject,)--that there does not exist one single instance in the whole
   of the New Testament of a reading even probably correct in which the
   four following notes of spurious origin concur,--which nevertheless are
   observed to attach to the two readings which have been chiefly
   discussed in the foregoing pages: viz.

   1. The adverse testimony of all the uncial MSS. except two.

   2. The adverse testimony of all, or very nearly all, the cursive MSS.

   3. The adverse testimony of all the Versions, without exception.

   4. The adverse testimony of the oldest Ecclesiastical Writers.

   To which if I do not add, as I reasonably might,--

   5. The highest inherent improbability,--

   it is only because I desire to treat this question purely as one of
   Evidence.

   II. Learned men have tasked their ingenuity to account for the
   phenomenon on which we have been bestowing so many words. The endeavour
   is commendable; but I take leave to remark in passing that if we are to
   set about discovering reasons at the end of fifteen hundred years for
   every corrupt reading which found its way into the sacred text during
   the first three centuries subsequent to the death of S. John, we shall
   have enough to do. Let any one take up the Codex Bezae, (with which, by
   the way, Cod. B shows marvellous sympathy [171] ,) and explain if he
   can why there is a grave omission, or else a gross interpolation, in
   almost every page; and how it comes to pass that Cod. D "reproduces the
   textus receptus' of the Acts much in the same way that one of the best
   Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew of the Old Testament; so wide are the
   variations in the diction, so constant and inveterate the practice of
   expounding the narrative by means of interpolations which seldom
   recommend themselves as genuine by even a semblance of internal
   probability [172] ," Our business as Critics is not to invent theories
   to account for the errors of Copyists; but rather to ascertain where
   they have erred, where not. What with the inexcusable depravations of
   early Heretics,--the preposterous emendations of ancient Critics,--the
   injudicious assiduity of Harmonizers,--the licentious caprice of
   individuals;--what with errors resulting from the inopportune
   recollection of similar or parallel places,--or from the familiar
   phraseology of the Ecclesiastical Lections,--or from the inattention of
   Scribes,--or from marginal glosses;--however arising, endless are the
   corrupt readings of the oldest MSS. in existence; and it is by no means
   safe to follow up the detection of a depravation of the text with a
   theory to account for its existence. Let me be allowed to say that such
   theories are seldom satisfactory. Guesses only they are at best.

   Thus, I profess myself wholly unable to accept the suggestion of
   Ussher,--(which, however, found favour with Garnier (Basil's editor),
   Bengel, Benson, and Michaelis; and has since been not only eagerly
   advocated by Conybeare and Howson following a host of German Critics,
   but has even enjoyed Mr. Scrivener's distinct approval;)--that the
   Epistle to the Ephesians "was a Circular addressed to other Asiatic
   Cities besides the capital Ephesus,--to Laodicea perhaps among the rest
   (Col. iv. 16); and that while some Codices may have contained the name
   of Ephesus in the first verse, others may have had another city
   substituted, or the space after toi?s ousinleft utterly void [173] ."
   At first sight, this conjecture has a kind of interesting plausibility
   which recommends it to our favour. On closer inspection,--(i) It is
   found to be not only gratuitous; but (ii) altogether unsupported and
   unsanctioned by the known facts of the case; and (what is most to the
   purpose) (iii) it is, as I humbly think, demonstrably erroneous. I
   demur to it,--

   (1) Because of its exceeding Improbability: for (a) when S. Paul sent
   his Epistle to the Ephesians we know that Tychicus, the bearer of it
   [174] , was charged with a distinct Epistle to the Colossians [175] :
   an Epistle nevertheless so singularly like the Epistle to the Ephesians
   that it is scarcely credible S. Paul would have written those two
   several Epistles to two of the Churches of Asia, and yet have sent only
   a duplicate of one of them, (that to the Ephesians,) furnished with a
   different address, to so large and important a place as Laodicea, for
   example. (b) Then further, the provision which S. Paul made at this
   very time for communicating with the Churches of Asia which he did not
   separately address is found to have been different. The Laodiceans were
   to read in their public assembly S. Paul's "Epistle to the Colossians,"
   which the Colossians were ordered to send them. The Colossians in like
   manner were to read the Epistle,--(to whom addressed, we know
   not),--which S. Paul describes as ten ek Laodikeias [176] . If then it
   had been S. Paul's desire that the Laodiceans (suppose) should read
   publicly in their Churches his Epistle to the Ephesians, surely, he
   would have charged the Ephesians to procure that his Epistle to them
   should be read in the Church of the Laodiceans. Why should the Apostle
   be gratuitously assumed to have simultaneously adopted one method with
   the Churches of Colosse and Laodicea,--another with the Churches of
   Ephesus and Laodicea,--in respect of his epistolary communications?

   (2) (a) But even supposing, for argument's sake, that S. Paul did send
   duplicate copies of his Epistle to the Ephesians to certain of the
   principal Churches of Asia Minor,--why should he have left the
   salutation blank, ("carta bianca," as Bengel phrases it [177] ,) for
   Tychicus to fill up when he got into Asia Minor? And yet, by the
   hypothesis, nothing short of this would account for the reading of
   Codd. B and '.

   (b) Let the full extent of the demand which is made on our good nature
   be clearly appreciated. We are required to believe that there was (1) A
   copy of what we call S. Paul's "Epistle to the Ephesians "sent into
   Asia Minor by S. Paul with a blank address; i.e. "with the space after
   tois ousin left utterly void:" (2) That Tychicus neglected to fill up
   that blank: and, (what is remarkable) (3) That no one was found to fill
   it up for him. Next, (4) That the same copy became the fontal source of
   the copy seen by Origen, and (5) Of the "old copies" seen by Basil; as
   well as (6) Of Codd. B and '. And even this is not all. The same
   hypothesis constrains us to suppose that, on the contrary, (7) One
   other copy of this same "Encyclical Epistle," filled up with the
   Ephesian address, became the archetype of every other copy of this
   Epistle in the world . . . . But of what nature, (I would ask,) is the
   supposed necessity for building up such a marvellous structure of
   hypothesis,--of which the top story overhangs and overbalances all the
   rest of the edifice? The thing which puzzles us in Codd. B and ' is not
   that we find the name of another City in the salutation of S. Paul's
   "Epistle to the Ephesians," but that we find the name of no city at
   all; nor meet with any vacant space there.

   (c) On the other hand, supposing that S. Paul actually did address to
   different Churches copies of the present Epistle, and was scrupulous
   (as of course he was) to fill in the addresses himself before the
   precious documents left his hands,--then, doubtless, each several
   Church would have received, cherished, and jealously guarded its own
   copy. But if this had been the case, (or indeed if Tychicus had filled
   up the blanks for the Apostle,) is it not simply incredible that we
   should never have heard a word about the matter until now?
   unaccountable, above all, that there should nowhere exist traces of
   conflicting testimony as to the Church to which S. Paul's Epistle to
   the Ephesians was addressed? whereas all the most ancient writers,
   without exception,--(Marcion himself [A.D.140 [178] ], the "Muratorian"
   fragment [A.D. 170 or earlier], Irenaeus [A.D.175], Clemens
   Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Origen, Dionysius Alexandrinus, Cyprian,
   Eusebius,)--and all copies wheresoever found, give one unvarying,
   unfaltering witness. Even in Cod. B. and Cod. ', (and this is much to
   be noted,) the superscription of the Epistle attests that it was
   addressed "to the Ephesians." Can we be warranted (I would respectfully
   inquire) in inventing facts in the history of an Apostle's practice, in
   order to account for what seems to be after all only an ordinary
   depravation of his text [179] ?

   (3) But, in fact, it is high time to point out that such "a Circular"
   as was described above, (each copy furnished with a blank, to be filled
   up with the name of a different City,) would be a document without
   parallel in the annals of the primitive Church. It is, as far as I am
   aware, essentially a modern notion. I suspect, in short, that the
   suggestion before us is only another instance of the fatal
   misapprehension which results from the incautious transfer of the
   notions suggested by some familiar word in a living language to its
   supposed equivalent in an ancient tongue. Thus, because kuklios or
   enkuklios confessedly signifies "circularis," it seems to be imagined
   that enkuklios epistole may mean "a Circular Letter." Whereas it really
   means nothing of the sort; but--"a Catholic Epistle [180] ."

   An "Encyclical," (and that is the word which has been imported into the
   present discussion), was quite a different document from what we call
   "a Circular." Addressed to no one Church or person in particular, it
   was Catholic or General,--the common property of all to whom it came.
   The General (or Catholic) Epistles of S. James, S. Peter, S. John are
   "Encyclical [181] ." So is the well-known Canonical Epistle which
   Gregory, Bp. of Neocaesaraea in Pontus, in the middle of the third
   century, sent to the Bishops of his province [182] . As for "a blank
   circular," to be filled up with the words "in Ephesus," "in Laodicea,"
   &c.,--its like (I repeat) is wholly unknown in the annals of
   Ecclesiastical Antiquity. The two notions are at all events
   inconsistent and incompatible. If S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians
   was "a Circular," then it was not "Encyclical:" if it was "Encyclical"
   then it was not "a Circular."

   Are we then deliberately to believe, (for to this necessity we are
   logically reduced,) that the Epistle which occupies the fifth place
   among S. Paul's writings, and which from the beginning of the second
   century,--that is, from the very dawn of Historical evidence,--has been
   known as "the Epistle to the Ephesians," was an "Encyclical," "Catholic
   "or "General Epistle,"--addressed tois agi'ois tois ousin, kai` pistois
   en Christo Iesou? There does not live the man who will accept so
   irrational a supposition. The suggestion therefore by which it has been
   proposed to account for the absence of the words en Ephe'so in Ephes.
   i. 1 is not only in itself in the highest degree improbable, and
   contradicted by all the evidence to which we have access; but it is
   even inadmissible on critical grounds, and must be unconditionally
   surrendered [183] . It is observed to collapse before every test which
   can be applied to it.

   III. Altogether marvellous in the meantime it is to me,--if men must
   needs account for the omission of the words en Epheso from this
   place,--that they should have recourse to wild, improbable, and wholly
   unsupported theories, like those which go before; while an easy,--I was
   going to say the obvious,--solution of the problem is close at hand,
   and even solicits acceptance.

   Marcion the heretic, (A.D. 140) is distinctly charged by Tertullian
   (A.D. 200), and by Jerome a century and a half later, with having
   abundantly mutilated the text of Scripture, and of S. Paul's Epistles
   in particular. Epiphanius compares the writing which Marcion tampered
   with to a moth-eaten coat [184] . "Instead of a stylus," (says
   Tertullian,) "Marcion employed a knife." "What wonder if he omits
   syllables, since often he omits whole pages [185] ?" S. Paul's Epistle
   to the Ephesians, Tertullian even singles out by name; accusing Marcion
   of having furnished it with a new title. All this has been fully
   explained above, from page 93 to page 96.

   Now, that Marcion recognised as S. Paul's Epistle "to the Ephesians"
   that Apostolical writing which stands fifth in our Canon, (but which
   stood seventh in his,) is just as certain as that he recognised as such
   S. Paul's Epistles to the Galatians, Corinthians, Romans,
   Thessalonians, Colossians, Philippians. All this has been fully
   explained in a preceding page [186] .

   But it is also evident that Marcion put forth as S. Paul's another
   Epistle,--of which all we know for certain is, that it contained
   portions of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and purported to be addressed
   by S. Paul "to the Laodiceans." To ascertain with greater precision the
   truth of this matter at the end of upwards of seventeen centuries is
   perhaps impossible. Nor is it necessary. Obvious is it to suspect that
   not only did this heretical teacher at some period of his career prefix
   a new heading to certain copies of the Epistle to the Ephesians, but
   also that some of his followers industriously erased from certain other
   copies the words en Epheso in ver. 1,--as being the only two words in
   the entire Epistle which effectually refuted their Master. It was not
   needful, (be it observed,) to multiply copies of the Epistle for the
   propagation of Marcion's deceit. Only two words had to be erased,--the
   very two words whose omission we are trying to account for,--in order
   to give some colour to his proposed attribution of the Epistle, ("quasi
   in isto diligentissimus explorator,")--to the Laodiceans. One of these
   mutilated copies will have fallen into the hands of Origen,--who often
   complains of the corrupt state of his text: while the critical
   personages for whom Cod. B and Cod. ' were transcribed will probably
   have been acquainted with other such mutilated copies. Are we not led,
   as it were by the hand, to take some such view of the case? In this way
   we account satisfactorily, and on grounds of historic evidence, for the
   omission which has exercised the Critics so severely.

   I do not lose sight of the fact that the Epistle to the Ephesians ends
   without salutations, without personal notices of any kind. But in this
   respect it is not peculiar [187] . That,--joined to a singular absence
   of identifying allusion,--sufficiently explains why Marcion selected
   this particular Epistle for the subject of his fraud. But, to infer
   from this circumstance, in defiance of the Tradition of the Church
   Universal, and in defiance of its very Title, that the Epistle is
   Encyclical,' in the technical sense of that word; and to go on to urge
   this characteristic as an argument in support of the omission of the
   words en Epheso,--is clearly the device of an eager Advocate; not the
   method of a calm and unprejudiced Judge. True it is that S. Paul,--who,
   writing to the Corinthians from Ephesus, says "the Churches of Asia
   salute you," (1 Cor. xvi. 19,)--may have known very well that an
   Epistle of his "to the Ephesians," would, as a matter of course, be
   instantly communicated to others besides the members of that particular
   Church: and in fact this may explain why there is nothing specially
   "Ephesian" in the contents of the Epistle. The Apostle,--(as when he
   addressed "the Churches of Galatia,")--may have had certain of the
   other neighbouring Churches in his mind while he wrote. But all this is
   wholly foreign to the question before us: the one only question being
   this,--Which of the three following addresses represents what S. Paul
   must be considered to have actually written in the first verse of his
   "Epistle to the Ephesians"?--

   (1) tois agi'ois tois ousin en Ephe'so kai` pistois en Ch. I.

   (2) tois agi'ois tois ousin en . . . . . . kai` pistois en Ch. I.

   (3) tois agi'ois tois ousi, kai` pistois en Ch. I.

   What I have been saying amounts to this: that it is absolutely
   unreasonable for men to go out of their way to invent a theory wanting
   every element of probability in order to account for the omission of
   the words en Ephe'so from S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians; while
   they have under their eyes the express testimony of a competent witness
   of the ii^nd century that a certain heretic, named Marcion, "presumed
   to prefix an unauthorized title to that very Epistle," ("Marcion ei
   titulum aliquando interpolare gestiit,")--which title obviously could
   not stand unless those two words were first erased from the text. To
   interpolate that new title, and to erase the two words which were
   plainly inconsistent with it, were obviously correlative acts which
   must always have been performed together.

   But however all this may be, (as already pointed out,) the only
   question to be determined by us is,--whether it be credible that the
   words en Ephe'so are an unauthorized addition; foisted into the text of
   Ephes. i. 1 as far back as the Apostolic age: an interpolation which,
   instead of dying out, and at last all but disappearing, has spread and
   established itself, until the words are found in every copy,--are
   represented in every translation,--have been recognised in every
   country,--witnessed to by every Father,--received in every age of the
   Church? I repeat that the one question which has to be decided is, not
   how the words en Ephe'so came to be put in, or came to be left out; but
   simply whether, on an impartial review of the evidence, it be
   reasonable (with Tischendorf, Tregelles, Conybeare and Howson, and so
   many more,) to suspect their genuineness and enclose them in brackets?
   Is it credible that the words en Ephe'so are a spurious and
   unauthorized addition to the inspired autograph of the Apostle? . . .
   We have already, as I think, obtained a satisfactory answer to this
   question. It has been shown, as conclusively as in inquiries of this
   nature is possible, that in respect of the reading of Ephesians i. 1,
   Codd. B and ' are even most conspicuously at fault.

   IV. But if these two Codices are thus convicted of error in respect of
   the one remaining text which their chief upholders have selected, and
   to which they still make their most confident appeal,--what remains,
   but to point out that it is high time that men should be invited to
   disabuse their minds of the extravagant opinion which they have been so
   industriously taught to entertain of the value of the two Codices in
   question? It has already degenerated into an unreasoning prejudice, and
   threatens at last to add one more to the already overgrown catalogue of
   "vulgar errors."

   V. I cannot, I suppose, act more fairly by Tischendorf than by
   transcribing in conclusion his remarks on the four remaining readings
   of Codex ' to which he triumphantly appeals: promising to dismiss them
   all with a single remark. He says, (addressing unlearned readers,) in
   his "Introduction" to the Tauchnitz (English) New Testament [188] :--

   "To these examples, others might be added. Thus, Origen says on John i.
   4, that in some copies it was written, in Him is life,' for in Him was
   life.' This is a reading which we find in sundry quotations before the
   time of Origen [189] ; but now, among all known Greek MSS. it is only
   in the Sinaitic, and the famous old Codex Bezae, a copy of the Gospels
   at Cambridge; yet it is also found in most of the early Latin versions,
   in the most ancient Syriac, and in the oldest Coptic.--Again, in Matth.
   xiii. 35, Jerome observes that in the third century Porphyry, the
   antagonist of Christianity, had found fault with the Evangelist Matthew
   for having said, which was spoken by the prophet Esaias.' A writing of
   the second century had already witnessed to the same reading; but
   Jerome adds further that well-informed men had long ago removed the
   name of Esaias. Among all our MSS. of a thousand years old and upwards,
   there is not a solitary example containing the name of .Esaias in the
   text referred to,--except the Sinaitic, to which a few of less than a
   thousand years old may be added.--Once more, Origen quotes John xiii.
   10 six times; but only the Sinaitic and several ancient Latin MSS. read
   it the same as Origen: He that is washed needeth not to wash, but is
   clean every whit.'--In John vi. 51, also, where the reading is very
   difficult to settle, the Sinaitic is alone among all Greek copies
   indubitably correct; and Tertullian, at the end of the second century,
   confirms the Sinaitic reading: If any man eat of my bread, he shall
   live for ever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is
   my flesh.' We omit to indicate further illustrations of this kind,
   although there are many others like them [190] ."

   Let it be declared without offence, that there appears to exist in the
   mind of this illustrious Critic a hopeless confusion between the
   antiquity of a Codex and the value of its readings. I venture to assert
   that a reading is valuable or the contrary, exactly in proportion to
   the probability of its being true or false. Interesting it is sure to
   be, be it what it may, if it be found in a very ancient
   codex,--interesting and often instructive: but the editor of Scripture
   must needs bring every reading, wherever found, to this test at
   last:--Is it to be thought that what I am here presented with is what
   the Evangelist or the Apostle actually wrote? If an answer in the
   negative be obtained to this question, then, the fact that one, or two,
   or three of the early Fathers appear to have so read the place, will
   not avail to impart to the rejected reading one particle of value. And
   yet Tischendorf thinks it enough in all the preceding passages to
   assure his reader that a given reading in Cod. ' was recognised by
   Origen, by Tertullian, by Jerome. To have established this one point he
   evidently thinks sufficient. There is implied in all this an utterly
   false major premiss: viz. That Scriptural quotations found in the
   writings of Origen, of Tertullian, of Jerome, must needs be the
   ipsissima verba of the Spirit. Whereas it is notorious "that the worst
   corruptions to which the New Testament has ever been subjected
   originated within a hundred years after it was composed: that Irenaeus
   and the whole Western, with a portion of the Syrian Church, used far
   inferior manuscripts to those employed by Stunica, or Erasmus, or
   Stephens, thirteen centuries later, when moulding the Textus Receptus
   [191] ." And one is astonished that a Critic of so much sagacity, (who
   of course knows better,) should deliberately put forth so gross a
   fallacy,--not only without a word of explanation, a word of caution,
   but in such a manner as inevitably to mislead an unsuspecting reader.
   Without offence to Dr. Tischendorf, I must be allowed to declare that,
   in the remarks we have been considering, he shows himself far more bent
   on glorifying the "Codex Sinaiticus" than in establishing the Truth of
   the pure Word of God. He convinces me that to have found an early
   uncial Codex, is every bit as fatal as to have "taken a gift." Verily,
   "it doth blind the eyes of the wise [192] ."

   And with this, I shall conclude my remarks on these two famous Codices.
   I humbly record my deliberate conviction that when the Science of
   Textual Criticism, which is at present only in its infancy, comes to be
   better understood; (and a careful collation of every existing Codex of
   the New Testament is one indispensable preliminary to its being ever
   placed on a trustworthy basis;) a very different estimate will be
   formed of the importance of not a few of those readings which at
   present are received with unquestioning submission, chiefly on the
   authority of Codex B and Codex '. On the other hand, it is perfectly
   certain that no future collations, no future discoveries, will ever
   make it credible that the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel are a
   spurious supplement to the Evangelical Narrative; or that the words en
   Ephe'so are an unauthorized interpolation of the inspired Text.

   And thus much concerning Codex B and Codex '.

   I would gladly have proceeded at once to the discussion of the
   "Internal Evidence," but that the external testimony commonly appealed
   to is not yet fully disposed of. There remain to be considered certain
   ancient "Scholia" and "Notes," and indeed whatever else results from
   the critical inspection of ancient MSS., whether uncial or cursive:
   and. all this may reasonably claim one entire Chapter to itself.

   from pp. 312-7; 318-321. [Note, by the way, the gross blunder which has
   crept into the printed text of Epiphanius at p. 321 D: pointed out long
   since by Jones, On the Canon, ii. 38.] His plan is excellent. Marcion
   had rejected every Gospel except S. Luke's, and of S. Paul's Epistles
   had retained only ten,--viz. (1st) Galatians, (2nd and 3rd) I and II
   Corinthians, (4th) Romans, (5th and 6th) I and II Thessalonians, (7th)
   Ephesians, (8th) Colossians, (9th) Philemon, (10th) Philippians. Even
   these he had mutilated and depraved. And yet out of that one mutilated
   Gospel, Epiphanius selects 78 passages, (pp. 312-7), and out of those
   ten mutilated Epistles, 40 passages more (pp. 318-21); by means of
   which 118 texts he undertakes to refute the heresy of Marcion. (pp.
   322-50: 350-74.) [It will be perceived that Tertullian goes over
   Marcion's work in much the same way.] . . Very beautiful, and well
   worthy of the student's attention, (though it comes before us in a
   somewhat incorrect form,) is the remark of Epiphanius concerning the

   67), collated by Alter (N. T. 1786, vol. ii. pp. 415-558), who says of
   it (p. 496),--"cod. en epheso punctis notat." The MS. must have a
   curious history. H. Treschow describes it in his Tentamen Descriptionis

   [179] e. Let it be clearly understood by the advocates of this
   expedient for accounting for the state of the text of Codd. D. and '.,
   that nothing whatever is gained for the credit of those two MSS. by
   their ingenuity. Even if we grant them all they ask, the Codices in
   question remain, by their own admission, defective. Quite plain is it,
   by the very hypothesis, that one of two courses alone remains open to
   them in editing the text: either (1) To leave a blank space after toi?s
   ousin: or else, (2) To let the words en Ephe'so stand,--which I
   respectfully suggest is the wisest thing they can do. [For with
   Conybeare and Howson (Life and Letters of S. Paul, ii. 491), to eject
   the words "at Ephesus" from the text of Ephes. i. 1, and actually to
   substitute in their room the words "in Laodicea,"--is plainly abhorrent
   to every principle of rational criticism. The remarks of C. and H. on
   this subject (pp. 486 ff) have been faithfully met and sufficiently
   disposed of by Dean Alford (vol. iii. Prolegg. pp.13-8); who infers,
   "in accordance with the prevalent belief of the Church in all ages,
   that this Epistle was veritably addressed to the Saints is Ephesus, and
   to no other Church."] In the former case, they will be exhibiting a
   curiosity; viz. they will be shewing us how (they think) a duplicate
   ("carts bianca") copy of the Epistle looked with "the space after tois
   ousin left utterly void:" in the latter, they will be representing the
   archetypal copy which was sent to the Metropolitan see of Ephesus. But
   by printing the text thus,--tois agi'ois tois ousin [en Ephe'so] kai`
   pistois k.t.l., they are acting on an entirely different theory. They
   are merely testifying their mistrust of the text of every MS. in the
   world except Codd. B and '. This is clearly to forsake the "Encyclical"
   hypothesis altogether, and to put Ephes. i. 1 on the same footing as
   any other disputed text of Scripture which can be named.

   [183] "On the whole," says Bishop Middleton, (Doctrine of the Greek
   Art. p. 355) "I see nothing so probable as the opinion of Macknight (on
   Col. iv. 16,)--that the Apostle sent the Ephesians word by Tychicus,
   who carried their letter, to send a copy of it to the Laodiceans; with
   an order to them to communicate it to the Colossians.'"--This
   suggestion is intended to meet another difficulty, and leaves the
   question of the reading of Ephes. i. 1 untouched. It proposes only to
   explain what S. Paul means by the enigmatical expression which is found
   in Col. iv. 16. Macknight's suggestion, though it has found favour with
   many subsequent Divines, appears to me improbable in a high degree. S.
   Paul is found not to have sent the Colossians "word by Tychicus, who
   carried their letter, to send a copy of it to the Laodiceans." He
   charged them, himself, to do so. Why? at the same instant, is the
   Apostle to be thought to have adopted two such different methods of
   achieving one and the same important end? And why, instead of this
   roundabout method of communication, were not the Ephesians ordered,--if
   not by S. Paul himself, at least by Tychicus,--to send a copy of their
   Epistle to Colosse direct? And why do we find the Colossians charged to
   read publicly ten ek Laodikeias, which (by the hypothesis) would have
   been only a copy,--instead of ten ex Ephesou, which, (by the same
   hypothesis,) would have been the original? Nay, why is it not
   designated by S. Paul, ten pros Ephephious,--(if indeed it was his
   Epistle to the Ephesians which is alluded to,) instead of ten ek
   Laodikeias; which would hardly be an intelligible way of indicating the
   document? Lastly, why are not the Colossians ordered to communicate a
   copy of their Epistle to the illustrious Church of the Ephesians also,
   which had been originally addressed by S. Paul? If the Colossians must
   needs read the Epistle (so like their own) which the Apostle had just
   written to the Ephesians, surely the Ephesians must also be supposed to
   have required a sight of the Epistle which S. Paul had at the same time
   written to the Colossians!

   [189] One is rather surprised to find the facts of the case so unfairly
   represented in addressing unlearned readers; who are entitled to the
   largest amount of ingenuousness, and to entire sincerity of statement.
   The facts are these:-- (1) Valentt. (apud Irenaeum), (2) Clemens Alex.,
   and (3) Theodotus (apud Clem.) read esti: but then (1) Irenaeus
   himself, (2) Clemens Alex., and (8) Theodotus (apud Clem.) also read
   en. These testimonies, therefore, clearly neutralize each other.
   Cyprian also has both readings.--Hippolytus, on the other hand, reads
   esti; but Origen, (though he remarks that esti is "perhaps not an
   improbable reading,") reads en ten or eleven times. Enis also the
   reading of Eusebius, of Chrysostom, of Cyril, of Nonnus, of
   Theodoret,--of the Vulgate, of the Memphitic, of the Peshito, and of
   the Philoxenian Versions; as well as of B, A, C,--in fact of all the
   MSS. in the world, except of ' and D. All that remains to be set on the
   other side are the Thebaic and Cureton's Syriac, together with most
   copies of the early Latin. And now, with the evidence thus all before
   us, will any one say that it is lawfully a question for discussion
   which of these two readings must exhibit the genuine text of S. John i.
   4? (For I treat it as a question of authority, and reason from the
   evidence,--declining to import into the argument what may be called
   logical considerations; though I conceive them to be all on my side.) I
   suspect, in fact, that the inveterate practice of the primitive age of
   reading the place after the following strange fashion,--o` ge'gonen en
   auto zoe` en was what led to this depravation of the text. Cyril in his
   Commentary [heading of lib. i, c. vi.] so reads S. John i. 3, 4. And to
   substitute esti (for en) in such a sentence as that, was obvious. . . .
   Chrysostom's opinion is well known, "Let us beware of putting the full
   stop" (he says) "at the words oude` e'n,--as do the heretics." [He
   alludes to Valentinus, Heracleon (Orig. Opp. i. 130), and to Theodotus
   (apud Clem. Alex.). But it must be confessed that Irenaeus, Hippolytus
   (Routh, Opusc. i. 68), Clemens Alex., Origen, Concil. Antioch. (A.D.
   269, Routh iii. 293), Theophilus Antioch., Athanasius, Cyril of
   Jer.,--besides of the Latins, Tertullian, Lactantius, Victorinus (Routh
   iii. 459), and Augustine,--point the place in the same way. "It is
   worth our observation," (says Pearson,) "that Eusebius citing the place
   of S. John to prove that the Holy Ghost was made by the Son, leaves out
   those words twice together by which the Catholics used to refute that
   heresy of the Arians, viz. o` ge'gonen."] Chrysostom proceeds,--"In
   order to make out that the Spirit is a creature, they read Ho ge'gonen,
   en auto zoe` en; by which means, the Evangelist's language is made
   unintelligible." (Opp. viii. 40.)--This punctuation is nevertheless
   adopted by Tregelles,--but not by Tischendorf. The Peshito, Epiphanius
   (quoted in Pearson's note, referred to infrÃ ), Cyprian, Jerome and the
   Vulgate divide the sentence as we do.--See by all means on this subject
   Pearson's note (z), Art. viii, (ii. p. 262 ed. Burton). Also Routh's
   Opusc. i. 88-9.

   [190] It may not be altogether useless that I should follow this famous
   Critic of the text of the N. T. over the ground which he has himself
   chosen. He challenges attention for the four following readings of the
   Codes Sinaiticus:-- (1.) S. John i. 4: en auto zoe estin.--(2.) S.
   Matth. xiii. 35: to rethen dia esaiou tou prophetou.--(3.) S. John
   xiii. 10: o leloumenos ouch echi chreian nipsasthai.--(4.) S. John vi.
   51: an tis phage ek tou emou artou, zesei eis ton aiona;--o artos on
   ego doso uper tes tou kosmou zoes e sarx mou estin. (And this, Dr.
   Tischendorf asserts to be "indubitably correct.") On inspection, these
   four readings prove to be exactly what might have been anticipated from
   the announcement that they are almost the private property of the
   single Codex '. The last three are absolutely worthless. They stand
   self-condemned. To examine is to reject them: the second (of which
   Jerome says something very different from what Tisch. pretends) and
   fourth being only two more of those unskilful attempts at critical
   emendation of the inspired Text, of which this Codex contains so many
   sorry specimens: the third being clearly nothing else but the result of
   the carelessness of the transcriber. Misled by the like ending
   (homoioteleuton) he has dropped a line: thus:-- OUCh EChI ChREIAN [EI

CHAPTER VIII.

  THE PURPORT OF ANCIENT SCHOLIA, AND NOTES IN MSS. ON THE SUBJECT OF THESE
  VERSES, SHEWN TO BE THE REVERSE OF WHAT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED.

   Later Editors of the New Testament the victims of their predecessors'
   inaccuracies.--Birch's unfortunate mistake (p. 117).--Schol's serious
   blunders (p. 119 and pp. 120-1).--Griesbach's sweeping misstatement
   (pp. 121-2).--The grave misapprehension which has resulted from all
   this inaccuracy of detail (pp. 122-3).

   Codex L (p. 123).--Ammonius not the author of the so-called "Ammonian"
   Sections (p. 125).--Epiphanius (p. 132).--"Caesarius," a
   misnomer.--"The Catenae," misrepresented (p. 133).

   IN the present Chapter, I propose to pass under review whatever
   manuscript testimony still remains unconsidered; our attention having
   been hitherto exclusively devoted to Codices B and '. True, that the
   rest of the evidence may be disposed of in a single short
   sentence:--The Twelve Verses under discussion are found in every copy
   of the Gospels in existence with the exception of Codices B and '. But
   then,

   I. We are assured,--(by Dr. Tregelles for example,)--that "a Note or a
   Scholion stating the absence of these verses from many, from most, or
   from the most correct copies (often from Victor or Severus) is found in
   twenty-five other cursive Codices [193] ." Tischendorf has nearly the
   same words: "Scholia" (he says) "in very many MSS. state that the
   Gospel of Mark in the most ancient (and most accurate) copies ended at
   the ninth verse." That distinguished Critic supports his assertion by
   appealing to seven MSS. in particular,--and referring generally to
   "about twenty-five others." Dr. Davidson adopts every word of this
   blindfold.

   1. Now of course if all that precedes were true, this department of the
   Evidence would become deserving of serious attention. But I simply deny
   the fact. I entirely deny that the "Note or Scholion" which these
   learned persons affirm to be of such frequent occurrence has any
   existence whatever,--except in their own imaginations. On the other
   hand, I assert that notes or scholia which state the exact reverse,
   (viz. that "in the older" or "the more accurate copies" the last twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel are contained,) recur even perpetually. The
   plain truth is this:--These eminent persons have taken their
   information at second-hand,--partly from Griesbach, partly from
   Scholz,--without suspicion and without inquiry. But then they have
   slightly misrepresented Scholz; and Scholz (1830) slightly
   misunderstood Griesbach; and Griesbach (1796) took liberties with
   Wetstein; and Wetstein (1751) made a few serious mistakes. The
   consequence might have been anticipated. The Truth, once thrust out of
   sight, certain erroneous statements have usurped its place,--which
   every succeeding Critic now reproduces, evidently to his own entire
   satisfaction; though not, it must be declared, altogether to his own
   credit. Let me be allowed to explain in detail what has occurred.

   2. Griesbach is found to have pursued the truly German plan of setting
   down all the twenty-five MSS. [194] and all the five Patristic
   authorities which up to his time had been cited as bearing on the
   genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20: giving the former in numerical order,
   and stating generally concerning them that in one or other of those
   authorities it would be found recorded "that the verses in question
   were anciently wanting in some, or in most, or in almost all the Greek
   copies, or in the most accurate ones:--or else that they were found in
   a few, or in the more accurate copies, or in many, or in most of them,
   specially in the Palestinian Gospel." The learned writer (who had made
   up his mind long before that the verses in question are to be rejected)
   no doubt perceived that this would be the most convenient way of
   disposing of the evidence for and against: but one is at a loss to
   understand how English scholars can have acquiesced in such a slipshod
   statement for well nigh a hundred years. A very little study of the
   subject would have shown them that Griesbach derived the first eleven
   of his references from Wetstein [195] , the last fourteen from Birch
   [196] . As for Scholz, he unsuspiciously adopted Griesbach's fatal
   enumeration of Codices; adding five to the number; and only
   interrupting the series here and there, in order to insert the
   quotations which Wetstein had already supplied from certain of them.
   With Scholz, therefore, rests the blame of everything which has been
   written since 1830 concerning the MS. evidence for this part of S.
   Mark's Gospel; subsequent critics having been content to adopt his
   statements without acknowledgment and without examination.
   Unfortunately Scholz did his work (as usual) in such a slovenly style,
   that besides perpetuating old mistakes he invented new ones; which, of
   course, have been reproduced by those who have simply translated or
   transcribed him. And now I shall examine his note "(z) [197] ", with
   which practically all that has since been delivered on this subject by
   Tischendorf, Tregelles, Davidson, and the rest, is identical.

   (1.) Scholz (copying Griesbach) first states that in two MSS. in the
   Vatican Library [198] the verses in question "are marked with an
   asterisk." The original author of this statement was Birch, who
   followed it up by explaining the fatal signification of this mark [199]
   . From that day to this, the asterisks in Codd. Vatt. 756 and 757 have
   been religiously reproduced by every Critic in turn; and it is
   universally taken for granted that they represent two ancient witnesses
   against the genuineness of the last twelve verses of the Gospel
   according to S. Mark.

   And yet, (let me say it without offence,) a very little attention ought
   to be enough to convince any one familiar with this subject that the
   proposed inference is absolutely inadmissible. For, in the first place,
   a solitary asterisk (not at all a rare phenomenon in ancient MSS. [200]
   ) has of necessity no such signification. And even if it does sometimes
   indicate that all the verses which follow are suspicious, (of which,
   however, I have never seen an example,) it clearly could not have that
   signification here,--for a reason which I should have thought an
   intelligent boy might discover.

   Well aware, however, that I should never be listened to, with Birch and
   Griesbach, Scholz and Tischendorf, and indeed every one else against
   me,--I got a learned friend at Rome to visit the Vatican Library for
   me, and inspect the two Codices in question [201] . That he would find
   Birch right in his facts, I had no reason to doubt; but I much more
   than doubted the correctness of his proposed inference from them. I
   even felt convinced that the meaning and purpose of the asterisks in
   question would be demonstrably different from what Birch had imagined.

   Altogether unprepared was I for the result. It is found that the
   learned Dane has here made one of those (venial, but) unfortunate
   blunders to which every one is liable who registers phenomena of this
   class in haste, and does not methodize his memoranda until he gets
   home. To be brief,--there proves to be no asterisk at all,--either in
   Cod. 756, or in Cod. 757.

   On the contrary. After ephobounto gar, the former Codex has, in the
   text of S. Mark xvi. 9 (fol. 150 b), a plain cross,--(not an asterisk,
   thus , but a cross, thus +),--the intention of which is to refer the
   reader to an annotation on fol. 151 b, (marked, of course, with a cross
   also,) to the effect that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is undoubtedly genuine
   [202] . The evidence, therefore, not only breaks hopelessly down; but
   it is discovered that this witness has been by accident put into the
   wrong box. This is, in fact, a witness not for the plaintiff, but for
   the defendant!--As for the other Codex, it exhibits neither asterisk
   nor cross; but contains the same note or scholion attesting the
   genuineness of the last twelve verses of S. Mark.

   I suppose I may now pass on: but I venture to point out that unless the
   Witnesses which remain to be examined are able to produce very
   different testimony from that borne by the last two, the present
   inquiry cannot be brought to a close too soon. ("I took thee to curse
   mine enemies, and, behold, thou halt blessed them altogether.")

   (2.) In Codd. 20 and 300 (Scholz proceeds) we read as follows:--"From
   here to the end forms no part of the text in some of the copies. In the
   ancient copies, however, it all forms part of the text [203] ." Scholz
   (who was the first to adduce this important testimony to the
   genuineness of the verses now under consideration) takes no notice of
   the singular circumstance that the two MSS. he mentions have been
   exactly assimilated in ancient times to a common model; and that they
   correspond one with the other so entirely [204] that the foregoing
   rubrical annotation appears in the wrong place in both of them, viz. at
   the close of ver. 15, where it interrupts the text. This was,
   therefore, once a scholion written in the margin of some very ancient
   Codex, which has lost its way in the process of transcription; (for
   there can be no doubt that it was originally written against ver. 8.)
   And let it be noted that its testimony is express; and that it avouches
   for the fact that "in the ancient copies," S. Mark xvi. 9-20 "formed
   part of the text."

   (3.) Yet more important is the record contained in the same two MSS.,
   (of which also Scholz says nothing,) viz. that they exhibit a text
   which had been "collated with the ancient and approved copies at
   Jerusalem [205] ." What need to point out that so remarkable a
   statement, taken in conjunction with the express voucher that "although
   some copies of the Gospels are without the verses under discussion, yet
   that in the ancient copies all the verses are found," is a critical
   attestation to the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9 to 20, far outweighing
   the bare statement (next to be noticed) of the undeniable historical
   fact that, "in some copies," S. Mark ends at ver. 8,--but "in many does
   not"?

   (4.) Scholz proceeds:--"In Cod. 22, after ephobounto gar + telos is
   read the following rubric:"--

   en tisi ton antigraphon heos hode pleroutai ho euangelis`tes; en
   pollois de kai tauta pheretai [206] .

   And the whole of this statement is complacently copied by all
   subsequent Critics and Editors,--cross, and "telos," and all,--as an
   additional ancient attestation to the fact that "The End" (telos) of S.
   Mark's Gospel is indeed at ch. xvi. 8. Strange,--incredible
   rather,--that among so many learned persons, not one should have
   perceived that "telos" in this place merely denotes that here a
   well-known Ecclesiastical section comes to an end! . . . As far,
   therefore, as the present discussion is concerned, the circumstance is
   purely irrelevant [207] ; and, (as I propose to shew in Chapter XI,)
   the less said about it by the opposite party, the better.

   (5.) Scholz further states that in four, (he means three,) other
   Codices very nearly the same colophon as the preceding recurs, with an
   important additional clause. In Codd. 1, 199, 206, 209, (he says) is
   read,--

   "In certain of the copies, the Evangelist finishes here; up to which
   place Eusebius the friend of Pamphilus canonized. In other copies,
   however, is found as follows [208] ." And then comes the rest of S.
   Mark's Gospel.

   I shall have more to say about this reference to Eusebius, and what he
   "canonized," by-and-by. But what is there in all this, (let me in the
   meantime ask), to recommend the opinion that the Gospel of S. Mark was
   published by its Author in an incomplete state; or that the last twelve
   verses of it are of spurious origin?

   (6.) The reader's attention is specially invited to the imposing
   statement which follows. Codd. 23, 34, 39, 41, (says Scholz,) "contain
   these words of Severus of Antioch:--

   "In the more accurate copies, the Gospel according to Mark has its end
   at for they were afraid.' In some copies, however, this also is
   added,--Now when He was risen,' &c. This, however, seems to contradict
   to some extent what was before delivered," &c.

   It may sound fabulous, but it is strictly true, that every word of
   this, (unsuspiciously adopted as it has been by every Critic who has
   since gone over the same ground,) is a mere tissue of mistakes. For
   first,--Cod. 23 contains nothing whatever pertinent to the present
   inquiry. (Scholz, evidently through haste and inadvertence, has
   confounded his own "23" with "Coisl. 23," but "Coisl. 23" is his
   "39,"--of which by-and-by. This reference therefore has to be
   cancelled.)--Cod. 41 contains a scholion of precisely the opposite
   tendency: I mean, a scholion which avers that the accurate copies of S.
   Mark's Gospel contain these last twelve verses. (Scholz borrowed this
   wrong reference from Wetstein,--who, by an oversight, quotes Cod. 41
   three times instead of twice.)--There remain but Codd. 34 and 39; and
   in neither of those two manuscripts, from the first page of S. Mark's
   Gospel to the last, does there exist any "scholion of Severus of
   Antioch" whatever. Scholz, in a word, has inadvertently made a gross
   misstatement [209] ; and every Critic who has since written on this
   subject has adopted his words,--without acknowledgment and without
   examination. . . . . Such is the evidence on which it is proposed to
   prove that S. Mark did not write the last twelve verses of his Gospel!

   (7.) Scholz proceeds to enumerate the following twenty-two
   Codices:--24, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 108, 129, 137, 138, 143, 181,
   186, 195, 199, 206, 209, 210, 221, 222. And this imposing catalogue is
   what has misled Tischendorf, Tregelles and the rest. They have not
   perceived that it is a mere transcript of Griesbach's list; which
   Scholz interrupts only to give from Cod. 24, (imperfectly and at
   second-hand,) the weighty scholion, (Wetstein had given it from Cod.
   41,) which relates, on the authority of an eye-witness, that S. Mark
   xvi. 9-20 existed in the ancient Palestinian Copy. (About that Scholion
   enough has been offered already [210] .) Scholz adds that very nearly
   the same words are found in 374.--What he says concerning 206 and 209
   (and he might have added 199,) has been explained above.

   But when the twenty MSS. which remain [211] undisposed of have been
   scrutinized, their testimony is found to be quite different from what
   is commonly supposed. One of them (N^o. 38) has been cited in error:
   while the remaining nineteen are nothing else but copies of Victor of
   Antioch's commentary on S. Mark,--no less than sixteen of which contain
   the famous attestation that in most of the accurate copies, and in
   particular the authentic Palestinian Codex, the last twelve verses of
   S. Mark's Gospel were found. (See above, pp. 64 and 65.) . . . . And
   this exhausts the evidence.

   (8.) So far, therefore, as "Notes" and "Scholia" in MSS. are concerned,
   the sum of the matter proves to be simply this:--(a) Nine Codices [212]
   are observed to contain a note to the effect that the end of S. Mark's
   Gospel, though wanting "in some," was yet found "in others,"--"in
   many,"--"in the ancient copies."

   (b) Next, four Codices [213] contain subscriptions vouching for the
   genuineness of this portion of the Gospel by declaring that those four
   Codices had been collated with approved copies preserved at Jerusalem.

   (c) Lastly, sixteen Codices, (to which, besides that already mentioned
   by Scholz [214] , I am able to add at least five others, making
   twenty-two in all [215] ,)--contain a weighty critical scholion
   asserting categorically that in "very many" and "accurate copies,"
   specially in the "true Palestinian exemplar," these verses had been
   found by one who seems to have verified the fact of their existence
   there for himself.

   (9.) And now, shall I be thought unfair if, on a review of the
   premisses, I assert that I do not see a shadow of reason for the
   imposing statement which has been adopted by Tischendorf, Tregelles,
   and the rest, that "there exist about thirty Codices which state that
   from the more ancient and more accurate copies of the Gospel, the last
   twelve verses of S. Mark were absent?" I repeat, there is not so much
   as one single Codex which contains such a scholion; while twenty-four
   [216] of those commonly enumerated state the exact reverse.--We may now
   advance a step: but the candid reader is invited to admit that hitherto
   the supposed hostile evidence is on the contrary entirely in favour of
   the versos under discussion. ("I called thee to curse mine enemies,
   and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.")

   II. Nothing has been hitherto said about Cod. L. [217] This is the
   designation of an uncial MS. of the viii^th or ix^th century, in the
   Library at Paris, chiefly remarkable for the correspondence of its
   readings with those of Cod. B and with certain of the citations in
   Origen; a peculiarity which recommends Cod. L, (as it recommends three
   cursive Codices of the Gospels, 1, 33, 69,) to the especial favour of a
   school with which whatever is found in Cod. B is necessarily right. It
   is described as the work of an ignorant foreign copyist, who probably
   wrote with several MSS. before him; but who is found to have been
   wholly incompetent to determine which reading to adopt and which to
   reject. Certain it is that he interrupts himself, at the end of ver. 8,
   to write as follows:--

   "SOMETHING TO THIS EFFECT
   IS ALSO MET WITH:

   "All that was commanded them they immediately rehearsed unto Peter and
   the rest. And after these things, from East even unto West, did Jesus
   Himself send forth by their means the holy and incorruptible message of
   eternal Salvation.

   "BUT THIS ALSO IS MET WITH AFTER
   THE WORDS, FOR THEY WERE AFRAID:'

   "Now, when He was risen early, the first day of the week [218] ," &c.

   It cannot be needful that I should delay the reader with any remarks on
   such a termination of the Gospel as the foregoing. It was evidently the
   production of some one who desired to remedy the conspicuous
   incompleteness of his own copy of S. Mark's Gospel, but who had imbibed
   so little of the spirit of the Evangelical narrative that he could not
   in the least imitate the Evangelist's manner. As for the scribe who
   executed Codex L, he was evidently incapable of distinguishing the
   grossest fabrication from the genuine text. The same worthless
   supplement is found in the margin of the Hharklensian Syriac (A.D.
   616), and in a few other quarters of less importance [219] .--I pass
   on, with the single remark that I am utterly at a loss to understand on
   what principle Cod. L,--a solitary MS. of the viii^th or ix^th century
   which exhibits an exceedingly vicious text,--is to be thought entitled
   to so much respectful attention on the present occasion, rebuked as it
   is for the fallacious evidence it bears concerning the last twelve
   verses of the second Gospel by all the seventeen remaining Uncials,
   (three of which are from 300 to 400 years more ancient than itself;)
   and by every cursive copy of the Gospels in existence. Quite certain at
   least is it that not the faintest additional probability is established
   by Cod. L that S. Mark's Gospel when it left the hands of its inspired
   Author was in a mutilated condition. The copyist shews that he was as
   well acquainted as his neighbours with our actual concluding Verses:
   while he betrays his own incapacity, by seeming to view with equal
   favour the worthless alternative which he deliberately transcribes as
   well, and to which he gives the foremost place. Not S. Mark's Gospel,
   but Codex L is the sufferer by this appeal.

   III. I go back now to the statements found in certain Codices of the
   x^th century, (derived probably from one of older date,) to the effect
   that "the marginal references to the Eusebian Canons extend no further
   than ver. 8:"--for so, I presume, may be paraphrased the words, (see p.
   120,) eos hou Eusebios ho Pamphilou ekanonisen, which are found at the
   end of ver. 8 in Codd. 1, 206, 209.

   (1.) Now this statement need not have delayed us for many minutes. But
   then, therewith, recent Critics have seen fit to connect another and an
   entirely distinct proposition: viz. that

   Ammonius

   also, a contemporary of Origen, conspires with Eusebius in disallowing
   the genuineness of the conclusion of B. Mark's Gospel. This is in fact
   a piece of evidence to which recently special prominence has been
   given: every Editor of the Gospels in turn, since Wetstein, having
   reproduced it; but no one more emphatically than Tischendorf. "Neither
   by the sections of Ammonius nor yet by the canons of Eusebius are these
   last verses recognised [220] ." "Thus it is seen,"
     __________________________________________________________________

   THE opposite page exhibits an exact Fac-simile, obtained by
   Photography, of fol. 113 of Evan. Cod. L, ("Codex Regius," No. 62,) at
   Paris; containing S. Mark xvi. 6 to 9;--as explained at pp. 123-4. The
   Text of that MS. has been published by Dr. Tischendorf in his
   "Monumenta Sacra Inedita," (1846, pp. 57-399.) See p. 206.

   The original Photograph was executed (Oct. 1869) by the obliging
   permission of M. de Wailly, who presides over the Manuscript Department
   of the "BibliothÃ¨que." He has my best thanks for the kindness with
   which he promoted my wishes and facilitated my researches.

   It should perhaps be stated that the margin of "Codex L" is somewhat
   ampler than can be represented in an octavo volume; mob folio measuring
   very nearly nine inches, by very nearly six inches and a half.
     __________________________________________________________________

   proceeds Dr. Tregelles, "that just as Eusebius found these verses
   absent in his day from the best and most numerous copies (sic), so was
   also the case with Ammonites when he formed his Harmony in the
   preceding century [221] ."

   A new and independent authority therefore is appealed to,--one of high
   antiquity and evidently very great importance,--Ammonius of Alexandria,
   A.D. 220. But Ammonius has left behind him no known writings
   whatsoever. What then do these men mean when they appeal in this
   confident way to the testimony of "Ammonius?"

   To make this matter intelligible to the ordinary English reader, I must
   needs introduce in this place some account of what are popularly called
   the "Ammonian Sections" and the "Eusebian Canons:" concerning both of
   which, however, it cannot be too plainly laid down that nothing
   whatever is known beyond what is discoverable from a careful study of
   the "Sections" and "Canons" themselves; added to what Eusebius has told
   us in that short Epistle of his "to Carpianus,"--which I suppose has
   been transcribed and reprinted more often than any other uninspired
   Epistle in the world.

   Eusebius there explains that Ammonius of Alexandria constructed with
   great industry and labour a kind of Evangelical Harmony; the
   peculiarity of which was, that, retaining S. Matthew's Gospel in its
   integrity, it exhibited the corresponding sections of the other three
   Evangelists by the side of S. Matthew's text. There resulted this
   inevitable inconvenience; that the sequence of the narrative, in the
   case of the three last Gospels, was interrupted throughout; and their
   context hopelessly destroyed [222] .

   The "Diatesaaron "of Ammonius, (so Eusebius styles it), has long since
   disappeared; but it is plain from the foregoing account of it by a
   competent witness that it must have been a most unsatisfactory
   performance. It is not easy to see how room can have been found in such
   a scheme for entire chapters of S. Luke's Gospel; as well as for the
   larger part of the Gospel according to S. John: in short, for anything
   which was not capable of being brought into some kind of agreement,
   harmony, or correspondence with something in S. Matthew's Gospel.

   How it may have fared with the other Gospels in the work of Ammonius is
   not in fact known, and it is profitless to conjecture. What we know for
   certain is that Eusebius, availing himself of the hint supplied by the
   very imperfect labours of his predecessor, devised an entirely
   different expedient, whereby he extended to the Gospels of S. Mark, S.
   Luke and S. John all the advantages, (and more than all,) which
   Ammonius had made the distinctive property of the first Gospel [223] .
   His plan was to retain the Four Gospels in their integrity; and,
   besides enabling a reader to ascertain at a glance the places which S.
   Matthew has in common with the other three Evangelists, or with any
   two, or with any one of them, (which, I suppose, was the sum of what
   had been exhibited by the work of Ammonius,)--to spew which places S.
   Luke has in common with S. Mark,--which with S. John only; as well as
   which places are peculiar to each of the four Evangelists in turn. It
   is abundantly clear therefore what Eusebius means by saying that the
   labours of Ammonius had "suggested to him" his own [224] . The sight of
   that Harmony of the other three Evangelists with S. Matthew's Gospel
   had suggested to him the advantage of establishing a series of
   parallels throughout all the Four Gospels. But then, whereas Ammonius
   had placed alongside of S. Matthew the dislocated sections themselves
   of the other three Evangelists which are of corresponding purport,
   Eusebius conceived the idea of accomplishing the same object by means
   of a system of double numerical references. He invented X Canons, or
   Tables: he subdivided each of the Four Gospels into a multitude of
   short Sections. These he numbered; (a fresh series of numbers appearing
   in each Gospel, and extending from the beginning right on to the end;)
   and immediately under every number, he inserted, in vermillion, another
   numeral (I to X); whose office it was to indicate in which of his X
   Canons, or Tables, the reader would find the corresponding places in
   any of the other Gospels [225] . (If the section was unique, it
   belonged to his last or X^th Canon.) Thus, against S. Matthew's account
   of the Title on the Cross, is written 335/I: but in the I^st Canon
   (which contains the places common to all four Evangelists) parallel
   with 335, is found,--214, 324, 199: and the Sections of S. Mark, S.
   Luke, and S. John thereby designated, (which are discoverable by merely
   casting one's eye down the margin of each of those several Gospels in
   turn, until the required number has been reached,) will be found to
   contain the parallel record in the other three Gospels.

   All this is so purely elementary, that its very introduction in this
   place calls for apology. The extraordinary method of the opposite party
   constrains me however to establish thus clearly the true relation in
   which the familiar labours of Eusebius stand to the unknown work of
   Ammonius.

   For if that earlier production be lost indeed [226] ,--if its precise
   contents, if the very details of its construction, can at this distance
   of time be only conjecturally ascertained,--what right has any one to
   appeal to "the Sections of Ammonius," as to a known document? Why above
   all do Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest deliberately claim
   "Ammonius" for their ally on an occasion like the present; seeing that
   they must needs be perfectly well aware that they have no means
   whatever of knowing (except from the precarious evidence of Catenae)
   what Ammonius thought about any single verse in any of the four
   Gospels? At every stage of this discussion, I am constrained to ask
   myself,--Do then the recent Editors of the Text of the New Testament
   really suppose that their statements will never be examined? their
   references never verified? or is it thought that they enjoy a monopoly
   of the learning (such as it is) which enables a man to form an opinion
   in this department of sacred Science? For,

   (1st.) Where then and what are those "Sections of Ammonius" to which
   Tischendorf and Tregelles so confidently appeal? It is even notorious
   that when they say the "Sections of Ammonius," what they mean are the
   "Sections of Eusebius."--But, (2dly.) Where is the proof,--where is
   even the probability,--that these two are identical? The Critics cannot
   require to be reminded by me that we are absolutely without proof that
   so much as one of the Sections of Ammonius corresponded with one of
   those of Eusebius; and yet, (3dly.) Who sees not that unless the
   Sections of Ammonius and those of Eusebius can be proved to have
   corresponded throughout, the name of Ammonius has no business whatever
   to be introduced into such a discussion as the present? They must at
   least be told that in the entire absence of proof of any kind,--(and
   certainly nothing that Eusebius says warrants any such inference [227]
   ,)--to reason from the one to the other as if they were identical, is
   what no sincere inquirer after Truth is permitted to do.

   It is time, however, that I should plainly declare that it happens to
   be no matter of opinion at all whether the lost Sections of Ammonius
   were identical with those of Eusebius or not. It is demonstrable that
   they cannot have been so; and the proof is supplied by the Sections
   themselves. It is discovered, by a careful inspection of them, that
   they imply and presuppose the Ten Canons; being in many places even
   meaningless,--nugatory, in fact, (I do not of course say that they are
   practically without use,)--except on the theory that those Canons were
   already in existence [228] . Now the Canons are confessedly the
   invention of Eusebius. He distinctly claims them [229] . Thus much then
   concerning the supposed testimony of Ammonius. It is nil.--And now for
   what is alleged concerning the evidence of Eusebius.

   The starting-point of this discussion, (as I began by remarking), is
   the following memorandum found in certain ancient MSS.:--"Thus far did
   Eusebius canonize [230] ;" which means either: (1) That his Canons
   recognise no section of S. Mark's Gospel subsequent to Â§ 233, (which
   number is commonly set over against ver. 8:) or else, (which comes to
   the same thing,)--(2) That no sections of the same Gospel, after Â§ 233,
   are referred to any of his X Canons.

   On this slender foundation has been raised the following precarious
   superstructure. It is assumed,

   (1st.) That the Section of S. Mark's Gospel which Eusebius numbers
   "233," and which begins at our ver. 8, cannot have extended beyond ver.
   8;--whereas it may have extended, and probably did extend, down to the
   end of ver. 11.

   (2dly.) That because no notice is taken in the Eusebian Canons of any
   sectional number in S. Mark's Gospel subsequent to Â§ 233, no Section
   (with, or without, such a subsequent number) can have existed:--whereas
   there may have existed one or more subsequent Sections all duly
   numbered [231] . This notwithstanding, Eusebius, (according to the
   memorandum found in certain ancient MSS.), may have canonised no
   further than Â§ 233.

   I am not disposed, however, to contest the point as far as Eusebius is
   concerned. I have only said so much in order to shew how unsatisfactory
   is the argumentation on the other side. Let it be assumed, for argument
   sake, that the statement "Eusebius canonized no farther than ver. 8" is
   equivalent to this,--"Eusebius numbered no Sections after ver. 8:" (and
   more it cannot mean:)--What then? I am at a loss to see what it is that
   the Critics propose to themselves by insisting on the circumstance. For
   we knew before,--it was in fact Eusebius himself who told us,--that
   Copies of the Gospel ending abruptly at ver. 8, were anciently of
   frequent occurrence. Nay, we heard the same Eusebius remark that one
   way of shelving a certain awkward problem would be, to plead that the
   subsequent portion of S. Mark's Gospel is frequently wanting. What more
   have we learned when we have ascertained that the same Eusebius allowed
   no place to that subsequent portion in his Canons? The new fact,
   (supposing it to be a fact,) is but the correlative of the old one; and
   since it was Eusebius who was the voucher for that, what additional
   probability do we establish that the inspired autograph of S. Mark
   ended abruptly at ver. 8, by discovering that Eusebius is consistent
   with himself, and omits to "canonize" (or even to "sectionize") what he
   had already hypothetically hinted might as well be left out altogether?
   (See above, pp. 44-6.)

   So that really I am at a loss to see that one atom of progress is made
   in this discussion by the further discovery that, (in a work written
   about A.D. 373,)

   Epiphanius

   states casually that "the four Gospels contain 1162 sections [232] ."
   From this it is argued [233] that since 355 of these are commonly
   assigned to S. Matthew, 342 to S. Luke, and 232 to S. John, there do
   but remain for S. Mark 233; and the 233rd section of S. Mark's Gospel
   confessedly begins at ch. xvi. 8.--The probability may be thought to be
   thereby slightly increased that the sectional numbers of Eusebius
   extended no further than ver. 8: but--Has it been rendered one atom
   more probable that the inspired Evangelist himself ended his Gospel
   abruptly at the 8th verse? That fact--(the only thing which our
   opponents have to establish)--remains exactly where it was; entirely
   unproved, and in the highest degree improbable.

   To conclude, therefore. When I read as follows in the pages of
   Tischendorf:--"These verses are not recognised by the Sections of
   Ammonius, nor by the Canons of Eusebius: Epiphanius and Caesarius bear
   witness to the fact;"--I am constrained to remark that the illustrious
   Critic has drawn upon his imagination for three of his statements, and
   that the fourth is of no manner of importance.

   (1.) About the "Sections of Ammonius," he really knows no more than
   about the lost Books of Livy. He is, therefore, without excuse for
   adducing them in the way of evidence.

   (2.) That Epiphanius bears no witness whatever either as to the
   "Sections of Ammonius" or to "Canons of Eusebius," Tischendorf is
   perfectly well aware. So is my reader.

   (3.) His appeal to

   Caesarius

   is worse than infelicitous. He intends thereby to designate the younger
   brother of Gregory of Nazianzus; an eminent physician of
   Constantinople, who died A.D. 368; and who, (as far as is known,) never
   wrote anything. A work called Peuseis, (which in the x^th century was
   attributed to Caesarius, but concerning which nothing is certainly
   known except that Caesarius was certainly not its author,) is the
   composition to which Tischendorf refers. Even the approximate date of
   this performance, however, has never been ascertained. And yet, if
   Tischendorf had condescended to refer to it, (instead of taking his
   reference at second-hand,) be would have seen at a glance that the
   entire context in which the supposed testimony is found, is nothing
   else but a condensed paraphrase of that part of Epiphanius, in which
   the original statement occurs [234] .

   Thus much, then, for the supposed evidence of Ammonius, of Epiphanius,
   and of Caesarius on the subject of the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel. It is exactly nil. In fact Pseudo-Caesarius, so far from
   "bearing witness to the fact" that the concluding verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel are spurious, actually quotes the 16th verse as genuine [235] .

   (4.) As for Eusebius, nothing whatever has been added to what we knew
   before concerning his probable estimate of these verses.

   IV. We are now at liberty to proceed to the only head of external
   testimony which remains undiscussed. I allude to the evidence of

   The Catenae.

   "In the Catenae on Mark," (crisply declares Dr. Davidson,) "there is no
   explanation of this section [236] ."

   "The Catenae on Mark:" as if they were quite common things,--"plenty,
   as blackberries!" But,--Which of "the Catenae" may the learned Critic
   be supposed to have examined?

   1. Not the Catena which Possinus found in the library of Charles de
   Montchal, Abp. of Toulouse, and which forms the basis of his Catena
   published at Rome in 1673; because that Codex is expressly declared by
   the learned Editor to be defective from ver. 8 to the end [237] .

   2. Not the Catena which Corderius transcribed from the Vatican Library
   and communicated to Possinus; because in that Catena the 9th and 12th
   verses are distinctly commented on [238] .

   3. Still less can Dr. Davidson be thought to have inspected the Catena
   commonly ascribed to Victor of Antioch,--which Peltanus published in
   Latin in 1580, but which Possinus was the first to publish in Greek
   (1673). Dr. Davidson, I say, cannot certainly have examined that
   Catena; inasmuch as it contains, (as I have already largely shewn, and,
   in fact, as every one may see,) a long and elaborate dissertation on
   the best way of reconciling the language of S. Mark in ver. 9 with the
   language of the other Evangelists [239] .

   4. Least of all is it to be supposed that the learned Critic has
   inspected either of the last two editions of the same Catena: viz. that
   of Matthaei, (Moscow 1775,) or that of Cramer, (Oxford 1844,) from MSS.
   in the Royal Library at Paris and in the Bodleian. This is simply
   impossible, because (as we have seen), in these is contained the famous
   passage which categorically asserts the genuineness of the last Twelve
   Verses of S. Mark's Gospel [240] .

   Now this exhausts the subject.

   To which, then, of "the Catenae on Mark," I must again inquire, does
   this learned writer allude?--I will venture to answer the question
   myself; and to assert that this is only one more instance of the
   careless, second-hand (and third-rate) criticism which is to be met
   with in every part of Dr. Davidson's book: one proof more of the
   alacrity with which worn-out objections and worthless arguments are
   furbished up afresh, and paraded before an impatient generation and an
   unlearned age, whenever (tanquam vile corpus) the writings of Apostles
   or Evangelists are to be assailed, or the Faith of the Church of Christ
   is to be unsettled and undermined.

   V. If the Reader will have the goodness to refer back to p. 39, he will
   perceive that I have now disposed of every witness whom I originally
   undertook to examine. 1Ie will also, in fairness, admit that there has
   not been elicited one particle of evidence, from first to last, which
   renders it in the slightest degree probable that the Gospel of S. Mark,
   as it originally came from the hands of its inspired Author, was either
   an imperfect or an unfinished work. Whether there have not emerged
   certain considerations which render such a supposition in the highest
   degree unlikely,--I am quite content that my Reader shall decide.

   Dismissing the external testimony, therefore, proceed we now to review
   those internal evidences, which are confidently appealed to as proving
   that the concluding Verses of S. Mark's Gospel cannot be regarded as
   really the work of the Evangelist.

   [221] Printed Text, p. 248.

   [222] The reader is invited to test the accuracy of what precedes for
   himself:--Ammonios men ho Alexandreus, pollen, hos eikos, philoponian
   kai spouden eisageochos, to dia tessaron hemin kataleloipen euangelion,
   to kata Matthaion tas homophonous ton loipon euangeliston perikopas

   tou proeiremenou andros eilephos aphormas, kath' heteran methodon
   kanonas deka ton arithmon diecharaxa soi tous hupotetagmenous.

   [224] * This seems to represent exactly what Eusebius means in this
   place. The nearest English equivalent to aphorme is "a hint." Consider
   Euseb. Hist. Eccl. v. 27. Also the following:--pollas labontes
   aphormas. (Andreas, Prolog. in Apocalyps.).--labontes tas aphormas.
   (Anastasius Sin., Routh's Rell. i. 15.)

   [225] kanonas . . . . diecharaxa soi tous hupotetagmenous. This at
   least is decisive as to the authorship of the Canons. When therefore
   Jerome says of Ammonius,--"Evangelicos canones excogitavit quos postea
   secutus est Eusebius Caesariensis," (De Viris Illust. c. lv. vol. ii.
   p. 881,) we learn the amount of attention to which such off-hand gain
   statements of this Father are entitled. What else can be inferred from
   the account which Eusebius gives of the present sectional division of
   the Gospels but that it was also his own?--Haute men oun he ton
   hupotetagmenon kanonon hupothesis; he de saphes auton diegesis, estin
   hede. Eph' hekasto ton tessaron euangelion arithmos tis prokeitai kata
   meros, archomenos apo tou protou, eita deuterou, kai tritou, kai
   kathexes proion di' holou mechri tou telous tou bibliou. He proceeds to
   explain how the sections thus numbered are to be referred to his X
   Canons:--kath' hekaston de arithmon huposemeiosis dia kinnabareos
   prokeitai, delousa en poio ton deka kanonon kaimenos ho arithmos
   tunchanei.

   [226] "Frustra ad Ammonium aut Tatianum in Harmoniis provocant. Quae
   supersunt vix quicquam cum Ammonio aut Tatiano commune habent."
   (Tischendorf on S. Mark xvi. 8).--Dr. Mill (1707),--because he assumed
   that the anonymous work which Victor of Capua brought to light in the
   vi^th century, and conjecturally assigned to Tatian, was the lost work
   of Ammonius, (Proleg. p.68, Â§ 660,)--was of course warranted in
   appealing to the authority of Ammonius in support of the last twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel. But in truth Mill's assumption cannot be
   maintained for a moment, as Wetstein has convincingly shewn. (Proleg.
   p.68.) Any one may easily satisfy himself of the fact who will be at
   the pains to examine a few of the chapters with attention, bearing in
   mind what Eusebius has said concerning the work of Ammonius. Cap.
   lxxiv, for instance, contains as follows:--Mtt. xiii. 33, 34. Mk. iv.
   33. Mtt. xiii. 34, 35: 10, 11. Mk. iv. 34. Mtt. xiii. 13 to 17. But
   here it is S. Matthew's Gospel which is dislocated,--for verses 10, 11,
   and 13 to 17 of ch. xiii. come after verses 33-35; while ver. 12 has
   altogether disappeared. The most convenient edition for reference is
   Schmeller's,--Ammonii Alexandrini quae et Tatiani dicitur Harmonia
   Evangeliorum. (Vienna, 1841.)

   [227] Only by the merest license of interpretation can eilephos
   aphormas be assumed to mean that Eusebius had found the four Gospels
   ready divided to his hand by Ammonium into exactly 1165
   sections,--every one of which he had simply adopted for his own. Mill,
   (who nevertheless held this strange opinion,) was obliged to invent the
   wild hypothesis that Eusebius, besides the work of Ammonius which be
   describes, must have found in the library at Caesarea the private copy
   of the Gospels which belonged to Ammonius,--an unique volume, in which
   the last-named Father (as he assumes) will have numbered the Sections
   and made them exactly 1165. It is not necessary to discuss such a
   notion. We are dealing with facts,--not with fictions.

   [228] For proofs of what is stated above, as well as for several
   remarks on the (so-called) "Ammonian" Sections, the reader is referred

   mistake himself while contradicting our learned countryman Mill, who
   says,--"Certe Victor Antioch. ac Anonymus Tolosanus huc usque [sc. ver.

CHAPTER IX.

  INTERNAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED TO BE THE VERY REVERSE OF UNFAVOURABLE TO THESE
  VERSES.

   The "Style" and "Phraseology" of these Verses declared by Critics to be
   not S. Mark's.--Insecurity of such Criticism (p. 140).--The "Style" of
   chap. xvi. 9-20 shown to be the same as the style of chap. i. 9-20 (p.
   142).--The "Phraseology" examined in twenty-seven particulars, and
   skews to be auspicious in none (p. 145),--but in twenty-seven
   particulars shewn to be the reverse (p. 170).--Such Remarks fallacious
   (p. 173).--Judged of by a truer, a more delicate and philosophical
   Test, these Verses proved to be most probably genuine (p. 175).

   A DISTINCT class of objections remains to be considered. An argument
   much relied on by those who deny or doubt the genuineness of this
   portion of S. Mark's Gospel, is derived from considerations of internal
   evidence. In the judgment of a recent Editor of the New
   Testament,--These twelve verses "bear traces of another hand from that
   which has shaped the diction and construction of the rest of the Gospel
   [241] ." They are therefore "an addition to the narrative,"--of which
   "the internal evidence will be found to preponderate vastly against the
   authorship of Mark."--"A difference," (says Dr. Tregelles,) "has been
   remarked, and truly remarked, between the phraseology of this section
   and the rest of this Gospel."--According to Dr. Davidson," The
   phraseology and style of the section are unfavourable to its
   authenticity." "The characteristic peculiarities which pervade Mark's
   Gospel do not appear in it; but, on the contrary, terms and
   expressions," "phrases and words, are introduced which Mark never uses;
   or terms for which he employs others [242] ."--So Meyer,--"With ver. 9,
   we suddenly come upon an excerpting process totally different from the
   previous mode of narration. The passage contains none of Mark's
   peculiarities (no eutheos, no palin, &c., but the baldness and lack of
   clearness which mark a compiler;) while in single expressions, it is
   altogether contrary to Mark's manner."--"There is" (says Professor
   Norton) "a difference so great between the use of language in this
   passage, and its use in the undisputed portion of Mark's Gospel, as to
   furnish strong reasons for believing the passage not genuine."--No one,
   however, has expressed himself more strongly on this subject than
   Tischendorf." "Singula" (he says) "multifariam a Marci ratione
   abhorrent [243] ." . . . Here, then, is something very like a consensus
   of hostile opinion: although the terms of the indictment are somewhat
   vague. Difference of "Diction and Construction,"--difference of
   "Phraseology and Style,"--difference of "Terms and
   Expressions,"--difference of "Words and Phrases;"--the absence of S.
   Mark's "characteristic peculiarities." I suppose, however, that all may
   be brought under two heads,--(I.) Style, and (II.) Phraseology: meaning
   by "Style" whatever belongs to the Evangelist's manner; and by
   "Phraseology" whatever relates to the words and expressions he has
   employed. It remains, therefore, that we now examine the proofs by
   which it is proposed to substantiate these confident assertions, and
   ascertain exactly what they are worth by constant appeals to the
   Gospel. Throughout this inquiry, we have to do not with Opinion but
   with Fact. The unsupported dicta of Critics, however distinguished, are
   entitled to no manner of attention.

   1. In the meantime, as might have been expected, these confident and
   often-repeated asseverations have been by no means unproductive of
   mischievous results:

   Like ceaseless droppings, which at last are known
   To leave their dint upon the solid stone.

   I observe that Scholars and Divines of the best type (as the Rev. T. S.
   Green [244] ) at last put up with them. The wisest however reproduce
   them under protest, and with apology. The names of Tischendorf and
   Tregelles, Meyer and Davidson, command attention. It seems to be
   thought incredible that they can all be entirely in the wrong. They
   impose upon learned and unlearned readers alike. "Even Barnabas has
   been carried away with their dissimulation." He has (to my surprise and
   regret) two suggestions:--

   (a) The one,--That this entire section of the second Gospel may
   possibly have been written long after the rest; and that therefore its
   verbal peculiarities need not perplex or trouble us. It was, I suppose,
   (according to this learned and pious writer,) a kind of after-thought,
   or supplement, or Appendix to S. Mark's Gospel. In this way I have seen
   the last Chapter of S. John once and again accounted for.--To which, it
   ought to be a sufficient answer to point out that there is no
   appearance whatever of any such interval having been interposed between
   S. Mark xvi. 8 and 9: that it is highly improbable that any such
   interval occurred: and that until the "verbal peculiarities" have been
   ascertained to exist, it is, to say the least, a gratuitous exercise of
   the inventive faculty to discover reasons for their existence. Whether
   there be not something radically unsound and wrong in all such
   conjectures about "after-thoughts," "supplements," "appendices," and
   "second editions" when the everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ is the
   thing spoken of,--a confusing of things heavenly with things earthly
   which must make the Angels weep,--I forbear to press on the present
   occasion. It had better perhaps be discussed at another opportunity.
   But philoi andres [245] will forgive my freedom in having already made
   my personal sentiment on the subject sufficiently plain.

   (b) His other suggestion is,--That this portion may not have been
   penned by S. Mark himself after all. By which he clearly means no more
   than this,--that as we are content not to know who wrote the conclusion
   of the Books of Deuteronomy and Joshua, so, if needful, we may well be
   content not to know who wrote the end of the Gospel of S. Mark.--In
   reply to which, I have but to say, that after cause has been shewn why
   we should indeed believe that not S. Mark but some one else wrote the
   end of S. Mark's Gospel, we shall be perfectly willing to acquiesce in
   the new fact:--but not till then.

   2. True indeed it is that here and there a voice has been lifted up in
   the way of protest [246] against the proposed inference from the
   familiar premisses; (for the self-same statements have now been so
   often reproduced, that the eye grows weary at last of the
   ever-recurring string of offending vocables:)--but, with one honorable
   exception [247] , men do not seem to have ever thought of calling the
   premisses themselves in question: examining the statements one by one:
   contesting the ground inch by inch: refusing absolutely to submit to
   any dictation whatever in this behalf: insisting on bringing the whole
   matter to the test of severe inquiry, and making every detail the
   subject of strict judicial investigation. This is what I propose to do
   in the course of the present Chapter. I altogether deny the validity of
   the inference which has been drawn from "the style," "the phraseology,"
   "the diction" of the present section of the Gospel. But I do more. I
   entirely deny the accuracy of almost every individual statement from
   which the unfavourable induction is made, and the hostile inference
   drawn. Even this will not nearly satisfy me. I insist that one only
   result can attend the exact analysis of this portion of the Gospel into
   its elements; namely, a profound conviction that S. Mark is most
   certainly its Author.

   3. Let me however distinctly declare beforehand that remarks on "the
   style" of an Evangelist are singularly apt to be fallacious, especially
   when (as here) it is proposed to apply them to a very limited portion
   of the sacred narrative. Altogether to be mistrusted moreover are they,
   when (as on the present occasion) it is proposed to make them the
   ground for possibly rejecting such a portion of Scripture as spurious.
   It becomes a fatal objection to such reasoning that the style may
   indeed be exceedingly diverse, and yet the Author be confessedly one
   and the same. How exceedingly dissimilar in style are the Revelation of
   S. John and the Gospel of S. John! Moreover, practically, the promised
   remarks on "style," when the Authorship of some portion of Scripture is
   to be discussed, are commonly observed to degenerate at once into what
   is really quite a different thing. Single words, perhaps some short
   phrase, is appealed to, which (it is said) does not recur in any part
   of the same book; and thence it is argued that the Author can no longer
   be the same. "According to this argument, the recurrence of the same
   words constitutes identity of style; the want of such recurrence
   implies difference of style;--difference of style in such a sense as
   compels us to infer diversity of authorship. Each writer is supposed to
   have at his disposal a limited number of formulae' within the range of
   which he must work. He must in each chapter employ these formulae, and
   these only. He must be content with one small portion of his
   mother-tongue, and not dare to venture across the limits of that
   portion,--on pain of losing his identity [248] ."

   How utterly insecure must be every approximation to such a method of
   judging about the Authorship of any twelve verses of Scripture which
   can be named, scarcely requires illustration. The attentive reader of
   S. Matthew's Gospel is aware that a mode of expression which is six
   times repeated in his viii^th and ix^th chapters is perhaps only once
   met with besides in his Gospel,--viz. in his xxi^st chapter [249] . The
   "style" of the 17th verse of his i^st chapter may be thought unlike
   anything else in S. Matthew. S. Luke's five opening verses are unique,
   both in respect of manner and of matter. S. John also in his five
   opening verses seems to me to have adopted a method which is not
   recognisable anywhere else in his writings; "rising strangely by
   degrees," (as Bp. Pearson expresses it [250] ,) "making the last word
   of the former sentence the first of that which followeth."--"He knoweth
   that he saith true," is the language of the same Evangelist concerning
   himself in chap. xix. 35. But, "we know that his testimony is true," is
   his phrase in chap. xxi. 24. Twice, and twice only throughout his
   Gospel, (viz. in chap. xix. 35: xx. 31), is he observed to address his
   readers, and on both occasions in the same words: ("that ye may
   believe.") But what of all this? Is it to be supposed that S. Matthew,
   S. Luke, S. John are not the authors of those several places? From
   facts like these no inference whatever is to be drawn as to the
   genuineness or the spuriousness of a writing. It is quite to mistake
   the Critic's vocation to imagine that he is qualified, or called upon,
   to pass any judgment of the sort.

   5. I have not said all this, of course, as declining the proposed
   investigation. I approach it on the contrary right willingly, being
   confident that it can be attended by only one result. With what is
   true, endless are the harmonies which evolve themselves: from what is
   false, the true is equally certain to stand out divergent [251] . And
   we all desire nothing but the Truth.

   I. To begin then with the "Style and manner" of S. Mark in this place.

   1. We are assured that "instead of the graphic, detailed description by
   which this Evangelist is distinguished, we meet with an abrupt,
   sententious manner, resembling that of brief notices extracted from
   larger accounts and loosely linked together [252] ." Surely if this be
   so, the only lawful inference would be that S. Mark, in this place, has
   "extracted brief notices from larger accounts, and loosely linked them
   together:" and unless such a proceeding on the part of the Evangelist
   be judged incredible, it is hard to see what is the force of the
   adverse criticism, as directed against the genuineness of the passage
   now under consideration.

   2. But in truth, (when divested of what is merely a gratuitous
   assumption,) the preceding account of the matter is probably not far
   from the correct one. Of S. Mark's practice of making "extracts," I
   know nothing: nor Dr. Davidson either. That there existed any "larger
   accounts" which would. have been available for such a purpose, (except
   the Gospel according to S. Matthew,) there is neither a particle of
   evidence, nor a shadow of probability. On the other hand, that,
   notwithstanding the abundant oral information to which confessedly he
   had access, S. Mark has been divinely guided in this place to handle,
   in the briefest manner, some of the chiefest things which took place
   after our Lord's Resurrection,--is simply undeniable. And without at
   all admitting that the style of the Evangelist is in consequence either
   "abrupt" or "sententious [253] ," I yet recognise the inevitable
   consequence of relating many dissimilar things within very narrow
   limits; namely, that the transition from one to the other forces itself
   on the attention. What wonder that the same phenomenon should not be
   discoverable in other parts of the Gospel where the Evangelist is not
   observed to be doing the same thing?

   3. But wherever in his Gospel S. Mark is doing the same thing, he is
   observed to adopt the style and manner which Dr. Davidson is pleased to
   call "sententious" and "abrupt." Take twelve verses in his first
   chapter, as an example. Between S. Mark xvi. 9-20 and S. Mark i. 9-20,
   I profess myself unable to discern any real difference of style. I
   proceed to transcribe the passage which I deliberately propose for
   comparison; the twelve corresponding verses, namely, in S. Mark's first
   chapter, which are to be compared with the twelve verses already under
   discussion, from his last; and they may be just as conveniently
   exhibited in English as in Greek:--

   (S. Mark i. 9-20.)

   (ver. 9.) "And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
   Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. (10.) And
   straightway coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and
   the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him: (11.) and there came a
   voice from heaven saying, Thou art My beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased. (12.) And immediately the Spirit driveth Him into the
   wilderness. (13.) And He was there in the wilderness forty days,
   tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the Angels
   ministered unto Him. (14.) Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus
   came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, (15.)
   and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of Goy is at hand:
   repent ye, and believe the Gospel. (16.) Now, as He walked by the sea
   of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the
   sea: for they were fishers. (17.) And Jesus said unto them, Come ye
   after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. (18.) And
   straightway they forsook their nets, and followed Him. (19.) And when
   He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James the son of Zebedee,
   and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
   (20.) And straightway He called them; and they left their father
   Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after Him."

   4. The candid reader must needs admit that precisely the self-same
   manner is recognisable in this first chapter of S. Mark's Gospel which
   is asserted to be peculiar to the last. Note, that from our Saviour's
   Baptism (which occupies the first three verses) the Evangelist passes
   to His Temptation, which is dismissed in two. Six months elapse. The
   commencement of the Ministry is dismissed in the next two verses. The
   last five describe the call of four of the Apostles,--without any
   distinct allusion to the miracle which was the occasion of it. . . .
   How was it possible that when incidents considerable as these had to be
   condensed within the narrow compass of twelve verses, the same
   "graphic, detailed description" could reappear which renders S. Mark's
   description of the miracle performed in the country of the Gadarenes
   (for example) so very interesting; where a single incident is spread
   over twenty verses, although the action did not perhaps occupy an hour?
   I rejoice to observe that "the abrupt transitions of this section"
   (ver. 1-13) have also been noticed by Dean Alford: who very justly
   accounts for the phenomenon by pointing out that here "Mark appears as
   an abridger of previously well-known facts [254] ." But then, I want to
   know what there is in this to induce us to suspect the genuineness of
   either the beginning or the end of S. Mark's Gospel?

   5. For it is a mistake to speak as if "graphic, detailed description"
   invariably characterise the second Gospel. S. Mark is quite as
   remarkable for his practice of occasionally exhibiting a considerable
   transaction in a highly abridged form. The opening of his Gospel is
   singularly concise, and altogether sudden. His account of John's
   preaching (i. 1-8) is the shortest of all. Very concise is his account
   of our Saviour's Baptism (ver. 9-11). The brevity of his description of
   our Lord's Temptation is even extraordinary (ver. 12, 13.)--I pass on;
   premising that I shall have occasion to remind the reader by-and-by of
   certain peculiarities in these same Twelve Verses, which seem to have
   been hitherto generally overlooked.

   II. Nothing more true, therefore, than Dr. Tregelles' admission "that
   arguments on style are often very fallacious, and that by themselves
   they prove very little. But" (he proceeds) "when there does exist
   external evidence; and when internal proofs as to style, manner, verbal
   expression, and connection, are in accordance with such independent
   grounds of forming a judgment; then, these internal considerations
   possess very great weight."

   I have already shewn that there exists no such external evidence as Dr.
   Tregelles supposes. And in the absence of it, I am bold to assert that
   since nothing in the "Style" or the "Phraseology" of these verses ever
   aroused suspicion in times past, we have rather to be on our guard
   against suffering our judgment to be warped by arguments drawn from
   such precarious considerations now. As for determining from such data
   the authorship of an isolated passage; asserting or denying its
   genuineness for no other reason but because it contains certain words
   and expressions which do or do not occur elsewhere in the Gospel of
   which it forms part;--let me again declare plainly that the proceeding
   is in the highest degree uncritical. We are not competent judges of
   what words an Evangelist was likely on any given occasion to employ. We
   have no positive knowledge of the circumstances under which any part of
   any one of the four Gospels was written; nor the influences which
   determined an Evangelist's choice of certain expressions in preference
   to others. We are learners,--we can be only learners here. But having
   said all this, I proceed (as already declared) without reluctance or
   misgiving to investigate the several charges which have been brought
   against this section of the Gospel; charges derived from its
   Phraseology; and which will be found to be nothing else but repeated
   assertions that a certain Word or Phrase,--(there are about twenty-four
   such words and phrases in all [255] ,)--"occurs nowhere in the Gospel
   of Mark;" with probably the alarming asseveration that it is "abhorrent
   to Mark's manner." . . . . The result of the inquiry which follows will
   perhaps be not exactly what is commonly imagined.

   The first difficulty of this class is very fairly stated by one whose
   name I cannot write without a pang,--the late Dean Alford:--

   (I.) The expression pro'te sabba'tou, for the "first day of the week"
   (in ver. 9) "is remarkable" (he says) "as occurring so soon after" mia
   sabba'ton, (a precisely equivalent expression) in ver. 2.--Yes, it is
   remarkable.

   Scarcely more remarkable, perhaps, than that S. Luke in the course of
   one and the same chapter should four times designate the Sabbath to
   sabbaton, and twice ta sabbata: again, twice, to sabbaton,--twice, he
   hemera tou sabba'tou,-- and once, ta sabbata [256] . Or again, that S.
   Matthew should in one and the same chapter five times call the Sabbath,
   ta sabbata, and three times, to sabbaton [257] . Attentive readers will
   have observed that the Evangelists seem to have been fond in this way
   of varying their phrase; suddenly introducing a new expression for
   something which they had designated differently just before. Often, I
   doubt not, this is done with the profoundest purpose, and sometimes
   even with manifest design; but the phenomenon, however we may explain
   it, still remains. Thus, S. Matthew, (in his account of our Lord's
   Temptation,--chap. iv.,) has o dia'bolos in ver. 1, and o peira'zon, in
   ver. 3, for him whom our Saviour calls Satanas in ver. 10.--S. Mark, in
   chap. v. 2, has ta mneme+a,--but in ver. 5, ta mnemata.--S. Luke, in
   xxiv. 1, has to mnema; but in the next verse, to mnemeion.--Epi. with
   an accusative twice in S. Matth. xxv. 21, 23, is twice exchanged for
   epi with a genitive in the same two verses: and eriphoi (in ver. 32) is
   exchanged for eriphia in ver. 33.--Instead of a'rchon tes sunagoges (in
   S. Luke viii. 41) we read, in ver. 49, archisunagogos: and for oi
   apo'stoloi (in ix. 10) we find oi do'deka in ver.12.--Ous in S. Luke
   xxii. 50 is exchanged for hotion in the next verse.--In like manner,
   those whom S. Luke calls oi neo'teroi in Acts v. 6, he calls neani'skoi
   in ver. 10. . . . All such matters strike me as highly interesting, but
   not in the least as suspicious. It surprises me a little, of course,
   that S. Mark should present me with prote sabbatou (in ver. 9) instead
   of the phrase mia sabbaton, which he had employed just above (in ver.
   2.) But it does not surprise me much,--when I observe that mia sabbaton
   occurs only once in each of the Four Gospels [258] . Whether surprised
   much or little, however,--Am I constrained in consequence, (with
   Tischendorf and the rest,) to regard this expression (prote sabbatou)
   as a note of spuriousness? That is the only thing I have to consider.
   Am I, with Dr. Davidson, to reason as follows:--"prote, Mark would
   scarcely have used. It should have been mia, &c. as is proved by Mark
   xvi. 2, &c. The expression could scarcely have proceeded from a Jew. It
   betrays a Gentile author [259] ." Am I to reason thus? . . . I propose
   to answer this question somewhat in detail.

   (1.) That among the Greek-speaking Jews of Palestine, in the days of
   the Gospel, he mia ton sabba'ton was the established method of
   indicating "the first day of the week," is plain, not only from the
   fact that the day of the Resurrection is so designated by each of the
   Four Evangelists in turn [260] ; (S. John has the expression twice;)
   but also from S. Paul's use of the phrase in 1 Cor. xvi. 2. It proves,
   indeed, to have been the ordinary Hellenistic way of exhibiting the
   vernacular idiom of Palestine [261] . The cardinal (mia) for the
   ordinal (prote) in this phrase was a known Talmudic expression, which
   obtained also in Syriac [262] . Sabbaton and sabbata,--designations in
   strictness of the Sabbath-day,--had come to be also used as
   designations of the week. A reference to S. Mark xvi. 9 and S. Luke
   xviii. 12 establishes this concerning sabbaton: a reference to the six
   places cited just now in note (s) establishes it concerning sabbata. To
   see how indifferently the two forms (sabbaton and sabbata) were
   employed, one has but to notice that S. Matthew, in the course of one
   and the same chapter, five times designates the Sabbath as ta sabbata,
   and three times as to sabbaton [263] . The origin and history of both
   words will be found explained in a note at the foot of the page [264]

   (2.) Confessedly, then, a double Hebraism is before us, which must have
   been simply unintelligible to Gentile readers. Mia ton sabbaton sounded
   as enigmatical to an ordinary Greek ear, as "una sabbatorum" to a
   Roman. A convincing proof, (if proof were needed,) how abhorrent to a
   Latin reader was the last-named expression, is afforded by the old
   Latin versions of S. Matthew xxviii. 1; where opse sabba'ton, te
   epiphoskou'se eis mi'an sabba'ton, is invariably rendered, "Vespere
   sabbati, quae lucescit in prima sabbati."

   (3.) The reader will now be prepared for the suggestion, that when S.
   Mark, (who is traditionally related to have written his Gospel at Rome
   [265] ,) varies, in ver. 9, the phrase he had employed in ver. 2, he
   does so for an excellent and indeed for an obvious reason. In ver. 2,
   be had conformed to the prevailing usage of Palestine, and followed the
   example set him by S. Matthew (xxviii. 1) in adopting the enigmatical
   expression, he mi'a sabba'ton. That this would be idiomatically
   represented in Latin by the phrase "prima sabbati," we have already
   seen. In ver. 9, therefore, he is solicitous to record the fact of the
   Resurrection afresh; and this time, his phrase is observed to be the
   Greek equivalent for the Latin "prima sabbati;" viz. prote sabbatou.
   How strictly equivalent the two modes of expression were felt to be by
   those who were best qualified to judge, is singularly illustrated by
   the fact that the Syriac rendering of both places is identical.

   (4.) But I take leave to point out that this substituted phrase,
   instead of being a suspicious circumstance, is on the contrary a
   striking note of genuineness. For do we not recognise here, in the last
   chapter of the Gospel, the very same hand which, in the first chapter
   of it, was careful to inform us, just for once, that "Judaea," is "a
   country," (he Ioudaia chora,)--and "Jordan," "a river," (he Iordanes
   potamos)?--Is not this the very man who explained to his readers (in
   chap. xv. 42) that the familiar Jewish designation for "Friday," he
   paraskeue, denotes "the day before the Sabbath [266] ?"--and who was so
   minute in informing us (in chap. vii. 3, 4) about certain ceremonial
   practices of "the Pharisees and all the Jews?" Yet more,--Is not the
   selfsame writer clearly recognisable in this xvi^th chapter, who in
   chap. vi. 37 presented us with spekoulator (the Latin spiculator) for
   "an executioner?" and who, in chap. xv. 39, for "a centurion,"
   wrote--not hekatontarchos, but--kenturion?--and, in chap. xii. 42,
   explained that the two lepta which the poor widow cast into the
   Treasury were equivalent to kodrantes, the Latin quadrans?--and in
   chap. vii. 4, 8, introduced the Roman measure sextarius, (xestes)?--and
   who volunteered the information (in chap. xv. 16) that aule; is only
   another designation of praitorion (Praetorium)?--Yes. S. Mark,--who,
   alone of the four Evangelists, (in chap. xv. 21,) records the fact that
   Simon the Cyrenian was "the father of Alexander and Rufus," evidently
   for the sake of his Latin readers [267] : S. Mark,--who alone ventures
   to write in Greek letters (oua,--chap. xv. 29,) the Latin interjection
   "Vah!"--obviously because be was writing where that exclamation was
   most familiar, and the force of it best understood [268] : S.
   Mark,--who attends to the Roman division of the day, in relating our
   Lord's prophecy to S. Peter [269] :--S. Mark, I say, no doubt it was
   who,--having conformed himself to the precedent set him by S. Matthew
   and the familiar usage. of Palestine; and having written tes mia?
   sabbaton, (which he knew would sound like "una sabbatorum [270] ,") in
   ver. 2;--introduced, also for the benefit of his Latin readers, the
   Greek equivalent for "prima sabbati," (viz. prote sabbatou,) in ver.
   9.--This, therefore, I repeat, so far from being a circumstance
   "unfavourable to its authenticity," (by which, I presume, the learned
   writer means its genuineness), is rather corroborative of the Church's
   constant belief that the present section of S. Mark's Gospel is,
   equally with the rest of it, the production of S. Mark. "Not only was
   the document intended for Gentile converts:" (remarks Dr. Davidson, p.
   149,) "but there are also appearances of its adaptation to the use of
   Roman Christians in particular." Just so. And I venture to say that in
   the whole of "the document" Dr. Davidson will not find a more striking
   "appearance of its adaptation to the use of Roman Christians,"--and
   therefore of its genuineness,--than this. I shall have to request my
   reader by-and-by to accept it as one of the most striking notes of
   Divine origin which these verses contain.--For the moment, I pass on.

   (II.) Less excusable is the coarseness of critical perception betrayed
   by the next remark. It has been pointed out as a suspicious
   circumstance that in ver. 9, "the phrase aph' hes ekbeble'kei epta`
   daimo'nia, is attached to the name, of Mary Magdalene, although she had
   been mentioned three times before without such appendix. It seems to
   have been taken from Luke viii. 2 [271] ."--Strange perversity, and yet
   stranger blindness!

   (1.) The phrase cannot have been taken from S. Luke; because S. Luke's
   Gospel was written after S. Mark's. It was not taken from S. Luke;
   because there aph' hes daimo'nia epta` exelelu'thei,--here, aph' hes
   ekbeble'kei epta` daimo'nia is read.

   (2.) More important is it to expose the shallowness and futility of the
   entire objection.--Mary Magdalene "had been mentioned three times
   before, without such appendix." Well but,--What then? After twice (ch.
   xiv. 54, 66) using the word aule without any "appendix," in the very
   next chapter (xv. 16) S. Mark adds, o' estin praito'rion.--The beloved
   Disciple having mentioned himself without any "appendix" in S. John xx.
   7, mentions himself with a very elaborate "appendix" in ver. 20. But
   what of it?--The sister of the Blessed Virgin, having been designated
   in chap. xv. 40, as Mari'a e Iako'bou tou mikrou kai` Iose me'ter; is
   mentioned with one half of that "appendix," (Mari'a e Iose) in ver. 47,
   and in the very next verse, with the other half (Mari'a he tou
   Iakobou.)--I see no reason why the Traitor, who, in S. Luke vi. 16, is
   called Iou'das Iskario'ten, should be designated as Iou'dan to`n
   epikalou'menon Iskario'ten in S. Luke xxii. 3.--I am not saying that
   such "appendices" are either uninteresting or unimportant. That I
   attend to them habitually, these pages will best evince. I am only
   insisting that to infer from such varieties of expression that a
   different author is recognisable, is abhorrent to the spirit of
   intelligent Criticism.

   (3.) But in the case before us, the hostile suggestion is peculiarly
   infelicitous. There is even inexpressible tenderness and beauty, the
   deepest Gospel significancy, in the reservation of the clause "out of
   whom He had cast seven devils," for this place. The reason, I say, is
   even obvious why an "appendix," which would have been meaningless
   before, is introduced in connexion with Mary Magdalene's august
   privilege of being the first of the human race to behold the risen
   Saviour. Jerome (I rejoice to find) has been beforehand with me in
   suggesting that it was done, in order to convey by an example the tacit
   assurance that "where Sin had abounded, there did Grace much more
   abound [272] ." Are we to be cheated of our birthright by Critics [273]
   who, entirely overlooking a solution of the difficulty (if difficulty
   it be) Divine as this, can see in the circumstance grounds only for
   suspicion and cavil? Apage.

   (III.) Take the next example.--The very form of the "appendix" which we
   have been considering (aph' hes ekbeblekei hepta daimonia breeds
   offence. "Instead of ekballein apo," (oracularly remarks Dr. Davidson,)
   "Mark has ekballein ek [274] ."

   Nothing of the sort, I answer. S. Mark once has ekballein ek [275] ,
   and once ekballein apo. So has S. Matthew, (viz. in chap. vii. 4 and
   5): and so has S. Luke, (viz. in chap. vi. 42, and in Acts xiii.
   50.)--But what of all this? Who sees not that such Criticism is simply
   nugatory?

   (IV.) We are next favoured with the notable piece of information that
   the word poreuesthai, "never used by S. Mark, is three times contained
   in this passage;" (viz. in verses 10, 12 and 15.)

   (1.) Yes. The uncompounded verb, never used elsewhere by S. Mark, is
   found here three times. But what then? The compounds of poreuesthai are
   common enough in his Gospel. Thus, short as his Gospel is, he alone has
   eisporeusthai, ek-poreuesthai, sum-poreuesthai, para-poreuesthai,
   oftener than all the other three Evangelists put together,--viz.
   twenty-four times against their nineteen: while the compound
   prosporeuesthai is peculiar to his Gospel.--I am therefore inclined to
   suggest that the presence of the verb poreuesthai in these Twelve
   suspected Verses, instead of being an additional element of suspicion,
   is rather a circumstance slightly corroborative of their genuineness.

   (2.) But suppose that the facts had been different. The phenomenon
   appealed to is of even perpetual recurrence, and may on no account be
   represented as suspicious. Thus, parousia, a word used only by S.
   Matthew among the Evangelists, is by him used four times; yet are all
   those four instances found in one and the same chapter. S. Luke alone
   has charizesthai, and he has it three times: but all three cases are
   met with in one and the same chapter. S. John alone has lupe, and he
   has it four times: but all the four instances occur in one and the same
   chapter.

   (3.) Such instances might be multiplied to almost any extent. Out of
   the fifteen occasions when S. Matthew uses the word talanton, no less
   than fourteen occur in one chapter. The nine occasions when S. Luke
   uses the word mna all occur in one chapter. S. John uses the verb
   anistanai transitively only four times: but all four instances of it
   are found in one chapter.--Now, these three words (be it observed) are
   peculiar to the Gospels in which they severally occur.

   (4.) I shall of course be reminded that talanton and mna are unusual
   words,--admitting of no substitute in the places where they
   respectively occur. But I reply,--Unless the Critics are able to show
   me which of the ordinary compounds of poreuomaiS. Mark could possibly
   have employed for the uncompounded verb, in the three places which have
   suggested the present inquiry, viz.:--

   ver. 10:--ekei'ne poreutheisa ape'ngeilen tois met' autou genome'nois.

   ver. 12:--dusi`n ex auton . . . poreuome'nois eis agro'n.

   ver. 13:--poreuthe'ntes eis to`n ko'smon a'panta, keru'xate to`
   euange'lion;--

   their objection is simply frivolous, and the proposed adverse
   reasoning, worthless. Such, in fact, it most certainly is; for it will
   be found that poreutheisa in ver.10,--poreuome'nois in ver.
   12,--poreuthe'ntes in ver. 15,--also "admit of no substitute in the
   places where they severally occur;" and therefore, since the verb
   itself is one of S. Mark's favourite verbs, not only are these three
   places above suspicion, but they may be fairly adduced as indications
   that the same hand was at work here which wrote all the rest of his
   Gospel [276] .

   (V.) Then further,--the phrase tois met' autou genome'nois (in ver. 10)
   is noted as suspicious. "Though found in the Acts (xx. 18) it never
   occurs in the Gospels: nor does the word mathetai in this passage."

   (1.) The phrase met' autou genomenoi occurs nowhere in the Acts or in
   the Gospels, except here. But,--Why should it appear elsewhere? or
   rather,--How could it? Now, if the expression be (as it is) an
   ordinary, easy, and obvious one,--wanted in this place, where it is met
   with; but not met with elsewhere, simply because elsewhere it is not
   wanted;--surely it is unworthy of any one calling himself a Critic to
   pretend that there attaches to it the faintest shadow of suspicion!

   (2.) The essence of the phrase is clearly the expression hoi met'
   autou. (The aorist participle of ginomai is added of necessity to mark
   the persons spoken of. In no other, (certainly in no simpler, more
   obvious, or more precise) way could the followers of the risen Saviour
   have been designated at such a time. For had He not just now "overcome
   the sharpness of Death"?) But this expression, which occurs four times
   in S. Matthew and four times in S. Luke, occurs also four times in S.
   Mark: viz. in chap. i. 36; 25; v. 40, and here. This, therefore, is a
   slightly corroborative circumstance,--not at all a ground of suspicion.

   (3.) But it seems to be implied that S. Mark, because he mentions tous
   mathetas often elsewhere in his Gospel, ought to have mentioned them
   here.

   (a) I answer:--He does not mention tous mathetas nearly so often as S.
   Matthew; while S. John notices them twice as often as he does.

   (b) Suppose, however, that he elsewhere mentioned them five hundred
   times, because he had occasion five hundred times to speak of
   them;--what reason would that be for his mentioning them here, where he
   is not speaking of them?

   (c) It must be evident to any one reading the Gospel with attention
   that besides hoi mathetai,--(by which expression S. Mark always
   designates the Twelve Apostles,)--there was a considerable company of
   believers assembled together throughout the first Easter Day [277] . S.
   Luke notices this circumstance when he relates how the Women, on their
   return from the Sepulchre, "told all these things unto the Eleven, and
   to all the rest," (xxiv. 9): and again when he describes how Cleopas
   and his companion (duo ex auton as S. Luke and S. Mark call them) on
   their return to Jerusalem, "found the Eleven gathered together, and
   then that were with them." (xxiv. 33.) But this was at least as well
   known to S. Mark as it was to S. Luke. Instead, therefore, of regarding
   the designation "them that had been with Him" with suspicion,--are we
   not rather to recognise in it one token more that the narrative in
   which it occurs is unmistakably genuine? What else is this but one of
   those delicate discriminating touches which indicate the hand of a
   great Master; one of those evidences of minute accuracy which stamp on
   a narrative the impress of unquestionable Truth?

   (VI.) We are next assured by our Critic that theasthai "is unknown to
   Mark;" but it occurs twice in this section, (viz. in ver. 11 and ver.
   14.) Another suspicious circumstance!

   (1.) A strange way (as before) of stating an ordinary fact, certainly!
   What else is it but to assume the thing which has to be proved? If the
   learned writer had said instead, that the verb theasthai, here twice
   employed by S. Mark, occurs nowhere else in his Gospel,--he would have
   acted more loyally, not to say more fairly by the record: but then he
   would have been stating a strictly ordinary phenomenon,--of no
   significancy, or relevancy to the matter in hand. He is probably aware
   that parabainein in like manner is to be found in two consecutive
   verses of S. Matthew's Gospel; parakouein, twice in the course of one
   verse: neither word being used on any other occasion either by S.
   Matthew, or by any other Evangelist. The same thing precisely is to be
   said of anazetein and antapodidonai, of antiparerchesthai and
   diatithesthai, in S. Luke: of anistanai and zonnunai in S. John. But
   who ever dreamed of insinuating that the circumstance is suspicious?

   (2.) As for theasthai, we should have reminded our Critic that this
   verb, which is used seven times by S. John, and four times by S.
   Matthew, is used only three times by S. Luke, and only twice by S.
   Mark. And we should have respectfully inquired,--What possible
   suspicion does theasthai throw upon the last twelve verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel?

   (3.) None whatever, would have been the reply. But in the meantime Dr.
   Davidson hints that the verb ought to have been employed by S. Mark in
   chap. ii. 14 [278] .--It is, I presume, sufficient to point out that S.
   Matthew, at all events, was not of Dr. Davidson's opinion [279] : and I
   respectfully submit that the Evangelist, inasmuch as he happens to be
   here writing about himself, must be allowed, just for once, to be the
   better judge.

   (4.) In the meantime,--Is it not perceived that theasthai is the very
   word specially required in these two places,--though nowhere else in S.
   Mark's Gospel [280] ? The occasion is one,--viz. the beholding' of the
   person of the risen Saviour. Does not even natural piety suggest that
   the uniqueness of such a spectacle' as that might well set an
   Evangelist on casting about for a word of somewhat less ordinary
   occurrence? The occasion cries aloud for this very verb theasthai; and
   I can hardly conceive a more apt illustration of a darkened eye,--a
   spiritual faculty perverted from its lawful purpose,--than that which
   only discovers "a stumbling-block and occasion of falling" in
   expressions like the present which "should have been only for their
   wealth," being so manifestly designed for their edification.

   (VII.) But,--(it is urged by a Critic of a very different
   stamp,)--ethea'the up' autes (ver. 11) "is a construction only found
   here in the New Testament."

   (1.) Very likely; but what then? The learned writer has evidently
   overlooked the fact that the passive theasthai occurs but three times
   in the New Testament in all [281] . S. Matthew, on the two occasions
   when he employs the word, connects it with a dative [282] . What is
   there suspicious in the circumstance that theasthai hupo should be the
   construction preferred by S. Mark? The phenomenon is not nearly so
   remarkable as that S. Luke, on one solitary occasion, exhibits the
   phrase me phobeisthe apo [283] ,--instead of making the verb govern the
   accusative, as he does three times in the very next verse; and, indeed,
   eleven times in the course of his Gospel. To be sure, S. Luke in this
   instance is but copying S. Matthew, who also has me phobeisthe apo once
   [284] ; and seven times makes the verb govern an accusative. This,
   nevertheless, constitutes no reason whatever for suspecting the
   genuineness either of S. Matth. x. 28 or of S. Luke xii. 4.

   (2.) In like manner, the phrase ephobethesan phobon megan will be found
   to occur once, and once only, in S. Mark,--once, and once only, in S.
   Luke [285] ; although S. Mark and S. Luke use the verb phobeisthai
   upwards of forty times. Such facts are interesting. They may prove
   important. But no one who is ever so little conversant with such
   inquiries will pretend that they are in the least degree suspicious.--I
   pass on.

   (VIII.) It is next noted as a suspicious circumstance that apistein
   occurs in ver. 11 and in ver. 16; but nowhere else in the
   Gospels,--except in S. Luke xxiv. 11, 14.

   But really, such a remark is wholly without force, as an argument
   against the genuineness of the passage in which the word is found: for,

   (1.) Where else in the course of this Gospel could apistein have
   occurred? Now, unless some reason can be shewn why the word should, or
   at least might have been employed elsewhere, to remark upon its
   introduction in this place, where it could scarcely be dispensed with,
   as a ground of suspicion, is simply irrational. It might just as well
   be hold to be a suspicious circumstance, in respect of verses 3 and 4,
   that the verb apokulizein occurs there, and there only, in this Gospel.
   Nothing whatever follows from the circumstance. It is, in fact, a point
   scarcely deserving of attention.

   (2.) To be sure, if the case of a verb exclusively used by the two
   Evangelists, S. Mark and S. Luke, were an unique, or even an
   exceedingly rare phenomenon, it might have been held to be a somewhat
   suspicious circumstance that the phenomenon presented itself in the
   present section. But nothing of the sort is the fact. There are no
   fewer than forty-five verbs exclusively used by S. Mark and S. Luke.
   And why should not apistein be, (as it is,) one of them?

   (3.) Note, next, that this word is used twice, and in the course of his
   last chapter too, also by S. Luke. Nowhere else does it occur in the
   Gospels. It is at least as strange that the word apistein should be
   found twice in the last chapter of the Gospel according to S. Luke, as
   in the last chapter of the Gospel according to S. Mark. And if no
   shadow of suspicion is supposed to result from this circumstance in the
   case of the third Evangelist, why should it in the case of the second?

   (4.) But, lastly, the noun apistia (which occurs in S. Mark xvi. 14)
   occurs in two other places of the same Gospel. And this word (which S.
   Matthew uses twice,) is employed by none of the other
   Evangelists.--What need to add another word? Do not many of these
   supposed suspicious circumstances,--this one for example,--prove
   rather, on closer inspection, to be confirmatory facts?

   (IX.) We are next assured that meta tauta (ver. 12) "is not found in
   Mark, though many opportunities occurred for using it."

   (1.) I suppose that what this learned writer means, is this; that if S.
   Mark had coveted an opportunity for introducing the phrase meta tauta
   earlier in his Gospel, he might have found one. (More than this cannot
   be meant: for nowhere before does S. Mark employ any other phrase to
   express "after these things," or "after this," or "afterwards.")

   But what is the obvious inference from the facts of the case, as stated
   by the learned Critic, except that the blessed Evangelist must be
   presumed to have been unconscious of any desire to introduce the
   expression under consideration on any other occasion except the
   present?

   (2.) Then, further, it is worth observing that while the phrase meta
   tauta occurs five times in S. Luke's Gospel, it is found only twice in
   the Acts; while S. Matthew never employs it at all. Why, then,--I would
   respectfully inquire--why need S. Mark introduce the phrase more than
   once? Why, especially, is his solitary use of the expression to be
   represented as a suspicious circumstance; and even perverted into an
   article of indictment against the genuineness of the last twelve verses
   of his Gospel? "Would any one argue that S. Luke was not the author of
   the Acts, because the author of the Acts has employed this phrase only
   twice,--often as he could have used it?' (Meyer's phrase here [286] .)"

   (X.) Another objection awaits us.-Heteros also "is unknown to Mark,"
   says Dr. Davidson;--which only means that the word occurs in chap. xvi.
   12, but not elsewhere in his Gospel.

   It so happens, however, that heteros also occurs once only in the
   Gospel of S. John. Does it therefore throw suspicion on S. John xix.
   37?

   (XI.) The same thing is said of husteron (in ver. 14) viz. that it
   "occurs nowhere" in the second Gospel.

   But why not state the case thus?--Husteron, a word which is twice
   employed by S. Luke, occurs only once in S. Mark and once in S.
   John.--That would be the true way of stating the facts of the case. But
   it would be attended with this inconvenient result,--that it would make
   it plain that the word in question has no kind of bearing on the matter
   in hand.

   (XII.) The same thing he says of bla'ptein (in ver. 18).

   But what is the fact? The word occurs only twice in the Gospels,--viz.
   in S. Mark xvi. 18 and S. Luke iv. 35. It is one of the eighty-four
   words which are peculiar to S. Mark and S. Luke. What possible
   significancy would Dr. Davidson attach to the circumstance?

   (XIII.) Once more.--"pantachou" (proceeds Dr. Davidson) "is unknown to
   Mark;" which (as we begin to be aware) is the learned gentleman's way
   of stating that it is only found in chap. xvi. 20.

   Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Alford insist that it also occurs in S.
   Mark i. 28. I respectfully differ from them in opinion: but when it has
   been pointed out that the word is only used besides in S. Luke ix. 6,
   what can be said of such Criticism but that it is simply frivolous?

   (XIV. and XV.) Yet again:--sunergein and bebaioun are also said by the
   same learned Critic to be "unknown to Mark."

   S. Mark certainly uses these two words only once,--viz. in the last
   verse of the present Chapter: but what there is suspicious in this
   circumstance, I am at a loss even to divine. He could not have used
   them oftener; and since one hundred and fifty-six words are peculiar to
   his Gospel, why should not sunergein and bebaioun be two of them?

   (XVI.) "Pasa ktisis is Pauline," proceeds Dr. Davidson, (referring to a
   famous expression which is found in ver. 15.)

   (1.) All very oracular,--to be sure: but why pasa ktisis should be
   thought "Pauline" rather than "Petrine," I really, once more, cannot
   discover; seeing that S. Peter has the expression as well as S. Paul
   [287] .

   (2.) In this place, however, the phrase is pasa he ktisis. But even
   this expression is no more to be called "Pauline" than "Marcine;"
   seeing that as S. Mark uses it once and once only, so does S. Paul use
   it once and once only, viz. in Rom. viii. 22.

   (3.) In the meantime, how does it come to pass that the learned Critic
   has overlooked the significant fact that the word ktisis occurs besides
   in S. Mark x. 6 and xiii. 19; and that it is a word which S. Mark alone
   of the Evangelists uses? Its occurrence, therefore, in this place is a
   circumstance the very reverse of suspicious.

   (4.) But lastly, inasmuch as the opening words of our Lord's
   Ministerial Commission to the Apostles are these,--keru'xate to`
   euange'lion pa'se te kti'sei (ver. 15): inasmuch, too, as S. Paul in
   his Epistle to the Colossians (i. 23) almost reproduces those very
   words; speaking of the Hope tou? euangeli'ou . . . tou keruchthe'ntos
   en pa'se kti'sei te upo` to`n ourano'n:"--Is it not an allowable
   conjecture that a direct reference to that place in S. Mark's Gospel is
   contained in this place of S. Paul's Epistle? that the inspired Apostle
   "beholding the universal tendency of Christianity already realized,"
   announces (and from imperial Rome!) the fulfilment of his Lord's
   commands in his Lord's own words as recorded by the Evangelist S. Mark?

   I desire to be understood to deliver this only as a conjecture. But
   seeing that S. Mark's Gospel is commonly thought to have been written
   at Rome, and under the eye of S. Peter; and that S. Peter (and
   therefore S. Mark) must have been at Rome before S. Paul visited that
   city in A.D. 61;--seeing, too, that it was in A.D. 61-2 (as Wordsworth
   and Alford are agreed) that S. Paul wrote his Epistle to the
   Colossians, and wrote it from Rome;--I really can discover nothing
   unreasonable in the speculation. If, however, it be well founded,--(and
   it is impossible to deny that the coincidence of expression may be such
   as I have suggested,)--then, what an august corroboration would this be
   of "the last Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark!" . . .
   If, indeed, the great Apostle on reaching Rome inspected S. Mark's
   Gospel for the first time, with what awe will he have recognised in his
   own recent experience the fulfilment of his Saviour's great
   announcement concerning the "signs which should follow them that
   believe!" Had he not himself "cast out devils?"--"spoken with tongues
   more than they all?"--and at Melita, not only "shaken off the serpent
   into the fire and felt no harm," but also "laid hands on the sick"
   father of Publius, "and he had recovered?" . . . To return, however, to
   matters of fact; with an apology (if it be thought necessary) for what
   immediately goes before.

   (XVII.) Next,--en to ono'mati' mou (ver. 17) is noticed as another
   suspicious peculiarity. The phrase is supposed to occur only in this
   place of S. Mark's Gospel; the Evangelist elsewhere employing the
   preposition epi:--(viz. in ix. 37: ix. 39: xiii. 6.)

   (1.) Now really, if it were so, the reasoning would be nugatory. S.
   Luke also once, and once only, has en to ono'mati' mou: his usage
   elsewhere being, (like S. Mark's) to use epi. Nay, in two consecutive
   verses of ch. ix, en to onomati mou--sou is read: and yet, in the very
   next chapter, his Gospel exhibits an unique instance of the usage of
   en. Was it ever thought that suspicion is thereby cast on S. Luke x.
   17?

   (2.) But, in fact, the objection is an oversight of the learned (and
   generally accurate) objector. The phrase recurs in S. Mark ix. 33,--as
   the text of that place has been revised by Tischendorf, by Tregelles
   and by himself. This is therefore a slightly corroborative, not a
   suspicious circumstance.

   (XVIII. and XIX.) We are further assured that parakolouthein (in ver.
   17) and epakolouthein (in ver. 20) "are both foreign to the diction of
   Mark."

   (1.) But what can the learned author of this statement possibly mean?
   He is not speaking of the uncompounded verb akolouthein, of course; for
   S. Mark employs it. at least twenty times. He cannot be speaking of the
   compounded verb; for sunakolouthein occurs in S. Mark v. 37. He cannot
   mean that parakolouthein, because the Evangelist uses it only once, is
   suspicious; for that would be to cast a slur on S. Luke i. 3. He cannot
   mean generally that verbs compounded with prepositions are "foreign to
   the diction of Mark;" for there are no less than forty-two such verbs
   which are even peculiar to S. Mark's short Gospel,--against thirty
   which are peculiar to S. Matthew, and seventeen which are peculiar to
   S. John. He cannot mean that verbs compounded with para and epi have a
   suspicious look; for at least thirty-three such compounds, (besides the
   two before us,) occur in his sixteen chapters [288] . What, then, I
   must really ask, can the learned Critic possibly mean?--I respectfully
   pause for an answer.

   (2.) In the meantime, I claim that as far as such evidence goes,--(and
   it certainly goes a very little way, yet, as far as it goes,)--it is a
   note of S. Mark's authorship, that within the compass of the last
   twelve verses of his Gospel these two compounded verbs should be met
   with.

   (XX.) Dr. Davidson points out, as another suspicious circumstance, that
   (in ver. 18) the phrase cheiras epitithenai epi tina occurs; "instead
   of cheiras epitithenai tina."

   (1.) But on the contrary, the phrase "is in Mark's manner," says Dean
   Alford: the plain fact being that it occurs no less than three times in
   his Gospel,--viz. in chap. viii. 25: x. 16: xvi. 18. (The other idiom,
   he has four times [289] .) Behold, then, one and the same phrase is
   appealed to as a note of genuineness and as an indication of spurious
   origin. What can be the value of such Criticism as this?

   (2.) Indeed, the phrase before us supplies no unapt illustration of the
   precariousness of the style of remark which is just now engaging our
   attention. Within the space of three verses, S. Mark has both
   expressions,--viz. epithei`s ta`s cheiras auto (viii. 23) and also
   epe'theke ta`s cheiras epi' (ver. 25.) S. Matthew has the latter phrase
   once; the former, twice [290] . Who will not admit that all this
   (so-called) Criticism is the veriest trifling; and that to pretend to
   argue about the genuineness of a passage of Scripture from such
   evidence as the present is an act of rashness bordering on folly? . . .
   The reader is referred to what was offered above on Art. VII.

   (XXI. and XXII.) Again: the words me`n oun--ho Kurios (ver. 19 and ver.
   20) are also declared to be "foreign to the diction of Mark." I ask
   leave to examine these two charges separately.

   (1.) me`n oun occurs only once in S. Murk's Gospel, truly: but then it
   occurs only once in S. Luke (iii. 18);--only twice in S. John (xix. 24:
   xx. 30):--in S. Matthew, never at all. What imaginable plea can be made
   out of such evidence as this, for or against the genuineness of the
   last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?--Once more, I pause for an
   answer.

   (2.) As for ho Kurios being "foreign to the diction of Mark in speaking
   of the Lord,"--I really do not know what the learned Critic can
   possibly mean; except that he finds our Lord nowhere called ho Kurios
   by S. Mark, except in this place.

   But then, he is respectfully reminded that neither does he find our
   Lord anywhere called by S. Mark "Jesus Christ," except in chap. i. 1.
   Are we, therefore, to suspect the beginning of S. Mark's Gospel as well
   as the end of it? By no means, (I shall perhaps be told:) a reason is
   assignable for the use of that expression in chap. i. 1. And so, I
   venture to reply, there is a fully sufficient reason assignable for the
   use of this expression in chap. xvi. 19 [291] .

   (3.) By S. Matthew, by S. Mark, by S. John, our Lord is called Iesous
   Christos,--but only in the first Chapter of their respective Gospels.
   By S. Luke nowhere. The appellation may,--or may not,--be thought
   "foreign to the diction" of those Evangelists. But surely it
   constitutes no reason whatever why we should suspect the genuineness of
   the beginning of the first, or the second, or the fourth Gospel.

   (4.) S. John three times in the first verse of his first Chapter
   designates the Eternal Son by the extraordinary title ho Logos; but
   nowhere else in his Gospel, (except once in ver. 14,) does that Name
   recur. Would it be reasonable to represent this as a suspicious
   circumstance? Is not the Divine fitness of that sublime appellation
   generally recognised and admitted [292] ?--Surely, we come to Scripture
   to be learners only: not to teach the blessed Writers how they ought to
   have spoken about God! When will men learn that "the Scripture-phrase,
   or language of the Holy Ghost [293] " is as much above them as Heaven
   is above Earth?

   (XXIII.) Another complaint:--analephthenai, which is found in ver. 19,
   occurs nowhere else in the Gospels.

   (1.) True. S. Mark has no fewer than seventy-four verbs which "occur
   nowhere else in the Gospels:" and this happens to be one of them? What
   possible inconvenience can be supposed to follow from that
   circumstance?

   (2.) But the remark is unreasonable. Analephthenai and analepsis are
   words proper to the Ascension of our Lord into Heaven. The two
   Evangelists who do not describe that event, are without these words:
   the two Evangelists who do describe it, have them [294] . Surely, these
   are marks of genuineness, not grounds for suspicion!

   It is high time to conclude this discussion.--Much has been said about
   two other minute points:--

   (XXIV.) It is declared that ekeinos "is nowhere found absolutely used
   by S. Mark:" (the same thing may be said of S. Matthew and of S. Luke
   also:) "but always emphatically: whereas in verses 10 and 11, it is
   absolutely used [295] ." Another writer says,--"The use of ekeinos in
   verses 10, 11, and 13 (twice) in a manner synonymous with ho de, is
   peculiar [296] ."

   (1.) Slightly peculiar it is, no doubt, but not very, that an
   Evangelist who employs an ordinary word in the ordinary way about
   thirty times in all, should use it "absolutely" in two consecutive
   verses.

   (2.) But really, until the Critics can agree among themselves as to
   which are precisely the offending instances,--(for it is evidently a
   moot point whether ekeinos be emphatic in ver. 13, or not,)--we may be
   excused from a prolonged discussion of such a question. I shall recur
   to the subject in the consideration of the next Article (XXV.)

   (XXV.) So again, it may be freely admitted that "in the 10th and 14th
   verses there are sentences without a copulative: whereas Mark always
   has the copulative in such cases, particularly kai." But then,--

   (1.) Unless we can be shewn at least two or three other sections of S.
   Mark's Gospel resembling the present,--(I mean, passages in which S.
   Mark summarizes many disconnected incidents, as he does here,)--is it
   not plain that such an objection is wholly without point?

   (2.) Two instances are cited. In the latter, (ver. 14), Lachmann and
   Tregelles read husteron de and the reading is not impossible. So that
   the complaint is really reduced to this,--That in ver. 10 the
   Evangelist begins Ekei'ne poreutheisa, instead of saying kai ekei'ne
   poreutheisa. And (it is implied) there is something so abhorrent to
   probability in this, as slightly to strengthen the suspicion that the
   entire context is not the work of the Evangelist.

   (3.) Now, suppose we had S. Mark back among us: and suppose that he, on
   being shewn this objection, were to be heard delivering himself
   somewhat to the following effect:--"Aye. But men may not find fault
   with that turn of phrase. I derived it from Simon Peter's lips. I have
   always suspected that it was a kind of echo, so to say, of what he and
   the other Disciple' had many a time rehearsed in the hearing of the
   wondering Church concerning the Magdalene on the morning of the
   Resurrection." And then we should have remembered the familiar place in
   the fourth Gospel:--

   gunai ti klaieis; tina zeteis; EKEINE dokousa k.t.l. X.

   After which, the sentence would not have seemed at all strange, even
   though it be "without a copulative:"--

   aph' hes ekbeblekei epta` daimo'nia. EKEINE poreutheisa k.t.l.

   (4.) For after all, the only question to be asked is,--Will any one
   pretend that such a circumstance as this is suspicious? Unless that be
   asserted, I see not what is gained by raking together,--(as one easily
   might do in any section of any of the Gospels,)--every minute
   peculiarity of form or expression which can possibly be found within
   the space of these twelve verses. It is an evidence of nothing so much
   as an incorrigible coarseness of critical fibre, that every slight
   variety of manner or language should be thus pounced. upon and
   represented as a note of spuriousness,--in the face of (a) the
   unfaltering tradition of the Church universal that the document has
   never been hitherto suspected: and (b) the known proclivity of all
   writers, as free moral and intellectual agents, sometimes to deviate
   from their else invariable practice.--May I not here close the
   discussion?

   There will perhaps be some to remark, that however successfully the
   foregoing objections may seem to have been severally disposed of, yet
   that the combined force of such a multitude of slightly suspicious
   circumstances must be not only appreciable, but even remain an
   inconvenient, not to say a formidable fact. Let me point out that the
   supposed remark is nothing else but a fallacy; which is detected the
   instant it is steadily looked at.

   For if there really had remained after the discussion of each of the
   foregoing XXV Articles, a slight residuum of suspiciousness, then of
   course the aggregate of so many fractions would have amounted to
   something in the end.

   But since it has been proved that there is absolutely nothing at all
   suspicious in any of the alleged circumstances which have been hitherto
   examined, the case becomes altogether different. The sum of ten
   thousand nothings is still nothing [297] . This may be conveniently
   illustrated by an appeal to the only charge which remains to be
   examined.

   (XXVI. and XXVII.) The absence from these twelve verses of the adverbs
   eutheos and palin,--(both of them favourite words with the second
   Evangelist,)--has been pointed out as one more suspicious circumstance.
   Let us take the words singly:--

   (a) The adverb eutheos (or euthus) is indeed of very frequent
   occurrence in S. Mark's Gospel. And yet its absence from chap. xvi is
   proved to be in no degree a suspicious circumstance, from the discovery
   that though it occurs as many as

   12                   times in chap. i;
   and 6                "        chap. v;
   and 5                "        chap. iv, vi;
   and 3                "        chap. ii, ix, xiv;
   and 2                "        chap. xi;
   it yet occurs only 1 "        chap. iii, viii, x, xv;
   while it occurs      "        chap. xii, xiii, xvi.

   (b) In like manner, palin, which occurs as often as

   6      times in chap. xiv;
   and 5  "        chap. x;
   and 3  "        chap. viii, xv;
   and 2  "        chap. ii, vii, xi, xii;
   and 1  "        chap. iv, v;
   occurs "        chap. i, vi, ix, xiii. xvi. [298]

   (1.) Now,--How can it possibly be more suspicious that palin should be
   absent from the last twelve verses of S. Mark, than that it should be
   away from the first forty-five?

   (2.) Again. Since eutheos is not found in the xii^th or the xiii^th
   chapters of this same Gospel,--nor palin in the i^st, vi^th, ix^th, or
   xiii^th chapter,--(for the sufficient reason that neither word is
   wanted in any of those places,)--what possible "suspiciousness" can be
   supposed to result from the absence of both words from the xvi^th
   chapter also, where also neither of them is wanted? Why is the xvi^th
   chapter of S. Mark's Gospel,--or rather, why are "the last twelve
   verses" of it,--to labour under such special disfavor and discredit?

   (3.) Dr. Tregelles makes answer,--"I am well aware that arguments on
   style are often very fallacious, and that by themselves they prove very
   little: but when there does exist external evidence, and when internal
   proofs as to style, manner, verbal expression, and connection, are in
   accordance with such independent grounds of forming a judgment; then
   these internal considerations possess very great weight [299] ."--For
   all rejoinder, the respected writer is asked,--(a) But when there does
   not exist any such external evidence: what then? Next, he is reminded
   (b) That whether there does, or does not, it is at least certain that
   not one of those "proofs as to style," &c., of which he speaks, has
   been able to stand the test of strict examination. Not only is the
   precariousness of all such Criticism as has been brought to bear
   against the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 excessive, but the
   supposed facts adduced in evidence have been found out to be every one
   of them mistakes;--being either, (1) demonstrably without argumentative
   cogency of any kind;--or else, (2) distinctly corroborative and
   confirmatory circumstances: indications that this part of the Gospel is
   indeed by S. Mark,--not that it is probably the work of another hand.

   And thus the formidable enumeration of twenty-seven grounds of
   suspicion vanishes out of sight: fourteen of them proving to be
   frivolous and nugatory; and thirteen, more of less clearly witnessing
   in favour of the section [300] .

   III. Of these thirteen expressions, some are even eloquent in their
   witness. I am saying that it is impossible not to be exceedingly struck
   by the discovery that this portion of the Gospel contains (as I have
   explained already) so many indications of S. Mark's undoubted manner.
   Such is the reference to hektisis (in ver. 15):--the mention of apistia
   (in ver. 14):--the occurrence of the verb poreuesthai (in ver. 10 and
   12),--of the phrase en to ono'mati' mou (in ver. 17),--and of the
   phrase cheiras epitithenai epi tina (in ver. 18):--of the Evangelical
   term for our Lord's Ascension, viz. anele'phthe (in ver. 19):--and
   lastly, of the compounds parakolouthein and epakolouthein (in verses 17
   and 20.)

   To these Thirteen, will have to be added all those other notes of
   identity of authorship,--such as they are,--which result from recurring
   identity of phrase, and of which the assailants of this portion of the
   Gospel have prudently said nothing. Such are the following:--

   (xiv.) Anistanai, for rising from the dead; which is one of S. Mark's
   words. Taking into account the shortness of his Gospel, he has it
   thrice as often as S. Luke; twelve times as often as S. Matthew or S.
   John.

   (xv.) The idiomatic expression poreuome'nois eis agro'n, of which S.
   Matthew does not present a single specimen; but which occurs three
   times in the short Gospel of S. Mark [301] ,--of which ver. 12 is one.

   (xvi.) The expression proi' (in ver. 9,)--of which S. Mark avails
   himself six times: i.e. (if the length of the present Gospel be taken
   into account) almost five times as often as either S. Matthew or S.
   John,--S. Luke never using the word at all. In his first chapter (ver.
   35), and here in his last (ver. 2), S. Mark uses li'an in connexion
   with proi'.

   (xvii.) The phrase keru'ssein to` euange'lion (in ver. 15) is another
   of S. Mark's phrases. Like S. Matthew, he employs it four times (i. 14:
   xiii. 10: xiv. 9: xvi. 15): but it occurs neither in S. Luke's nor in
   S. John's Gospel.

   (xviii.) The same words singly are characteristic of his Gospel. Taking
   the length of their several narratives into account, S. Mark has the
   word keru'ssein more than twice as often as S. Matthew: three times as
   often as S. Luke.

   (xix.) euange'lion,--a word which occurs only in the first two
   Gospels,--is found twice as often in S. Mark's as in S. Matthew's
   Gospel: and if the respective length of their Gospels be considered,
   the proportion will be as three to one. It occurs, as above stated, in
   ver. 15.

   (xx.) If such Critics as Dr. Davidson had been concerned to vindicate
   the genuineness of this section of the Gospel, we should have been
   assured that phanerousthai is another of S. Mark's words: by which they
   would have meant no more than this,--that though employed neither by S.
   Matthew nor by S. Luke it is used thrice by S. Mark,--being found twice
   in this section (verses 12, 14), as well as in ch. iv. 22.

   (xxi.) They would have also pointed out that sklerokardia is another of
   S. Mark's words: being employed neither by S. Luke nor by S. John,--by
   S. Matthew only once,--but by S. Mark on two occasions; of which ch.
   xvi. 14 is one.

   (xxii.) In the same spirit, they would have bade us observe that
   pantachou (ver. 20)--unknown to S. Matthew and S. John, and employed
   only once by S. Luke,--is twice used by S. Mark; one instance occurring
   in the present section.

   Nor would it have been altogether unfair if they had added that the
   precisely similar word pantachothen (or pantothen) is only found in
   this same Gospel,--viz. in ch. i. 45.

   (xxiii.) They would further have insisted (and this time with a greater
   show of reason) that the adverb kalos (which is found in ver. 18) is
   another favorite word with S. Mark: occurring as it does, (when the
   length of these several narratives is taken into account,) more than
   twice as often in S. Mark's as in S. John's Gospel,-- just three times
   as often as in the Gospel of S. Matthew and S. Luke.

   (xxiv.) A more interesting (because a more just) observation would have
   been that echein, in the sense of "to be," (as in the phrase kalos
   echein, ver. 18,) is characteristic of S. Mark. He has it oftener than
   any of the Evangelists, viz. six times in all (ch. i. 32; 34: ii. 17:
   v. 23: vi. 55: xvi. 18.) Taking the shortness of his Gospel into
   account, he employs this idiom twice as often as S. Matthew;--three
   times as often as S. John;--four times as often as S. Luke.

   (xxv.) They would have told us further that arrhostos is another of S.
   Mark's favorite words: for that he has it three times,--viz. in ch. vi.
   5, 13, and here in ver. 18. S. Matthew has it only once. S. Luke and S.
   John not at all.

   (xxvi.) And we should have been certainly reminded by them that the
   conjunction of penthousi kai` klai'ousi (in ver. 10) is characteristic
   of S. Mark,--who has klai'ontas kai` alala'zontas in ch. v. 38:
   thorubeisthe kai` klai'ete in the very next verse. As for penthein, it
   is one of the 123 words common to S. Matthew and S. Mark, and peculiar
   to their two Gospels.

   (xxvii.) Lastly, "katakrino (in ver. 16), instead of krino, is Mark's
   word, (comp. x. 33: xiv. 64)." The simple verb which is used four times
   by S. Matthew, five times by S. Luke, nineteen times by S. John, is
   never at all employed by S. Mark: whereas the compound verb he has
   oftener in proportion than S. Matthew,--more than twice as often as
   either S. Luke or S. John.

   Strange,--that there should be exactly "xxvii" notes of genuineness
   discoverable in these twelve verses, instead of "XXVII" grounds of
   suspicion!

   But enough of all this. Here, we may with advantage review the progress
   hitherto made in this inquiry.

   I claim to have demonstrated long since that all those imposing
   assertions respecting the "Style" and "Phraseology" of this section of
   the Gospel which were rehearsed at the outset [302] ,--are destitute of
   foundation, But from this discovery alone there results a settled
   conviction which it will be found difficult henceforth to disturb. A
   page of Scripture which has been able to endure so severe au ordeal of
   hostile inquiry, has been proved to be above suspicion. That character
   is rightly accounted blameless which comes out unsullied after Calumny
   has done her worst; done it systematically; done it with a will; done
   it for a hundred years.

   But this is not an adequate statement of the facts of the case in
   respect of the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel. Something more is
   certain than that the charges which have been so industriously brought
   against this portion of the Gospel are without foundation. It has been
   also proved that instead of there being discovered twenty-seven
   suspicious words and phrases scattered up and down these twelve verses
   of the Gospel, there actually exist exactly as many words and phrases
   which attest with more or less certainty that those verses are nothing
   else but the work of the Evangelist.

   IV. And now it is high time to explain that though I have hitherto
   condescended to adopt the method of my opponents, I have only done so
   in order to show that it proves fatal to themselves. I am, to say the
   truth, ashamed of what has last been written,--so untrustworthy do I
   deem the method which, (following the example of those who have
   preceded me in this inquiry,) I have hitherto pursued. The "Concordance
   test,"--(for that is probably as apt and intelligible a designation as
   can be devised for the purely mechanical process whereby it is proposed
   by a certain school of Critics to judge of the authorship of
   Scripture,)--is about the coarsest as well as about the most delusive
   that could be devised. By means of this clumsy and vulgar instrument,
   especially when applied, (as in the case before us,) without skill and
   discrimination, it would be just as easy to prove that the first twelve
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel are of a suspicious character as the last
   [303] . In truth, except in very skilful hands, it is no test at all,
   and can only mislead.

   Thus, (in ver. 1,) we should be informed (i.) that "Mark nowhere uses
   the appellation Jesus Christ:" and (ii.) that "euangelion Iesou
   Christou" is "Pauline."--We should be reminded (iii.) that this
   Evangelist nowhere introduces any of the Prophets by name, and that
   therefore the mention of "Isaiah [304] " (in ver. 2) is a suspicious
   circumstance:--(iv.) that a quotation from the Old Testament is
   "foreign to his manner,"--(for writers of this class would not hesitate
   to assume that S. Mark xv. 28 is no part of the Gospel;)--and (v.) that
   the fact that here are quotations from two different prophets, betrays
   an unskilful hand.--(vi.) Because S. Mark three times calls Judaea by
   its usual name (Ioudaia, viz. in iii. 7: x. 1: xiii. 14), the unique
   designation, e Ioudai'a cho'ra (in ver. 5) would be pronounced decisive
   against "the authorship of Mark."--(vii.) The same thing would be said
   of the unique expression, en Iorda'ne potamo, which is found in ver.
   5,--seeing that this Evangelist three times designates Jordan simply as
   Iorda'nes (i. 9: iii. 8: x. 1).--(viii.) That entire expression in ver.
   7 (unique, it must be confessed, in the Gospel,) hou ouk eimi`
   ikano`s--upodema'ton autou, would be pronounced "abhorrent to the style
   of Mark."--(ix.) to` Pneuma, twice, (viz. in ver. 10 and ver. 12) we
   should be told is never used by the Evangelist absolutely for the Holy
   Ghost: but always to` Pneuma to` Hagion, (as in ch. iii. 29; xii. 36:
   xiii. 11).--(x.) The same would be said of oi Hierosolumitai (in ver.
   5) for "the inhabitants of Jerusalem:" we should be assured that S.
   Mark's phrase would rather be hoi apo` Hierosolu'mon,--as in ch. iii. 8
   and 22.--And (xi.) the expression pisteu'ete en to euangeli'o (ver.
   15), we should be informed "cannot be Mark's;"--who either employs
   eisand the accusative (as in ch. ix. 92), or else makes the verb take a
   dative (as in ch. xi. 31: xvi. 13, 14.)--We should also probably be
   told that the ten following words are all "unknown to Mark:"--(xii.)
   triches,--(xiii.) dermatine,--(xiv.) osphus,--(xv.) akrides,--(xvi.)
   meli, (xvii.) agrios (six instances in a single verse (ver. 6): a
   highly suspicious circumstance!),--(xviii.) kuptein,--(xix.) himas,
   (xx.) hupodemata (all three instances in ver. 7!)--(xxi.)
   eudokein,--(xxii.) kai` ege'neto . . . elthen, (ver. 9),--unique in S.
   Mark!--(xxiii.) baptizesthai eis (ver 9), another unique
   phrase!--(xxiv.) hoi ouranoi twice, (viz. in verses 10, 11) yet
   elsewhere, when S. Mark speaks of Heaven, (ch. vi. 41: vii. 34: viii.
   11: xvi. 19) he always uses the singular.--Lastly, (xxv.) the same
   sorry objection which was brought against the "last twelve verses,"
   (that palin, a favourite adverb with S. Mark, is not found there,) is
   here even more conspicuous.

   Turning away from all this,--(not, however, without an apology for
   having lingered over such frivolous details so long,)--I desire to
   point out that we have reverently to look below the surface, if we
   would ascertain how far it is to be presumed from internal
   considerations whether S. Mark was indeed the author of this portion of
   his Gospel, or not.

   V. We must devise, I say, some more delicate, more philosophical, more
   real test than the coarse, uncritical expedient which has been hitherto
   considered of ascertaining by reference to the pages of a Greek
   Concordance whether a certain word which is found in this section of
   the Gospel is, or is not, used elsewhere by S. Mark. And I suppose it
   will be generally allowed to be deserving of attention,--in fact, to be
   a singularly corroborative circumstance,--that within the narrow
   compass of these Twelve Verses we meet with every principal
   characteristic of S. Mark's manner:--Thus,

   (i.) Though he is the Author of the shortest of the Gospels, and though
   to all appearance he often merely reproduces what S. Matthew has said
   before him, or else anticipates something, which is afterwards
   delivered by S. Luke,--it is surprising how often we are indebted to S.
   Mark for precious pieces of information which we look for in vain
   elsewhere. Now, this is a feature of the Evangelist's manner which is
   susceptible of memorable illustration from the section before us.

   How many and how considerable are the new circumstances which S. Mark
   here delivers!--(1) That Mary Magdalene was the first to behold the
   risen Saviour: (2) That it was He who had cast out from her the "seven
   devils:" (3) How the men were engaged to whom she brought her joyful
   message,--(4) who not only did not believe her story, but when Cleopas
   and his companion declared what had happened to themselves, "neither
   believed they them." (5) The terms of the Ministerial Commission, as
   set down in verses 15 and 16, are unique. (6) The announcement of the
   "signs which should follow them that believe" is even extraordinary.
   Lastly, (7) this is the only place in the Gospel where The Session at
   the right Hand of God is recorded. . . . So many, and such precious
   incidents, showered into the Gospel Treasury at the last moment, and
   with such a lavish hand, must needs have proceeded if not from an
   Apostle at least from a companion of Apostles. , if we had no other
   token to go by, there could not be a reasonable doubt that this entire
   section is by no other than S. Mark himself!

   (ii.) A second striking characteristic of the second Evangelist is his
   love of picturesque, or at least of striking details,--his proneness to
   introduce exceedingly minute particulars, often of the profoundest
   significancy, and always of considerable interest. Not to look beyond
   the Twelve Verses (chap. i. 9-20) which were originally proposed for
   comparison,--We are reminded (a) that in describing our Saviour's
   Baptism, it is only S. Mark who relates that "He came from Nazareth" to
   be baptized.--(b) In his highly elliptical account of our Lord's
   Temptation, it is only he who relates that "He was with the wild
   beasts."--(c) In his description of the Call of the four Disciples, S.
   Mark alone it is who, (notwithstanding the close resemblance of his
   account to what is found in S. Matthew,) records that the father of S.
   James and S. John was left "in the ship with the hired servants [305]
   ."--Now, of this characteristic, we have also within these twelve
   verses, at least four illustrations:--

   (a) Note in ver. 10, that life-like touch which evidently proceeded
   from an eye-witness,--"penthousi kai` klai'ousi." S. Mark relates that
   when Mary conveyed to the Disciples the joyous tidings of the Loan's
   Resurrection, she found them overwhelmed with sorrow,--"mourning and
   weeping."

   (b) Note also that the unbelief recorded in ver. 13 is recorded only
   there.

   (c) Again. S. Mark not only says that as the two Disciples were "going
   into the country," (poreuome'nois eis agro'n [306] , ver. 12,) Jesus
   also "went with them"--(sun-eporeueto, as S. Luke relates;)--but that
   it was as they actually "walked" along (peripatousin) that this
   manifestation took place.

   (d) Among the marvellous predictions made concerning "them that
   believe;" what can be imagined more striking than the promise that they
   should "take up serpents;" and suffer no harm even if they should
   "drink any deadly thing"?

   (iii) Next,--all have been struck, I suppose, with S. Mark's proneness
   to substitute some expression of his own for what he found in the
   Gospel of his predecessor S. Matthew: or, when he anticipates something
   which is afterwards met with in the Gospel of S. Luke, his aptness to
   deliver it in language entirely independent of the later Evangelist. I
   allude, for instance; to his substitution of epibalo`n e'klaie (xiv.
   72) for S. Matthew's e'klausen pikros (xxvi. 75);--and of o te'kton
   (vi. 3) for o tou te'ktonos uio's (S. Matth. xiii. 55).--The "woman of
   Canaan" in S. Matthew's Gospel (gune` Chananai'a, ch. xv. 22), is
   called "a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation" in S. Mark's (Helleni`s,
   Surophoini'ssa to ge'nei, ch. vii. 26).--At the Baptism, "instead of
   the "opened" heavens of S. Matthew (aneo'chthesan, ch. iii. 16) and S.
   Luke (aneochthenai, ch. iii. 22), we are presented by S. Mark with the
   striking image of the heavens "cleaving" or "being rent asunder"
   (schizome'nous [307] , ch. i. 10).--What S. Matthew calls ta` o'ria
   Magadala' (ch. xv. 39), S. Mark designates as ta` me're Dalmanoutha'
   (ch. viii. 10.)--In place of S. Matthew's zu'me Saddoukai'on, (ch. xvi.
   6), S. Mark has zu'me Hero'dou (ch. viii. 15.)--In describing the visit
   to Jericho, for the du'o tuphloi of S. Matthew (ch. xx. 29), S. Mark
   gives uio`s Timai'ou Bartimaios o tuphlo`s . . . . prosaiton (ch. x.
   46.)--For the kla'dous of S. Matth. xxi. 8, S. Mark (ch. xi. 8) has
   stoiba'das; and for the other's pri`n ale'ktora phonesai (xxvi. 34), he
   has pri`n e` di`s (xiv. 30.)--It is so throughout.

   Accordingly,--(as we have already more than once had occasion to
   remark,)--whereas the rest say only he mia ton sabbaton, S. Mark says
   pro'te sabba'tou (in ver. 9).--Whereas S. Luke (viii. 2) says aph' es
   daimo'nia epta` exelelu'thei,--S. Mark records that from her
   ekbeble'kei epta` daimonia.--Very different is the great ministerial
   Commission as set down by S. Mark in ver. 15, 16, from what is found in
   S. Matthew xxviii. 19, 20.--And whereas S. Luke says "their eyes were
   holden that they should not know Him," S. Mark says that "He appeared
   to them in another form." . . . Is it credible that any one fabricating
   a conclusion to S. Mark's narrative after S. Luke's Gospel had
   appeared, would have ventured so to paraphrase S. Luke's statement? And
   yet, let the consistent truthfulness of either expression be carefully
   noted. Both are historically accurate, but they proceed from opposite
   points of view. Viewed on the heavenly side, (God's side), the
   Disciples' "eyes" (of course) "were holden:"--viewed on the earthly
   side, (Man's side), the risen Saviour (no doubt) "appeared in another
   form."

   (iv.) Then further, S. Mark is observed to introduce many expressions
   into his Gospel which confirm the prevalent tradition that it was at
   Rome he wrote it; and that it was with an immediate view to Latin
   readers that it was published. Twelve such expressions were enumerated
   above (at p. 150-1); and such, it was also there shewn, most
   unmistakably is the phrase prote sabbatou in ver. 9.--It is simply
   incredible that any one but an Evangelist writing under the peculiar
   conditions traditionally assigned to S. Mark, would have hit upon such
   an expression as this,--the strict equivalent, to Latin ears, for he
   mia to?n sabba'ton, which has occurred just above, in ver. 2. Now this,
   it will be remembered, is one of the hacknied objections to the
   genuineness of this entire portion of the Gospel;--quite proof enough,
   if proof were needed, of the exceeding improbability which attaches to
   the phrase, in the judgment of those who have considered this question
   the most.

   (v.) The last peculiarity of S. Mark to which I propose to invite
   attention is supplied by those expressions which connect his Gospel
   with S. Peter, and remind us of the constant traditional belief of the
   ancient Church that S. Mark was the companion of the chief of the
   Apostles.

   That the second Gospel contains many such hints has often been pointed
   out; never more interestingly or more convincingly than by Townson
   [308] , in a work which deserves to be in the hands of every student of
   Sacred Science. Instead of reproducing any of the familiar cases in
   order to illustrate my meaning, I will mention one which has perhaps
   never been mentioned in this connexion before.

   (a) Reference is made to our Lord's sayings in S. Mark vii, and
   specially to what is found in ver. 19. That expression, "purging all
   meats" (kathari'zon [309] pa'nta ta` bro'mata), does really seem to be
   no part of the Divine discourse; but the Evangelist's inspired comment
   on the Saviour's words [310] . Our Saviour (he explains) by that
   discourse of His--ipso, facto--"made all meats clean." How doubly
   striking a statement, when it is remembered that probably Simon Peter
   himself was the actual author of it;--the same who, on the house-top at
   Joppa, had been shewn in a vision that "God had made clean" (ho Theos
   ekatharise [311] ) all His creatures!

   (b) Now, let a few words spoken by the same S. Peter on a memorable
   occasion be considered:--"Wherefore of these men which have companied
   with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
   beginning from the Baptism of John, unto that same day that He was
   taken up (anelephthe) from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
   with us of His Resurrection [312] ." Does not S. Peter thereby define
   the precise limits of our Saviour's Ministry,--shewing it to have
   "begun" (arxamenos) "from the Baptism of John,"--and closed with the
   Day of our Lord's Ascension? And what else are those but the exact
   bounds of S. Mark's Gospel,--of which the arche; (ch. i. 1) is signally
   declared to have been the Baptism of John,--and. the utmost limit, the
   day when (as S. Mark says) "He was taken up (anelephthe) into
   Heaven,"--(ch. xvi. 19)?

   (c) I will only further remind the reader, in connexion with the
   phrase, pa'se te kti'sei, in ver. 155,--(concerning which, the reader
   is referred back to page 162-3,)--that both S. Peter and S. Mark (but
   no other of the sacred writers) conspire to use the expression ap'
   arche?s kti'seos [313] . S. Mark has besides kti'seos hes e'ktise o
   Theo`s (ch. xiii. 19); while S. Peter alone styles the Almighty, from
   His work of Creation, ho ktistes (1 S. Pet. iv. 19).

   VI. But besides, and over and above such considerations as those which
   precede,--(some of which, I am aware, might be considerably evacuated
   of their cogency; while others, I am just as firmly convinced, will
   remain forcible witnesses of God's Truth to the end of Time,)--I
   hesitate not to avow my personal conviction that abundant and striking
   evidence is garnered up within the brief compass of these Twelve Verses
   that they are identical in respect of fabric with the rest of the
   Gospel; were clearly manufactured out of the same Divine
   materials,--wrought in the same heavenly loom.

   It was even to have been expected, from what is found to have been
   universally the method in other parts of Scripture,--(for it was of
   course foreseen by Almighty God from the beginning that this portion of
   His Word would be, like its Divine Author, in these last days cavilled
   at, reviled, hated, rejected, denied,)--that the Spirit would not leave
   Himself without witness in this place. It was to have been anticipated,
   I say, that Eternal Wisdom would carefully--(I trust there is no
   irreverence in so speaking of God and His ways!)--would carefully make
   provision: meet the coming unbelief (as His Angel met Balaam) with a
   drawn sword: plant up and down throughout these Twelve Verses of the
   Gospel, sure indications of their Divine Original,--unmistakable notes
   of purpose and design,--mysterious traces and tokens of Himself; not
   visible indeed to the scornful and arrogant, the impatient and
   irreverent; yet clear as if written with a sunbeam to the patient and.
   humble student, the man who "trembleth at God's Word [314] ." Or, (if
   the Reader prefers the image,) the indications of a Divine Original to
   be met with in these verses shall be likened rather to those cryptic
   characters, invisible so long as they remain unsuspected, but which
   shine forth clear and strong when exposed to the Light or to the Heat;
   (Light and Heat, both emblems of Himself!) so that even he that gropeth
   in darkness must now see them, and admit that of a truth "the Lord is
   in this place" although he "knew it not!"

   (i.) I propose then that in the first instance we compare the
   conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel with the beginning of it. We did this
   before, when our object was to ascertain whether the Style of S. Mark
   xvi. 9-20 be indeed as utterly discordant from that of the rest of the
   Gospel as is commonly represented. We found, instead, the most striking
   resemblance [315] . We also instituted a brief comparison between the
   two in order to discover whether the Diction of the one might not
   possibly be found as suggestive of verbal doubts as the diction of the
   other: and so we found it [316] .--Let us for the third time draw the
   two extremities of this precious fabric into close proximity in order
   again to compare them. Nothing I presume can be fairer than to elect
   that, once more, our attention be chiefly directed to what is contained
   within the twelve verses (ver. 9-20) of S. Mark's first chapter which
   exactly correspond with the twelve verses of his last chapter (ver.
   9-20) which are the subject of the present volume.

   Now between these two sections of the Gospel, besides (1) the obvious
   verbal resemblance, I detect (2) a singular parallelism of essential
   structure. And this does not strike me the less forcibly because
   nothing of the kind was to have been expected.

   (1.) On the verbal coincidences I do not propose to lay much stress.
   Yet are they certainly not without argumentative weight and
   significancy. I allude to the following:--

   (a) [bapti'zon, ba'ptisma (i. 4)--kai` ebapti'zonto (i. 5)--eba'ptisa,
   bapti'sei (i. 8)]--kai` ebapti'sthe (i. 9)

   (a) baptistheis

   (b) [kerusson, ekerusse (i. 7)]

   (b) ekeruxan (xvi. 20)

   (b and c) keru'sson to` euange'lion, (i. 14)--[arche` tou euangeli'ou
   (i. 1)]

   (c) keru'xate to` euange'lion (xvi. 15

   (c and d) pisteu'ete en to euangeli'o (i. 15)

   (d) epi'stesan (xvi. 11)--oude` epi'steusan (xvi. 13)--te`n apisti'an,
   ouk epi'steusan (xvi. 14)--o pisteu'sas, o apiste'sas (xvi. 16)--tois
   pisteu'sasi (xvi. 17.)

   Now this, to say the least, shews that there exists an unmistakable
   relation of sympathy between the first page of S. Mark's Gospel and the
   last. The same doctrinal phraseology [317] ,--the same indications of
   Divine purpose,--the same prevailing cast of thought is observed to
   occur in both. (i.) A Gospel to be everywhere preached;--(ii.) Faith,
   to be of all required;--(iii.) Baptism to be universally administered;
   ("one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism:")--Is not this the theme of the
   beginning of S. Mark's Gospel as well as of the end of it? Surely it is
   as if on comparing the two extremities of a chain, with a view to
   ascertaining whether the fabric be identical or not, It were discovered
   that those extremities are even meant to clasp!

   (2.) But the essential parallelism between S. Mark xvi. 9-20 and S.
   Mark i. 9-20 is a profounder phenomenon and deserves even more
   attention. I proceed to set down side by side, as before, what ought to
   require neither comment nor explanation of mine. Thus we find,--

   (A) in ch. i. 9 to 11:--Our Lord's Manifestation to the World
   epiphaneia on His "coming up (anabainon) out of the water" of Jordan:
   (having been "buried by Baptism," as the Apostle speaks:) when the
   Voice from Heaven proclaimed,--"Thou art My beloved Son in whom I am
   well pleased."

   (A) in ch. xvi. 9 to 11:--Our Lord's appearance to Mary Magdalene
   (epha'ne) after His Resurrection (anastas) from Death: (of which God
   had said, "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee."

   ----12 to 14:--Two other Manifestations (ephanero'the) to Disciples.

   (B)---- 12, 13:--Christ's victory over Satan; (whereby is fulfilled the
   promise "Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
   the dragon shalt Thou trample under feet.")

   (B)----17, 18:--Christ's promise that "they that believe" "shall cast
   out devils" and "shall take up serpents:" (as [in S. Luke x. 19] He had
   given the Seventy "power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over
   all the power of the Enemy.")

   [(C)----8:--The Pentecostal Gift foretold: "He shall baptize you with
   the Holy Ghost."]

   (C)----17:--The chief Pentecostal Gift specified: "They shall speak
   with new tongues."

   (D) in ch. i. 14, 15:--Christ "comes into Galilee, preaching the Gospel
   . . . . and saying . . . . Repent ye, and believe the Gospel."

   (D) in ch. xvi. 15, 16:--He commands His Apostles to "go into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved."

   (E)----15: His announcement, that "The time is fulfilled, and the
   Kingdom of God is at hand."

   (E)----19:--S. Mark's record concerning Him, that "He was received up
   into Heaven, and sat on the right hand of God:" (where He must reign
   till He hath put all enemies under His feet.")

   (F)----16 to 20:--The four Apostles' Call to the Ministry: (which [S.
   Luke v. 8, 9] is miraculously attested.)

   (F)----20:--The Apostles' Ministry, which is everywhere miraculously
   attested,--"The Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the
   signs that followed."

   It is surely not an unmeaning circumstance, a mere accident, that the
   Evangelist should at the very outset and at the very conclusion of his
   Gospel, so express himself! If, however, it should seem to the Reader a
   mere matter of course, a phenomenon without interest or
   significancy,--nothing which I could add would probably bring him to a
   different mind.

   (3.) Then, further: when I scrutinize attentively the two portions of
   Scripture thus proposed for critical survey, I am not a little struck
   by the discovery that the VIth Article of the ancient Creed of
   Jerusalem (A.D. 348) is found in the one: the Xth Article, in the other
   [318] . If it be a purely fortuitous circumstance, that two cardinal
   verities like these,--(viz. "He ascended into Heaven, and sat down at
   the Right Hand of God,"--and "One Baptism for the Remission of sins,")
   should be found at either extremity of one short Gospel,--I will but
   point out that it is certainly one of a very remarkable series of
   fortuitous circumstances.--But in the thing to be mentioned next, there
   neither is, nor can be, any talk of fortuitousness at all.

   (4.) Allusion is made to the diversity of Name whereby the Son of Man
   is indicated in these two several places of the Gospel; which
   constitutes a most Divine circumstance, and is profoundly significant.
   He who in the first verse (S. Mark i. 1) was designated by the joint
   title "Iesous" and "Christos,"--here, in the last two verses (S. Mark
   xvi. 19, 20) is styled for the first and for the last time, "Ho
   KURIOS"--the Lord [319] .

   And why? Because He who at His Circumcision was named "Jesus," (a Name
   which was given Him from His Birth, yea, and before His Birth); He who
   at His Baptism became "the Christ," (a Title which belonged to His
   Office, and which betokens His sacred Unction);--the same, on the
   occasion of His Ascension into Heaven and Session at the Right Hand of
   God,--when (as we know) "all power had been given unto Him in Heaven
   and in Earth" (S. Matth. xxviii. 18),--is designated by His Name of
   Dominion; "the Lord" Jehovah . . . "Magnifica et opportuna
   appellatio!"--as Bengel well remarks.

   But I take leave to point out that all this is what never either would
   or could have entered into the mind of a fabricator of a conclusion to
   S. Mark's unfinished Gospel. No inventor of a supplement, I say, could
   have planted his foot in this way in exactly the right place. The proof
   of my assertion is twofold:--

   (a) First, because the present indication that the Holy Ghost was
   indeed the Author of these last Twelve Verses is even appealed to by
   Dr. Davidson and his School, as a proof of a spurious original. Verily,
   such Critics do not recognise the token of the Divine Finger even when
   they see it!

   (b) Next, as a matter of fact, we have a spurious Supplement to the
   Gospel,--the same which was exhibited above at p. 123-4; and which may
   here be with advantage reproduced in its Latin form:--"Omnia autem
   quaecumque praecepta erant illis qui cum Petro erant, breviter
   exposuerunt. Post haec et ipso Iesus adparuit, et ab oriente usque in
   occidentem misit per illos sanctam et incorruptam praedicationem
   salutis aeternae. Amen [320] ."--Another apocryphal termination is
   found in certain copies of the Thebaic version. It occupies the place
   of ver. 20, and is as follows:--"Exeuntes terni in quatuor climata
   caeli praedicarunt Evangelium in mundo toto, Christo operante cum iis
   in verbo confirmationem cum signis sequentibus eos et miraculis. Atque
   hoc modo cognitum est regnum Dei iu terra tota et in mundo toto
   Israelis in testimonium gentium omnium harum quae exsistunt ab oriente
   ad occasum." It will be seen that the Title of Dominion (ho Kurios--the
   Lord) is found in neither of these fabricated passages; but the Names
   of Nativity and of Baptism (Iesous and Christos--Jesus and Christ)
   occur instead.

   (ii.) Then further:--It is an extraordinary note of genuineness that
   such a vast number of minute but important facts should be found
   accumulated within the narrow compass of these twelve verses; and
   should be met with nowhere else. The writer,--supposing that he had
   only S. Matthew's Gospel before him,--traverses (except in one single
   instance) wholly new ground; moves forward with unmistakable boldness
   and a rare sense of security; and wherever he plants his foot, it is to
   enrich the soil with fertility and beauty. But on the supposition that
   he wrote after S. Luke's and S. John's Gospel had appeared,--the marvel
   becomes increased an hundred-fold: for how then does it come to pass
   that he evidently draws his information from quite independent sources?
   is not bound by any of their statements? even seems purposely to break
   away from their guidance, and to adventure some extraordinary statement
   of his own,--which nevertheless carries the true Gospel savour with it;
   and is felt to be authentic from the very circumstance that no one
   would have ever dared to invent such a detail and put it forth on his
   own responsibility?

   (iii.) Second to no indication that this entire section of the Gospel
   has a Divine original, I hold to be a famous expression which (like
   prote sabbatou) has occasioned general offence: I mean, the designation
   of Mary Magdalene as one "out of whom" the Lord "had cast seven
   devils;" and that, in immediate connexion with the record of her august
   privilege of being the first of the Human Race to behold His risen
   form. There is such profound Gospel significancy,--such sublime
   improbability,--such exquisite pathos in this record,--that I would
   defy any fabricator, be he who he might, to have achieved it. This has
   been to some extent pointed out already [321] .

   (iv.) It has also been pointed out, (but the circumstance must be by
   all means here insisted upon afresh,) that the designation (found in
   ver. 10) of the little company of our Lord's followers,--"tois met'
   autou genome'nois,"--is another rare note of veracious origin. No one
   but S. Mark,--or just such an one as he,--would or could have so
   accurately designated the little band of Christian men and women who,
   unconscious of their bliss, were "mourning and weeping" till after
   sunrise on the first Easter Day. The reader is reminded of what has
   been already offered on this subject, at p.155-6.

   (v.) I venture further to point out that no writer but S. Mark, (or
   such an one as he [322] ), would have familiarly designated the
   Apostolic body as "autois tois e'ndeka," in ver. 14. The phrase hoi
   dodeka, he uses in proportion far oftener than any other two of the
   Evangelists [323] . And it is evident that the phrase hoi hendeka soon
   became an equally recognised designation of the Apostolic body,--"from
   which Judas by transgression fell." Its familiar introduction into this
   place by the second Evangelist is exactly what one might have looked
   for, or at least what one is fully prepared to meet with, in him.

   (vi.) I will close this enumeration by calling attention to an
   unobtrusive and unobserved verb in the last of these verses which (I
   venture to say) it would never have entered into the mind of any
   ordinary writer to employ in that particular place. I allude to the
   familiar word exelthontes.

   The precise meaning of the expression,--depending on the known force of
   the preposition with which the verb is compounded,--can scarcely be
   missed by any one who, on the one hand, is familiar with the
   Evangelical method; on the other, is sufficiently acquainted with the
   Gospel History. Reference is certainly made to the final departure of
   the Apostolic body out of the city of Jerusalem [324] . And tacitly,
   beyond a question, there is herein contained a recollection of our
   Saviour's command to His Apostles, twice expressly recorded by S. Luke,
   "that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise
   of the Father." "Behold," (said He,) "I send the promise of My Father
   upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued
   with power from on high [325] ." . . . After many days "they went
   forth," or "out." S. Mark, (or perhaps it is rather S. Peter,)
   expressly says so,--exelthontes. Aye, and that was a memorable
   "outgoing," truly! What else was its purpose but the evangelization of
   the World?

   VII. Let this suffice, then, concerning the evidence derived from
   Internal considerations. But lest it should hereafter be reckoned as an
   omission, and imputed to me as a fault, that I have said nothing about
   the alleged Inconsistency of certain statements contained in these
   "Twelve Verses" with the larger notices contained in the parallel
   narratives of S. Luke and S. John,--I proceed briefly to explain why I
   am silent on this head.

   1. I cannot see for whom I should be writing; in other words,--what I
   should propose to myself as the end to be attained by what I wrote.
   For,

   2. What would be gained by demonstrating,--(as I am of course prepared
   to do,)--that there is really no inconsistency whatever between
   anything which S. Mark here says, and what the other Evangelists
   deliver? I should have proved that,--(assuming the other Evangelical
   narratives to be authentic, i.e. historically true,)--the narrative
   before us cannot be objected to on the score of its not being authentic
   also. But by whom is such proof required?

   (a) Not by the men who insist that errors are occasionally to be met
   with in the Evangelical narratives. In their estimation, the
   genuineness of an inspired writing is a thing not in the least degree
   rendered suspicious by the erroneousness of its statements. According
   to them, the narrative may exhibit inaccuracies and inconsistencies,
   and may yet be the work of S. Mark. If the inconsistencies be but
   "trifling," and the inaccuracies "minute,"--these "sound Theologians,"
   (for so they style themselves [326] ,) "have no dread whatever of
   acknowledging" their existence. Be it so. Then would it be a gratuitous
   task to set about convincing them that no inconsistency, no inaccuracy
   is discoverable within the compass of these Twelve concluding Verses.

   (b) But neither is such proof required by faithful Readers; who, for
   want of the. requisite Scientific knowledge, are unable to discern the
   perfect Harmony of the Evangelical narratives in this place. It is only
   one of many places where a prima facie discrepancy, though it does not
   fail to strike,--yet (happily) altogether fails to distress them.
   Consciously or unconsciously, such readers reason with themselves
   somewhat as follows:--"God's Word, like all God's other Works, (and I
   am taught to regard God's Word as a very masterpiece of creative
   skill;)--the blessed Gospel, I say, is full of difficulties. And yet
   those difficulties are observed invariably to disappear under competent
   investigation. Can I seriously doubt that if sufficient critical skill
   were brought to bear on the highly elliptical portion of narrative
   contained in these Twelve Verses, it would present no exception to a
   rule which is observed to be else universal; and that any apparent
   inconsistency between S. Mark's statements in this place, and those of
   S. Luke and S. John, would also be found to be imaginary only?"

   This then is the reason why I abstain from entering upon a prolonged
   Inquiry, which would in fact necessitate a discussion of the Principles
   of Gospel Harmony,--for which the present would clearly not be the
   proper place.

   VIII. Let it suffice that, in the foregoing pages,--

   1. I have shewn that the supposed argument from "Style," (in itself a
   highly fallacious test,) disappears under investigation.

   It has been proved (pp. 142-5) that, on the contrary, the style of S.
   Mark xvi. 9-20 is exceedingly like the style of S. Mark i. 9-20; and
   therefore, that it is rendered probable by the Style that the Author of
   the beginning of this Gospel was also the Author of the end of it.

   2. I have further shewn that the supposed argument from
   "Phraseology,"--(in itself, a most unsatisfactory test; and as it has
   been applied to the matter in hand, a very coarse and clumsy
   one;)--breaks down hopelessly under severe analysis.

   Instead of there being twenty-seven suspicious circumstances in the
   Phraseology of these Twelve Verses, it has been proved (pp.170-3) that
   in twenty-seven particulars there emerge corroborative considerations.

   3. Lastly, I have shewn that a loftier method of Criticism is at hand;
   and that, tested by this truer, more judicious, and more philosophical
   standard; a presumption of the highest order is created that these
   Verses must needs be the work of S. Mark.

   [246] To the honour of the Rev. F. H. Scrivener be it said, that he at
   least absolutely refuses to pay any attention at all "to the argument
   against these twelve verses arising from their alleged difference in
   style from the rest of the Gospel." See by all means his remarks on
   this subject. (Introduction, pp. 481-2.)--One would have thought that a
   recent controversy concerning a short English Poem--which some able men
   were confident might have been written by Milton, while others were
   just as confident that it could not possibly be his,--ought to have
   opened the eyes of all to the precarious nature of such Criticism.

   [247] Allusion is made to the Rev. John A. Broadus, D.D.,--"Professor
   of Interpretation of the New Testament in the Southern Baptist
   Theological Seminary, Greenville, S.C.,"--the author of an able and
   convincing paper entitled "Exegetical Studies" in "The Baptist
   Quarterly" for July, 1869 (Philadelphia), pp. 355-62: in which "the
   words and phrases" contained in S. Mark xvi. 9-20 are exclusively
   examined. If the present volume should ever reach the learned
   Professor's hands, he will perceive that I must have written the
   present Chapter before I knew of his labours: (an advantage which I owe
   to Mr. Scrivener's kindness:) my treatment of the subject and his own
   being so entirely different. But it is only due to Professor Broadus to
   acknowledge the interest and advantage with which I have compared my
   lucubrations with his, and the sincere satisfaction with which I have
   discovered that we have everywhere independently arrived at precisely
   the same result.

   [253] And yet, if it were ever so "sententious," ever so "abrupt;" and
   if his "brief notices" were ever so "loosely linked together;"--these,
   according to Dr. Davidson, would only be indications that S. Mark
   actually was their Author. Hear him discussing S. Mark's
   "characteristics," at p. 151:--"In the consecution of his narrations,
   Mark puts them together very loosely." "Mark is also characterised by a
   conciseness and apparent incompleteness of delineation which are allied
   to the obscure." "The abrupt introduction" of many of his details is
   again and again appealed to by Dr. Davidson, and illustrated by
   references to the Gospel. What, in the name of common sense, is the
   value of such criticism as this? What is to be thought of a gentleman
   who blows hot and cold in the same breath: denying at p.170 the
   genuineness of a certain portion of Scripture because it exhibits the
   very peculiarities which at p. 151 he had volunteered the information
   are characteristic of its reputed Author?

   [262] y. Lightfoot (on 1 Cor. xvi. 2) remarks concerning S. Paul's
   phrase kata mian sabbaton,--"vchd vsvt [b'had b'shabbath,] In the first
   [lit. one] of the Sabbath,' would the Talmudists say."--Professor
   Gandell writes,--"in Syriac, the days of the week are similarly named.
   See Bernstein s. v. [lit. one in the Sabbath, two in the Sabbath, three
   in the Sabbath.]"

   [263] S. Mark xii. 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12.

   [264] The Sabbath-day, in the Old Testament, is invariably sbt,
   (shabbath): a word which the Greeks could not exhibit more nearly than
   by the word sabbaton. The Chaldee form of this word is sbt'
   (shabbatha:) the final ' (a) being added for emphasis, as in Abba,
   Aceldama, Bethesda, Cepha, Pascha, &c.: and this form,--(I owe the
   information to my friend Professor Gandell,)--because it was so
   familiar to the people of Palestine, (who spoke Aramaic,) gave rise to
   another form of the Greek name for the Sabbath,--viz. sabbata: which,
   naturally enough, attracted the article (to) into agreement with its
   own (apparently) plural form. By the Greek-speaking population of
   Judaea, the Sabbath day was therefore indifferently called to sabbaton
   and ta sabbata: sometimes again, he hemera tou sabbatou: and sometimes
   he hemera ton sabbaton Sabbata, although plural in sound, was strictly
   singular in sense. (Accordingly, it is invariably rendered "Sabbatum
   "in the Vulgate.) Thus, in Exod. xvi. 23,--sa'bbata ana'pausis agi'a to
   Kuri'o: and 25,--e'stin ga`r sa'bbata se'meron to Kuri'o. Again,--te
   de` eme'ra te ebdo'me sa'bbata. (Exod. xvi. 28: xxxi. 14. Levit. xxiii.
   3.) And in the Gospel, what took place on one definite Sabbath-day, is
   said to have occurred en tois sabbasi (S. Luke xiii. 10. S. Mark xii.
   1.) It will, I believe, be invariably found that the form en tois
   sabbasi is strictly equivalent to en to sabbato and was adopted for
   convenience in contradistinction to en tois sabbatois (1 Chron. xxiii.
   31 and 2 Chron. ii. 4) where Sabbath days are spoken of. It is not
   correct to say that in Levit. xxiii. 15 sbtvt is put for "weeks;"
   though the Septuagint translators have (reasonably enough) there
   rendered the word hebdomadas. In Levit. xxv. 8, (where the same word
   occurs twice,) it is once rendered anapauseis; once, hebdomades.. Quite
   distinct is svv (shavooa) i.e. hebdom?s; nor is there any substitution
   of the one word for the other. But inasmuch as the recurrence of the
   Sabbath-day was what constituted a week; in other words, since the
   essential feature of a week, as a Jewish division of time, was the
   recurrence of the Jewish day of rest;--to sabbaton or ta sabbata, the
   Hebrew name for the day of rest, became transferred to the week. The
   former designation, (as explained in the text,) is used once by S.
   Mark, once by S. Luke; while the phrase mia ton sabbaton occurs in the
   N.T., in all, six times..

   [265] So Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. ii. 15), and Jerome (De Viris Illust.
   ii. 827), on the authority of Clemens Alex. and of Papias. See also
   Euseb. Hist. Eccl. vi. 14.--The colophon in the Syriac Version shews
   that the same traditional belief prevailed in the Eastern Church. It
   also finds record in the Synopsis Scripturae (wrongly) ascribed to
   Athanasius.

   [297] Exactly so Professor Broadus:--"Now it will not do to say that
   while no one of these peculiarities would itself prove the style to be
   foreign to Mark, the whole of them combined will do so. It is very true
   that the multiplication of littles may amount to much; but not so the
   multiplication of nothings. And how many of the expressions which are
   cited, appear, in the light of our examination, to retain the slightest
   real force as proving difference of authorship? Is it not true that
   most of them, and those the most important, are reduced to absolutely
   nothing, while the remainder possess scarcely any appreciable
   significance?"--p. 360, (see above, p. 139, note g.)

   [298] S. John has palin (47 times) much oftener than S. Mark (29

   reproduces in the corresponding place of his Gospel, viz. in ch. xxiii.
   26.

   [302] See above, p. 148.

   [303] The reader will be perhaps interested with the following passage
   in the pages of Professor Broadus already (p. 139 note g) alluded
   to:--"It occurred to me to examine the twelve just preceding verses,
   (xv. 44 to xvi. 8,) and by a curious coincidence, the words and
   expressions not elsewhere employed by Mark, footed up precisely the
   same number, seventeen. Those noticed are the following (text of
   Tregelles):--ver. 44, te'thneken (elsewhere apothnesko):--ver. 45,
   gnou`s apo, a construction found nowhere else in the New Testament:
   also edore'sato and ptoma: ver. 46, enei'lesen, lelatomeme'non,
   pe'tras, proseku'lisen:--chap. xvi. ver. 1, diagenome'nou, and
   aro'mata: ver. 2, mia ton sabba'ton:--ver. 3, apokuli'sei:--ver. 4,
   anekekulistai. Also, spho'dra, (Mark's word is lian.) Ver. 5, en tois
   dexiois is a construction not found in Mark, or the other Gospels,
   though the word dexios occurs frequently:--ver. 8, eichen, in this
   particular sense, not elsewhere in the New Testament: tromos. "This
   list is perhaps not complete, for it was prepared in a few hours--about
   as much time, it may be said, without disrespect, as Fritsche and Meyer
   appear to have given to their collections of examples from the other
   passage. It is not proposed to discuss the list, though some of the
   instances are curious. It is not claimed that they are all important,
   but that they are all real. And as regards the single question of the
   number of peculiarities, they certainly form quite an offset to the
   number upon which Dean Alford has laid stress"--p. 361.

CHAPTER X.

  THE TESTIMONY OF THE LECTIONARIES SHEWN TO BE ABSOLUTELY DECISIVE AS TO THE
  GENUINENESS OF THESE VERSES.

   The Lectionary of the East shewn to be a work of extraordinary
   antiquity (p. 195).--Proved to be older than any extant MS. of the
   Gospels, by an appeal to the Fathers (p. 198).--In this Lectionary,
   (and also in the Lectionary of the West,) the last Twelve Verses of S.
   Mark's Gospel have, from the first, occupied a most conspicuous, as
   well as most honourable place, (p.204.)--Now, this becomes the
   testimony of ante-Nicene Christendom in their favour (p. 209.)

   I HAVE reserved for the last the testimony of The Lectionaries, which
   has been hitherto all but entirely overlooked [327] ;--passed by
   without so much as a word of comment, by those who have preceded me in
   this inquiry. Yet is it, when rightly understood, altogether decisive
   of the question at issue. And why? Because it is not the testimony
   rendered by a solitary Father or by a solitary MS.; no, nor even the
   testimony yielded by a single Church, or by a single family of MSS. But
   it is the united testimony of all the Churches. It is therefore the
   evidence borne by a goodly fellowship of Prophets,' a noble army of
   Martyrs' indeed; as well as by MSS. innumerable which have long since
   perished, but which must of necessity once have been. And so, it comes
   to us like the voice of many waters: dates, (as I shall show
   by-and-by,) from a period of altogether immemorial antiquity: is
   endorsed by the sanction of all the succeeding ages: admits of neither
   doubt nor evasion. This subject, in order that it may be intelligibly
   handled, will be most conveniently approached by some remarks which
   shall rehearse the matter from the beginning.

   The Christian Church succeeded to the Jewish. The younger society
   inherited the traditions of the elder, not less as a measure of
   necessity than as a matter of right; and by a kind of sacred instinct
   conformed itself from the very beginning in countless particulars to
   its divinely-appointed model. The same general Order of Service went on
   unbroken,--conducted by a Priesthood whose spiritual succession was at
   least as jealously guarded as had been the natural descent from Aaron
   in the Church of the Circumcision [328] . It was found that "the
   Sacraments of the Jews are [but] types of ours [329] ." Still were
   David's Psalms antiphonally recited, and the voices of "Moses and the
   Prophets" were heard in the sacred assemblies of God's people "every
   Sabbath day." Canticle succeeded to Canticle; while many a Versicle
   simply held its ground. The congenial utterances of the chosen race
   passed readily into the service of the family of the redeemed.
   Unconsciously perhaps, the very method of the one became adopted by the
   other: as, for example, the method of beginning a festival from the
   "Eve" of the preceding Day. The Synagogue-worship became transfigured;
   but it did not part with one of its characteristic features. Above all,
   the same three great Festivals were still retained which declare "the
   rock whence we are hewn and the hole of the pit whence we are digged:"
   only was it made a question, a controversy rather, whether Easter
   should or should not be celebrated with the Jews [330] .

   But it is the faithful handing on to the Christian community of the
   Lectionary practice of the Synagogue to which the reader's attention is
   now exclusively invited. That the Christian Church inherited from the
   Jewish the practice of reading a first and a second Lesson in its
   public assemblies, is demonstrable. What the Synagogue practice was in
   the time of the Apostles is known from Acts xiii. 15, 27. Justin
   Martyr, (A.D. 150) describes the Christian practice in his time as
   precisely similar [331] : only that for "the Law," there is found to
   have been at once substituted "the Gospel." He speaks of the writings
   of "the Apostles" and of "the Prophets." Chrysostom has the same
   expression (for the two Lessons) in one of his Homilies [332] . Cassian
   (A.D. 400) says that in Egypt, after the Twelve Prayers at Vespers and
   at Matins, two Lessons were read, one out of the Old Testament and the
   other out of the New. But on Saturdays and Sundays, and the fifty days
   of Pentecost, both Lessons were from the New Testament,--one from the
   Epistles or the Acts of the Apostles; the other, from the Gospels [333]
   . Our own actual practice seems to bear a striking resemblance to that
   of the Christian Church at the earliest period: for we hear of (1)
   "Moses and the Prophets," (which will have been the carrying on of the
   old synagogue-method, represented by our first and second Lesson,)--(2)
   a lesson out of the "Epistles or Acts," together with a lesson out of
   the "Gospels [334] ." It is, in fact, universally received that the
   Eastern Church has, from a period of even Apostolic antiquity, enjoyed
   a Lectionary,--or established system of Scripture lessons,--of her own.
   In its conception, this Lectionary is discovered to have been fashioned
   (as was natural) upon the model of the Lectionary of God's ancient
   people, the Jews: for it commences, as theirs did, in the autumn, (in
   September [335] ); and prescribes two immovable "Lections" for every
   Saturday (as well as for every Sunday) in the year: differing chiefly
   in this,--that the prominent place which had been hitherto assigned to
   "the Law and the Prophets [336] ," was henceforth enjoyed by the
   Gospels and the Apostolic writings. "Saturday-Sunday"
   lections--(sabbatokuriakai, for so these Lections were called,)--retain
   their place in the "Synaxarium" of the East to the present hour. It
   seems also a singular note of antiquity that the Sabbath and the Sunday
   succeeding it do as it were cohere, and bear one appellation; so that
   the week takes its name--not from the Sunday with which it commences
   [337] , but--from the Sabbath-and-Sunday with which it concludes. To
   mention only one out of a hundred minute traits of identity which the
   public Service of the sanctuary retained:--Easter Eve, which from the
   earliest period to this day has been called "mega sabbaton [338] ," is
   discovered to have borne the self-same appellation in the Church of the
   Circumcision [339] .--If I do not enter more minutely into the
   structure of the Oriental Lectionary,--(some will perhaps think I have
   said too much, but the interest of the subject ought to be a sufficient
   apology,)--it is because further details would be irrelevant to my
   present purpose; which is only to call attention to the three following
   facts:

   (I.) That the practice in the Christian Church of reading publicly
   before the congregation certain fixed portions of Holy Writ, according
   to an established and generally received rule, must have existed from a
   period long anterior to the date of any known Greek copy of the New
   Testament Scriptures.

   (II.) That although there happens to be extant neither "Synaxarium,"
   (i.e. Table of Proper Lessons of the Greek Church), nor
   "Evangelistarium," (i.e. Book containing the Ecclesiastical Lections in
   extenso), of higher antiquity than the viii^th century,--yet that the
   scheme itself, as exhibited by those monuments,--certainly in every
   essential particular,--is older than any known Greek MS. which contains
   it, by at least four, in fact by full five hundred years.

   (III.) Lastly,--That in the said Lectionaries of the Greek and of the
   Syrian Churches, the twelve concluding verses of S. Mark which are the
   subject of discussion throughout the present pages are observed
   invariably to occupy the same singularly conspicuous, as well as most
   honourable place.

   I. The first of the foregoing propositions is an established fact. It
   is at least quite certain that in the iv^th century (if not long
   before) there existed a known Lectionary system, alike in the Church of
   the East and of the West. Cyril of Jerusalem (A.D. 348,) having to
   speak about our Lord's Ascension, remarks that by a providential
   coincidence, on the previous day, which was Sunday, the event had
   formed the subject of the appointed lessons [340] ; and that he had
   availed himself of the occasion to discourse largely on the
   subject.--Chrysostom, preaching at Antioch, makes it plain that, in the
   latter part of the iv^th century, the order of the lessons which were
   publicly read in the Church on Saturdays and Sundays [341] was
   familiarly known to the congregation: for he invites them to sit down,
   and study attentively beforehand, at home, the Sections (perikopas) of
   the Gospel which they were about to hear in Church [342] .--Augustine
   is express in recording that in his time proper lessons were appointed
   for Festival days [343] ; and that an innovation which he had attempted
   on Good Friday had given general offence [344] .--Now by these few
   notices, to look no further, it is rendered certain that a Lectionary
   system of some sort must have been in existence at a period long
   anterior to the date of any copy of the New Testament Scriptures
   extant. I shall shew by-and-by that the fact is established by the
   Codices (B, ', A, C, D) themselves.

   But we may go back further yet; for not only Eusebius, but Origen and
   Clemens Alexandrinus, by their habitual use of the technical term for
   an Ecclesiastical Lection (perikope, anagnosis, anagnosma,) remind us
   that the Lectionary practice of the East was already established in
   their days [345] .

   II. The Oriental Lectionary consists of "Synaxarion" and "Eclogadion,"
   (or Tables of Proper Lessons from the Gospels and Apostolic writings
   daily throughout the year;) together with "Menologion," (or Calendar of
   immovable Festivals and Saints' Days.) That we are thoroughly
   acquainted with all of these, as exhibited in Codices of the viii^th,
   ix^th and x^th centuries,--is a familiar fact; in illustration of which
   it is enough to refer the reader to the works cited at the foot of the
   page [346] . But it is no less certain that the scheme of Proper
   Lessons itself is of much higher antiquity.

   1. The proof of this, if it could only be established by an induction
   of particular instances, would not only be very tedious, but also very
   difficult indeed. It will be perceived, on reflection, that even when
   the occasion of a Homily (suppose) is actually recorded, the Scripture
   references which it contains, apart from the Author's statement that
   what he quotes had formed part of that day's Service, creates scarcely
   so much as a presumption of the fact: while the correspondence, however
   striking, between such references to Scripture and the Lectionary as we
   have it, is of course no proof whatever that we are so far in
   possession of the Lectionary of the Patristic age. Nay, on famous
   Festivals, the employment of certain passages of Scripture is, in a
   manner, inevitable [347] , and may on no account be pressed.

   2. Thus, when Chrysostom [348] and when Epiphanius [349] , preaching on
   Ascension Day, refer to Acts i. 10, 11,--we do not feel ourselves
   warranted to press the coincidence of such a quotation with the
   Liturgical section of the day.--So, again, when Chrysostom preaches on
   Christmas Day, and quotes from S. Matthew ii. 1, 2 [350] ; or on
   Whitsunday, and quotes from S. John vii. 38 and Acts ii. 3 and
   13;--though both places form part of the Liturgical sections for the
   day, no proof results therefrom that either chapter was actually used.

   3. But we are not reduced to this method. It is discovered that nearly
   three-fourths of Chrysostom's Homilies on S. Matthew either begin at
   the first verse of a known Ecclesiastical Lection; or else at the first
   ensuing verse after the close of one. Thirteen of those Homilies in
   succession (the 63rd to the 75th inclusive) begin with the first words
   of as many known Lections. "Let us attend to this delightful section
   (perikope) which we never cease turning to,"--are the opening words of
   Chrysostom's 79th Homily, of which "the text" is S. Matth. xxv. 31,
   i.e. the beginning of the Gospel for Sexagesima Sunday.--Cyril Of
   Alexandria's (so called) "Commentary on S. Luke" is nothing else but a
   series of short Sermons, for the most part delivered on known
   Ecclesiastical Lections; which does not seem to have been as yet
   observed.--Augustine (A.D. 416) says expressly that he had handled S.
   John's Gospel in precisely the same way [351] .--All this is
   significant in a high degree.

   4. I proceed, however, to adduce a few distinct proofs that the
   existing Lectionary of the great Eastern Church,--as it is exhibited by
   Matthaei, by Scholz, and by Scrivener from MSS. of the viii^th
   century,--and which is contained in Syriac MSS. of the vi^th and
   vii^th--must needs be in the main a work of extraordinary antiquity.
   And if I do not begin by insisting that at least one century more may
   be claimed for it by a mere appeal to the Hierosolymitan Version, it is
   only because I will never knowingly admit what may prove to be
   untrustworthy materials [352] into my foundations.

   (a) "Every one is aware," (says Chrysostom in a sermon on our Saviour's
   Baptism, preached at Antioch, A.D. 387,) "that this is called the
   Festival of the Epiphany. Two manifestations are thereby intended:
   concerning both of which you have heard this day S. Paul discourse in
   his Epistle to Titus [353] ." Then follows a quotation from ch. ii. 11
   to 13,--which proves to be the beginning of the lection for the day in
   the Greek Menology. In the time of Chrysostom, therefore, Titus ii. 11,
   12, 13 formed part of one of the Epiphany lessons,--as it does to this
   hour in the Eastern Church. What is scarcely less interesting, it is
   also found to have been part of the Epistle for the Epiphany in the old
   Gallican Liturgy [354] , the affinities of which with the East are well
   known.

   (b) Epiphanius (speaking of the Feasts of the Church) says, that at the
   Nativity, a Star shewed that the Word had become incarnate: at the
   "Theophania" (our "Epiphany") John cried, "Behold the Lamb of God,"
   &c., and a Voice from Heaven proclaimed Him at His Baptism.
   Accordingly, S. Matth. ii. 1-12 is found to be the ancient lection for
   Christmas Day: S. Mark i. 9-11 and S. Matth. iii. 13-17 the lections
   for Epiphany. On the morrow, was read S. John i. 29-34.

   (c) In another of his Homilies, Chrysostom explains with considerable
   emphasis the reason why the Book of the Acts was read publicly in
   Church during the interval between Easter and Pentecost; remarking,
   that it had been the liturgical arrangement of a yet earlier age [355]
   .--After such an announcement, it becomes a very striking circumstance
   that Augustine also (A.D. 412) should be found to bear witness to the
   prevalence of the same liturgical arrangement in the African Church
   [356] . In the old Galilean Lectionary, as might have been expected,
   the same rule is recognisable. It ought to be needless to add that the
   same arrangement is observed universally to prevail in the Lectionaries
   both of the East and of the West to the present hour; although the fact
   must have been lost sight of by the individuals who recently, under
   pretence of "making some advantageous alterations" in our Lectionary,
   have constructed an entirely new one,--vicious in principle and liable
   to the gravest objections throughout,--whereby this link also which
   bound the Church of England to the practice of Primitive Christendom,
   has been unhappily broken; this note of Catholicity also has been
   effaced [357] .

   (d) The purely arbitrary arrangement, (as Mr. Scrivener phrases it), by
   which the Book of Genesis, instead of the Gospel, is appointed to be
   read [358] on the week days of Lent, is discovered to have been fully
   recognised in the time of Chrysostom. Accordingly, the two series of
   Homilies on the Book of Genesis which that Father preached, he preached
   in Lent [359] .

   (e) It will be seen in the next chapter that it was from a very remote
   period the practice of the Eastern Church to introduce into the lesson
   for Thursday in Holy-week, S. Luke's account (ch. xxii. 43, 44) of our
   Lord's "Agony and bloody Sweat," immediately after S. Matth. xxvi. 39.
   That is, no doubt, the reason why Chrysostom,--who has been suspected,
   (I think unreasonably,) of employing an Evangelistarium instead of a
   copy of the Gospels in the preparation of his Homilies, is observed to
   quote those same two verses in that very place in his Homily on S.
   Matthew [360] ; which shews that the Lectionary system of the Eastern
   Church in this respect is at least as old as the iv^th century.

   (f) The same two verses used to be left out on the Tuesday after
   Sexagesima (te g' tes turophagou) for which day S. Luke xxii.
   39--xxiii. 1, is the appointed lection. And this explains why Cyril
   (A.D. 425) in his Homilies on S. Luke, passes them by in silence [361]
   .

   But we can carry back the witness to the Lectionary practice of
   omitting these verses, at least a hundred years; for Cod. B, (evidently
   for that same reason,) also omits them, as was stated above, in p. 79.
   They are wanting also in the Thebaic version, which is of the iii^rd
   century.

   (g) It will be found suggested in the next chapter (page 218) that the
   piercing of our Lord's side, (S. John xix. 34),--thrust into Codd. B
   and ' immediately after S. Matth. xxvii. 49,--is probably indebted for
   its place in those two MSS. to the Eastern Lectionary practice. If this
   suggestion be well founded, a fresh proof is obtained that the
   Lectionary of the East was fully established in the beginning of the
   iv^th century. But see Appendix (H).

   (h) It is a remarkable note of the antiquity of that Oriental
   Lectionary system with which we are acquainted, that S. Matthew's
   account of the Passion (ch. xxvii. 1-61,) should be there appointed to
   be read alone on the evening of Good Friday. Chrysostom clearly alludes
   to this practice [362] ; which Augustine expressly states was also the
   practice in his own day [363] . Traces of the same method are
   discoverable in the old Galilean Lectionary [364] .

   (i) Epiphanius, (or the namesake of his who was the author of a
   well-known Homily on Palm Sunday,) remarks that "yesterday" had been
   read the history of the rising of Lazarus [365] . Now S. John xi. 1-45
   is the lection for the antecedent Sabbath, in all the Lectionaries.

   (k) In conclusion, I may be allowed so far to anticipate what will be
   found fully established in the next chapter, as to point out here that
   since in countless places the text of our oldest Evangelia as well as
   the readings of the primitive Fathers exhibit unmistakable traces of
   the corrupting influence of the Lectionary practice, that very fact
   becomes irrefragable evidence of the antiquity of the Lectionary which
   is the occasion of it, Not only must it be more ancient than Cod. B or
   Cod. ', (which are referred to the beginning of the iv^th century), but
   it must be older than Origen in the iii^rd century, or the Vetus Itala
   and the Syriac in the iind. And thus it is demonstrated, (1st) That
   fixed Lessons were read in the Churches of the East in the immediately
   post-Apostolic age; and (2ndly) That, wherever we are able to test it,
   the Lectionary of that remote period corresponded with the Lectionary
   which has come down to us in documents of the vi^th and vii^th century,
   and was in fact constructed in precisely the same way.

   I am content in fact to dismiss the preceding instances with this
   general remark:--that a System which is found to have been fully
   recognised throughout the East and throughout the West in the beginning
   of the fourth century, must of necessity have been established very
   long before. It is as when we read of three British Bishops attending
   the Council at Arles, A.D. 314. The Church (we say) which could send
   out those three Bishops must have been fully organized at a greatly
   antecedent period.

   4. Let us attend, however, to the great Festivals of the Church. These
   are declared by Chrysostom (in a Homily delivered at Antioch 20 Dec.
   A.D. 386) to be the five following:--(1) Nativity: (2) the Theophania:
   (3) Pascha: (4) Ascension: (6) Pentecost [366] . Epiphanius, his
   contemporary, (Bishop of Constantia in the island of Cyprus,) makes the
   same enumeration [367] , in a Homily on the Ascension [368] . In the
   Apostolical Constitutions, the same five Festivals are enumerated [369]
   . Let me state a few Liturgical facts in connexion with each of these.

   It is plain that the preceding enumeration could not have been made at
   any earlier period: for the Epiphany of our Saviour and His Nativity
   were originally but one Festival [370] . Moreover, the circumstances
   are well known under which Chrysostom (A. D. 386) announced to his
   Eastern auditory that in conformity with what had been correctly
   ascertained at Rome, the ancient Festival was henceforth to be
   disintegrated [371] . But this is not material to the present inquiry.
   We know that, as a matter of fact, "the Epiphanies" (for ta epiphania
   is the name of the Festival) became in consequence distributed over
   Dec. 25 and Jan. 5: our Lord's Baptism being the event chiefly
   commemorated on the latter anniversary [372] ,--which used to be
   chiefly observed in honour of His Birth [373] .--Concerning the Lessons
   for Passion-tide and Easter, as well as concerning those for the
   Nativity and Epiphany, something has been offered already; to which may
   be added that Hesychius, in the opening sentences of that "Homily"
   which has already engaged so much of our attention [374] , testifies
   that the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel was in his days, as it has been
   ever since, one of the lections for Easter. He begins by saying that
   the Evangelical narratives of the Resurrection were read on the Sunday
   night; and proceeds to reconcile S. Mark's with the rest.--Chrysostom
   once and again adverts to the practice of discontinuing the reading of
   the Acts after Pentecost [375] ,--which is observed to be also the
   method of the Lectionaries.

   III. I speak separately of the Festival of the Ascension, for an
   obvious reason. It ranked, as we have seen, in the estimation of
   Primitive Christendom, with the greatest Festivals of the Church.
   Augustine, in a well-known passage, hints that it may have been of
   Apostolical origin [376] ; so exceedingly remote was its institution
   accounted in the days of the great African Father, as well as so
   entirely forgotten by that time was its first beginning. I have to chew
   that in the Great Oriental Lectionary (whether of the Greek or of the
   Syrian Church) the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel occupy a
   conspicuous as well as a most honourable place. And this is easily
   done: for,

   (a) The Lesson for Matins on Ascension-Day in the East, in the oldest
   documents to which we have access, consisted (as now it does) of the
   last Twelve Verses,--neither more nor less,--of S. Mark's Gospel. At
   the Liturgy on Ascension was read S. Luke xxiv. 36-53: but at Matins,
   S. Mark xvi. 9-20. The witness of the "Synaxaria" is constant to this
   effect.

   (b) The same lection precisely was adopted among the Syrians by the
   Melchite Churches [377] ,--(the party, viz. which maintained the
   decrees of the Council of Chalcedon): and it is found appointed also in
   the "Evangeliarium Hierosolymitanum [378] ." In the Evangelistarium
   used in the Jacobite, (i.e. the Monophysite) Churches of Syria, a
   striking difference of arrangement is discoverable. While S. Luke xxiv.
   36-53 was read at Vespers and at Matins on Ascension Day, the last
   seven verses of S. Mark's Gospel (ch. xvi. 14-20) were read at the
   Liturgy [379] . Strange, that the self-same Gospel should have been
   adopted at a remote age by some of the Churches of the West [380] , and
   should survive in our own Book of Common Prayer to this hour!

   (c) But S. Mark xvi. 9-20 was not only appointed by the Greek Church to
   be read upon Ascension Day. Those same twelve verses constitute the
   third of the xi "Matin Gospels of the Resurrection," which were
   universally held in high esteem by the Eastern Churches (Greek and
   Syrian [381] ), and were read successively on Sundays at Matins
   throughout the year; as well as daily throughout Easter week.

   (d) A rubricated copy of S. Mark's Gospel in Syriac [382] , certainly
   older than A.D. 683, attests that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 was the "Lection
   for the great First Day of the week," (megale kuriake, i.e. Easter
   Day). Other copies almost as ancient [383] add that it was used "at the
   end of the Service at the dawn."

   (e) Further, these same "Twelve Verses" constituted the Lesson at
   Matins for the 2nd Sunday after Easter,--a Sunday which by the Greeks
   is called kuriake ton murophoron, but with the Syrians bore the names
   of "Joseph and Nicodemus [384] ." So also in the "Evangeliarium
   Hierosolymitanum."

   (f) Next, in the Monophysite Churches of Syria, S. Mark xvi. 9-18 (or
   9-20 [385] ) was also read at Matins on Easter-Tuesday [386] . In the
   Gallican Church, the third lection for Easter-Monday extended from S.
   Mark xv. 47 to xvi. 11: for Easter-Tuesday, from xvi. 12 to the end of
   the Gospel [387] . Augustine says that in Africa also these concluding
   verses of S. Mark's Gospel used to be publicly read at Easter tide
   [388] . The same verses (beginning with ver. 9) are indicated in the
   oldest extant Lectionary of the Roman Church [389] .

   (g) Lastly, it may be stated that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 was with the Greeks
   the Gospel for the Festival of S. Mary Magdalene (he murophoros), July
   22 [390] .

   He knows wondrous little about this department of Sacred Science who
   can require to be informed that such a weight of public testimony as
   this to the last Twelve Verses of a Gospel is simply overwhelming. The
   single discovery that in the age of Augustine [385-430] this portion of
   S. Mark's Gospel was unquestionably read at Easter in the Churches of
   Africa, added to the express testimony of the Author of the 2nd Homily
   on the Resurrection, and of the oldest Syriac MSS., that they were also
   read by the Orientals at Easter in the public services of the Church,
   must be held to be in a manner decisive of the question.

   Let the evidence, then, which is borne by Ecclesiastical usage to the
   genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, be summed up, and the entire case
   caused again to pass under review.

   (1.) That Lessons from the New Testament were publicly read in the
   assemblies of the faithful according to a definite scheme, and on an
   established system, at least as early as the fourth century,--has been
   shown to be a plain historical fact. Cyril, at Jerusalem,--(and by
   implication, his namesake at Alexandria,)--Chrysostom, at Antioch and
   at Constantinople,--Augustine, in Africa,--all four expressly witness
   to the circumstance. In other words, there is found to have been at
   least at that time fully established throughout the Churches of
   Christendom a Lectionary, which seems to have been essentially one and
   the same in the West [391] and in the East. That it must have been of
   even Apostolic antiquity may be inferred from several considerations.
   But that it dates its beginning from a period anterior to the age of
   Eusebius,--which is the age of Codices B and ',--at least admits of no
   controversy.

   (2.) Next,--Documents of the vi^th century put us in possession of the
   great Oriental Lectionary as it is found at that time to have
   universally prevailed throughout the vast unchanging East. In other
   words, several of the actual Service Books, in Greek and in Syriac
   [392] , have survived the accidents of full a thousand years: and
   rubricated copies of the Gospels carry us back three centuries further.
   The entire agreement which is observed to prevail among these several
   documents,--added to the fact that when tested by the allusions
   incidentally made by Greek Fathers of the iv^th century to what was the
   Ecclesiastical practice of their own time, there are found to emerge
   countless as well as highly significant notes of
   correspondence,--warrants us in believing, (in the absence of testimony
   of any sort to the contrary,) that the Lectionary we speak of differs
   in no essential respect from that system of Lections with which the
   Church of the iv^th century was universally acquainted.

   Nothing scarcely is more forcibly impressed upon us in the course of
   the present inquiry than the fact, that documents alone are wanting to
   make that altogether demonstrable which, in default of such evidence,
   must remain a matter of inevitable inference only. The forms we are
   pursuing at last disappear from our sight: but it is only the mist of
   the early morning which shrouds them. We still hear their voices: still
   track their footsteps: know that others still see them, although we
   ourselves see them no longer. We are sure that there they still are.
   Moreover they may yet reappear at any moment. Thus, there exist Syriac
   MSS. of the Gospels of the vii^th and even of the vi^th century, in
   which the Lessons are rubricated in the text or on the margin. A Syriac
   MS. (of part of the Old T.) is actually dated A.D. 464 [393] . Should
   an Evangelium of similar date ever come to light of which the
   rubrication was evidently by the original Scribe, the evidence of the
   Lectionaries would at once be carried back full three hundred years.

   But in fact we stand in need of no such testimony. Acceptable as it
   would be, it is plain that it would add no strength to the argument
   whatever. We are already able to plant our footsteps securely in the
   iv^th and even in the iii^rd. century. It is not enough to insist that
   inasmuch as the Liturgical method of Christendom was at least fully
   established in the East and in the West at the close of the iv^th
   century, it therefore must have had its beginning at a far remoter
   period. Our two oldest Codices (B and ') bear witness throughout to the
   corrupting influence of a system which was evidently in full operation
   before the time of Eusebius. And even this is not all. The readings in
   Origen, and of the earliest versions of the Gospel, (the old Latin, the
   Syriac, the Egyptian versions,) carry back our evidence on this subject
   unmistakably to the age immediately succeeding that of the .Apostles.
   This will be found established in the course of the ensuing Chapter.

   Beginning our survey of the problem at the opposite end, we arrive at
   the same result; with even a deepened conviction that in its essential
   structure, the Lectionary of the Eastern Church must be of truly
   primitive antiquity: indeed that many of its leading provisions must
   date back almost,--nay quite,--to the Apostolic age. From whichever
   side we approach this question,--whatever test we are able to apply to
   our premisses,--our conclusion remains still the very same.

   (3.) Into this Lectionary then,--so universal in its extent, so
   consistent in its witness, so Apostolic in its antiquity,--"the Last
   Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark" from the very first
   are found to have won for themselves not only an entrance, a lodgment,
   an established place; but, the place of highest honour,--an audience on
   two of the Church's chiefest Festivals.

   The circumstance is far too important, far too significant to be passed
   by without a few words of comment.

   For it is not here, (be it carefully observed,) as when we appeal to
   some Patristic citation, that the recognition of a phrase, or a verse,
   or a couple of verses, must be accepted as a proof that the same
   ancient Father recognised the context also in which those words are
   found. Not so. All the Twelve Verses in dispute are found in every
   known copy of the venerable Lectionary of the East. Those same Twelve
   Verses,--neither more nor less,--are observed to constitute one
   integral Lection.

   But even this is not all. The most important fact seems to be that to
   these Verses has been assigned a place of the highest possible
   distinction. It is found that, from the very first, S. Mark xvi. 9-20
   has been everywhere, and by all branches of the Church Catholic,
   claimed for two of the Church's greatest Festivals,--Easter and
   Ascension. A more weighty or a more significant circumstance can
   scarcely be imagined. To suppose that a portion of Scripture singled
   out for such extraordinary honour by the Church universal is a spurious
   addition to the Gospel, is purely irrational; is simply monstrous. No
   unauthorized "fragment," however "remarkable," could by possibility
   have so established itself in the regards of the East and of the West,
   from the very first. No suspected "addition, placed here in very early
   times," would have been tolerated in the Church's solemn public Service
   six or seven times a-year. No. It is impossible. Had it been one short
   clause which we were invited to surrender: a verse: two verses: even
   three or four:--the plea being that (as in the case of the celebrated
   pericopa de adulterÃ¢) the Lectionaries knew nothing of them:--the case
   would have been entirely different. But for any one to seek to persuade
   us that these Twelve Verses, which exactly constitute one of the
   Church's most famous Lections, are every one of them spurious:--that
   the fatal taint begins with the first verse, and only ends with the
   last:--this is a demand on our simplicity which, in a less solemn
   subject, would only provoke a smile. We are constrained to testify
   astonishment and even some measure of concern. Have the Critics then,
   (supposing them to be familiar with the evidence which has now been set
   forth so much in detail;)--Have the Critics then, (we ask) utterly
   taken leave of their senses? or do they really suppose that we have
   taken leave of ours?

   It is time to close this discussion. It was declared at the outset that
   the witness of the Lectionaries to the genuineness of these Verses,
   though it has been generally overlooked, is the most important of any:
   admitting, as it does, of no evasion: being simply, as it is, decisive.
   I have now fully explained the grounds of that assertion. I have set
   the Verses, which I undertook to vindicate and establish, on a basis
   from which it will be found impossible any more to dislodge them.
   Whatever Griesbach, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and the rest, may
   think about the matter,--the Holy Eastern Church in her corporate
   capacity, has never been of their opinion. They may doubt. The
   ante-Nicene Fathers at least never doubted. If "the last Twelve Verses"
   of S. Mark were deservedly omitted from certain Copies of his Gospel in
   the iv^th century, utterly incredible is it that these same Twelve
   Verses should have been disseminated, by their authority, throughout
   Christendom;--read, by their command, in all the Churches;--selected,
   by their collective judgment, from the whole body of Scripture for the
   special honour of being listened to once and again at Easter time, as
   well as on Ascension-Day.

   [327] The one memorable exception, which I have only lately met with,
   is supplied by the following remark of the thoughtful and accurate
   Matthaei, made in a place where it was almost safe to escape attention;
   viz. in a footnote at the very end of his Nov. Test. (ed. 1803), vol.
   i. p. 748.--"Haec lectio in Evangeliariis et Synaxariis omnibus ter

   [346] At the beginning of every volume of the first ed. of his Nov.
   Test. (Riga, 1788) Matthaei has laboriously edited the "Lectiones
   Ecclesiasticae" of the Greek Church. See also his Appendices,--viz.
   vol. ii. pp. 272-318 and 322-363. His 2nd ed. (Wittenberg, 1803,) is
   distinguished by the valuable peculiarity of indicating the
   Ecclesiastical sections throughout, in the manner of an ancient MS.;
   and that, with extraordinary fulness and accuracy. His Sunaxaria (i.
   723-68 and iii. 1-24) though not intelligible perhaps to ordinary
   readers, are very important. He derived them from MSS. which he
   designates "B" and "H," but which are our "Evstt. 47 and 50,"--uncial
   Evangelistaria of the viii^th century (See Scrivener's Introd. p. 214.)
   Scholz, at the end of vol. i. of his N. T. p. 453-93, gives in full the
   "Synaxarium" and "Menologium" of Codd. K and M, (viii^th or ix^th
   century.) See also his vol. pp. 456-69. Unfortunately, (as Scrivener
   recognises, p. 110,) all here is carelessly done,--as usual with this
   Editor; and therefore to a great extent useless. His slovenliness is
   extraordinary. The "Gospels of the Passion" (ton hagion pathon), he
   entitles ton hagion panton of (p. 472); and so throughout. Mr.
   Scrivener (Introduction, pp. 68-75,) has given by far the most
   intelligible account of this matter, by exhibiting in English the
   Lectionary of the Eastern Church, ("gathered chiefly from Evangelist.
   Arund. 547, Parham 18, Harl. 5598, Burney 22, and Christ's Coll.
   Camb."); and supplying the references to Scripture in the ordinary way.

   [357] I desire to leave in this place the permanent record of my
   deliberate conviction that the Lectionary which, last year, was hurried
   with such indecent haste through Convocation,--passed in a half-empty
   House by the casting vote of the Prolocutor,--and rudely pressed upon
   the Church's acceptance by the Legislature in the course of its present
   session,--is the gravest calamity which has befallen the Church of
   England for a long time past. Let the history of this Lectionary be
   remembered. Appointed (in 1867) for an entirely different purpose,
   (viz. the Ornaments and Vestments question,) 29 Commissioners (14
   Clerical and 15 Lay) found themselves further instructed "to suggest
   and report whether any and what alterations and amendments may be
   advantageously made in the selection of Lessons to be read at the time
   of Divine Service." Thereupon, these individuals,--(the Liturgical
   attainments of nine-tenths of whom it would be unbecoming in such an
   one as myself to characterise truthfully,)--at once imposed upon
   themselves the duty of inventing an entirely new Lectionary for the
   Church of England. So to mutilate the Word of God that it shall
   henceforth be quite impossible to understand a single Bible story, or
   discover the sequence of a single connected portion of
   narrative,--seems to have been the guiding principle of their
   deliberations. With reckless eclecticism,--entire forgetfulness of the
   requirements of the poor brother,--strange disregard for Catholic
   Tradition and the claims of immemorial antiquity;--these Commissioners,
   (evidently unconscious of their own unfitness for their self-imposed
   task,) have given us a Lectionary which will recommend itself to none
   but the lovers of novelty,--the Impatient,--and the enemies of Divine
   Truth. That the blame, the guilt lies at the door of our Bishops, is
   certain; but the Church has no one but herself to thank for the injury
   which has been thus deliberately inflicted upon her. She has suffered
   herself to be robbed of her ancient birthright without resistance;
   without remonstrance; without (in her corporate capacity) so much as a
   word of audible dissatisfaction. Can it be right in this way to defraud
   those who are to come after us of their lawful inheritance? . . . I am
   amazed and grieved beyond measure at what is taking place. At least,
   (as on other occasions,) liberavi animam meam.

   survive in the Church of the West, in memoriam, to the present hour;)
   but "Hypapante," which was the title bestowed by the Orientals in the
   time of Justinian, on Candlemas Day, (our Feast of the Purification, or
   Presentation of Christ in the Temple,) from the "Meeting" of Symeon on
   that occasion. Friday, or paras9keue, was called "Parasceve" in the
   West. (Mab. Lit. Gall. p. 129.) So entire was the sympathy of the East
   with the West in such matters in very early times, that when Rome
   decided to celebrate the Nativity on the 25th December, Chrysostom (as
   we have been reminded) publicly announced the fact at Constantinople;
   and it was determined that in this matter East and West would walk by
   the same rule.

   [392] From Professor Wright's Catalogue of Syriac MSS. in the British

CHAPTER XI.

  THE OMISSION OF THESE TWELVE VERSES IN CERTAIN ANCIENT COPIES OF THE GOSPELS,
  EXPLAINED AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

   The Text of our five oldest Uncials proved, by an induction of
   instances, to have steered depravation throughout by the operation of
   the ancient Lectionary system of the Church (p. 217).--The omission of
   S. Mark's "last Twelve Verses," (constituting an integral
   Ecclesiastical Lection,) shewn to be probably only one more example of
   the same depraving influence (p. 224).

   This solution of the problem corroborated by the language of Eusebius
   and of Hesychius (p. 232); as well as favoured by the "Western" order
   of the Gospels (p. 239).

   I AM much mistaken if the suggestion which I am about to offer has not
   already presented itself to every reader of ordinary intelligence who
   has taken the trouble to follow the course of my argument thus far with
   attention. It requires no acuteness whatever,--it is, as it seems to
   me, the merest instinct of mother-wit,--on reaching the present stage
   of the discussion, to debate with oneself somewhat as follows:--

   1. So then, the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel were anciently
   often observed to be missing from the copies. Eusebius expressly says
   so. I observe that he nowhere says that their genuineness was anciently
   suspected. As for himself, his elaborate discussion of their contents
   convinces me that individually, he regarded them with favour. The mere
   fact,--(it is best to keep to his actual statement,)--that "the entire
   passage [394] " was "not met with in all the copies," is the sum of his
   evidence: and two Greek manuscripts, yet extant, supposed to be of the
   iv^th century (Codd. B and '), mutilated in this precise way, testify
   to the truth of his statement.

   2. But then it is found that these self-same Twelve Verses,--neither
   more nor less,--anciently constituted an integral Ecclesiastical
   Lection; which lection,--inasmuch as it is found to have established
   itself in every part of Christendom at the earliest period to which
   liturgical evidence reaches back, and to have been assigned from the
   very first to two of the chiefest Church Festivals, must needs be a
   lection of almost Apostolic antiquity. Eusebius, I observe, (see p.
   45), designates the portion of Scripture in dispute by its technical
   name,--kephalaion or perikope; (for so an Ecclesiastical lection was
   anciently called). Here then is a rare coincidence indeed. It is in
   fact simply unique. Surely, I may acid that it is in the highest degree
   suggestive also. It inevitably provokes the inquiry,--Must not these
   two facts be not only connected, but even interdependent? Will not the
   omission of the Twelve concluding Verses of S. Mark from certain
   ancient copies of his Gospel, have been in some way occasioned by the
   fact that those same twelve verses constituted an integral Church
   Lection? How is it possible to avoid suspecting that the phenomenon to
   which Eusebius invites attention, (viz. that certain copies of S.
   Mark's Gospel in very ancient times had been mutilated from the end of
   the 8th verse onwards,) ought to be capable of illustration,--will have
   in fact to be explained, and in a word accounted for,--by the
   circumstance that at the 8th verse of S. Mark's xvi^th chapter, one
   ancient Lection came to an end, and another ancient Lection began?

   Somewhat thus, (I venture to think,) must every unprejudiced Reader of
   intelligence hold parley with himself on reaching the close of the
   preceding chapter. I need hardly add that I am thoroughly convinced he
   would be reasoning rightly. I am going to skew that the Lectionary
   practice of the ancient Church does indeed furnish a sufficient clue
   for the unravelment of this now famous problem: in other words, enables
   us satisfactorily to account for the omission of these Twelve Verses
   from ancient copies of the collected Gospels. But I mean to do more. I
   propose to make my appeal to documents which shall be observed to bear
   no faltering witness in my favour. More yet. I propose that Eusebius
   himself, the chief author of all this trouble, shall be brought back
   into Court and invited to resyllable his Evidence; and I am much
   mistaken if even he will not be observed to let fall a hint that we
   have at last got on the right scent;--have accurately divined how this
   mistake took its first beginning;--and, (what is not least to the
   purpose,) have correctly apprehended what was his own real meaning in
   what he himself has said.

   The proposed solution of the difficulty,--if not the evidence on which
   it immediately rests,--might no doubt be exhibited within exceedingly
   narrow limits. Set down abruptly, however, its weight and value would
   inevitably fail to be recognised, even by those who already enjoy some
   familiarity with these studies. Very few of the considerations which I
   shall have to rehearse are in fact unknown to Critics: yet is it
   evident that their bearing on the problem before us has hitherto
   altogether escaped their notice. On the other hand, by one entirely a
   novice to this department of sacred Science, I could scarcely hope to
   be so much as understood. Let me be allowed, therefore, to preface what
   I have to say with a few explanatory details which I promise shall not
   be tedious, and which I trust will not be found altogether without
   interest either. If they are anywhere else to be met with, it is my
   misfortune, not my fault, that I have been hitherto unsuccessful in
   discovering the place.

   I. From the earliest ages of the Church, (as I shewed at page 192-5,)
   it has been customary to read certain definite portions of Holy
   Scripture, determined by Ecclesiastical authority, publicly before the
   Congregation. In process of time, as was natural, the sections so
   required for public use were collected into separate volumes: Lections
   from the Gospels being written out in a Book which was called
   "Evangelistarium," (euangelistarion,)--from the Acts and Epistles, in a
   book called "Praxapostolus," (praxapostolos). These Lectionary-books,
   both Greek and Syriac, are yet extant in great numbers [395] , and (I
   may remark in passing) deserve a far greater amount of attention than
   has hitherto been bestowed upon them [396] .

   When the Lectionary first took the form of a separate book, has not
   been ascertained. That no copy is known to exist (whether in Greek or
   in Syriac) older than the viii^th century, proves nothing. Codices in
   daily use, (like the Bibles used in our Churches,) must of necessity
   have been of exceptionally brief duration; and Lectionaries, more even
   than Biblical MSS. were liable to injury and decay.

   II. But it is to be observed,--(and to explain this, is much more to my
   present purpose,)--that besides transcribing the Ecclesiastical
   lections into separate books, it became the practice at a very early
   period to adapt copies of the Gospels to lectionary purposes. I suspect
   that this practice began in the Churches of Syria; for Syriac copies of
   the Gospels (at least of the vii^th century) abound, which have the
   Lections more or less systematically rubricated in the Text [397] .
   There is in the British Museum a copy of S. Mark's Gospel according to
   the Peshito version, certainly written previous to A.D. 583, which has
   at least five or six rubrics so inserted by the original scribe [398] .
   As a rule, in all later cursive Greek MSS., (I mean those of the xii^th
   to the xv^th century,) the Ecclesiastical lections are indicated
   throughout: while either at the summit, or else at the foot of the
   page, the formula with which the Lection was to be introduced is
   elaborately inserted; prefaced probably by a rubricated statement (not
   always very easy to decipher) of the occasion when the ensuing portion
   of Scripture was to be read. The ancients, to a far greater extent than
   ourselves [399] , were accustomed,-- (in fact, they made it a
   rule,)--to prefix unauthorized formulae to their public Lections; and
   these are sometimes found to have established themselves so firmly,
   that at last they became as it were ineradicable; and later copyists of
   the fourfold Gospel are observed to introduce them unsuspiciously into
   the inspired text [400] . All that belongs to this subject deserves
   particular attention; because it is this which explains not a few of
   the perturbations (so to express oneself) which the text of the New
   Testament has experienced. 1Nre are made to understand how, what was
   originally intended only as a liturgical note, became mistaken, through
   the inadvertence or the stupidity of copyists, for a critical
   suggestion; and thus, besides transpositions without number, there has
   arisen, at one time, the insertion of something unauthorized into the
   text of Scripture,--at another, the omission of certain inspired words,
   to the manifest detriment of the sacred deposit. For although the
   systematic rubrication of the Gospels for liturgical purposes is a
   comparatively recent invention,--(I question if it be older in Greek
   MSS. than the x^th century,)--yet will persons engaged in the public
   Services of God's House have been prone, from the very earliest age, to
   insert memoranda of the kind referred to, into the margin of their
   copies. In this way, in fact, it may be regarded as certain that in
   countless minute particulars the text of Scripture has been depraved.
   Let me not fail to add, that by a judicious, and above all by an
   unprejudiced use of the materials at our disposal, it may, even at this
   distance of time, in every such particular, be successfully restored
   [401] .

   III. I now proceed to shew, by an induction of instances, that even in
   the oldest copies in existence, I mean in Codd. B, ', A, C, and D, the
   Lectionary system of the early Church has left abiding traces of its
   operation. When a few such undeniable cases have been adduced, all
   objections grounded on primÃ¢ facie improbability will have been
   satisfactorily disposed of. The activity, as well as the existence of
   such a disturbing force and depraving influence, at least as far back
   as the beginning of the iv^th century, (but it is in fact more ancient
   by full two hundred years,), will have been established: of which I
   shall only have to shew, in conclusion, that the omission of "the last
   Twelve Verses" of S. Mark's Gospel is probably but one more
   instance,--though confessedly by far the most extraordinary of any.

   (1.) From Codex B then, as well as from Cod. A, the two grand verses
   which describe our Lord's "Agony and Bloody Sweat," (S. Luke xxii. 43,
   44,) are missing. The same two verses are absent also from a few other
   important MSS., as well as from both the Egyptian versions; but I
   desire to fasten attention on the confessedly erring testimony in this
   place of Codex B. "Confessedly erring," I say; for the genuineness of
   those two verses is no longer disputed. Now, in every known
   Evangelistarium, the two verses here omitted by Cod. B follow, (the
   Church so willed it,) S. Matth. xxvi. 39, and are read as a regular
   part of the lesson for the Thursday in Holy Week [402] . Of course they
   are also omitted in the same Evangelistaria from the lesson for the
   Tuesday after Sexagesima, (te g' tes turophagou, as the Easterns call
   that day,) when S. Luke xxii. 39-xxiii. 1 used to be read. Moreover, in
   all ancient copies of the Gospels which have been accommodated to
   ecclesiastical use, the reader of S. Luke xxii. is invariably directed
   by a marginal note to leave out those two verses, and to proceed per
   saltum from ver. 42 to ver. 45 [403] . What more obvious therefore than
   that the removal of the paragraph from its proper place in S. Luke's
   Gospel is to be attributed to nothing else but the Lectionary practice
   of the primitive Church? Quite unreasonable is it to impute heretical
   motives, or to invent any other unsupported theory, while this plain
   solution of the difficulty is at hand.

   (2.) The same Cod. B., (with which Codd. ', C, L, U and G are observed
   here to conspire,) introduces the piercing of the Saviour's side (S.
   John xix. 34) at the end of S. Matth. xxvii. 49. Now, I only do not
   insist that this must needs be the result of the singular Lectionary
   practice already described at p. 202, because a scholion in Cod. 72
   records the singular fact that in the Diatessaron of Tatian, after S.
   Matth. xxvii. 48, was read allos de labon lonchen enuxen autou ten
   pleuran; kai exelthen hudor kai haima. (Chrysostom's codex was
   evidently vitiated in precisely the same way.) This interpolation
   therefore may have resulted from the corrupting influence of Tatian's
   (so-called) "Harmony." See Appendix (H).

   (3.) To keep on safe ground. Codd. B and D concur in what Alford justly
   calls the "grave error" of simply omitting from S. Luke xxiii. 34, our
   Lord's supplication on behalf of His murderers, (o de` Iesous e'lege,
   Pa'ter, a'phes autoisÂ· ou ga`r oi'dasi ti' poiousi. They are not quite
   singular in so doing; being, as usual, kept in countenance by certain
   copies of the old Latin, as well as by both the Egyptian versions. How
   is this "grave error" in so many ancient MSS. to be accounted for? (for
   a "grave error," or rather "a fatal omission" it certainly is). Simply
   by the fact that in the Eastern Church the Lection for the Thursday
   after Sexagesima breaks off abruptly, immediately before these very
   words,--to recommence at ver. 44 [404] .

   (4.) Note, that at ver. 32, the eighth "Gospel of the Passion"
   begins,--which is the reason why Codd. B and ' (with the Egyptian
   versions) exhibit a singular irregularity in that place; and why the
   Jerusalem Syriac introduces the established formula of the Lectionaries
   (sun to Iesou) at the same juncture.

   (If I do not here insist that the absence of the famous pericopa de
   adulterÃ¢ (S. John vii. 53-viii. 11,) from so many MSS., is to be
   explained in precisely the same way, it is only because the genuineness
   of that portion of the Gospel is generally denied; and I propose, in
   this enumeration of instances, not to set foot on disputed ground. I am
   convinced, nevertheless, that the first occasion of the omission of
   those memorable verses was the lectionary practice of the primitive
   Church, which, on Whitsunday, read from S. John vii. 37 to viii. 12,
   leaving out the twelve verses in question. Those verses, from the
   nature of their contents, (as Augustine declares,) easily came to be
   viewed with dislike or suspicion. The passage, however, is as old as
   the second century, for it is found in certain copies of the old Latin.
   Moreover Jerome deliberately gave it a place in the Vulgate. I pass
   on.)

   (5.) The two oldest Codices in existence,--B and ',--stand all but
   alone in omitting from S. Luke vi. 1 the unique and indubitably genuine
   word deuteroproto; which is also omitted by the Peshito, Italic and
   Coptic versions. And yet, when it is observed that an Ecclesiastical
   lection begins here, and that the Evangelistaria (which invariably
   leave out such notes of time) simply drop the word,--only substituting
   for en sabbato the more familiar tois sabbasi,--every one will be ready
   to admit that if the omission of this word be not due to the
   inattention of the copyist, (which, however, seems to me not at all
   unlikely [405] ,) it is sufficiently explained by the Lectionary
   practice of the Church,--which may well date back even to the
   immediately post-Apostolic age.

   (6/) In S. Luke xvi. 19, Cod. D introduces the Parable of Lazarus with
   the formula,--eipen de kai heteran parabolen; which is nothing else but
   a marginal note which has found its way into the text from the margin;
   being the liturgical introduction of a Church-lesson [406] which
   afterwards began eipen ho Kurios ten parabolen tauten [407] .

   (7.) In like manner, the same Codex makes S. John xiv. begin with the
   liturgical formula,--(it survives in our Book of Common Prayer [408] to
   this very hour!)--kai eipen tois mathetais autou: in which it is
   countenanced by certain MSS. of the Vulgate and of the old Latin
   Version. Indeed, it may be stated generally concerning the text of Cod.
   D, that it bears marks throughout of the depraving influence of the
   ancient Lectionary practice. Instances of this, (in addition to those
   elsewhere cited in these pages,) will be discovered in S. Luke iii. 23:
   iv. 16 (and xix. 45): v. 1 and 17: vi. 37 (and xviii. 15): vii. 1: x. 1
   and 25: xx. 1: in all but three of which, Cod. D is kept in countenance
   by the old Latin, often by the Syriac, and by other versions of the
   greatest antiquity. But to proceed.

   (8.) Cod. A, (supported by Athanasius, the Vulgate, Gothic, and
   Philoxeuian versions,) for kai, in S. Luke ix. 57, reads egeneto
   de--which is the reading of the Textus Receptus. Cod. D, (with some
   copies of the old Latin,) exhibits kai egeneto. All the diversity which
   is observable in this place, (and it is considerable,) is owing to the
   fact that an Ecclesiastical lection begins here [409] . In different
   Churches, the formula with which the lection was introduced slightly
   differed.

   (9.) Cod. C is supported by Chrysostom and Jerome, as well as by the
   Peshito, Cureton's and the Philoxenian Syriac, and some MSS. of the old
   Latin, in reading ho Iesous at the beginning of S. Matth. xi. 20. That
   the words have no business there, is universally admitted. So also is
   the cause of their interpolation generally recognized. The
   Ecclesiastical lection for Wednesday in the iv^th week after Pentecost
   begins at that place; and begins with the formula,--en to kairo ekeino,
   erxato ho Iesous oneidizein.

   Similarly, in S. Matth. xii. 9, xiii. 36, and xiv. 14, Cod. C inserts
   ho Iesous; a reading which on all three occasions is countenanced by
   the Syriac and some copies of the old Latin, and on the last of the
   three, by Origen also. And yet there can be no doubt that it is only
   because Ecclesiastical lections begin at those places [410] , that the
   Holy Name is introduced there.

   Let me add that the Sacred Name is confessedly an interpolation in the
   six places indicated at foot,--its presence being accounted for by the
   fact that, in each, an Ecclesiastical lection begins [411] . Cod. D in
   one of these places, Cod. A in four, is kept in countenance by the old
   Latin, the Syriac, the Coptic and other early versions;--convincing
   indications of the extent to which the Lectionary practice of the
   Church had established itself so early as the second century of our
   Ã¦ra.

   Cod. D, and copies of the old Latin and Egyptian versions also read tou
   Iesou, (instead of autou,) in S. Mark xiv. 3; which is only because a
   Church lesson begins there.

   (12.) The same Cod. D is all but unique in leaving out that memorable
   verse in S. Luke's Gospel (xxiv. 12), in which S. Peter's visit to the
   Sepulchre of our risen Lord finds particular mention. It is only
   because that verse was claimed both as the conclusion of the iv^th and
   also as the beginning of the v^th Gospel of the Resurrection: so that
   the liturgical note arche stands at the beginning,--telos at the end of
   it. Accordingly, D is kept in countenance here only by the Jerusalem
   Lectionary and some copies of the old Latin. But what is to be thought
   of the editorial judgment which (with Tregelles) encloses this verse
   within brackets and (with Tischendorf) rejects it from the text
   altogether?

   (13.) Codices B, ', and D are alone among MSS. in omitting the clause
   dieltho`n dia` me'ssou auton; kai` paregen ou'tos, at the end of the
   59th verse of S. John viii. The omission is to be accounted for by the
   fact that just there the Church-lesson for Tuesday in the v^th week
   after Easter came to an end.

   (14.) Again. It is not at all an unusual thing to find in cursive MSS.,
   at the end of S. Matth. viii. 13, (with several varieties), the
   spurious and tasteless appendix,--kai hupostrepsas ho hekatontarchos
   eis ton oikon autou en aute te hora heuren ton paida hugiainonta: a
   clause which owes its existence solely to the practice of ending the
   lection for the iv^th Sunday after Pentecost in that unauthorized
   manner [412] . But it is not only in cursive MSS. that these words are
   found. They are met with also in the Codex Sinaiticus ('): a witness at
   once to the inveteracy of Liturgical usage in the ivth century of our
   Ã¦ra, and to the corruptions which the "Codex omnium antiquissimus" will
   no doubt have inherited from a yet older copy than itself.

   (15.) In conclusion, I may remark generally that there occur instances,
   again and again, of perturbations of the Text in our oldest MSS.,
   (corresponding sometimes with readings vouched for by the most ancient
   of the Fathers,) which admit of no more intelligible or inoffensive
   solution than by referring them to the Lectionary practice of the
   primitive Church [413] .

   Thus when instead of kai` anabai'non o Iesous eis Hieroso'luma (S.
   Matth. xx. 17), Cod. B reads, (and, is almost unique in reading,)
   Mellon de anabai'non o Iesou?s; and when Origen sometimes quotes the
   place in the same way, but sometimes is observed to transpose the
   position of the Holy Name in the sentence; when again six of Matthaei's
   MSS., (and Origen once,) are observed to put the same Name after
   Hieroso'luma: when, lastly, two of Field's MSS. [414] , and one of
   Matthaei's, (and I dare say a great many more, if the truth were
   known,) omit the words o Iesous entirely:--who sees not that the true
   disturbing force in this place, from the ii^nd century of our Ã¦ra
   downwards, has been the Lectionary practice of the primitive
   Church?--the fact that there the lection for the Thursday after the
   viii^th Sunday after Pentecost began?--And this may suffice.

   IV. It has been proved then, in what goes before, morn effectually even
   than in a preceding page [415] , not only that Ecclesiastical Lections
   corresponding with those indicated in the "Synaxaria" were fully
   established in the immediately post-Apostolic age, but also that at
   that early period the Lectionary system of primitive Christendom had
   already exercised a depraving influence of a peculiar kind on the text
   of Scripture. Further yet, (and this is the only point I am now
   concerned to establish), that our five oldest Copies of the Gospels,--B
   and ' as well as A, C and D,--exhibit not a few traces of the
   mischievous agency alluded to; errors, and especially omissions, which
   sometimes seriously affect the character of those Codices as witnesses
   to the Truth of Scripture.--I proceed now to consider the case of S.
   Mark xvi. 9-20; only prefacing my remarks with a few necessary words of
   explanation.

   V. He who takes into his hands an ordinary cursive MS. of the Gospels,
   is prepared to find the Church-lessons regularly indicated throughout,
   in the text or in the margin. A familiar contraction, executed probably
   in vermillion , ar, indicates the "beginning" (arche) of each lection:
   a corresponding contraction indicates its "end" (telos.) Generally,
   these rubrical directions, (for they are nothing else,) are inserted
   for convenience into the body of the text,--from which the red pigment
   with which they are almost invariably executed, effectually
   distinguishes them. But all these particulars gradually disappear as
   recourse is had to older and yet older MSS. The studious in such
   matters have noticed that even the memorandums as to the "beginning"
   and the "end" of a lection are rare, almost in proportion to the
   antiquity of a Codex. When they do occur in the later uncials, they do
   not by any means always seem to have been the work of the original
   scribe; neither has care been always taken to indicate them in ink of a
   different colour. It will further be observed in such MSS. that whereas
   the sign where the reader is to begin is generally--(in order the
   better to attract his attention,)--inserted in the margin of the Codex,
   the note where he is to leave off, (in order the more effectually to
   arrest his progress,) is as a rule introduced into the body of the text
   [416] . In uncial MSS., however, all such symbols are not only rare,
   but (what is much to be noted) they are exceedingly irregular in their
   occurrence. Thus in Codex G, in the Bodleian Library, (a recently
   acquired uncial MS. of the Gospels, written A.D. 844), there occurs no
   indication of the "end" of a single lection in S. Luke's Gospel, until
   chap. xvi. 31 is reached; after which, the sign abounds. In Codex L,
   the original notes of Ecclesiastical Lections occur at the following
   rare and irregular intervals: S. Mark ix. 2: x. 46: xii. 40 (where the
   sign has lost its way; it should have stood against ver. 44): xv. 42
   and xvi. 1 [417] . In the oldest uncials, nothing of the kind is
   discoverable. Even in the Codex Bezae, (vi^th century,) not a single
   liturgical direction coeval with the MS. is anywhere to be found.

   VI. And yet, although the practice of thus indicating the beginning and
   the end of a liturgical section, does not seem to have come into
   general use until about the xii^th century; and although, previous to
   the ix^th century, systematic liturgical directions are probably
   unknown [418] ; the need of them must have been experienced by one
   standing up to read before the congregation, long before. The want of
   some reminder where he was to begin,--above all, of some hint where he
   was to leave off,--will have infallibly made itself felt from the
   first. Accordingly, there are not wanting indications that,
   occasionally, teloc (or to teloc) was written in the margin of Copies
   of the Gospels at an exceedingly remote epoch. One memorable example of
   this practice is supplied by the Codex Bezae (D): where in S. Mark xiv.
   41, instead of apechei. elthen e o'ra,--we meet with the unintelligible
   apechei to teloc kai E ora Now, nothing else has here happened but that
   a marginal note, designed originally to indicate the end (to teloc) of
   the lesson for the third day of the ii^nd week of the Carnival, has
   lost its way from the end of ver. 42, and got thrust into the text of
   ver. 41,--to the manifest destruction of the sense [419] . I find D's
   error here is shared (a) by the Peshito Syriac, (b) by the old Latin,
   and (c) by the Philoxenian: venerable partners in error, truly! for the
   first two probably carry back this false reading to the second century
   of our Ã¦ra; and so, furnish one more remarkable proof, to be added to
   the fifteen (or rather the forty) already enumerated (pp. 217-23), that
   the lessons of the Eastern Church were settled at a period long
   anterior to the date of the oldest MS. of the Gospels extant.

   VII. Returning then to the problem before us, I venture to suggest as
   follows:--What if, at a very remote period, this same isolated
   liturgical note (to teloc) occurring at S. Mark xvi. 8, (which is "the
   end" of the Church-lection for the ii^nd Sunday after Easter,) should
   have unhappily suggested to some copyist,--kallugraphias quam vel
   Criticae Sacrae vel rerum Liturgicarum peritior--the notion that the
   entire "Gospel according to S. Mark," came to an end at verse 8?
   . . . . I see no more probable account of the matter, I say, than
   this:--That the mutilation of the last chapter of S. Mark has resulted
   from the fact, that some very ancient scribe misapprehended the import
   of the solitary liturgical note teloc (or to teloc) which he found at
   the close of verse 8. True, that he will have probably beheld, further
   on, several additional stichoi. But if he did, how could he acknowledge
   the fact more loyally than by leaving (as the author of Cod. B is
   observed to have done) one entire column blank, before proceeding with
   S. Luke? He hesitated, all the same, to transcribe any further, having
   before him, (as he thought,) an assurance that "THE END" had been
   reached at ver. 8.

   VIII. That some were found in very early times eagerly to acquiesce in
   this omission: to sanction it: even to multiply copies of the Gospel so
   mutilated; (critics or commentators intent on nothing so much as
   reconciling the apparent discrepancies in the Evangelical
   narratives:)--appears to me not at all unlikely [420] . Eusebius almost
   says as much, when he puts into the mouth of one who is for getting rid
   of these verses altogether, the remark that "they would be in a manner
   superfluous if it should appear that their testimony is at variance
   with that of the other Evangelists [421] ." (The ancients were giants
   in Divinity but children in Criticism.) On the other hand, I altogether
   agree with Dean Alford in thinking it highly improbable that the
   difficulty of harmonizing one Gospel with another in this place, (such
   as it is,) was the cause why these Twelve Verses were originally
   suppressed [422] . (1) First, because there really was no need to
   withhold more than three,--at the utmost, five of them,--if this had
   been the reason of the omission. (2) Next, because it would have been
   easier far to introduce some critical correction of any supposed
   discrepancy, than to sweep away the whole of the unoffending context.
   (3) Lastly, because nothing clearly was gained by causing the Gospel to
   end so abruptly that every one must see at a glance that it had been
   mutilated. No. The omission having originated in a mistake, was
   perpetuated for a brief period (let us suppose) only through infirmity
   of judgment: or, (as I prefer to believe), only in consequence of the
   religious fidelity of copyists, who were evidently always instructed to
   transcribe exactly what they found in the copy set before them. The
   Church meanwhile in her corporate capacity, has never known anything at
   all of the matter,--as was fully shewn above in Chap. X.

   IX. When this solution of the problem first occurred to me, (and it
   occurred to me long before I was aware of the memorable reading to
   teloc in the Codex Bezae, already adverted to,) I reasoned with myself
   as follows:--But if the mutilation of the second Gospel came about in
   this particular way, the MSS. are bound to remember something of the
   circumstance; and in ancient MSS., if I am right, I ought certainly to
   meet with some confirmation of my opinion. According to my view, at the
   root of this whole matter lies the fact that at S. Mark xvi. 8 a
   well-known Ecclesiastical lesson comes to an end. Is there not perhaps
   something exceptional in the way that the close of that liturgical
   section was anciently signified?

   X. In order to ascertain this, I proceeded to inspect every copy of the
   Gospels in the Imperial Library at Paris [423] ; and devoted seventy
   hours exactly, with unflagging delight, to the task. The success of the
   experiment astonished me.

   1. I began with our Cod. 24 (= Reg. 178) of the Gospels: turned to the
   last page of S. Mark: and beheld, in a Codex of the xi^th Century
   wholly devoid of the Lectionary apparatus which is sometimes found in
   MSS. of a similar date [424] , at fol. 104, the word + teloc +
   conspicuously written by the original scribe immediately after S. Mark
   xvi. 8, as well as at the close of the Gospel. It occurred besides only
   at ch. ix. 9, (the end of the lesson for the Transfiguration.) And yet
   there are at least seventy occasions in the course of S. Mark's Gospel
   where, in MSS. which have been accommodated to Church use, it is usual
   to indicate the close of a Lection. This discovery, which surprised me
   not a little, convinced me that I was on the right scent; and every
   hour I met with some fresh confirmation of the fact.

   2. For the intelligent reader will readily understand that three such
   deliberate liturgical memoranda, occurring solitary in a MS. of this
   date, are to be accounted for only in one way. They infallibly
   represent a corresponding peculiarity in some far more ancient
   document. The fact that the word teloc is here (a) set down
   unabbreviated, (b) in black ink, and (c) as part of the text,--points
   unmistakably in the same direction. But that Cod. 24 is derived from a
   Codex of much older date is rendered certain by a circumstance which
   shall be specified at foot [425] .

   3. The very same phenomena reappear in Cod. 36 [426] . The sign + teloc
   +, (which occurs punctually at S. Mark xvi. 8 and again at v. 20,) is
   found besides in S. Mark's Gospel only at chap. i. 8 [427] ; at chap.
   xiv. 31; and (+ teloc oou kephal[/]) at chap. xv. 24;--being on every
   occasion incorporated with the Text. Now, when it is perceived that in
   the second and third of these places, teloc has clearly lost its
   way,--appearing where no Ecclesiastical lection came to an end,--it
   will be felt that the MS. before us (of the xi^th century) if it was
   not actually transcribed from,--must at least exhibit at second
   hand,--a far more ancient Codex [428] .

   4. Only once more.--Codex 22 (= Reg. 72) was never prepared for Church
   purposes. A rough hand has indeed scrawled indications of the
   beginnings and endings of a few of the Lessons, here and there; but
   these liturgical notes are no part of the original MS. At S. Mark xvi.
   8, however, we are presented (as before) with the solitary note + teloc
   +---, incorporated with the text. Immediately after which, (in writing
   of the same size,) comes a memorable statement [429] in red letters.
   The whole stands thus:--

   phobounto gar + teloc +--
   ? hen tici ton antigraphon.
   eoc hode pleroutai o eu
   angelictec: ee polloic
   de. kai tauta pheretai +--
   Anastas de. proi prote sabbaton.

   And then follows the rest of the Gospel; at the end of which, the sign
   + teloc + is again repeated,--which sign, however, occurs nowhere else
   in the MS. nor at the end of any of the other three Gospels. A more
   opportune piece of evidence could hardly have been invented. A
   statement so apt and so significant was surely a thing rather to be
   wished than to be hoped for. For here is the liturgical sign teloc not
   only occurring in the wholly exceptional way of which we have already
   seen examples, but actually followed by the admission that "In certain
   copies, the Evangelist proceeds no further." The two circumstances so
   brought together seem exactly to bridge over the chasm between Codd. B
   and ' on the one hand,--and Codd. 24 and 36. on the other; and to
   supply us with precisely the link of evidence which we require. For
   observe:--During the first six centuries of our Ã¦ra, no single instance
   is known of a codex in which teloc is written at the end of a Gospel.
   The subscription of S. Mark for instance is invariably either KATA
   MARKON,--(as in B and '): or else EUAGGELION KATA MARKON,--(as in A and
   C, and the other older uncials): never teloc. But here is a Scribe who
   first copies the liturgical note teloc,--and then volunteers the
   critical observation that "in some copies of S. Mark's Gospel the
   Evangelist proceeds no further!" A more extraordinary corroboration of
   the view which I am endeavouring to recommend to the reader's
   acceptance, I really cannot imagine. Why, the ancient Copyist actually
   comes back, in order to assure me that the suggestion which I have been
   already offering in explanation of the difficulty, is the true one!

   5. I am not about to abuse the reader's patience with a prolonged
   enumeration of the many additional conspiring
   circumstances,--insignificant in themselves and confessedly unimportant
   when considered singly, but of which the cumulative force is
   unquestionably great,--which an examination of 99 MSS. of the Gospels
   brought to light [430] . Enough has been said already to shew,

   (1st.) That it must have been a customary thing, at a very remote age,
   to write the word teloc against S. Mark xvi. 8, even when the same note
   was withheld from the close of almost every other ecclesiastical
   lection in the Gospel.

   (2ndly.) That this word, or rather note, which no doubt was originally
   written as a liturgical memorandum in the margin, became at a very
   early period incorporated with the text; where, retaining neither its
   use nor its significancy, it was liable to misconception, and may have
   easily come to be fatally misunderstood.

   And although these two facts certainly prove nothing in and by
   themselves, yet, when brought close alongside of the problem which has
   to be solved, their significancy becomes immediately apparent: for,

   (3rdly.) As a matter of fact, there are found to have existed before
   the time of Eusebius, copies of S. Mark's Gospel which did come to an
   end at this very place. Now, that the Evangelist left off there, no one
   can believe [431] . Why, then, did the Scribe leave off? But the Reader
   is already in possession of the reason why. A sufficient explanation of
   the difficulty has been elicited from the very MSS. themselves. And
   surely when, suspended to an old chest which has been locked up for
   ages, a key is still hanging which fits the lock exactly and enables
   men to open the chest with ease, they are at liberty to assume that the
   key belongs to the lock; is, in fact, the only instrument by which the
   chest may lawfully be opened.

   XI. And now, in conclusion, I propose that we summon back our original
   Witness, and invite him to syllable his evidence afresh, in order that
   we may ascertain if perchance it affords any countenance whatever to
   the view which I have been advocating. Possible at least it is that in
   the Patristic) record that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were anciently
   defective from the 8th verse onwards some vestige may be discoverable
   of the forgotten truth. Now, it has been already fully shewn that it is
   a mistake to introduce into this discussion any other name but that of
   Eusebius [432] . Do, then, the terms in which Eusebius alludes to this
   matter lend us any assistance? Let us have the original indictment read
   over to us once more: and this time we are bound to listen to every
   word of it with the utmost possible attention.

   A problem is proposed for solution. "There are two ways of solving it,"
   (Eusebius begins):--ho men gar [to kephalaion auto] ten touto
   phaskousan perikopen atheton, eipoi an me en hapasin auten pheresthai
   tois antigraphois tou kata Markon euangeliou; ta goun akribe ton
   antigraphon TO TELOS perigraphei tes kata ton Markon historias en tois
   logois k.t.l. hois epilegei, "kai oudeni ouden eipon, ephobounto gar."
   En touto schedon en hapasi tois antigraphois tou kata Markon euangeliou
   perigegraptai TO TELOS [433] . . . Let us halt hero for one moment.

   2. Surely, a new and unexpected light already begins to dawn upon this
   subject! How is it that we paid so little attention before to the terms
   in which this ancient Father delivers his evidence, that we overlooked
   the import of an expression of his which from the first must have
   struck us as peculiar, but which now we perceive to be of paramount
   significancy? Eusebius is pointing out that one way for a man (so
   minded) to get rid of the apparent inconsistency between S. Mark xvi. 9
   and S. Matth. xxviii. 1, would be for him to reject the entire
   "Ecclesiastical Lection [434] " in which S. Mark xvi. 9 occurs. Any one
   adopting this course, (he proceeds; and it is much to be noted that
   Eusebius is throughout delivering the imaginary sentiments of
   another,--not his own:) Such an one (he says) "will say that it is not
   met with in all the copies of S. Mark's Gospel. The accurate copies, at
   all events,"--and then follows an expression in which this ancient
   Critic is observed ingeniously to accommodate his language to the
   phenomenon which he has to describe, so as covertly to insinuate
   something else. Eusebius employs an idiom (it is found elsewhere in his
   writings) sufficiently colourless to have hitherto failed to arouse
   attention; but of which it is impossible to overlook the actual design
   and import, after all that has gone before. He clearly recognises the
   very phenomenon to which I have been calling attention within the last
   two pages, and which I need not further insist upon or explain: viz.
   that the words TO TELOC were in some very ancient ("the accurate")
   copies found written after ephobounto gar: although to an unsuspicious
   reader the expression which he uses may well seem to denote nothing
   more than that the second Gospel generally came to an end there.

   3. And now it is time to direct attention to the important bearing of
   the foregoing remark on the main point at issue. The true import of
   what Eusebius has delivered, and which has at last been ascertained,
   will be observed really to set his evidence in a novel and unsuspected
   light. From the days of Jerome, it has been customary to assume that
   Eusebius roundly states that, in his time almost all the Greek copies
   were without our "last Twelve Verses" of S. Mark's Gospel [435] :
   whereas Eusebius really does nowhere say so. He expresses himself
   enigmatically, resorting to a somewhat unusual phrase [436] which
   perhaps admits of no exact English counterpart: but what he says
   clearly amounts to no more than this,--that "the accurate copies, at
   the words ephobounto gar, circumscribe THE END (TO TELOC ) of Mark's
   narrative:" that there, "in almost all the Copies of the Gospel
   according to Mark, is circumscribed THE END." He says no more. He does
   not say that there "is circumscribed the Gospel." As for the twelve
   verses which follow, he merely declares that they were "not met with in
   all the copies;" i.e. that some copies did not contain them. But this,
   so far from being a startling statement, is no more than what Codd. B
   and ' in themselves are sufficient to establish. In other words,
   Eusebius, (whose testimony on this subject as it is commonly understood
   is so extravagant [see above, p. 48-9,] as to carry with it its own
   sufficient refutation,) is found to bear consistent testimony to the
   two following modest propositions; which, however, are not adduced by
   him as reasons for rejecting S. Mark xvi. 9-20, but only as samples of
   what might be urged by one desirous of shelving a difficulty suggested
   by their contents;--

   (1st.) That from some ancient copies of S. Mark's Gospel these last
   Twelve Verses were away.

   (2nd.) That in almost all the copies,--(whether mutilated or not, he
   does not state,)--the words TO TELOC were found immediately after ver.
   8; which, (he seems to hint,) let those who please accept as evidence
   that there also is the end of the Gospel.

   4. But I cannot dismiss the testimony of Eusebius until I have recorded
   my own entire conviction that this Father is no more an original
   authority here than Jerome, or Hesychius, or Victor [437] . He is
   evidently adopting the language of some more ancient writer than
   himself. I observe that he introduces the problem with the remark that
   what follows is one of the questions "for ever mooted by every body
   [438] ." I suspect (with Matthaei, [suprÃ , p. 66,]) that Origen is the
   true author of all this confusion. He certainly relates of himself that
   among his voluminous exegetical writings was a treatise on S. Mark's
   Gospel [439] . To Origen's works, Eusebius, (his apologist and
   admirer,) is known to have habitually resorted; and, like many others,
   to have derived not a few of his notions from that fervid and acute,
   but most erratic intellect. Origen's writings in short, seem to have
   been the source of much, if not most of the mistaken Criticism of
   Antiquity. (The reader is reminded of what has been offered above at p.
   96-7). And this would not be the first occasion on which it would
   appear that when an ancient Writer speaks of "the accurate copies,"
   what he actually means is the text of Scripture which was employed or
   approved by Origen [440] . The more attentively the language of
   Eusebius in this place is considered, the more firmly (it is thought)
   will the suspicion be entertained that he is here only reproducing the
   sentiments of another person. But, however this may be, it is at least
   certain that the precise meaning of what he says, has been hitherto
   generally overlooked. He certainly does not say, as Jerome, from his
   loose translation of the passage [441] , evidently imagined,--"omnibus
   Graeciae libris pene hoc capitulum in fine non habentibus:" but
   only,--"non in omnibus Evangelii exemplaribus hoc capitulum inveniri;"
   which is an entirely different thing. Eusebius adds,--"Accuratiora
   saltem exemplaria FINEM narrationis secundum Marcum circumscribunt in
   verbis ephobounto gar;"--and, "In hoc, fere in omnibus exemplaribus
   Evangelii secundum Marcum, FINEM circumscribi."--The point, however, of
   greatest interest is, that Eusebius here calls attention to the
   prevalence in MSS. of his time of the very liturgical peculiarity which
   plainly supplies the one true solution of the problem under discussion.
   His testimony is a marvellous corroboration of what we learn from Cod.
   22, (see above, p. 230,) and, rightly understood, does not go a whit
   beyond it.

   5. What wonder that Hesychius, because he adopted blindly what he found
   in Eusebius, should at once betray his author and exactly miss the
   point of what his author says? To kata Markon euangelion (so he writes)
   mechri tou "ephobounto gar," echei TO TELOC [442] .

   6. This may suffice concerning the testimony of Eusebius.--It will be
   understood that I suppose Origen to have fallen in with one or more
   copies of S. Mark's Gospel which exhibited the Liturgical hint, (TO
   TELOC,) conspicuously written against S. Mark xvi. 9. Such a copy may,
   or may not, have there terminated abruptly. I suspect however that it
   did. Origen at all events, (more suo,) will have remarked on the
   phenomenon before him; and Eusebius will have adopted his remarks,--as
   the heralds say, "with a difference,"--simply because they suited his
   purpose, and seemed to him ingenious and interesting.

   7. For the copy in question,--(like that other copy of S. Mark from
   which the Peshito translation was made, and in which TO TELOC most
   inopportunely occurs at chap. xiv. 41 [443] ,)--will have become the
   progenitor of several other copies (as Codd. B and '); and some of
   these, it is pretty evident, were familiarly known to Eusebius.

   8. Let it however be clearly borne in mind that nothing of all this is
   in the least degree essential to my argument. Eusebius, (for aught that
   I know or care,) may be solely responsible for every word that he has
   delivered concerning S. Mark xvi. 9-20. Every link in my argument will
   remain undisturbed, and the conclusion will be still precisely the
   same, whether the mistaken Criticism before us originated with another
   or with himself.

   XII. But why, (it may reasonably be asked,)--Why should there have been
   anything exceptional in the way of indicating the end of this
   particular Lection? Why should telos be so constantly found written
   after S. Mark xvi. 8?

   I answer,--I suppose it was because the Lections which respectively
   ended and began at that place were so many, and were Lections of such
   unusual importance. Thus,--(1) On the 2nd Sunday after Easter, (kuriaee
   g' ton murophoron as it was called,) at the Liturgy, was read S. Mark
   xv. 43 to xvi. 8; and (2) on the same day at Matins, (by the Melchite
   Syrian Christians as well as by the Greeks [444] ,) S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
   The severance, therefore, was at ver. 8. (3) In certain of the Syrian
   Churches the liturgical section for Easter Day was S. Mark xvi. 2-8
   [445] : in the Churches of the Jacobite, or Monophysite Christians, the
   Eucharistic lesson for Easter-Day was ver. 1-8 [446] . (4) The second
   matin lesson of the Resurrection (xvi. 1-8) also ends,--and (5) the
   third (xvi. 9-20) begins, at the same place: and these two Gospels
   (both in the Greek and in the Syrian Churches) were in constant use not
   only at Easter, but throughout the year [447] . (6) That same third
   matin lesson of the Resurrection was also the Lesson at Matins on
   Ascension-Day; as well in the Syrian [448] as in the Greek [449]
   Churches. (7) With the Monophysite Christians, the lection "feriae
   tertiae in albis, ad primam vesperam," (i.e. for the Tuesday in
   Easter-Week) was S. Mark xv. 37-xvi. 8: and (8) on the same day, at
   Matins, ch. xvi. 9-18 [450] .--During eighteen weeks after Easter
   therefore, the only parts of S. Mark's Gospel publicly read were (a)
   the last thirteen [ch. xv. 43-xvi. 8], and (b) "the last twelve" [ch.
   xvi. 9-20] verses. Can it be deemed a strange thing that it should have
   been found indispensable to mark, with altogether exceptional
   emphasis,--to make it unmistakably plain,--where the former Lection
   came to an end, and where the latter Lection began [451] ?

   XIII. One more circumstance, and but one, remains to be adverted to in
   the way of evidence; and one more suggestion to be offered. The
   circumstance is familiar indeed to all, but its bearing on the present
   discussion has never been pointed out. I allude to the fact that
   anciently, in copies of the fourfold Gospel, the Gospel according to S.
   Hark frequently stood last.

   This is memorably the case in respect of the Codex Bezae [vi]: more
   memorably yet, in respect of the Gothic version of Ulphilas (A.D. 360):
   in both of which MSS., the order of the Gospels is (1) S. Matthew, (2)
   S. John, (3) S. Luke, (4) S. Mark. This is in fact the usual Western
   order. Accordingly it is thus that the Gospels stand in the Codd.
   Vercellensis (a), Veronensis (b), Palatinus (e), Brixianus (f) of the
   old Latin version. But this order is not exclusively Western. It is
   found in Cod. 309. It is also observed in Matthaei's Codd. 13, 14,
   (which last is our Evan. 256), at Moscow. And in the same order
   Eusebius and others of the ancients [452] are occasionally observed to
   refer to the four Gospels,--which induces a suspicion that they were
   not unfamiliar with it. Nor is this all. In Codd. 19 and 90 the Gospel
   according to S. Mark stands last; though in the former of these the
   order of the three antecedent Gospels is (1) S. John, (2) S. Matthew,
   (3) S. Luke [453] ; in the latter, (1) S. John, (2) S. Luke, (3) S.
   Matthew. What need of many words to explain the bearing of these facts
   on the present discussion? Of course it will have sometimes happened
   that S. Mark xvi. 8 came to be written at the bottom of the left hand
   page of a MS. [454] And we have but to suppose that in the case of one
   such Codex the next leaf, which would have been the last, was
   missing,--(the very thing which has happened in respect of one of the
   Codices at Moscow [455] ) what else could result when a copyist reached
   the words,

   EPhOBOUNTO GAR. TO TELOC

   but the very phenomenon which has exercised critics so sorely and which
   gives rise to the whole of the present discussion? The copyist will
   have brought S. Mark's Gospel to an end there, of course. What else
   could he possibly do? . . . . Somewhat less excusably was our learned
   countryman Mill betrayed into the statement, (inadvertently adopted by
   Wetstein, Griesbach, and Tischendorf,) that "the last verse of S.
   John's Gospel is omitted in Cod. 63:" the truth of the matter being (as
   Mr. Scrivener has lately proved) that the last leaf of Cod. 63,--on
   which the last verse of S. John's Gospel was demonstrably once
   written,--has been lost [456] .

   XIV. To sum up.

   1. It will be perceived that I suppose the omission of "the last Twelve
   Verses" of S. Mark's Gospel to have originated in a sheer error and
   misconception on the part of some very ancient Copyist. He saw TO TELOC
   written after ver. 8: he assumed that it was the Subscription, or at
   least that it denoted "the End," of the Gospel.

   2. Whether certain ancient Critics, because it was acceptable to them,
   were not found to promote this mistake,--it is useless to inquire. That
   there may have arisen some old harmonizer of the Gospels, who, (in the
   words of Eusebius,) was disposed to "regard what followed as
   superfluous from its seeming inconsistency with the testimony of the
   other Evangelists [457] ;"--and that in this way the error became
   propagated;--is likely enough. But an error it most certainly was: and
   to that error, the accident described in the last preceding paragraph
   would have very materially conduced, and it may have very easily done
   so.

   3. I request however that it may be observed that the "accident" is not
   needed in order to account for the "error." The mere presence of TO
   TELOC at ver. 8, so near the end of the Gospel, would be quite enough
   to occasion it. And we have seen that in very ancient times the word
   TELOC frequently did occur in an altogether exceptional manner in that
   very place. Moreover, we have ascertained that its meaning was not
   understood by the transcribers of ancient MSS.

   4. And will any one venture to maintain that it is to him a thing
   incredible that an intelligent copyist of the iii^rd century, because
   he read the words TO TELOC at S. Mark xvi. 8, can have been beguiled
   thereby into the supposition that those words indicated "the End" of S.
   Mark's Gospel?--Shall I be told that, even if one can have so entirely
   overlooked the meaning of the liturgical sign as to suffer it to
   insinuate itself into his text [458] , it is nevertheless so improbable
   as to pass all credence that another can have supposed that it
   designated the termination of the Gospel of the second Evangelist?--For
   all reply, I take leave to point out that Scholz, and Tischendorf, and
   Tregelles, and Mai and the rest of the Critics have, one and all,
   without exception, misunderstood the same word occurring in the same
   place, and in precisely the same way.

   Yes. The forgotten inadvertence of a solitary Scribe in the second or
   third century has been, in the nineteenth, deliberately reproduced,
   adopted, and stereotyped by every Critic and every Editor of the New
   Testament in turn.

   What wonder,--(I propose the question deliberately,)--What wonder that
   an ancient Copyist should have been misled by a phenomenon which in our
   own days is observed to have imposed upon two generations of professed
   Biblical Critics discussing this very textual problem, and therefore
   fully on their guard against delusion [459] ? To this hour, the
   illustrious Editors of the text of the Gospels are clearly, one and
   all, labouring under the grave error of supposing that "ephobounto gar
   + telos,"--(for which they are so careful to refer us to "Cod.
   22,")--is an indication that there, by rights, comes the "End" of the
   Gospel according to S. Mark. They have failed to perceive that TELOC in
   that place is only a liturgical sign,--the same with which (in its
   contracted form) they are sufficiently familiar; and that it serves no
   other purpose whatever, but to mark that there a famous Ecclesiastical
   Lection comes to an end.

   With a few pages of summary, we may now bring this long disquisition to
   an end.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [394] The reader is requested to refer back to p. 45, and the note
   there.--The actual words of Eusebius are given in Appendix (B).

   [395] See the enumeration of Greek Service-Books in Scrivener's
   Introduction, &c. pp. 211-25. For the Syriac Lectionaries, see Dean
   Payne Smith's Catalogue, (1864) pp. 114-29-31-4-5-8: also Professor
   Wright's Catalogue, (1870) pp. 146 to 203.--I avail myself of this
   opportunity to thank both those learned Scholars for their valuable
   assistance, always most obligingly rendered.

   [396] "Evangelistariorum codices literis uncialibus scripti nondum sic
   ut decet in usum criticum conversi sunt." Tischendorf, quoted by
   Scrivener, [Introduction to Cod. Augiensis,--80 pages which have been
   separately published and are well deserving of study,--p. 48,] who
   adds,--"I cannot even conjecture why an Evangelistarium should be
   thought of less value than another MS. of the same age."--See also
   Scrivener's Introduction, &c. p. 211.

   [397] e.g. Addit. MSS. 12,141: 14,449: 14,450-2-4-5-6-7-8: 14,461-3:
   17,113-4-5-6:--(= 15 Codd. in all:) from p. 45 to p. 66 of Professor
   Wright's Catalogue.

   [398] Addit. MS. 14,464. (See Dr. Wright's Catalogue, p. 70.)

   [399] Add to the eight examples adduced by Mr. Scrivener from our Book
   of C. P., (Introduction, p. 11), the following:--Gospels for
   Quinquagesima, 2nd S. after Easter, 9th, 12th, 22nd after Trinity,
   Whitsunday, Ascension Day, SS. Philip and James (see below, p. 220),
   All Saints.

   [400] Thus the words eipe de` o Ku'rios (S. Luke vii. 31) which
   introduce an Ecclesiastical Lection (Friday in the iii^rd week of S.
   Luke,) inasmuch as the words are found in no uncial MS., and are
   omitted besides by the Syriac, Vulgate, Gothic and Coptic Versions,
   must needs be regarded as a liturgical interpolation.--The same is to
   be said of ho Iesous in S. Matth. xiv. 22,--words which Origen and
   Chrysostom, as well as the Syriac versions, omit; and which clearly owe
   their place in twelve of the uncials, in the Textus Receptus, in the
   Vulgate and some copies of the old Latin, to the fact that the Gospel
   for the ix^th Sunday after Pentecost begins at that place.--It will be
   kindred to the present inquiry that I should point out that in S. Mark
   xvi. 9, Anast8as ho Iesous is constantly met with in Greek MSS., and
   even in some copies of the Vulgate; and yet there can be no doubt that
   here also the Holy Name is an interpolation which has originated from
   the same cause as the preceding. The fact is singularly illustrated by
   the insertion of "ho i?s?" in Cod. 267 (= Reg. 69,) rubro above the
   same contraction (for ho Iesous) in the text.

   [401] Not, of course, so long as the present senseless fashion prevails
   of regarding Codex B, (to which, if Cod. L. and Codd. 1, 33 and 69 are
   added, it is only because they agree with B), as an all but infallible
   guide in settling the text of Scripture; and quietly taking it for
   granted that all the other MSS. in existence have entered into a grand
   conspiracy to deceive mankind. Until this most uncritical method, this
   most unphilosophical theory, is unconditionally abandoned, progress in
   this department of sacred Science is simply impossible.

   [402] See Matthaei's note on S. Luke xxii. 43, (Nov. Test. ed.1803.)

   [403] This will be best understood by actual reference to a manuscript.
   In Cod. Evan. 436 (Meerman 117) which lies before me, these directions
   are given as follows. After to son genestho (i.e. the last words of
   ver. 42), is written huperba eis to tes g'. Then, at the end of ver.
   44, is written--arxou tes g', after which follows the text kai anastas,
   &c. In S. Matthew's Gospel, at chap. xxvi, which contains the
   Liturgical section for Thursday in Holy Week (te hagia kai megale e'),
   my Codex has been only imperfectly rubricated. Let me therefore be
   allowed to quote from Harl. MS. 1810, (our Cod. Evan. 113) which, at
   fol. 84, at the end of S. Matth. xxvi. 39, reads as follows,
   immediately after the words,--all' os su:-- (i.e. hupanta.) But in
   order to explain what is meant; the above rubricated word and sign are
   repeated at foot, as follows hupanta eis to kata Loukan en kephalaio
   rth?. hophthe de a8uto angelos: eita straph9e8is entautha palin, lege;
   kai erchetai pros tous mathetas--which are the first words of S. Matth.
   xxvi. 40. Accordingly, my Codex (No. 436, above referred to)
   immediately after S. Luke xxii. 42, besides the rubric already quoted,
   has the following: arxou tes megales e'. Then come the two famous
   verses (ver. 43, 44); and, after the words anastas apo tos proseuches,
   the following rubric occurs: hupanta eis to tes megales e Matth.
   erchetai pros tous mathetas. [With the help of my nephew, (Rev. W. F.
   Rose, Curate of Holy Trinity, Windsor,) I have collated every syllable
   of Cod. 436. Its text most nearly resembles the Rev. F. H. Scrivener's
   l, m, n.]

   [404] See by all means Matthaei's Nov. Test. (ed. 1803,) i. p. 491, and
   492.

   [405] See above, p. 75, note (h).

   [406] For the 5th Sunday of S. Luke.

   [407] Such variations are quite common. Matthaei, with his usual
   accuracy, points out several: e.g. Nov. Test. (1788) vol. i. p. 19
   (note 26), p. 23: vol. ii. p. 10 (note 12), p. 14 (notes 14 and 15),
   &c.

   [408] SS. Philip and James.

   [409] viz. sabbato th: i.e. the ix^th Saturday in S. Luke.--Note that
   Cod. A also reads egeneto de in S. Lu. xi. 1.

   [410] viz. Monday in the v^th, Thursday in the vi^th week after
   Pentecost, and the viii^th Sunday after Pentecost.

   [411] viz. S. Luke xiii. 2: xxiv. 36. S. John i. 29 (o Ioa'nnes): 44:
   vi. 14: xiii. 3,--to which should perhaps be added xxi. 1, where B, ',
   A, C (not D) read Iesous.

   [412] See by all means Matthaei's interesting note on the place,--Nov.
   Test. (1788) vol. i. p. 113-4. It should be mentioned that Cod. C (and
   four other uncials), together with the Philoxenian and Hierosolymitan
   versions, concur in exhibiting the seine spurious clause. Matthaei
   remarks,--"Origenes (iv. 171 D) hanc pericopam haud adeo diligenter
   recensens terminal eum in genetheto soi." Will not the disturbing
   Lectionary practice of his day sufficiently explain Origen's omission?

   [413] I recal S. John x. 29: xix. 13: xxi. 1;--but the attentive
   student will be able to multiply such references almost indefinitely.
   In these and similar places, while the phraseology is exceedingly
   simple, the variations which the text exhibits are so exceeding
   numerous,--that when it is discovered that a Church Lesson begins in
   those places, we may be sure that we have been put in possession of the
   name of the disturbing force.

   [414] Viz. K and M. (Field's Chrys. p. 251.)--How is it that the
   readings of Chrysostom are made so little account of? By Tregelles, for
   example, why are they overlooked entirely?

   [415] See above, p. 197 to 204.

   [416] e.g. in Cod. Evan. 10 and 270.

   [417] In some cursive MSS. also, (which have been probably transcribed
   from ancient originals), the same phenomenon is observed. Thus, in
   Evan. 265 (= Reg. 66), tel only occurs, in S. Mark, at ix. 9 and 41:
   xv. 32 and 41: xvi. 8. Arch at xvi. 1. It is striking to observe that
   so little were those ecclesiastical notes (embedded in the text)
   understood by the possessor of the MS., that in the margin, over
   against ch. xv. 41, (where "tel^o" stands in the text,) a somewhat
   later hand has written,--te[los] t[es] hor[as]. A similar liturgical
   note may be seen over against ch. ix. 9, and elsewhere. Cod. 25 (= Reg.
   191), at the end of S. Mark's Gospel, has only two notes of liturgical
   endings: viz. at ch. xv. 1 and 42.

   [418] Among the Syriac Evangelia, as explained above (p. 215),
   instances occur of far more ancient MSS. which exhibit a text
   rubricated by the original scribe. Even here, however, (as may be
   learned from Dr. Wright's Catalogue, pp. 46-66,) such Rubrics Live been
   only irregularly inserted in the oldest copies.

   [419] Note, that the Codex from which Cod. D was copied will have
   exhibited the text thus,--apechei to teloc Elthen E ora,--which is the
   reading of Cod. (= 13 Reg. 50.) But the scribe of Cod. D, in order to
   improve the sense, substituted for elthen the word kai. Note the
   scholion [Anon. Vat.] in Possinus, p. 321:--apechei, toutesti,
   peplerotai, telos echei to kat' eme. Besides the said Cod. 13, the same
   reading is found in 47 and 54 (in the Bodl.): 56 (at Linc. Coll.): 61
   (i.e. Cod. Montfort.): 69 (i.e. Cod. Leicestr.): 124 (i.e. Cod. Vind.
   Lamb. 31): c^scr (i.e. Lambeth, 1177): 2^pc (i.e. the 2nd of Muralt's
   S. Petersburg Codd.); and Cod. 439 (i.e. Auddit. Brit. Mus. 5107). All
   these eleven MSS. read ape'chei to telos at S. Mark xiv. 41.

   [420] So Scholz (i. 200):--"Pericopa haec casu quodam forsan exciderat
   a codice quodam Alexandrino; unde defectus iste in alios libros
   transiit. Nec mirum hunc defectum multis, immo in certis regionibus
   plerisque scribis arrisisse: confitentur enim ex ipsorum opinione
   Marcum Matthaeo repugnare. Cf. maxime Eusebium ad Marinum," &c.

   [421] peritta an heie, kai malista eiper echoien antilogian te ton
   loipon euangeliston marturia. (Mai, Bibl. P.P. Nova, vol. iv. p. 256.)

   [422] Alford's N. T. vol. i. p. 433, (ed. 1868.)--And so Tischendorf,
   (ed. 8va. pp. 406-7.) "Talem dissentionem ad Marci librum tam misere
   mutilandum adduxisse quempiam, et quidem tanto cum successu, prorsus
   incredible est, nec ullo probari potest exemplo."--Tregelles is of the
   same opinion. (Printed Text, pp. 255-6.)--Matthaei, a competent judge,
   seems to have thought differently. "Una autem causa cur hic locus
   omitteretur fuit quod Marcus in his repugnare ceteris videtur
   Evangelistis." The general observation which follows is true
   enough:--"Quae ergo vel obscura, vel repugnantia, vel parum decora
   quorundam opinione habebantur, ea olim ab Criticis et interpretibus
   nonnullis vel sublata, vel in dubium vocata esse, ex allis locis
   sanctorum Evangeliorum intelligitur." (Nov. Test. 1788, vol. ii. p.
   266.) Presently, (at p. 270,)--"In summÃ¢. Videtur unus et item alter ex
   interpretibus, qui haec caeteris evangeliis repugnare opinebatur, in
   dubium vocasse. Hunc deinde plures temere secuti sunt, ut plerumque
   factum esse animadvertimus." Dr. Davidson says the same thing (ii.
   116.) and, (what is of vastly more importance,) Mr. Scrivener also.
   (Coll. Cod. Sin. p. xliv.)

   [423] I have to acknowledge very gratefully the obliging attentions of
   M. de Wailly, the chief of the Manuscript department.

   [424] See above, p. 224.

   [425] Whereas in the course of S. Matthew's Gospel, only two examples
   of + teloc + occur, (viz. at ch. xxvi. 35 and xxvii. 2,)--in the former
   case the note has entirely lost its way in the process of
   transcription; standing where it has no business to appear. No
   Liturgical section ends thereabouts. I suspect that the transition
   (huperbasis) anciently made at ver. 39, was the thing to which the
   scribe desired to call attention.

   [426] = Coisl. 20. This sumptuous MS., which has not been adapted for
   Church purposes, appears to me to be the work of the same scribe who
   produced Reg. 178, (the codex described above); but it exhibits a
   different text. Bound up with it are some leaves of the LXX of about
   the viii^th century.

   [427] End of the Lection for the Sunday before Epiphany.

   [428] In S. Matthew's Gospel, I could find teloc so written only
   twice,--viz. at ch. ii. 23 and xxvi. 75: in S. Luke only once,--viz. at
   ch. viii. 39. These, in all three instances, are the concluding verses
   of famous Lessons,--viz. the Sunday after Christmas Day, the iii^rd
   Gospel of the Passion, the vi^th Sunday of S. Luke.

   [429] This has already come before us in a different connection: (see
   p. 119): but it must needs be reproduced here; and this time, it shall
   be exhibited as faithfully as my notes permit.

   [430] (1.) In Evan. 282 (written A.D. 1176),--a codex which has been
   adapted to Lectionary purposes,--the sign and , strange to say, is
   inserted into the body of the Text, only at S. Mark xv. 47 and xvi. 8.
   (2) Evan. 208, (a truly superb MS., evidently left unfinished, the
   pictures of the Evangelists only sketched in ink,) was never prepared
   for Lectionary purposes; which makes it the more remarkable that,
   between ephothounto gar and anastas, should be found inserted into the
   body of the text, te. in gold. (3) I have often met with copies of S.
   Matthew's, or of S. Luke's, or of S. John's Gospel, unfurnished with a
   subscription in which telos occurs: but scarcely ever have I seen an
   instance of a Codex where the Gospel according to S. Mark was one of
   two, or of three from which it was wanting; much less where it stood
   alone in that respect. On the other hand, in the following
   Codices,--Evan. 10: 22: 30: 293,--S. Mark's is the only Gospel of the
   Four which is furnished with the subscription, + telos tou kata Markon
   euangeliou Â·:Â· or simply + telos + . . . . In Evan. 282, S. Matthew's
   Gospel shares this peculiarity with S. Mark's.

   [433] The English reader will follow the text with sufficient exactness
   if he will refer back, and read from the last line of p. 44 to the
   ninth line of p. 45; taking care to see, in two places, for "the
   end,"--"THE END" . . . . The entire context of the Greek is given in
   the Appendix (B).

   greater part of the Greek copies had not the verses in
   question."--Printed Text, p. 247.

   [436] Observe, the peculiarity of the expression in this place of
   Eusebius consists entirely In his introduction of the words to telos.
   Had he merely said akribe ton antigraphon to euangelion kata Markon
   perigraphei en tois logois k.t.l. . . . . En touto gar schedon en
   hapasi tois anrgraphois perigegraptai to kata Markon euangelion,--there
   would have been nothing extraordinary in the mode of expression. We
   should have been reminded of such places as the following in the
   writings of Eusebius himself:--Ho Klemes . . . eis ten Komodou teleuten
   perigraphei tous chronous, (Hist. Eccl. lib. vi. c. 6.)--Hippolutos
   . . . epi to proton etos autokratoros Alexandrou tous chronous
   perigraphei, (Ibid. c. 22. See the note of Valesius on the place.)--Or
   this, referred to by Stephanus (in voce),--Henos d' eti mnestheis
   perigrapso ton logon, (Praep. Evang. lib. vi. c. 10, [p. 280 c, ed.
   1628].) But the substitution of to telos for to euangelion wants
   explaining; and can be only satisfactorily explained in one way.

   [437] See above, p. 66 and p. 67.

   [438] Pareimi nun . . . pros to telei ton auton pantote tois pasi
   zetoumena [sic].--Mai, vol. iv. p. 255.

   [439] "Consentit autem nobis ad tractatum quem fecimus de scripturÃ¢
   Marci."--Origen. (Opp. iii. 929 B.) Tractat. xxxv. in Matth. [I owe the
   reference to Cave (i. 118.) It seems to have escaped the vigilance of
   Huet.]--This serves to explain why Victor of Antioch's Catena on S.
   Mark was sometimes anciently attributed to Origen: as in Paris Cod.
   703, [olim 2330, 958, and 1048: also 18.] where is read (at fol. 247),
   Origenous prologos eis ten hermeneian tou kata Markon euangeliou. Note,
   that Reg. 937 is but a (xvi^th cent.) counterpart of the preceding;
   which has been transcribed [xviii^th cent.] in Par. Suppl. Grace. 40.
   Possevinus [Apparat. Sac. ii. 542,] (quoted by Huet, Origeniana, p.
   274) states that there is in the Library of C. C. C., Oxford, a
   Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel by Origen. The source of this
   misstatement has been acutely pointed out. to me by the Rev. W. R.
   Churton. James, in his "Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrig.," (1600, lib. i. p.
   49,) mentions "Homiliae Origenis super Evangelio Marcae, Stabat ad
   monumentum."--.Read instead, (with Rev. H. O. Coxe, "Cat. Codd. MSS. C.
   C. C.;" [N^o. 142, 4,]) as follows:--"Origenis presb. Hom. in istud
   Johannis, Maria stabat ad monumentum," &c. But what actually led
   Possevinus astray, I perceive, was James's consummation of his own
   blunder in lib. ii. p. 49,--which Possevinus has simply appropriated.

   [440] So Chrysostom, speaking of the reading Bethabara. Origen (iv.
   140) says that not only schedon en pasi tois antigraphois, but also
   that apud Heracleonem, (who wrote within 50 years of S. John's death,)
   he found Bethania written in S. John i. 28. Moved by geographical
   considerations, however, (as he explains,) for Bethania, Origen
   proposes to read Bethabara.--Chrysostom (viii. 96 D), after noticing
   the former reading, declares,--hosa de ton antigraphon akribesteron
   echei en Bethabara phesin: but he goes on to reproduce Origen's
   reasoning;--thereby betraying himself.--The author of the Catena in
   Matth. (Cramer, i. 190-1) simply reproduces Chrysostom:--chre de
   ginoskein hoti ta akribe ton antigraphon en Bethabara periechei. And
   so, other Scholia; until at last what was only due to the mistaken
   assiduity of Origen, became generally received as the reading of the
   "more accurate copies." A scholium on S. Luke xxiv. 13, in like manner,
   declares that the true reading of that place is not "60" but
   "160,"--houtos gar ta akribe periechei, kai he Horgenous tes aletheias
   bebaiosis. Accordingly, Eusebius also reads the place in the same
   erroneous way.

   [441] Jerome says of himself (Opp. vii. 537,)--"Non digne Graeca in
   Latinum transfero: aut Graecos lege (si ejusdem linguae habes
   scientiam) aut si tantum Latinus es, noli de gratuito munere judicare,
   et, ut vulgare proverbium est: equi dentes inspicere donati."

   [449] i. Accordingly, in Cod. Evan. 266 (= Paris Reg. 67) is read, at
   S. Mark xvi. 8 (fol. 126), as follows:--ephobounto gar. [then, rubro]
   telos tou B' heothinou, kai tes kuriakes ton murophoron, arche. [then
   the text:] Anastas k.t.l. . . . After ver. 20, (at fol. 126 of the same
   Codex) is found the following concluding rubric:--telos tou G'
   heothinou euangeliou. In the same place, (viz. at the end of S. Mark's
   Gospel,) is found in another Codex (Evan. 7 = Paris Reg. 71,) the
   following rubric:--telos tou tritou tou heothinou, kai tou orthrou tes
   analepseos.

   [450] R. Payne Smith's Catal. p. 146.

   [451] Cod. 27 (xi) is not provided with any lectionary apparatus, and
   is written continuously throughout: and yet at S. Mark xvi. 9 a fresh
   paragraph is observed to commence. Not dissimilar is the phenomenon
   recorded in respect of some copies of the Armenian version. "The
   Armenian, in the edition of Zohrab, separates the concluding 12 verses
   from the rest of the Gospel . . . Many of the oldest MSS., after the
   words ephobounto gar, put the final Euangelion kata Markon, and then
   give the additional verses with a new superscription." (Tregelles,
   Printed Text, p. 253). . . We are now in a position to understand the
   Armenian evidence, which has been described above, at p. 36, as well as
   to estimate its exact value.

   [452] Euseb. apud Mai, iv. p. 264 = p. 287. Again at p. 289-90.--So
   also the author of the 2nd Homily on the Resurr. (Greg. Nyss. Opp. iii.
   411-2.)--And see the third of the fragments ascribed to Polycarp.
   Patres Apostol., (ed. Jacobson) ii. p. 515.

   [453] I believe this will be found to be the invariable order of the
   Gospels in the Lectionaries.

   [454] This is the case for instance in Evan. 15 (= Reg. 64). See fol.
   98 b.

   [455] I allude of course to Matthaei's Cod. g. (See the note in his N.
   T. vol. ix. p. 228.) Whether or no the learned critic was right in his
   conjecture "aliquot folia excidisse," matters nothing. The left hand
   page ends at the words ephobounto gar. Now, if telos had followed, how
   obvious would have been the inference that the Gospel itself of S. Mark
   had come to an end there! Note, that in the Codex Bezae (D), S. Mark's
   Gospel ends at ver. 15: in the Gothic Codex Argenteus, at ver. 11. The
   Codex Vercell. (a) proves to be imperfect from ch. xv. 15; Cod. Veron.
   (b) from xiii. 24; Cod. Brix. (f) from xiv. 70.

   appeals to copies, "sometimes with telos interposed after ver. 8," (p.
   254.)--Mai (iv. 256) in the same spirit remarks,--"Codex
   Vatican-palatinus [220], ex quo Eusebium producimus, post octavum
   versum habet quidem vocem telos, ut alibi interdum observatum fuit; sed
   tamen ibidem eadem manu subecribitur incrementum cum progredientibus

CHAPTER XII.

  GENERAL REVIEW OF THE QUESTION: SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE; AND CONCLUSION OF THE
  WHOLE SUBJECT.

   This discussion narrowed to a single issue (p. 244).--That S. Mark's
   Gospel was imperfect from the very first, a thing altogether incredible
   (p. 246):--But that at some very remote period Copies have suffered
   mutilation, a supposition probable in the highest degree (p.
   248).--Consequences of this admission (p. 252).--Parting words (p.
   254.)

   THIS Inquiry has at last reached its close. The problem was fully
   explained at the outset [460] . All the known evidence has since been
   produced [461] , every Witness examined [462] . Counsel has been heard
   on both sides. A just Sentence will assuredly follow. But it may not be
   improper that I should in conclusion ask leave to direct attention to
   the single issue which has to be decided, and which has been strangely
   thrust into the background and practically kept out of sight, by those
   who have preceded me in this Investigation. The case stands simply
   thus:--

   It being freely admitted that, in the beginning of the iv^th century,
   there must have existed Copies of the Gospels in which the last chapter
   of S. Mark extended no further than ver. 8, the Question arises,--How
   is this phenomenon to be accounted for? . . . The problem is not only
   highly interesting and strictly legitimate, but it is even inevitable.
   In the immediately preceding chapter, I have endeavoured to solve it,
   and I believe in a wholly unsuspected way.

   But the most recent Editors of the text of the New Testament, declining
   to entertain so much as the possibility that certain copies of the
   second Gospel had experienced mutilation in very early times in respect
   of these Twelve concluding Verses, have chosen to occupy themselves
   rather with conjectures as to how it may have happened that S. Mark's
   Gospel was without a conclusion from the very first. Persuaded that no
   more probable account is to be given of the phenomenon than that the
   Evangelist himself put forth a Gospel which (for some unexplained
   reason) terminated abruptly at the words ephobounto gar (chap. xvi.
   8),--they have unhappily seen fit to illustrate the liveliness of this
   conviction of theirs, by presenting the world with his Gospel mutilated
   in this particular way. Practically, therefore, the question has been
   reduced to the following single issue:--Whether of the two suppositions
   which follow is the more reasonable:

   First,--That the Gospel according to S. Mark, as it left the hands of
   its inspired Author, was in this impeded or unfinished state; ending
   abruptly at (what we call now) the 8th verse of the last chapter:--of
   which solemn circumstance, at the end of eighteen centuries, Cod. B and
   Cod. ' are the alone surviving Manuscript witnesses? . . . or,

   Secondly,--That certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel having suffered
   mutilation in respect of their Twelve concluding Verses in the
   post-Apostolic age, Cod. B and Cod. ' are the only examples of MSS. so
   mutilated which are known to exist at the present day?

   I. Editors who adopt the former hypothesis, are observed (a) to sever
   the Verses in question from their context [463] :--(b) to introduce
   after ver. 8, the subscription "KATA MARKON [464] "--(c) to shut up
   verses 9-20 within brackets [465] . Regarding them as "no integral part
   of the Gospel [466] ,"--"as an authentic anonymous addition to what
   Mark himself wrote down [467] ,"--a "remarkable Fragment," "placed as a
   completion of the Gospel in very early times [468] ;"--they consider
   themselves at liberty to go on to suggest that "the Evangelist may have
   been interrupted in his work:" at any rate, that "something may have
   occurred, (as the death of S. Peter,) to cause him to leave it
   unfinished [469] ." But "the most probable supposition" (we are
   assured) "is, that the last leaf of the original Gospel was torn away
   [470] ."

   We listen with astonishment; contenting ourselves with modestly
   suggesting that surely it will be time to conjecture why S. Mark's
   Gospel was left by its Divinely inspired Author in an unfinished state,
   when the fact has been established that it probably was so left. In the
   meantime, we request to be furnished with some evidence of that fact.

   But not a particle of Evidence is forthcoming. It is not even pretended
   that any such evidence exists. Instead, we are magisterially informed
   by "the first Biblical Critic in Europe,"--(I desire to speak of him
   with gratitude and respect, but S. Mark's Gospel is a vast deal more
   precious to me than Dr. Tischendorf's reputation,)--that "a healthy
   piety reclaims against the endeavours of those who are for palming off
   as Mark's what the Evangelist is so plainly shewn [where?] to have
   known nothing at all about [471] ." In the meanwhile, it is assumed to
   be a more reasonable supposition,--(a) That S. Mark published an
   imperfect Gospel; and that the Twelve Verses with which his Gospel
   concludes were the fabrication of a subsequent age; than,--(b) That
   some ancient Scribe having with design or by accident left out these
   Twelve concluding Verses, copies of the second Gospel so mutilated
   become multiplied, and in the beginning of the iv^th century existed in
   considerable numbers.

   And yet it is notorious that very soon after the Apostolic age,
   liberties precisely of this kind were freely taken with the text of the
   New Testament. Origen (A.D. 185-254) complains of the licentious
   tampering with the Scriptures which prevailed in his day. "Men add to
   them," (he says) "or leave out,--as seems good to themselves [472] ."
   Dionysius of Corinth, yet earlier, (A.D. 168-176) remarks that it was
   no wonder his own writings were added to and taken from, seeing that
   men presumed to deprave the Word of God in the same manner [473] .
   Irenaeus, his contemporary, (living within seventy years of S. John's
   death,) complains of a corrupted Text [474] . We are able to go back
   yet half a century, and the depravations of Holy Writ become avowed and
   flagrant [475] . A competent authority has declared it "no less true to
   fact than paradoxical in sound, that the worst corruptions to which the
   New Testament has been ever subjected originated within a hundred years
   after it was composed [476] ." Above all, it is demonstrable that Cod.
   B and Cod. ' abound in unwarrantable omissions very like the present
   [477] ; omissions which only do not provoke the same amount of
   attention because they are of less moment. One such extraordinary
   depravation of the Text, in which they also stand alone among MSS. and
   to which their patrons are observed to appeal with triumphant
   complacency, has been already made the subject of distinct
   investigation. I am much mistaken if it has not been shewn in my
   VIII^th chapter, that the omission of the words en Epheso from Ephes.
   i. 1, is just as unauthorized,--quite as serious a blemish,--as the
   suppression of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.

   Now, in the face of facts like these, and in the absence of any
   Evidence whatever to prove that S. Mark's Gospel was imperfect from the
   first,--I submit that an hypothesis so violent and improbable, as well
   as so wholly uncalled for, is simply undeserving of serious attention.
   For,

   (1st.) It is plain from internal considerations that the improbability
   of the hypothesis is excessive; "the contents of these Verses being
   such as to preclude the supposition that they were the work of a
   post-Apostolic period. The very difficulties which they present afford
   the strongest presumption of their genuineness." No fabricator of a
   supplement to S. Mark's Gospel would have ventured on introducing so
   many minute seeming discrepancies: and certainly "his contemporaries
   would not have accepted and transmitted such an addition," if he had.
   It has also been shewn at great length that the Internal Evidence for
   the genuineness of these Verses is overwhelmingly strong [478] . But,

   (2nd.) Even external Evidence is not wanting. It has been acutely
   pointed out long since, that the absence of a vast assemblage of
   various Readings in this place, is, in itself, a convincing argument
   that we have here to do with no spurious appendage to the Gospel [479]
   . Were this a deservedly suspected passage, it must have shared the
   fate of all other deservedly (or undeservedly) suspected passages. It
   never could have come to pass that the various Readings which these
   Twelve Verses exhibit would be considerably fewer than those which
   attach to the last twelve verses of any of the other three Gospels.

   (3rd.) And then surely, if the original Gospel of S. Mark had been such
   an incomplete work as is feigned, the fact would have been notorious
   from the first, and. must needs have become the subject of general
   comment [480] . It may be regarded as certain that so extraordinary a
   circumstance would have been largely remarked upon by the Ancients, and
   that evidence of the fact would have survived in a hundred quarters. It
   is, I repeat, simply incredible that Tradition would have proved so
   utterly neglectful of her office as to remain quite silent on such a
   subject, if the facts had been such as are imagined. Either Papias, or
   else John the Presbyter,--Justin Martyr, or Hegesippus, or one of the
   "Seniores apud Irenaeum,"--Clemens Alexandrinus, or Tertullian, or
   Hippolytus,--if not Origen, yet at least Eusebius,--if not Eusebius,
   yet certainly Jerome,--some early Writer, I say, must certainly have
   recorded the tradition that S. Mark's Gospel, as it came from the hands
   of its inspired author, was an incomplete or unfinished work. The
   silence of the Ancients, joined to the inherent improbability of the
   conjecture,--(that silence so profound, this improbability so
   gross!)--is enough, I submit, in the entire absence of Evidence on the
   other side, to establish the very contradictory of the alternative
   which recent Critics are so strenuous in recommending to our
   acceptance.

   (4th.) But on the contrary. We have indirect yet convincing testimony
   that the oldest copies of all did contain the Verses in question [481]
   : while so far are any of the Writers just now enumerated from
   recording that these verses were absent from the early copies, that
   five out of those ten Fathers actually quote, or else refer to the
   verses in question in a way which shews that in their day they were the
   recognised termination of S. Mark's Gospel [482] .

   We consider ourselves at liberty, therefore, to turn our attention to
   the rival alternative. Our astonishment is even excessive that it
   should have been seriously expected of us that we could accept without
   Proof of any sort,--without a particle of Evidence, external, internal,
   or even traditional,--the extravagant hypothesis that S. Mark put forth
   an unfinished Gospel; when the obvious and easy alternative solicits
   us, of supposing,

   II. That, at some period subsequent to the time of the Evangelist,
   certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel suffered that mutilation in respect
   of their last Twelve Verses of which we meet with no trace whatever, no
   record of any sort, until the beginning of the fourth century.

   (i.) And the facts which now meet us on the very threshold, are in a
   manner conclusive: for if Papias and Justin Martyr [A.D. 150] do not
   refer to, yet certainly Irenaeus [A.D. 185] and Hippolytus [A.D.
   190-227] distinctly quote Six out of the Twelve suspected
   Verses,--which are also met with in the two oldest Syriac Versions, as
   well as in the old Latin Translation. Now the latest of these
   authorities is earlier by full a hundred years than the earliest record
   that the verses in question were ever absent from ancient MSS. At the
   eighth Council of Carthage, (as Cyprian relates,) [A.D. 256] Vincentius
   a Thiberi, one of the eighty-seven African Bishops there assembled,
   quoted the 17th verse in the presence of the Council.

   (ii.) Nor is this all [483] . Besides the Gothic and Egyptian versions
   in the iv^th century; besides Ambrose, Cyril of Alexandria, Jerome, and
   Augustine in the v^th, to say nothing of Codices A and C;--the
   Lectionary of the Church universal, probably from the second century of
   our Ã¦ra, is found to bestow its solemn and emphatic sanction on every
   one of these Twelve Verses. They are met with in every MS. of the
   Gospels existence, uncial and cursive,--except two [484] ; they are
   found in every Version; and are contained besides in every known
   Lectionary, where they are appointed to be read at Easter and on
   Ascension Day [485] .

   (iii.) Early in the iv^th century, however, we are encountered by a
   famous place in the writings of Eusebius [A.D. 300-340], who, (as I
   have elsewhere explained [486] ) is the only Father who delivers any
   independent testimony on this subject at all. What he says has been
   strangely misrepresented. It is simply as follows:--

   (a) One, "Marinus," is introduced quoting this part of S. Mark's Gospel
   without suspicion, and enquiring, How its opening statement is to be
   reconciled with S. Matth. xxviii. 1? Eusebius, in reply, points out
   that a man whose only object was to get rid of the difficulty, might
   adopt the expedient of saying that this last section of S. Mark's
   Gospel "is not found in all the copies:" (me en hapasi pheresthai.)
   Declining, however, to act thus presumptuously in respect of anything
   claiming to be a part of Evangelical Scripture, (oud' hotioun tolmon
   athetein ton hoposoun en te ton euangelion graphe pheromenon,)--he
   adopts the hypothesis that the text is genuine. Kai de toude tou merous
   sunchoroumenou einai alethous, he begins: and he enters at once without
   hesitation on an elaborate discussion to shew how the two places may be
   reconciled [487] . What there is in this to countenance the notion that
   in the opinion of Eusebius "the Gospel according to S. Mark originally
   terminated at the 8th verse of the last chapter,"--I profess myself
   unable to discover. I draw from his words the precisely opposite
   inference. It is not even clear to me that the Verses in dispute were
   absent from the copy which Eusebius habitually employed. He certainly
   quotes one of those verses once and again [488] . On the other hand,
   the express statement of Victor of Antioch [A. D. 450?] that he knew of
   the mutilation, but had ascertained by Critical research the
   genuineness of this Section of Scripture, and had adopted the Text of
   the authentic "Palestinian" Copy [489] ,--is more than enough to
   outweigh the faint presumption created (as some might think) by the
   words of Eusebius, that his own copy was without it. And yet, as
   already stated, there is nothing whatever to shew that Eusebius himself
   deliberately rejected the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel. Still
   less does that Father anywhere say, or even hint, that in his judgment
   the original Text of S. Mark was without them. If he may be judged by
   his words, he accepted them as genuine: for (what is at least certain)
   he argues upon their contents at great length, and apparently without
   misgiving.

   (b) It is high time however to point out that, after all, the question
   to be decided is, not what Eusebius thought on this subject, but what
   is historically probable. As a plain matter of fact, the sum of the
   Patristic Evidence against these Verses is the hypothetical suggestion
   of Eusebius already quoted; which, (after a fashion well understood by
   those who have given any attention to these studies), is observed to
   have rapidly propagated itself in the congenial soil of the v^th
   century. And even if it could be shewn that Eusebius deliberately
   rejected this portion of Scripture, (which has never been done,)--yet,
   inasmuch as it may be regarded as certain that those famous codices in
   the library of his friend Pamphilus at Caesarea, to which the ancients
   habitually referred, recognised it as genuine [490] ,--the only
   sufferer from such a conflict of evidence would surely be Eusebius
   himself: (not S. Mark, I say, but Eusebius:) who is observed to employ
   an incorrect text of Scripture on many other occasions; and must (in
   such case) be held to have been unduly partial to copies of S. Mark in
   the mutilated condition of Cod. B or Cod. '. His words were translated
   by Jerome [491] ; adopted by Hesychius [492] ; referred to by Victor
   [493] ; reproduced "with a difference" in more than one ancient
   scholion [494] . But they are found to have died away into a very faint
   echo when Euthymius Zigabenus [495] rehearsed them for the last time in
   his Commentary on the Gospels, A.D. 1116. Exaggerated and
   misunderstood, behold them resuscitated after an interval of seven
   centuries by Griesbach, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles and the rest:
   again destined to fall into a congenial, though very differently
   prepared soil; and again destined (I venture to predict) to die out and
   soon to be forgotten for ever.

   (iv.) After all that has gone before, our two oldest Codices (Cod. B
   and Cod. ') which alone witness to the truth of Eusebius' testimony as
   to the state of certain copies of the Gospels in his own day, need not
   detain us long. They are thought to be as old as the iv^th century:
   they are certainly without the concluding section of S. Mark's Gospel.
   But it may not be forgotten that both Codices alike are disfigured
   throughout by errors, interpolations and omissions without number; that
   their testimony is continually divergent; and that it often happens
   that where they both agree they are both demonstrably in error [496] .
   Moreover, it is a highly significant circumstance that the Vatican
   Codex (B), which is the more ancient of the two, exhibits a vacant
   column at the end of S. Mark's Gospel,--the only vacant column in the
   whole codex: whereby it is shewn that the Copyist was aware of the
   existence of the Twelve concluding Verses of S. Mark's Gospel, even
   though he left them out [497] : while the original Scribe of the Codex
   Sinaiticus (') is declared by Tischendorf to have actually omitted the
   concluding verse of S. John's Gospel,--in which unenviable peculiarity
   it stands alone among MSS. [498]

   (I.) And thus we are brought back to the point from which we started.
   We are reminded that the one thing to be accounted for is the mutilated
   condition of certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel in the beginning of the
   fourth century; of which, Cod. B and Cod. ' are the two solitary
   surviving specimens,--Eusebius, the one historical witness. We have to
   decide, I mean, between the evidence for this fact,--(namely, that
   within the first two centuries and a-half of our Ã¦ra, the Gospel
   according to S. Mark suffered mutilation;)--and the reasonableness of
   the other opinion, namely, that S. Mark's original autograph extended
   no farther than ch. xvi. 8. All is reduced to this one issue; and
   unless any are prepared to prove that the Twelve familiar Verses (ver.
   9 to ver. 20) with which S. Mark ends his Gospel cannot be his,--(I
   have proved on the contrary that he must needs be thought to have
   written them [499] ,)--I submit that it is simply irrational to persist
   in asseverating that the reason why those verses are not found in our
   two Codexes of the iv^th century must be because they did not exist in
   the original autograph of the Evangelist. What else is this but to set
   unsupported opinion, or rather unreasoning prejudice, before the
   historical evidence of a fact? The assumption is not only gratuitous,
   arbitrary, groundless; but it is discountenanced by the evidence of
   MSS., of Versions, of Fathers, (Versions and Fathers much older than
   the iv^th century:) is rendered in the highest degree improbable by
   every internal, every external consideration: is condemned by the
   deliberate judgment of the universal Church,--which, in its corporate
   capacity, for eighteen hundred years, in all places, has not only
   solemnly accepted the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel as
   genuine, but has even singled them out for special honour [500] .

   (II.) Let it be asked in conclusion,--(for this prolonged discussion is
   now happily at an end,)--Are any inconveniences likely to result from a
   frank and loyal admission, (in the absence of any Evidence whatever to
   the contrary,) that doubtless the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
   Gospel are just as worthy of acceptation as the rest? It might
   reasonably be supposed, from the strenuous earnestness with which the
   rejection of these Verses is generally advocated, that some
   considerations must surely be assignable why the opinion of their
   genuineness ought on no account to be entertained. Do any such reasons
   exist? Are any inconveniences whatever likely to supervene?

   No reasons whatever are assignable, I reply; neither are there any
   inconvenient consequences of any sort to be anticipated,--except indeed
   to the Critics: to whom, it must be confessed, the result proves
   damaging enough.

   It will only follow,

   (1st) That Cod. B and Cod. ' must be henceforth allowed to be in one
   more serious particular untrustworthy and erring witnesses. They have
   been convicted, in fact, of bearing false witness in respect of S. Mark
   xvi. 9-20, where their evidence had been hitherto reckoned upon with
   the most undoubting confidence.

   (2ndly) That the critical statements of recent Editors, and indeed the
   remarks of Critics generally, in respect of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, will
   have to undergo serious revision: in every important particular, will
   have to be unconditionally withdrawn.

   (3rdly) That, in all future critical editions of the New Testament,
   these "Twelve Verses" will have to be restored to their rightful
   honours: never more appearing disfigured with brackets, encumbered with
   doubts, banished from their context, or molested with notes of
   suspicion. On the contrary. A few words of caution against the
   resuscitation of what has been proved to be a "vulgar error," will have
   henceforth to be introduced in memoriam rei.

   (4thly) Lastly, men must be no longer taught to look with distrust on
   this precious part of the Deposit; and encouraged to dispute the Divine
   sayings which it contains on the plea that perhaps they may not be
   Divine, after all; for that probably the entire section is not genuine.
   They must be assured, on the contrary, that these Twelve Verses are
   wholly undistinguishable in respect of genuineness from the rest of the
   Gospel of S. Mark; and it may not be amiss to remind them the Creed
   called the "Athanasian" speaks no other language than that employed by
   the Divine Author of our Religion and Object of our Faith. The Church
   warns her children against the peril incurred by as many as wilfully
   reject the Truth, in no other language but that of the Great Head of
   the Church. No person may presume to speak disparagingly of S. Mark
   xvi. 16, any more.

   (III.) Whether,--after the foregoing exposure of a very prevalent and
   highly popular, but at the same time most calamitous
   misapprehension,--it will not become necessary for Editors of the Text
   of the New Testament to reconsider their conclusions in countless other
   places:--whether they must not be required to review their method, and
   to remodel their text throughout, now that they have been shewn the
   insecurity of the foundation on which they have so confidently builded,
   and been forced to reverse their verdict in respect of a place of
   Scripture where at least they supposed themselves impregnable;--I
   forbear at this time to inquire.

   Enough to have demonstrated, as I claim to have now
   done, that not a particle of doubt, that not an
   atom of suspicion, attaches to "the
   last Twelve Verses of the
   Gospel according to
   S. Mark."

   photograph of the last page of S. John's Gospel,--I must be allowed
   altogether to call in question the accuracy of Dr. Tischendorf's
   judgment in this particular. The utmost which can be allowed is that
   the Scribe may have possibly changed his pen, or been called away from
   his task, just before bringing the fourth Gospel to a close.

APPENDIX (A).

   On the importance of attending to Patristic Citations of Scripture.--
   The correct Text of S. Luke ii. 14, established.

   (Referred to at p. 22.)

   IN Chapter III. the importance of attending to Patristic citations of
   Scripture has been largely insisted upon. The controverted reading of
   S. Luke ii. 14 supplies an apt illustration of the position there
   maintained, viz. that this subject has not hitherto engaged nearly as
   much attention as it deserves.

   I. Instead of en anthropois eudokia, (which is the reading of the
   "Textus receptus,") Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles and Alford present
   us with en anthropois eudokias. Their authority for this reading is the
   consentient testimony of the four oldest MSS. which contain S. Luke ii.
   14 (viz. B, ', A, D): The Latin Versions generally ("in hominibus bonae
   voluntatis"); and the Gothic. Against those are to be set, Cod. A (in
   the Hymn at the end of the Psalms); all the other uncials; together
   with every known cursive MS.; and every other ancient Version in
   existence.

   So far, the evidence of mere Antiquity may be supposed to preponderate
   in favour of eudokias: though no judicious Critic, it is thought,
   should hesitate in deciding in favour of eudokia, even upon the
   evidence already adduced. The advocates of the popular Theory ask,--But
   why should the four oldest MSS., together with the Latin and the Gothic
   Versions, conspire in reading eudokias, if eudokia be right? That
   question shall be resolved by-and-by. Let them in the mean time tell
   us, if they can,--How is it credible that, in such a matter as this,
   every other MS. and every other Version in the world should read
   eudokia, if eudokia be wrong? But the evidence of Antiquity has not yet
   been nearly cited. I proceed to set it forth in detail.

   It is found then, that whereas eudokias is read by none, eudokia is
   read by all the following Fathers:--

   (1) Origen, in three places of his writings, [i. 374 D: ii. 714 B: iv.
   15 B,--A.D. 240.]

   (2) The Apostolical Constitutions, twice, [vii. 47: viii. 12 ad
   fin.,--III^rd cent.]

   (3) Methodius, [Galland. iii. 809 B,--A.D. 290.]

   (4) Eusebius, twice, [Dem. Ev. 163 c: 342 B,--A.D. 320.]

   (5) Aphraates the Persian, (for whose name [suprÃ , pp. 26-7] that of
   Jacobus of Nisibis' has been erroneously substituted), twice, [i. 180
   and 385,--A.D. 337.]

   (6) Titus of Bostra, twice, [in loc., but especially in S. Luc. xix. 29
   (Cramer, ii. 141, line 20),--A.D. 350.]

   (7) Gregory of Nazianzus, [i. 845 C,--A.D. 360.]

   (8) Cyril of Jerusalem, [A.D. 370], as will be found explained below.

   (9) Epiphanius, [i. 154 D,--A.D. 375.]

   (10) Chrysostom, four times, [vii. 311 B: 674 C: viii. 85 C: xi. 374 B
   expressly,--A.D. 400.]

   (11) Cyril of Alexandria, in three places, [Comm. on S. Luke, pp. 12
   and 16. Also Opp. ii. 593 A: vi. 398 C,--A.D. 420.]

   (12) Theodoret, [in Coloss. i. 20,--A.D. 430.]

   (13) Theodotus of Ancyra, [Galland. x. 446 B,--A.D. 430.]

   (14) Proclus, Abp. of Constantinople, [Gall, x. 629 A,--A.D. 434.]

   To which may be added the evidence of

   (15) Cosmas Indicopleustes, four times repeated, [Coll. Nov. PP.,
   (Montfaucon,) ii. 152 A, 160 D, 247 E, 269 C,--A.D. 535.]

   (16) Eulogius, Abp. of Alexandria, [Gall. xii. 308 E,--A.D. 581.]

   (17) Andreas of Crete, twice, [Gall. xiii. 100 D, 123 C,--A.D. 635.]

   Now, when it is considered that these seventeen Fathers of the Church
   [501] all concur in exhibiting the Angelic Hymn as our own Textus
   Receptus exhibits it,--(viz. en anthropois eudokia,)--who does not see
   that the four oldest uncial authorities for eudokias are hopelessly
   outvoted by authorities yet older than themselves? Here is, to all
   intents and purposes, a record of what was once found in two Codices of
   the iii^rd century; in nine of the iv^th; in three of the v^th;--added
   to the testimony of the two Syriac, the Egyptian, the Ethiopic, and the
   Armenian versions. In this instance therefore the evidence of Antiquity
   is even overwhelming.

   Most decisive of all, perhaps, is the fact this was the form in which
   the Churches of the East preserved the Angelic Hymn in their private,
   as well as their solemn public Devotions. Take it, from a document of
   the v^th century:--

   DOXA EN UPsICTOIC ThEo
   KAI EPI GEC EIRENE
   EN ANThRoPOIC EUDOKIA [502]

   But the text of this Hymn, as a Liturgical document, at a yet earlier
   period is unequivocally established by the combined testimony of the
   Apostolical Constitutions (already quoted,) and of Chrysostom, who says
   expressly:--Eucharistountes legomen, Doxa en hupsistois Theo, kai epi
   ges eirene, en anthropois eudokia. [Opp. xi. 347 B.] Now this
   incontestably proves that the Church's established way of reciting the
   Angelic Hymn in the iv^th century was in conformity with the reading of
   the Textus Receptus. And this fact infinitely outweighs the evidence of
   any extant MSS. which can be named: for it is the consentient evidence
   of hundreds,--or rather of thousands of copies of the Gospels of a date
   anterior to A.D. 400, which have long since perished.

   To insist upon this, however, is not at all my present purpose. About
   the true reading of S. Luke ii. 14, (which is not the reading of
   Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford,) there is clearly no longer
   any room for doubt. It is perhaps one of the best established readings
   in the whole compass of the New Testament. My sole object is to call
   attention to the two following facts:--

   (1) That the four oldest Codices which contain S. Luke ii. 14 (B, ', A,
   D, A.D. 320-520), and two of the oldest Versions, conspire in
   exhibiting the Angelic Hymn incorrectly.

   (2) That we are indebted to fourteen of the Fathers (A.D. 240-434), and
   to the rest of the ancient Versions, for the true reading of that
   memorable place of Scripture.

   II. Against all this, it is urged (by Tischendorf) that,--

   1. Irenaeus sides with the oldest uncials.--Now, the Greek of the place
   referred to is lost. A Latin translation is all that survives.
   According to that evidence, Irenaeus, having quoted the place in
   conformity with the Vulgate reading (iii. c. x. Â§ 41,--"Gloria in
   excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis,") presently
   adds,--"In eo quod dicunt, Gloria in altissimis Deo et in terra pax,
   eum qui sit altissimorum, hoc est, supercaelestium factor et eorum,
   quae super terram omnium conditor, his sermonibus glorificaverunt; qui
   suo plasmati, hoc est hominibus suam benignitatem salutis de caelo
   misit." (ed. Stieren, i. 459).--But it must suffice to point out (1)
   that these words really prove nothing: and (2) that it would be very
   unsafe to build upon them, even if they did; since (3) it is plain that
   the Latin translator exhibits the place in the Latin form most familiar
   to himself: (consider his substitution of "excelsis" for "altissimis.")

   2. Next, Origen is claimed on the same side, on the strength of the
   following passage in (Jerome's version of) his lost Homilies on S.
   Luke:--"Si scriptum esset, Super terram pax, et hucusque esset finita
   sententia, recto quaestio nasceretur. Nunc vero in eo quod additum est,
   hoc est, quod post pacem dicitur, In hominibus bonae voluntatis, solvit
   quaestionem. Pax enim quam non dat Dominus super terram, non est pax
   bonae voluntatis." (Opp. iii. p. 946.) "From this," (says Tischendorf,
   who is followed by Tregelles,) "it is plain that Origen regarded
   eudokias as the true reading; not eudokia--which is now thrice found in
   his Greek writings."--But,

   Is one here more struck with the unfairness of the Critic, or with the
   feebleness of his reasoning? For,--(to say nothing of the insecurity of
   building on a Latin. Translation [503] , especially in such a matter as
   the present,)--How can testimony like this be considered to outweigh
   the three distinct places in the original writings of this Father,
   where he reads not eudokias but eudokia? Again. Why is a doubt
   insinuated concerning the trustworthiness of those three places, ("ut
   nunc reperitur,") whore there really is no doubt? How is Truth ever to
   be attained if investigations like the present are to be conducted in
   the spirit of an eager partisan, instead of with the calm gravity of an
   impartial judge?

   But I may as well state plainly that the context of the passage above
   quoted chews that Tischendorf's proposed inference is inadmissible.
   Origen is supposing some one to ask the following question:--"Since
   Angels on the night when Christ was born proclaimed on earth Peace,'
   --why does our Saviour say, I am not come to send Peace upon earth, but
   a sword? . . . . Consider," (he proceeds) "whether the answer may not
   be this:"--and then comes the extract given above. Origen, (to express
   oneself with colloquial truthfulness,) is at his old tricks. He is
   evidently acquainted with the reading eudokias: and because it enables
   him to offer (what appears to him) an ingenious solution of a certain
   problem, he adopts it for the nonce: his proposal to take the words
   eirene eudokias together, being simply preposterous,--as no one ever
   knew better than Origen himself [504] .

   3. Lastly, Cyril of Jerusalem is invariably cited by the latest Critics
   as favouring the reading eudokias. Those learned persons have evidently
   overlooked the candid acknowledgment of De TouttÃ©e, Cyril's editor, (p.
   180, cf. bottom of p. 162,) that though the MSS. of Cyril exhibit
   eudokia, yet in his editorial capacity he had ventured to print
   eudokias. This therefore is one more Patristic attestation to the
   trustworthiness of the Textus Receptus in respect of S. Luke ii. 14,
   which has been hitherto unaccountably lost sight of by Critics. (May I,
   without offence, remind Editors of Scripture that instead of copying,
   they ought in every instance to verify their references?)

   III. The history of this corruption of the Text is not hard to
   discover. It is interesting and instructive also.

   In the immediately post-Apostolic age,--if not earlier still,--some
   Copyist will have omitted the en before anthropois. The resemblance of
   the letters and the similarity of the sound (EN, AN,) misled him:--

   ENANThRoPOIC

   Every one must see at a glance how easily the thing may have happened.
   (It is in fact precisely what has happened in Acts iv. 12; where, for
   en anthropois, D and a few cursive MSS. read anthropois,--being
   countenanced therein by the Latin Versions generally, and by them
   only.)

   (2.) The result however--(doxa en hupsistois Theo kai epi ges eirene
   anthropois eudokia--was obviously an impossible sentence. It could not
   be allowed to stand. And yet it was not by any means clear what had
   happened to it. In order, as it seems, to force a meaning into the
   words, some one with the best intentions will have put the sign of the
   genitive (c) at the end of eudokia. The copy so depraved was destined
   to play an important part; for it became the fontal source of the Latin
   Version, which exhibits the place thus:--Gloria in altissimis Deo, et
   in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis. . . . . It is evident, by the
   way, (if the quotation from Irenaeus, given above, is to be depended
   upon,) that Irena3us must have so read the place: (viz. eirene
   anthropois eudokias.)

   (3.) To restore the preposition (EN) which had been accidentally thrust
   out, and to obliterate the sign of the genitive (c) which had been
   without authority thrust in, was an obvious proceeding, Accordingly,
   every Greek Evangelium extant exhibits en anthropois: while all but
   four (B, ', A, D) read eudokia. In like manner, into some MSS. of the
   Vulgate (e.g. the Cod. Amiatinus,) the preposition ("in") has found its
   way back; but the genitive ("bonae voluntatis") has never been
   rectified in a single copy of the Latin version.--The Gothic represents
   a copy which exhibited en anthropois eudokias [505]

   The consequence is that .a well-nigh untranslatable expression retains
   its place in the Vulgate to the present hour. Whether (with Origen) we
   connect eudokias with eirene,--or (with the moderns) we propose to
   understand "men of good pleasure,"--the result is still the same. The
   harmony of the three-part Anthem which the Angels sang on the night of
   the Nativity is hopelessly marred, and an unintelligible discord
   substituted in its place. Logic, Divinity, Documents are here all at
   one. The reading of Stephens is unquestionably correct. The reading of
   the latest Editors is as certainly corrupt. This is a case therefore
   where the value of Patristic testimony becomes strikingly apparent. It
   affords also one more crucial proof of the essential hollowness of the
   theory on which it has been recently proposed by Lachmann, Tischendorf,
   Tregelles and the rest to reconstruct the text of the New Testament.

   To some, it may perhaps seem unreasonable that so many words should be
   devoted to the establishment of the text of a single place of
   Scripture,--depending, as that text does, on the insertion or the
   omission of a single letter. I am content to ask in reply,--What is
   important, if not the utterance of Heaven, when, at the laying of the
   corner-stone of the New Creation, "the Morning Stars sang together, and
   all the Sons of God shouted for joy?"

   IV. Only one word in conclusion.

   Whenever the time comes for the Church of England to revise her
   Authorized Version (1611), it will become necessary that she should in
   the first instance instruct some of the more judicious and learned of
   her sons carefully to revise the Greek Text of Stephens (1550). Men
   require to know precisely what it is they have to translate before they
   can pretend to translate it. As for supposing that Scholars who have
   been appointed to revise a Translation are competent at a moment's
   notice, as every fresh difficulty presents itself, to develope the
   skill requisite for revising the original Text,--it is clearly nothing
   else but supposing that experts in one Science can at pleasure shew
   themselves proficients in another.

   But it so happens that, on the present occasion, that other Science is
   one of exceeding difficulty. Revisionists here will find it necessary
   altogether to disabuse their minds of the Theory of Textual Criticism
   which is at present the dominant and the popular one,--and of which I
   have made it my business to expose the fallaciousness, in respect of
   several crucial texts, in the course of the present work.

   I cannot so far forget the unhappy circumstances of the times as to
   close this note without the further suggestion, (sure therein of the
   approval of our trans-Atlantic brethren,) that, for a Revision of the
   Authorized Version to enjoy the confidence of the Nation, and to
   procure for itself acceptance at the hands of the Church,--it will be
   found necessary that the work should be confided to Churchmen. The
   Church may never abdicate her function of being "a Witness and a Keeper
   of Holy Writ." Neither can she, without flagrant inconsistency and
   scandalous consequence, ally herself in the work of Revision with the
   Sects. Least of all may she associate with herself in the sacred
   undertaking an Unitarian Teacher,--one who avowedly [see the letter of
   "One of the Revisionists, G. V. S.," in the "Times" of July 11, 1870]
   denies the eternal Godhead of her Lord. That the individual alluded to
   has shewn any peculiar aptitude for the work of a Revisionist; or that
   he is a famous Scholar; or that he can boast of acquaintance with any
   of the less familiar departments of Sacred Learning; is not even
   pretended. (It would matter nothing if the reverse were the case.) What
   else, then, is this but to offer a deliberate insult to the Majesty of
   Heaven in the Divine Person of Him who is alike the Object of the
   Everlasting Gospel, and its Author?

   [507] P.S. I avail myself of this blank space to introduce a passage
   from Theophylact (A.D. 1077) which should have obtained notice in a
   much earlier page:--Anastas de ho Iesous; entautha stixon, eita eipe;

   that Theophylact also,--like Victor, Jerome, and Hesychius,--is here
   only reproducing Eusebius. See above, p. 66, note (c).

   Proof that HESYCHIUS is a copyist only in what he says concerning the
   end of S. Mark's Gospel.

   (Referred to at pp. 57-58.)

   Â§ 1. IT was confidently stated above (at p. 58) that Hesychius,
   discussing the consistency of S. Matthew's opse ton sabbaton (chap.
   xxviii. 1), with the proi of S. Mark (chap. xvi. 9), is a copyist only;
   and that he copies from the "QuÃ¦stiones ad Marinum" of Eusebius. The
   proof of that statement is subjoined. It should perhaps be explained
   that the extracts in the right-hand column have been dislocated in
   order to shew their close resemblance to what is set down in the
   left-hand column from Eusebius

   (Eusebius.) (Hesychius, or Severus.)

     __________________________________________________________________

APPENDIX (D).

   Some account of Victor of Antioch's Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel;
   together with an enumeration of MSS. which contain Victor's Work.

   (Referred to at p. 60.)

   "APRÃS avoir examinÃ© avec soin les MSS. de la BibliothÃ¨que du Roi,"
   (says the PÃ¨re Simon in his Hist. Crit. du N.T. p. 79,) "j'ai rÃ©connu
   que cet ouvrage" (he is speaking of the Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel
   popularly ascribed to Victor of Antioch,) "n'est ni d'OrigÃ©ne, ni de
   Victor d'Antioche, ni de Cyrille, ni d'aucun autre auteur en
   particulier. C'est un recueil de plusieurs PÃ¨res, dont on a marquÃ© les
   nom dans quelques exemplaires; et si ces noms ne se trouveut point dans
   d'autres, cela est assez ordinaire Ã  ces recueils, qu'on appelle
   chaÃ®nes [508] ." It will be seen from the notices of the work in
   question already offered, (suprÃ , p. 59 to p. 65,) that I am able to
   yield only a limited acquiescence in this learned writer's verdict.
   That the materials out of which Victor of Antioch constructed his
   Commentary are scarcely ever original,--is what no one will deny who
   examines the work with attention. But the Author of a compilation is an
   Author still; and to put Victor's claim to the work before us on a
   level with that of Origen or of Cyril, is entirely to misrepresent the
   case and hopelessly to perplex the question.

   Concerning Victor himself, nothing whatever is known except that he was
   "a presbyter of Antioch." Concerning his Work, I will not here repeat
   what I have already stated elsewhere; but, requesting the Reader to
   refer to what was remarked at pp. 59 to 65, I propose to offer a few
   observations with which I was unwilling before to encumber the text;
   holding it to be a species of duty for those who have given any time
   and attention to a subject like the present to contribute the result,
   (however slender and unsatisfactory it may prove,) to the common store.
   Let abler men enlarge the ensuing scanty notices, and correct me if in
   any respect I shall have inadvertently fallen into error.

   1. There exists a Commentary, then, on S. Mark's Gospel, which
   generally claims on its front "Victor, Presbyter of Antioch," for its
   Author [509] . A Latin translation of this work, (not the original
   Greek,) was, in the first instance, published at Ingolstadt in 1580
   [510] , by Theodore Peltanus. His Latin version found its way at once
   into "BibliothecÃ¦," (or Collections of Writings of the Fathers,) and
   has been again and again reprinted.

   2. The Greek text of Victor was first published at Rome by Peter
   Possinus in 1673, from a MS. existing somewhere in Germany; which
   Bathazar Corderius had transcribed and presented to Possinus about
   thirty years before. Corderius gave Possinus at the same time his
   transcript of an anonymous Commentary on S. Mark preserved in the
   Vatican; and Possinus had already in his possession the transcript of a
   third Commentary on the same Evangelist (also anonymous) which he had
   obtained from the Library of Charles de Montchal, Abp. of Toulouse.
   These three transcripts Possinus published in a well-known volume. It
   is to be wished that he had kept them distinct, instead of to some
   extent blending their contents confusedly into one [511] . Still, the
   dislocated paragraphs of Victor of Antioch are recognisable by the name
   of their author ("Victor Antiochenus") prefixed to each: while
   "Tolosanus" designates the Toulouse MS.: "Vaticanus" (or simply
   "Anonymus") the Vatican.

   3. At the end of another century, (1775) C. F. Matthaei put forth at
   Moscow, with his usual skill and accuracy, a new and independent
   Edition of Victor's Commentary [512] : the text of which is based on
   four of the Moscow MSS. This work, which appeared in two parts, has
   become of extraordinary rarity. I have only just ascertained (June,
   1871,) that one entire Copy is preserved in this country.

   4. Lastly, (in 1840,) Dr. J. A. Cramer, in the first volume of his
   Catenae on the N. T., reproduced Victor's work from independent MS.
   sources. He took for his basis two Codices in the Paris Library, (No.
   186 and No. 188), which, however, prove to have been anciently so
   exactly assimilated the one to the other [infrÃ , p. 279] as to be, in
   fact, but duplicates of one and the same original. Cramer supplemented
   their contents from Laud. Gr. 33, (in the Bodleian:) Coisl. 23: and
   Reg. 178 at Paris. The result has been by far the fullest and most
   satisfactory exhibition of the Commentary of Victor of Antioch which
   has hitherto appeared. Only is it to be regretted that the work should
   have been suffered to comb abroad disfigured in every page with errors
   so gross as to be even scandalous, and with traces of slovenly
   editorship which are simply unintelligible. I cannot bring myself to
   believe that Dr. Cramer ever inspected the MSS. in the Paris Library in
   person. Else would the slender advantage which those abundant materials
   have proved to so learned and accomplished. a scholar, be altogether
   unaccountable. Moreover, he is incorrect in what he says about them
   [513] : while his reasons for proposing to assign the work of Victor of
   Antioch to Cyril of Alexandria are undeserving of serious attention.

   On a comparison of these four Editions of the same work, it is
   discovered that the Latin version of Peltanus (1580), represents the
   same Greek text which Possinus gave to the world in 1673. Peltanus
   translates very loosely; in fact he paraphrases rather than translates
   his author, and confesses that he has taken great liberties with
   Victor's text. But I believe it will be found that there can have been
   no considerable discrepancy between the MS. which Peltanus employed,
   and that which Possinus afterwards published.--Not so the text which
   Matthaei edited, which is in fact for the most part, (though not
   invariably,) rather an Epitome of Victor's Commentary. On the other
   hand, Cramer's text is more full than that of Possinus. There seem to
   be only a few lines in Possinus, here and there, which are not to be
   met with in Cramer; whereas no less than twenty-eight of Cramer's pages
   are not found in the work of Possinus. Cramer's edition, therefore, is
   by far the most complete which has hitherto appeared. And though it
   cries aloud for revision throughout; though many important corrections
   might easily be introduced into it, and the whole brought back in
   countless particulars more nearly to the state in which it is plain
   that Victor originally left it;--1 question whether more than a few
   pages of additional matter could easily be anywhere recovered. I
   collated several pages of Cramer (Oct. 1869) with every MS. of Victor
   in the Paris Library; and. all but invariably found that Cramer's text
   was fuller than that of the MS. which lay before me. Seldom indeed did
   I meet with a few lines in any MS. which had not already seen the light
   in Cramer's edition. One or other of the four Codices which he employed
   seems to fill up almost every hiatus which is met with in any of the
   MSS. of this Father.

   For it must be stated, once for all, that an immense, and I must add, a
   most unaccountable discrepancy is observable between the several extant
   copies of Victor: yet not so much in respect of various readings, or
   serious modifications of his text; (though the transpositions are very
   frequent, and often very mischievous [514] ;) as resulting from the
   boundless license which every fresh copyist seems to have allowed
   himself chiefly in abridging his author.--To skip a few lines: to omit
   an explanatory paragraph, quotation, or digression: to pass per saltum
   from the beginning to the end of a passage: sometimes to leave out a
   whole page: to transpose: to paraphrase: to begin or to end with quite
   a different form of words;--proves to have been the rule. Two copyists
   engaged on the same portion of Commentary are observed to abridge it in
   two quite different ways. I question whether there exist in Europe
   three manuscripts of Victor which correspond entirely throughout. The
   result is perplexing in a high degree. Not unfrequently (as might be
   expected) we are presented with two or even three different exhibitions
   of one and the same annotation [515] . Meanwhile, as if to render the
   work of collation (in a manner) impossible,--(1) Peltanus pleads guilty
   to having transposed and otherwise taken liberties with the text he
   translated: (2) Possinus confessedly welded three codices into one: (3)
   Matthaei pieced and patched his edition out of four MSS.; and (4)
   Cramer, out of five.

   The only excuse I can invent for this strange licentiousness on the
   part of Victor's ancient transcribers is this:--They must have known
   perfectly well, (in fact it is obvious,) that the work before them was
   really little else but a compilation; and that Victor had already
   abridged in the same merciless way the writings of the Fathers
   (Chrysostom chiefly) from whom he obtained his materials. We are to
   remember also, I suppose, the labour which transcription involved, and
   the costliness of the skins out of which ancient books were
   manufactured. But when all has been said, I must candidly admit that
   the extent of license which the ancients evidently allowed themselves
   quite perplexes me [516] . Why, for example, remodel the structure of a
   sentence and needlessly vary its phraseology? Never I think in my life
   have I been more hopelessly confused than in the BibliothÃ¨que, while
   attempting to collate certain copies of Victor of Antioch.

   I dismiss this feature of the case by saying that if any person desires
   a sample of the process I have been describing, he cannot do better
   than bestow a little attention on the "Preface" (hupothesis) at the
   beginning of Victor's Commentary. It consists of thirty-eight lines in
   Cramer's edition: of which Possinus omits eleven; and Matthaei also,
   eleven;--but not the same eleven. On the other hand, Matthaei [517]
   prolongs the Preface by eight lines. Strange to relate, the MS. from
   which Cramer professes to publish, goes on differently. If I may depend
   on my hasty pencilling, after ekklesiais. [Cramer, p. 264, line 16,]
   Evan. 300, [= Reg. 186, fol. 93, line 16 from bottom] proceeds,--Klemes
   en hekto ton hupotuposeon (thirty-one lines, ending) charakter egeneto.

   On referring to the work of Possinus, "Anonymus Vaticanus" is found to
   exhibit so admirable a condensation (?) of the hupothesis in question,
   that it is difficult to divest oneself of the suspicion that it must
   needs be an original and independent composition; the germ out of which
   the longer Preface has grown . . . . We inspect the first few pages of
   the Commentary, and nothing but perplexity awaits us at every step. It
   is not till we have turned over a few pages that we begin to find
   something like exact correspondence.

   As for the Work,--(for I must now divest myself of the perplexing
   recollections which the hurried collation of so many MSS. left behind;
   and plainly state that, in spite of all, I yet distinctly ascertained,
   and am fully persuaded that the original work was one,--the production,
   no doubt, of "Victor, Presbyter of Antioch," as 19 out of the 52 MSS.
   declare):--For the Commentary itself, I say, Victor explains at the
   outset what his method had been. Having failed to discover any separate
   exposition of S. Mark's Gospel, he had determined to construct one, by
   collecting the occasional notices scattered up and down the writings of
   Fathers of the Church [518] . Accordingly, he presents us in the first
   few lines of his Commentary (p. 266) with a brief quotation from the
   work of Eusebius "to Marinus, on the seeming inconsistency of the
   Evangelical accounts of the Resurrection;" following it up with a
   passage from "the vi^th [vii^thP] tome of Origen's Exegetics on S.
   John's Gospel." We are thus presented at the outset with two of
   Victor's favorite authorities. The work of Eusebius just named he was
   evidently thoroughly familiar with [519] . I suspect that he has many
   an unsuspected quotation from its pages. Towards the end of his
   Commentary, (as already elsewhere explained,) he quotes it once and
   again.

   Of Origen also Victor was evidently very fond [520] : and his words on
   two or three occasions seem to shew that he had recourse besides
   habitually to the exegetical labours of Apolinarius, Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, and Titus of Bostra [521] . Passages from Cyril of
   Alexandria are occasionally met with [522] ; and once at least (p. 370)
   he has an extract from Basil. The historian Josephus he sometimes
   refers to by name [523] .

   But the Father to whom Victor is chiefly indebted is Chrysostom,--whom
   he styles "the blessed John, Bishop of the Royal City;" (meaning
   Constantinople [524] ). Not that Victor, strictly speaking, transcribes
   from Chrysostom; at least, to any extent. His general practice is
   slightly to adapt his Author's language to his own purpose; sometimes,
   to leave out a few words; a paragraph; half a page [525] . Then, he
   proceeds to quote another Father probably; or, it may be, to offer
   something of his own. But he seldom gives any intimation of what it is
   he does: and if it were not for the occasional introduction of the
   phrase ho men phesi or allos de sesi [526] , a reader of Victor's
   Commentary might almost mistake it for an original composition. So
   little pains does this Author take to let his reader know when he is
   speaking in his own person, when not, that he has not scrupled to
   retain Chrysostom's phrases ego de oimai [527] , &c. The result is that
   it is often impossible to know to whose sentiments we are listening. It
   cannot be too clearly borne in mind that ancient ideas concerning
   authorship differed entirely from those of modern times; especially
   when Holy Scripture was to be commented on.

   I suspect that, occasionally, copyists of Victor's work, as they
   recognised a fragment here and there, prefixed to it the name of its
   author. This would account for the extremely partial and irregular
   occurrence of such notes of authorship; as well as explain why a name
   duly prefixed in one copy is often missing in another [528] . Whether
   Victor's Commentary can in strictness be called a "Catena," or not,
   must remain uncertain until some one is found willing to undertake the
   labour of re-editing his pages; from which, by the way, I cannot but
   think that some highly interesting (if not some important) results
   would follow.

   Yet, inasmuch as Victor never, or certainly very seldom, prefixes to a
   passage from a Father the name of its Author;--above all, seeing that
   sometimes, at all events, he is original, or at least speaks in his own
   person;--I think the title of "Catena" inappropriate to his Commentary.

   As favourable and as interesting a specimen of this work as could be
   found, is supplied by his annotation on S. Mark xiv. 3. He begins as
   follows, (quoting Chrysostom, p. 436):--"One and the same woman seems
   to be spoken of by all the Evangelists. Yet is this not the case. By
   three of them one and the same seems to be spoken of; not however by S.
   John, but another famous person,--the sister of Lazarus. This is what
   is said by John, the Bishop of the Royal City.--Origen on the other
   hand says that she who, in S. Matthew and S. Mark, poured the ointment
   in the house of Simon the leper was a different person from the sinner
   whom S. Luke writes about who poured the ointment on His feet in the
   house of the Pharisee.--Apolinarius [529] and Theodorus say that all
   the Evangelists mention one and the same person; but that John
   rehearses the story more accurately than the others. It is plain,
   however, that Matthew, Mark, and John speak of the same individual; for
   they relate that Bethany was the scene of the transaction; and this is
   a village; whereas Luke [viii. 37] speaks of some one else; for,
   Behold,' (saith he) a woman in the city which was a sinner," &c., &c.

   But the most important instance by far of independent and sound
   judgment is supplied by that concluding paragraph, already quoted and
   largely remarked upon, at pp. 64-5; in which, after rehearsing all that
   had been said against the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel, Victor
   vindicates their genuineness by appealing in his own person to the best
   and the most authentic copies. The Reader is referred to Victor's Text,
   which is given below, at p. 288.

   It only remains to point out, that since Chrysostom, (whom Victor
   speaks of as ho en hagiois, [p. 408,] and ho makarios, [p. 442,]) died
   in A.D. 407, it cannot be right to quote "401" as the date of Victor's
   work. Rather would A.D. 450 be a more reasonable suggestion: seeing
   that extracts from Cyril, who lived on till A.D. 444, are found here
   and there in Victor's pages. We shall not perhaps materially err if we
   assign A.D. 430-450 as Victor of Antioch's approximate date.

   I conclude these notices of an unjustly neglected Father, by specifying
   the MSS. which contain his Work. Dry enough to ordinary readers, these
   pages will not prove uninteresting to the critical student. An
   enumeration of all the extant Codices with which I am acquainted which
   contain Victor of Antioch's Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel, follows:--

   (i.) Evan. (= Reg. 230) a most beautiful MS.

   The Commentary on S. Mark is here assigned to Victor by name; being a
   recension very like that which Matthaei has published. S. Mark's text
   is given in extenso.

   (ii.) Evan. (= Reg. 189: anciently numbered 437 and 1880. Also 134 and
   135. At back, 1603.) A grand folio, well-bound and splendidly written.
   Pictures of the Evangelists in such marvellous condition that the very
   tools employed by a scribe might be reproduced. The ground gilded.
   Headings, &c. and words from Scripture all in gold.

   Here also the Commentary on B. Mark's Gospel is assigned to Victor. The
   differences between this text and that of Cramer (e.g. at fol. 320-3,
   370,) are hopelessly numerous and complicated. There seem to have been
   extraordinary liberties taken with the text of this copy throughout.

   (iii.) Evan. 20 (= Reg. 188: anciently numbered 1883.) A splendid
   folio,--the work of several hands and beautifully written.

   Victor's Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel is generally considered to be
   claimed for Cyril of Alexandria by the following words:

   UPOThECIC EIC TO KATA MARKON AGION EUAGGELION
   EK TEC EIC AUTON EPMENEIAC TOU EN AGIOIC
   KURILLOU ALEXANDREIAC.

   The correspondence between Evan. 20 and Evan. 300 [infrÃ , N^o. xiv], (=
   Reg. 188 and 186), is extraordinary [530] . In S. Mark's Gospel, (which
   alone I examined,) every page begins with the same syllable, both of
   Text and Commentary: (i.e. Reg. 186, fol. 94 to 197 = Reg.188, fol. 87
   to 140). Not that the number of words and letters in every line
   corresponds: but the discrepancy is compensated for by a blank at the
   end of each column, and at the foot of each page. Evan. 20 and Evan.
   300 seem, therefore, in some mysterious way referable to a common
   original. The sacred Text of these two MSS., originally very
   dissimilar, has been made identical throughout; some very ancient (the
   original?) possessor of Reg. 188 having carefully assimilated the
   readings of his MS. to those of Reg. 186, the more roughly written
   copy; which therefore, in the judgment of the possessor of Reg. 188,
   exhibits the purer text. But how then does it happen that in both
   Codices alike, each of the Gospels (except S. Matthew's Gospel in Reg.
   188,) ends with the attestation that it has been collated with approved
   copies? Are we to suppose that the colophon in question was added after
   the one text had been assimilated to the other? This is a subject which
   well deserves attention. The reader is reminded that these two Codices
   have already come before us at pp. 118-9,--where see the notes.

   I proceed to set down some of the discrepancies between the texts of
   these two MSS.: in every one of which, Reg. 188 has been made
   conformable to Reg. 186:--

   (Cod. Reg. 186.) (Cod. Reg. 188.)
   (1) Matth. xxvi. 70. auton legon auton panton legon
   (2) Mk. i. 2. hos kathos
   (3)  "  11. o soi

   (4)  "  16. balontas amphiblestron

   amphibalontas amphiblestron

   (5) Mk. ii. 21. palaio; ei de me ge hairei ap' autou to pleroma

   palaio; ei de me, airei to pleroma autou
   (6)  "  iii. 10. etherapeuen etherapeusen
   (7)  "  iii. 17. tou Iakobou Iakobou
   (8)  "  iii. 18. kai Matthaion kai Th. kai M. ton telonen kai Th.
   (9)  "  vi. 9. me endusesthe endedusthai
   (10) "  vi. 10. menete meinate

   In the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th of these instances, Tischendorf is found
   (1869) to adopt the readings of Reg. 188: in the last four, those of
   Reg. 186. In the 1st, 4th, and 5th, he follows neither.

   (iv.) Evan. 24 (= Reg. 178.) A most beautifully written fol.

   Note, that this Codex has been mutilated at p. 70-1; from S. Matth.
   xxvii. 20 to S. Mark iv. 22 being away. It cannot therefore be
   ascertained whether the Commentary on S. Mark was here attributed to
   Victor or not. Cramer employed it largely in his edition of Victor
   (Catenae, vol. i. p. xxix,), as I have explained already at p. 271.
   Some notices of the present Codex are given above at p. 228-9.

   (v.) Evan. 25 (= Reg. 191: anciently numbered Colb. 2259: 1880. Folio:
   grandly written.

   3 )

   No Author's name to the Commentary on S. Mark. The text of the
   Evangelist is given in extenso.

   (vi.) Evan. 34 (= Coisl. 195.) A grand folio, splendidly written, and
   in splendid condition: the paintings as they came from the hand of the
   artist.

   At fol. 172, the Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for Victor. It will
   be found that Coisl. 23 (infrÃ , N^o. ix.) and Coisl. 195 are derived
   from a common original; but Cod. 195 is the more perfect copy, and
   should have been employed by Cramer in preference to the other (suprÃ ,
   p. 271.) There has been an older and a more recent hand employed on the
   Commentary.

   (vii.) Evan. 36 (= Coisl. 20.) A truly sumptuous Codex.

   Some notices of this Codex have been given already, at p. 229. The
   Commentary on S. Mark is Victor's, but is without any Author's name.

   (viii.) Evan. 37 (= Coisl. 21.) Fol.

   The Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for Victor at fol. 117. It seems
   to be very much the same recension which is exhibited by Coisl. 19
   (infrÃ , N^o. xviii.) and Coisl. 24 (infrÃ , N^o. xi.) The Text is given
   in extenso: the Commentary, in the margin.

   (ix.) Evan. 39 (= Coisl. 23.) A grand large fol. The writing singularly
   abbreviated.

   The Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for Victor: but is very dissimilar
   in its text from that which forms the basis of Cramer's editions. (See
   above, on N^o. vi.) It is Cramer's "P." (See his Catenae, vol. i. p.
   xxviii; and vide supra, p. 271.)

   (x.) Evan. 40 (= Coisl. 22.)

   No Author's name is prefixed to the Commentary (fol. 103); which is a
   recension resembling Matthaei's. The Text is in extenso: the
   Commentary, in the margin.

   (xi.) Evan. 41 (= Coisl. 24.) Fol.

   This is a Commentary, not a Text. It is expressly claimed for Victor.
   The recension seems to approximate to that published by Matthaei. (See
   on N^o. viii.) One leaf is missing. (See fol. 136 b.)

   (xii.) Evan. 50 (=Bodl. Laud. Graec. 33.) 4to. The Commentary here
   seems to be claimed for Cyril of Alexandria, but in the same
   unsatisfactory way as N^o. iii and xiv. (See Coxe's Cat. i. 516.)

   (xiii.) Evan. 299 (= Reg. 177: anciently numbered 2242^3).

   The Commentary on S. Mark is Victor's, but is without any Author's
   name. The Text of S. Mark is given in extenso: Victor's Commentary, in
   the margin.

   (xiv.) Evan. 300 (= Reg. 186: anciently numbered 692, 750, and 1882.) A
   noble Codex: but the work of different scribes. It is most beautifully
   written.

   At fol. 94, the Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for Cyril of
   Alexandria, in the same equivocal manner as above in N^o. iii and xii.
   The writer states in the colophon that he had diversely found it
   ascribed to Cyril and to Victor. (eplerothe sun Theo he hermeneia tou
   kata Markon hagiou euangeliou apo phones, en tisin heuron Kurillou
   Alexandreos, en allois de Biktoros presbuterou.)

   See above, the note on Evan. 20 (N^o. iii),--a MS. which, as already
   explained, has been elaborately assimilated to the present.

   (xv.) Evan. 301 (= Reg. 187: anciently numbered 504, 537 and 1879.) A
   splendid fol. beautifully written throughout.

   The Commentary on S. Mark is here claimed for Victor.

   (xvi.) Evan. 309 (= Reg. 201: anciently numbered 176 and 2423.) A very
   interesting little fol.: very peculiar in its style. Drawings old and
   curious. Beautifully written.

   The Commentary is here claimed for Victor. This is not properly a text
   of the Gospel; but parts of the text interwoven with the Commentary.
   Take a specimen [531] : (S. Mark xvi. 8-20.)

   Kai exelthousai ephugon apo tou mnemeiou. eichen de athtac tromoc kai
   ekstasic. eoc dia ton epakolouthounton semeion.

   Over the text is written

   M
   KEI

   (keimenon i.e. Text) and over the Commentary

   M
   EP

   (hermeneia, i.e. Interpretation.) See the next.

   (xvii.) Evan. 312 (= Reg. 206: anciently numbered 968, 1058, 2283; and
   behind, 1604. Also A. 67.) A beautiful little fol.

   Contains only the Commentary, which is expressly assigned to Victor.
   This Copy of Victor's Commentary is very nearly indeed a duplicate of
   Cod. 309, (N^o. xvi.) both in its contents and in its method; but it is
   less beautifully written.

   (xviii.) Evan. 329 (= Coisl. 19.) A very grand fol.

   The Commentary on S. Mark is Victor's, but is without any Author's
   name. (See above, on N^o. viii.)

   (xix.) Evan. 703, (anciently numbered 958: 1048, and Reg. 2330: also
   No. 18.) A grand large 4^to.

   The Commentary is here claimed for Origen. Such at least is probably
   the intention of the heading (in gold capital letters) of the
   Prologue:--

   ORIGENOUC PROLOGOC EIC TEN ERMENEIAN TOU
   KATA MARKON EUAGGELIOU.

   See on this subject the note at foot of p. 235.

   (xx.) Evan. 304 (= Reg. 194. Teller 1892.)

   The text of S. Mark is here interwoven with a Commentary which I do not
   recognise. But from the correspondence of a note at the end with what
   is found in Possinus, pp. 361-3, I am led to suspect that the contents
   of this MS. will be found to correspond with what Possinus published
   and designated as "Tolosanus."

   (xxi.) Evan. 77 (Vind. Ness. 114, Lambec. 29.) Victor's Commentary is
   here anonymous.

   (xxii.) Evan. 92 (which belonged to Faesch of Basle [see Wetstein's
   Proleg.], and which Haenel [p. 658 b] says is now in Basle Library).
   Wetstein's account of this Codex shows that the Commentary on S. Mark
   is here distinctly ascribed to Victor. He says,--"Continet Marcum et in
   eum Victoris Antiocheni Commentarios, foliis 5 mutilos. Item Scholia in
   Epistolas Catholicas," &c. And so Haenel.

   (xxiii.) Evan. 94 (As before, precisely; except that Haenel's
   [inaccurate] notice is at p. 657 b.) This Codex contains Victor of
   Antioch's Commentary on S. Mark, (which is evidently here also assigned
   to him by name;) and Titus of Bostra on S. Luke. Also several Scholia:
   among the rest, I suspect, (from what Haenel says), the Scholia spoken
   of suprÃ , p. 47, note (x).

   (xxiv.) In addition to the preceding, and before mentioning them,
   Haenel says there also exists in the Library at Basle,--"Victoris
   Antiocheni Scholia in Evang. Marci: chart [532] ."

   (xxv.) Evan. 108 (Vind. Forlos. 5. Koll. 4.) Birch (p. 225) refers to
   it for the Scholion given in the next article. (Append. E.)

   Evan. 129 (Vat. 358.)

   The Commentary is written along the top and bottom and down the side of
   each page; and there are references (a', b', g') inserted in the text
   to the paragraphs in the margin,--as in some of the MSS. at Paris.
   Prefixed is an exegetical apparatus by Eusebius, &c.

   Note, that of these five MSS. in the Vatican, (358, 756, 757, 1229,
   1445), the 3rd and 4th are without the prefatory section (beginning
   pollon eis to kata M.)--All 5 begin, Markos ho euangelistes. In all but
   the 4th, the second paragraph begins saphesteron.

   The third passage begins in all 5, Isodunamei touto. Any one seeking to
   understand this by a reference to the editions of Cramer or of Possinus
   will recognise the truth of what was stated above, p. 274, line 24 to
   27.

   (xxvii.) Evan. 137 (Vat. 756.) The Commentary is written as in Vat. 358
   (N^o. xxvi): but no Author's name is given.

   (xxviii.)Evan. 138 (Vat. 757.) On a blank page or fly-leaf at the
   beginning are these words:--ho antigraphos (sic) outos estin ho Petros
   ho tes Laodikeias hostis proegeitai ton allon exegeton entautha. (Comp.
   N^o. xlvii.) The Commentary and Text are not kept distinct, as in the
   preceding Codex. Both are written in an ill-looking, slovenly hand.

   (xxix.) Evan. 143 (Vat. 1,229.) The Commentary is written as in Vat.
   358 (N^o. xxvi), but without the references; and no Author's name is
   given.

   (xxx.) Evan. 181 (Xavier, Cod. Zelada.) Birch was shewn this Codex of
   the Four Gospels in the Library of Cardinal Xavier of Zelada
   (Prolegomena, p. lviii): "Cujus forma est in folio, pp. 596. In margine
   passim occurrunt scholia ex Patrum Commentariis exscripta."

   (xxxi.) Evan. 186 (Laur. vi. 18.) This Codex is minutely described by
   Bandini (Cat. i. 130), who gives the Scholion (infra, p. 388-9), and
   says that the Commentary is without any Author's name.

   (xxxii.) Evan. 194 (Laur. vi. 33.) Biktoros presbuterou Antiocheias
   hermeneia eis to kata Markon euangelion. (See the description of this
   Codex in Bandini's Cat. i. 158.)

   (xxxiii.) Evan. 195 (Laur. vi. 34.) This Codex seems to correspond in
   its contents with N^o. xxxi. suprÃ : the Commentary containing the
   Scholion, and being anonymous. (See Bandini, p. 161.)

   (xxxiv.) Evan. 197 (Laur. viii. 14.) The Commentary, (which is
   Victor's, but has no Author's name prefixed,) is defective at the end.
   (See Bandini, p. 355.)

   (xxxv.) Evan 210 (Venet. 27.) "Conveniunt initio Commentarii eum iis
   qui Victori Antiocheno tribuuntur, progressu autem discrepant."
   (Theupoli Graeca D. Marci Bibl. Codd. MSS. Venet. 1740.) I infer that
   the work is anonymous.

   (xxxvi.) Venet. 495. "Victoris Antiocheni Presbyteri expositio in
   Evangelium Marci, collecta ex diversis Patribus." (I obtain this
   reference from the Catalogue of Theupolus.)

   (xxxvii.) Evan. 215 (Venet. 544.) I presume, from the description in
   the Catalogue of Theupolus, that this Codex also contains a copy of
   Victor's Commentary.

   (xxxviii.) Evan. 221 (Vind. Ness. 117, Lambec. 38). Kollar has a long
   note (B) [iii. 157] on the Commentary, which has no Author's name
   prefixed. Birch (p. 225) refers to it for the purpose recorded under
   N^o. xxv.

   (xxxix.) Evan. 222 (Vind. Ness. 180, Lambec. 39.) The Commentary is
   anonymous. Birch refers to it, as before.

   Add the following six MSS. at Moscow, concerning which, see Matthaei's
   Nov. Test. (1788) vol. ii. p. xii.:--

   (xl.) Evan. 237 (This is Matthaei's d or D [described in his N. T. ix.
   242. Also Vict. Ant. 137.] "SS. Synod. 42:") and is one of the MSS.
   employed by Matthaei in his ed. of Victor.--The Commentary on S. Mark
   has no Author's name prefixed.

   (xli.) Evan. 238 (Matthaei's e or B [described in his N. T. ix. 200.
   Also Vict. Ant. ii. 141.] "SS. Synod. 48.") This Codex formed the basis
   of Matthaei's ed. of Victor, [See the Not. Codd. MSS. at the end of
   vol. ii. p. 123. Also N. T. ix. 202.] The Commentary on S. Mark is
   anonymous.

   (xlii.) Evan. 253 (Matthaei's 10 [described in his N. T. ix. 234.] It
   was lent him by Archbishop Nicephorus.) Matthaei says (p. 236) that it
   corresponds with a (our Evan. 259). No Author's name is prefixed to the
   Commentary on S. Mark.

   (xliii.) Evan. 255 (Matthaei's 12 [described in his N.T. ix. 222. Also
   Vict. Ant. ii. 133.] "SS. Synod. 139." The Scholia on S. Mark are here
   entitled exegetikai eklogai, and (as in 14) are few in number. For some
   unexplained reason, in his edition of Victor of Antioch, Matthaei saw
   fit to designate this MS. as "B." [N. T. ix. 224 note.] . . . . See by
   all means, infrÃ , the "Postscript."

   (xliv.) Evan. 256 (Matthaei's 14 [described in his N. T. ix. 220.]
   "Bibl. Typ. Synod. 3.") The Commentary on S. Mark is here assigned to
   Victor; presbyter of Antioch; but the Scholia are said to be (as in
   "12" [N^o. xxxix]) few in number.

   (xlv.) Evan. 259 (Matthaei's a or A [described in his N. T. ix. 237.
   Also Vict. Ant. ii. 128.] "SS. Synod. 45.") This is one of the MSS.
   employed by Matthaei in his ed. of Victor. No Author's name is prefixed
   to the Commentary.

   (xlvi.) Evan. 332 (Taurin. xx b iv. 20.) Victor's Commentary is here
   given anonymously. (See the Catalogue of Pasinus, P. i. p. 91.)

   (xlvii.) Evan. 353 (Ambros. M. 93): with the same Commentary as Evan.
   181, (i.e. N^o. xxx.)

   (xlviii.) Evan. 374 (Vat. 1445.) Written continuously in a very minute
   character. The Commentary is headed (in a later Greek hand) + hermeneia
   Petrou Laodikeias eis tous d' ag[ious] euangelistas + This is simply a
   mistake. No such Work exists: and the Commentary on the second
   Evangelist is that of Victor. (See ^No. xxviii.)

   (xlix.) Evan. 428 (Monacensis 381. Augsburg 11): said to be duplicate
   of Evan. 300 (i.e. of N^o. xiv.)

   (l.) Evan. 432 (Monacensis 99.) The Commentary contained in this Codex
   is evidently assigned to Victor.

   (li.) Evan. 7^pe (ix. 3. 471.) A valuable copy of the Four Gospels,
   dated 1062; which Edw. de Muralto (in his Catalogue of the Greek MSS.
   in the Imperial Library at Petersburg) says contains the Commentary of
   Victor Ant. (See Scrivener's Introduction, p. 178.).

   (lii.) At Toledo, in the "Biblioteca de la Iglesia Mayor," Haenel [p.
   885] mentions:--"Victor Antiochenus Comm. Graec. in iv. [?] Evangelia
   saec. xiv. membr. fol."

   To this enumeration, (which could certainly be very extensively
   increased,) will probably have to be added the following:--

   Evan. 146 (Palatine-Vat. 5.)

   Evan. 233 (Escurial U. ii. 8.)

   Evan. 373 (Vat. 1423.)

   Evan. 379 (Vat. 1769.)

   Evan. 427 (Monacensis 465, Augsburg 10.)

   Middle Hill, N^o. 13,975,--a MS. in the collection of Sir Thomas
   Phillipps.

   In conclusion, it can scarcely require to be pointed out that Victor's
   Commentary,--of which the Church in her palmiest days shewed herself so
   careful to multiply copies, and of which there survive to this hour
   such a vast number of specimens,--must needs anciently have enjoyed
   very peculiar favour. It is evident, in fact, that an Epitome of
   Chrysostom's Homilies on S. Matthew, together with Victor's compilation
   on S. Mark,--Titus of Bostra on S. Luke,--and a work in the main
   derived from Chrysostom's Homilies on S. John;--that these four
   constituted the established Commentary of ancient Christendom on the
   fourfold Gospel. Individual copyists, no doubt, will have been found
   occasionally to abridge certain of the Annotations, and to omit others:
   or else, out of the multitude of Scholia by various ancient Fathers
   which were evidently once in circulation, and must have been held in
   very high esteem,--(IrenÃ¦us, Origen, Ammonius, Eusebius, Apolinarius,
   Cyril, Chrysostom, the Gregorys, Basil, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and
   Theodore of Heraclea,) they will have introduced extracts according to
   their individual caprice. In this way, the general sameness of the
   several copies is probably to be accounted for, while their endless
   discrepancy in matters of detail is perhaps satisfactorily explained.

   These last remarks are offered in the way of partial elucidation of the
   difficulty pointed out above, at pp. 272-4.

   far shrewder conclusion.

   [514] To understand what is alluded to, the reader should compare the
   upper and the lower half of p. 442 in Cramer: noting that he has one
   and the same annotation before him; but diversely exhibited. (The lower
   part of the page is taken from Cod. 178.) Besides transposing the
   sentences, the author of Cod. 178 has suppressed the reference to
   Chrysostom, and omitted the name of Apolinarius in line 10. (Compare
   Field's ed. of Chrys. iii. 529, top of the page.)

   [515] Thus the two notes on p. 440 are found substantially to agree
   with the note on p. 441, which = Chrys. p. 627. See also infrÃ , p. 289.

   [516] Let any one, with Mai's edition of the "QuÃ¦stiones ad Marinum" of
   Eusebius before him, note how mercilessly they are abridged, mutilated,
   amputated by subsequent writers. Compare for instance p. 257 with
   Cramer's "Catenae," p. 251-2; and this again with the "Catena in
   Joannem" of Corderius, p. 448-9.

   [517] With whom, Reg. 177 and 703 agree.

   [518] p. 263, line 3 to 13, and in Possinus, p. 4.

   [519] Eusebius is again quoted at p. 444, and referred to at p. 445
   (line 23-5). See especially p. 446.

   [520] What is found at p. 314 (on S. Mark v. 1,) is a famous place.
   (Cf. Huet's ed. ii. 131.) Compare also Victor's first note on i. 7 with
   the same edit. of Origen, ii. 125 C, D, which Victor is found to have
   abridged. Compare the last note on p. 346 with Orig. i. 284 A. Note,
   that allos de phesi, (foot of p. 427) is also Origen. Cf. Possinus, p.
   324.

   [521] See pp. 408, 418, 442.

   [522] e.g. the first note on p. 311; (comp. Possinus, p. 95): and the
   last note on p. 323; (comp. Poss. p. 123.) Compare also Cramer, p. 395
   (line 16-22) with Poss. p. 249.--I observe that part of a note on p.
   315 is ascribed by Possinus (p. 102) to Athanasius: while a scholium at
   p. 321 and p. 359, has no owner.

   [523] e.g. p. 408, 411 (twice).

   [524] In p.418,--ho tes basilidos poleos episkopos Ioannes. For
   instances of quotation from Chrysostom, comp. V. A. p. 315 with Chrys.
   pp. 398-9: p.376 with Chrys. pp. 227-8: p.420 with Chrys. p. 447, &c.

   [525] Take for example Victor's Commentary on the stilling of the storm
   (pp. 312-8), which is merely an abridged version of the first part of
   Chrysostom's 28^th Homily on S. Matthew (pp. 395-8); about 46 lines
   being left out. Observe Victor's method however. Chrysostom begins as
   follows:--Ho men oun Loukas, apallatton heauton tou apaitethenai ton
   chronon ten taxin, houtos eipen. (Then follows S. Luke viii. 22.) kai
   ho Markos homoios. Houtos de ouch houtos; alla kai akolouthian entautha
   diaterei. Victor, because he had S. Mark (not S. Matthew) to comment
   upon, begins thus:--Ho men Markos apallatton heauton tou apaitethenai
   ton chronon ten taxin, houtos eipen, homoios de kai ho Loukas; ho de
   Matthaios ouch houtos; alla kai akolouthian entautha diaterei.

   [526] e.g. V. A. p. 422 (from ho men phesin to allos de phesin) =
   Chrys. p. 460. Observe the next paragraph also, (p. 423,) begins, allos
   phesin.--So again, V. A. pp. 426-7 = Chrys. pp. 473-6: where allos de
   phesin, at the foot of p.427 introduces a quotation from Origen, as
   appears from Possinus, p. 324.--See also p. 269, line 1,--which is from
   Chrys. p.130, e hos ho allos being the next words.--The first three
   lines in p. 316 = Chrys. p. 399. Then follows, allos de phesin. See
   also pp. 392: 407 (phasi tines--heteros de phesin): pp. 415 and 433.
   After quoting Eusebius by name (p.446-7), Victor says (line 3) allos de
   phesin.

   [527] e.g. V. A. p. 420 line 15, which = Chrys. p. 447.

   [528] e.g. Theod. Mops., (p. 414,) which name is absent from Cod. Reg.
   201:--Basil, (p. 370) whose name Possinus does not seem to have
   read:--Cyril's name, which Possinus found in a certain place (p. 311),
   is not mentioned in Laud. Gr. 33 fol. 100 b, at top, &c.

   [529] So in the Catena of Cordorius, in S. Joannem, p. 302.

   [530] I believe it will be found that Cod. Reg. 186 corresponds exactly
   with Cod. Reg. 188: also that the contents of Cod. Reg. 201 correspond
   with those of Cod. Reg. 206; to which last two, I believe is to be
   added Cod. Reg. 187.

   [531] Note, that this recurs at fol. 145 of a Codex at Moscow numbered
   384 in the Syr. Cat.

APPENDIX (E).

   Text of the concluding Scholion of Victor of Antioch's Commentary on S.
   Mark's Gospel; in which Victor bears emphatic testimony to the
   genuineness of "the last Twelve Verses."

   (Referred to at p. 65.)

   I HAVE thought this very remarkable specimen of the method of an
   ancient and (as I think) unjustly neglected Commentator, deserving of
   extraordinary attention. Besides presenting the reader, therefore, with
   what seems to be a fair approximation to the original text of the
   passage, I have subjoined as many various readings as have come to my
   knowledge. It is hoped that they are given with tolerable exactness;
   but I have been too often obliged to depend on printed books and the
   testimony of others. I can at least rely on the readings furnished me
   from the Vatican.

   The text chiefly followed is that of Coisl. 20, (in the Paris
   Library,--our Evan. 36;) supplemented by several other MSS., which, for
   convenience, I have arbitrarily designated by the letters of the
   alphabet as under [533] .

   Ei de kai to "Anastas [534] de proi prote sabbatou ephane proton Maria
   te Magdalene," kai ta exes epipheromena, en to kata Markon euangelio
   para [535] pleistois antigraphois ou keintai [536] , (hos netha gar
   enomisan auta tines einai [537] .) all' hemeis ex akribon antigraphon,
   hos en pleistois heurontes auta [538] , kata to Palaistinaion
   euangelion Markou, hos echei he aletheia, suntetheikamen [539] kai ten
   en auto epipheromonen despotiken anastasin, meta to "ephobounto gar
   [540] ." toutestin apo tou "anastas de proi prote sabbatou," kai kath'
   hexes mechri tou "dia` ton epakolouthou'nton semei'on. Ame'n [541] ."

   More pains than enough (it will perhaps be thought) have been taken to
   exhibit accurately this short Scholion. And yet, it has not been
   without design (the reader may be sure) that so many various readings
   have been laboriously accumulated. The result, it is thought, is
   eminently instructive, and (to the student of Ecclesiastical Antiquity)
   important also.

   For it will be perceived by the attentive reader that not more than two
   or three of the multitude of various readings afforded by this short
   Scholion can have possibly resulted from careless transcription [542] .
   The rest have been unmistakably occasioned by the merest
   licentiousness: every fresh Copyist evidently considering himself at
   liberty to take just whatever liberties he pleased with the words
   before him. To amputate, or otherwise to mutilate; to abridge; to
   amplify; to transpose; to remodel;--this has been the rule with all.
   The types (so to speak) are reducible to two, or at most to three; but
   the varieties are almost as numerous us the MSS. of Victor's work.

   And yet it is impossible to doubt that this Scholion was originally
   one, and one only. Irrecoverable perhaps, in some of its minuter
   details, as the actual text of Victor may be, it is nevertheless
   self-evident that in the main we are in possession of what he actually
   wrote on this occasion. In spite of all the needless variations
   observable in the manner of stating a certain fact, it is still
   unmistakably one and the same fact which is every time stated. It is
   invariably declared,--

   (1.) That from certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel the last Twelve
   Verses had been left out; and (2) That this had been done because their
   genuineness had been by certain persons suspected: but, (3) That the
   Writer, convinced of their genuineness, had restored them to their
   rightful place; (4) Because he had found them in accurate copies, and
   in the authentic Palestinian copy, which had supplied him with his
   exemplar.

   It is obvious to suggest that after familiarizing ourselves with this
   specimen of what proves to have been the licentious method of the
   ancient copyists in respect of the text of au early Father, we are in a
   position to approach more intelligently the Commentary of Victor
   itself; and, to some extent, to understand how it comes to pass that so
   many liberties have been taken with it throughout. The Reader is
   reminded of what has been already offered on this subject at pp. 272-3.

   [535] B begins thus,--Ei de kai to anastas de proi meta ta epipheromena

   scholion (A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V,
   W, X) begin.

   [536] So far (except in its opening phrase) E. But C, D, F, H, I, J, K,

   N, O, P, Q, T, except that they begin the sentence, emeis de.

   [539] So D, E, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, P, T: also B and Q, except that
   they prefix kai to kata to P. B is peculiar in reading,--os echei e
   aletheia Markou (transposing Markou): while C and P read,--omos emeis
   ex akribon antigraphon kai pleiston ou men alla kai en to Palaistinaio
   euangelio Markou eurontes auta os echei e aletheia suntetheikamen.

   [540] So all, apparently: except that P reads empheromenen for
   epipheromenen; and M, after anastasin inserts edelosamen, with a point
   (.) before meta: while C and P (after anastasin,) proceed,--kai ten [C,
   eita] analepsin kai kathedran ek dexion tou Patros o prepei e doxa kai
   e time nun kai eis tous aionas. amen. But J [and I think, H] (after
   gar) proceeds,--dio doxan anapempsomen to anastanti ek nekron Christo
   to Theo emon ama to anarcho Patri kai zoopoio Pneumati nun kai aei kai
   eis tous aionas ton aionon. amen.

   [541] So B. All, except B, C, H, J, P seem to end at ephobounto gar.

   [542] e.g. ouk en de for ou keintai.
     __________________________________________________________________

APPENDIX (F).

   On the Relative antiquity of the Codex Vaticanus (B), and the Codex
   Sinaiticus (').

   (Referred to at p. 70.)

   I. "Vix differt aetate a Codice Sinaitico," says Tischendorf, (ed. 8va,
   1869, p. ix,) speaking of the Codex Vaticanus (B). Yet does he
   perpetually designate his own Sinaitic Codex (') as "omnium
   antiquissimus." Now,

   (1) The (all but unique) sectional division of the Text of Codex
   B,--confessedly the oldest scheme of chapters extant, is in itself a
   striking note of primitiveness. The author of the Codex knew nothing,
   apparently, of the Eusebian method. But I venture further to suggest
   that the following peculiarities in Codex ' unmistakably indicate for
   it a later date than Codex B.

   (2) Cod. ', (like C, and other later MSS.,) is broken up into short
   paragraphs throughout. The Vatican Codex, on the contrary, has very few
   breaks indeed: e.g. it is without break of any sort from S. Matth.
   xvii. 24 to xx. 17: whereas, within the same limits, there are in Cod.
   ' as many as thirty interruptions of the context. From S. Mark xiii. 1
   to the end of the Gospel the text is absolutely continuous in Cod. B,
   except in one place: but in Cod. ' it is interrupted upwards of fifty
   times. Again: from S. Luke xvii. 11, to the end of the Gospel there is
   but one break in Cod. B. But it is broken into well nigh an hundred and
   fifty short paragraphs in Cod. '.

   There can be no doubt that the unbroken text of Codex B, (resembling
   the style of the papyrus of Hyperides published by Mr. Babington,) is
   the more ancient. The only places where it approximates to the method
   of Cod. ', is where the Commandments are briefly recited (S. Matth.
   xix. 18, &c.), and where our Lord proclaims the eight Beatitudes (S.
   Matth. v.)

   (3) Again; Cod. ' is prone to exhibit, on extraordinary occasions, a
   single word in a line, as at--

   S. Matth. xv. 30 S. Mark x. 29. S. Luke xiv. 13.
   ChoLOUC          E ADeLPhAC     PToChOUC
   TUPhLOUC         E PATeRA       ANAPEROUC
   KULLOUC          E METeRA       ChoLOUC
   KoPhOUC          E TeKNA        TUPhLOUC
                    E AGROUC

   This became a prevailing fashion in the vi^th century; e.g. when the
   Cod. Laudianus of the Acts (E) was written. The only trace of anything
   of the kind in Cod. B is at the Genealogy of our Lord.

   (4) At the commencement of every fresh paragraph, the initial letter in
   Cod. ' slightly projects into the margin,--beyond the left hand edge of
   the column; as usual in all later MSS. This characteristic is only not
   undiscoverable in Cod. B. Instances of it there are in the earlier
   Codex; but they are of exceedingly rare occurrence.

   (5) Further; Cod. ' abounds in such contractions as

   ________ _________
   ANOC,    OUNOC,

   (with all their cases), for ANThRoPOC, OURANOC, &c. Not only

   ______ ______ _____ _____ ______
   PNA,   PER,   PER,  PRA,  MRA,

   (for PNeUMA, PATER-TeR-TeRA, METeRA), but also

   ______  ______ _____
   CTRThE, IEL,   IELEM,

   for CTAURoThE, ICRAEL, IeROUCALEM.

   But Cod. B, though familiar with i?c?, and a few other of the most
   ordinary abbreviations, knows nothing of these compendia: which
   certainly cannot have existed in the earliest copies of all. Once more,
   it seems reasonable to suppose that their constant occurrence in Cod '
   indicates for that Codex a date subsequent to Cod. B.

   (6) The very discrepancy observable between these two Codices in their
   method of dealing with "the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel,"
   (already adverted to at p. 88,) is a further indication, and as it
   seems to the present writer a very striking one, that Cod. B is the
   older of the two. Cod. ' is evidently familiar with the phenomenon
   which astonishes Cod. B by its novelty and strangeness.

   (7) But the most striking feature of difference, after all, is only to
   be recognised by one who surveys the Codices themselves with attention.
   It is that general air of primitiveness in Cod. B which makes itself at
   once felt. The even symmetry of the unbroken columns;--the work of the
   prima manus everywhere vanishing through sheer antiquity;--the small,
   even, square writing, which partly recals the style of the Herculanean
   rolls; partly, the papyrus fragments of the Oration against Demosthenes
   (published by Harris in 1848):--all these notes of superior antiquity
   infallibly set Cod. B before Cod. '; though it may be impossible to
   determine whether by 50, by 75, or by 100 years.

   II. It has been conjectured by one whose words are always entitled to
   most respectful attention, that Codex Sinaiticus may have been "one of
   the fifty Codices of Holy Scripture which Eusebius prepared A.D. 331,
   by Constantine's direction, for the use of the new Capital."
   (Scrivener's Collation of the Cod. Sin., Introd. p. xxxvii-viii.)

   1. But this, which is rendered improbable by the many instances of
   grave discrepancy between its readings and those with which Eusebius
   proves to have been most familiar, is made impossible by the discovery
   that it is without S. Mark xv. 28, which constitutes the Eusebian
   Section numbered "216" in S. Mark's Gospel. [Quite in vain has
   Tischendorf perversely laboured to throw doubt on this circumstance. It
   remains altogether undeniable,--as a far less accomplished critic than
   Tischendorf may see at a glance. Tischendorf's only plea is the fact
   that in Cod. M, (he might have added and in the Codex Sinaiticus, which
   explains the phenomenon in Cod. M), against ver. 29 is set the number,
   ("216,") instead of against ver. 28. But what then? Has not the number
   demonstrably lost its place? And is there not still one of the Eusebian
   Sections missing? And which can it possibly have been, if it was not S.
   Mark xv. 28?] Again. Cod. ', (like B, C, L, U, G, and some others),
   gives the piercing of the Saviour's side at S. Matth. xxvii. 49: but if
   Eusebius had read that incident in the same place, he would have
   infallibly included S. John xix. 34, 35, with S. Matth. xxvii. 49, in
   his vii^th Canon, where matters are contained which are common to S.
   Matthew and S. John,--instead of referring S. John xix. 31-37 to his
   x^th Canon, which specifies things peculiar to each of the four
   Evangelists. Eusebius, moreover, in a certain place (Dem. Evan. x. 8
   [quoted by Tisch.]) has an allusion to the same transaction, and
   expressly says that it is recorded by S. John.

   2. No inference as to the antiquity of this Codex can be drawn from the
   Eusebian notation of Sections in the margin: that notation having been
   confessedly added at a subsequent date.

   3. On the other hand, the subdivision of Cod. ' into paragraphs, proves
   to have been made without any reference to the sectional distribution
   of Eusebius. Thus, there are in the Codex thirty distinct paragraphs
   from S. Matthew xi. 20 to xii. 34, inclusive; but there are comprised
   within the same limits only seventeen Eusebian sections. And yet, of
   those seventeen sections only nine correspond with as many paragraphs
   of the Codex Sinaiticus. This, in itself, is enough to prove that
   Eusebius knew nothing of the present Codex. His record is
   express:--eph' hekasto ton tessaron euangelion arithmos tis prokeitai
   kata meros k.t.l.

   III. The supposed resemblance of the opened volume to an Egyptian
   papyrus,--when eight columns (selides) are exhibited to the eye at
   once, side by side,--seems to be a fallacious note of high antiquity.
   If Cod. ' has four columns in a page,--Cod. B three,--Cod. A two,--Cod.
   C has only one. But Cod. C is certainly as old as Cod. A. Again, Cod.
   D, which is of the vi^th century, is written (like Cod. C) across the
   page: yet was it "copied from an older model similarly divided in
   respect to the lines or verses,"--and therefore similarly written
   across the page. It is almost obvious that the size of the skins on
   which a Codex was written will have decided whether the columns should
   be four or only three in a page.

   IV. In fine, nothing doubting the high antiquity of both Codices, (B
   and ',) I am nevertheless fully persuaded that an interval of at least
   half a century,--if not of a far greater span of years,--is absolutely
   required to account for the marked dissimilarity between them.

APPENDIX (G).

   On the so-called "Ammonian Sections" and "Eusebian Canons".

   (Referred to at p. 130.)

   I. THAT the Sections (popularly miscalled "Ammonian") with which
   Eusebius [A.D. 320] has made the world thoroughly familiar, and of
   which some account was given above (pp. 127-8), cannot be the same
   which Ammonius of Alexandria [A.D. 220] employed,--but must needs be
   the invention of Eusebius himself,--admits of demonstration. On this
   subject, external testimony is altogether insecure [543] . The only
   safe appeal is to the Sections_ themselves.

   1. The Call of the Four Apostles is described by the first three
   Evangelists, within the following limits of their respective
   Gospels:--S. Matthew iv. 18-22: S. Mark 1 16-20: S. Luke (with the
   attendant miraculous draught of fishes,) v. 1-11. Now, these three
   portions of narrative are observed to be dealt with in the sectional
   system of Eusebius after the following extraordinary fashion: (the
   fourth column represents the Gospel according to S. John):--

  (1.)                                      Â§ 29, (v. 1-3)
  (2.) Â§ 20, (iv. 17, 18) Â§ 9, (i. 14Â½-16
  (3.)                                      Â§ 30, (v. 4-7)     Â§ 219, (xxi. 1-6)
  (4.)                                      Â§ 30 (v. 4-7)      Â§ 222, (xxi. 11)
  (5.)                                      Â§ 31, (v. 8-10Â½)
  (6.)Â§ 21, (iv. 19, 20)  Â§ 10, (i. 17, 18) Â§ 32, (v. 10Â½, 11)
  (7.) Â§ 22, (iv. 21, 22) Â§ 11, (i. 19, 20)

   It will be perceived from this, that Eusebius subdivides these three
   portions of the sacred Narrative into ten Sections ("Â§Â§;")--of which
   three belong to S. Matthew, viz. Â§Â§ 20, 21, 22:--three to S. Mark, viz.
   Â§Â§ 9, 10, 11:--four to S. Luke, viz. Â§Â§ 29, 30, 31, 32: which ten
   Sections, Eusebius distributes over four of his Canons: referring three
   of them to his II^nd Canon, (which exhibits what S. Matthew, S. Mark,
   and S. Luke have in common); four of them to his VI^th Canon, (which
   shews what S. Matthew and S. Mark have in common); one, to his IX^th,
   (which contains what is common to S. Luke and S. John); two, to his
   X^th, (in which is found what is peculiar to each Evangelist.)

   Now, the design which Eusebius had in breaking up this portion of the
   sacred Text, (S. Matth. iv. 18-22, S. Mark i. 16-20, S. Luke v. 1-11,)
   after so arbitrary a fashion, into ten portions; divorcing three of
   those Sections from S. Matthew's Gospel, (viz. S. Luke's Â§Â§ 29, 30,
   31); and connecting one of these last three (Â§ 30) with two Sections
   (Â§Â§ 219, 222) of S. John;--is perfectly plain. His object was, (as he
   himself explains,) to shew--not only (a) what S. Matthew has in common
   with S. Mark and S. Luke; but also (b) what S. Luke has in common with
   S. John;--as well as (c) what S. Luke has peculiar to himself. But, in
   the work of Ammonius, as far as we know anything about that work, all
   this would have been simply impossible. (I have already described his
   "Diatessaron," at pp. 126-7.) Intent on exhibiting the Sections of the
   other Gospels which correspond with the Sections of S. Matthew,
   Ammonius would not if he could,--(and he could not if he would,)--have
   dissociated from its context S. Luke's account of the first miraculous
   draught of fishes in the beginning of our Lord's Ministry, for the
   purpose of establishing its resemblance to S. John's account of the
   second miraculous draught of fishes which took place after the
   Resurrection, and is only found in S. John's Gospel. These Sections
   therefore are "Eusebian," not Ammonian. They are necessary, according
   to the scheme of Eusebius. They are not only unnecessary and even
   meaningless, but actually impossible, in the Ammonian scheme.

   2. Let me call attention to another, and, as I think, a more convincing
   instance. I am content in fact to narrow the whole question to the
   following single issue:--Let mo be shown how it is rationally
   conceivable that Ammomus can have split up S. John xxi. 12, 13, into
   three distinct Sections; and S. John xxi. 15, 16, 17, into six? and
   yet, after so many injudicious disintegrations of the sacred Text, how
   it is credible that he can have made but one Section of S. John xxi. 18
   to 25,--which nevertheless, from its very varied contents, confessedly
   requires even repeated subdivision? . . . . Why .Eusebius did all this,
   is abundantly plain. His peculiar plan constrained him to refer the
   former half of ver. 12,--the latter half of verses 15, 16, 17--to his
   IX^th Canon, where S. Luke and S. John are brought together; (en ho hoi
   duo ta paraplesia eirekasi):--and to consign the latter half of ver.
   12,--the former half of verses 15, 16, 17,--together with the whole of
   the last eight verses of S. John's Gospel, to his X^th (or last) Canon,
   where what is peculiar to each of the four Evangelists is set down, (en
   ho peri tinon hekastos auton idios anegrapsen.) But Ammonius, because
   he confessedly recognised no such canons, was under no such constraint.
   He had in fact no such opportunity. He therefore simply cannot have
   adopted the same extraordinary sectional subdivision.

   3. To state the matter somewhat differently, and perhaps to exhibit the
   argument in a more convincing form:--The Canons of Eusebius, and the
   so-called "Ammonian Sections,"--(by which, confessedly, nothing else
   whatever is meant but the Sections of Eusebius,)--are discovered
   mutually to imply one another. Those Canons are without meaning or use
   apart from the Sections,--for the sake of which they were clearly
   invented. Those Sections, whatever convenience they may possess apart
   from the Canons, nevertheless are discovered to presuppose the Canons
   throughout: to be manifestly subsequent to them in order of time: to
   depend upon them for their very existence: in some places to be even
   unaccountable in the eccentricity of their arrangement, except when
   explained by the requirements of the Eusebian Canons. I say--That
   particular sectional subdivision, in other words, to which the epithet
   "Ammonian" is popularly applied,--(applied however without authority,
   and in fact by the merest license,)--proves on careful inspection to
   have been only capable of being devised by one who was already in
   possession of the Canons of Eusebius. In

   plain terms, they are demonstrably the work of Eusebius himself,--who
   expressly claims The Canons for his own (kanonas deka ton arithmon
   diecharaxa soi), and leaves it to be inferred that he is the Author of
   the Sections also. Wetstein (Proleg. p. 70,) and Bishop Lloyd (in the
   "Monitum" prefixed to his ed. of the Greek Test. p. x,) so understand
   the matter; and Mr. Scrivener (Introduction, p. 51) evidently inclines
   to the same opinion.

   II. I desire, in the next place, to point out that a careful inspection
   of the Eusebian "Sections," (for Eusebius himself calls them perikopai,
   not kephalaia,) leads inevitably to the inference that they are only
   rightly understood when regarded in the light of "Marginal References."
   This has been hitherto overlooked. Bp. Lloyd, in the interesting
   "Monitum" already quoted, remarks of the Eusebian Canons,--"quorum haec
   est utilitas, ut eorum scilicet ope quivis, nullo labore, Harmoniam
   sibi quatuor Evangeliorum possit conficere." The learned Prelate can
   never have made the attempt in this way "Harmoniam sibi conficere," or
   he would not have so written. He evidently did not advert to the fact
   that Eusebius refers his readers (in his III^rd Canon) from S. John's
   account of the Healing of the Nobleman's son to the account given by S.
   Matthew and S. Luke of the Healing of the Centurion's servant. It is
   perfectly plain in fact that to enable a reader "to construct for
   himself a Harmony of the Gospels," was no part of Eusebius' intention;
   and quite certain that any one who shall ever attempt to avail himself
   of the system of Sections and Canons before us with that object, will
   speedily find himself landed in hopeless confusion [544] .

   But in fact there is no danger of his making much progress in his task.
   His first discovery would probably be that S. John's weighty doctrinal
   statements concerning our Lord's Eternal Godhead in chap. i. 1-5: 9,
   10: 14, are represented as parallel with the Human Genealogy of our
   Saviour as recorded by S. Matthew i. 1-16, and by S. Luke iii.
   23-38:--the next, that the first half of the Visit of the Magi (S.
   Matthew ii. 1-6) is exhibited as corresponding with S. John vii. 41,
   42.--Two such facts ought to open the eyes of a reader of ordinary
   acuteness quite wide to the true nature of the Canons of Eusebius. They
   are Tables of Reference only.

   Eusebius has in fact himself explained his object in constructing them;
   which (he says) was twofold: (l^st) To enable a reader to see at a
   glance, "which of the Evangelists have said things of the same kind,"
   (tines ta paraplesia eirekasi: the phrase occurs four times in the
   course of his short Epistle): and (2^ndly), To enable him to find out
   where they have severally done so: (tous oikeious hekastou euangelistou
   topous, en hois kata ton auton henechthesan eipein; Eusebius uses the
   phrase twice.) But this, (as all are aware) is precisely the office of
   (what are called) "Marginal References." Accordingly,

   (a.) Whether referring from S. Matth. x. 40 (Â§ 98); S. Mark ix. 37 (Â§
   96); or S. Luke x. 16 (Â§ 116);--we find ourselves referred to the
   following six places of S. John,--v. 23: xii. 44, 45: xiii. 20: xiv.
   21: xiv. 24, 25: xv. 23 [545] (= Â§Â§ 40, 111, 120, 129, 131, 144 [546]
   .) Again,

   (b.) Whether we refer from S. Matth. xi. 27 (Â§Â§ 111, 112,) or S. Luke
   x. 22 (Â§ 119),--we find ourselves referred to the following eleven
   places of S. John,--i. 18: 35: v. 37: vi. 46: vii. 28, 29: viii. 19: x.
   15: xiii. 3: xv. 21: xvi. 15: xvii. 25 (Â§Â§ 8, 30, 44, 61, 76, 87, 90,
   114, 142, 148, 154.)

   (c.) So also, from S. Matthew's (xvi. 13-16), S. Mark's (viii. 27-29),
   and S. Luke's (ix. 18-20) account of S. Peter's Confession at CÃ¦sarea
   Philippi, we are referred to S. John i. 42, 43,--a singular reference;
   and. to S. John vi. 68, 69.

   (d.) From the mention of the last Passover by the three earlier
   Evangelists, (S. Matth. xxvi. 1, 2: S. Mark xiv. 1: S. Luke xxii. 1,)
   we are referred to S. John's mention of the first Passover (ii. 13 = Â§
   20); and of the second (vi. 4 = Â§ 48); as well as of the fourth (xi. 55
   = Â§ 96.)

   (e.) From the words of Consecration at the Last Supper, as recorded by
   S. Matth. (xxvi. 16), S. Mark (xiv. 22), and S. Luke (xxii. 19),--we
   are referred to the four following Sections of our Lord's Discourse in
   the Synagogue at Capernaum recorded by S. John, which took place a year
   before,--S. John vi. 35, 36: 48: 51: 55: (Â§Â§ 55, 63, 65, 67).

   (f.) Nothing but the spirit in which "Marginal References" are made
   would warrant a critic in linking together three incidents like the
   following,--similar, indeed, yet entirely distinct: viz. S. Matth.
   xxvii. 34: S. Mark xv. 24: and S. John xix. 28, 29.

   (g.) I was about to say that scarcely could such an excuse be invented
   for referring a Reader from S. Luke xxii. 32, to S. John xxi. 15, and
   16, and 17 Â§Â§ 227, 228, 229,)--but I perceive that the same three
   References stand in the margin of our own Bibles. Not even the margin
   of the English Bible, however, sends a Reader (as the IX^th Canon of
   Eusebius does) from our Lord's eating "broiled fish and honeycomb," in
   the presence of the ten Apostles at Jerusalem on the evening of the
   first Easter-Day, (S. Luke xxiv. 41-43 (= Â§ 341,)) to His feeding the
   seven Apostles with bread and fish at the Sea of Galilee many days
   after. (S. John xxi. 9, 10: 12: 13 = Â§Â§ 221, 223, 224.)--And this may
   suffice.

   It is at all events certain that the correctest notion of the use and
   the value of the Eusebian Sections will be obtained by one who will be
   at the pains to substitute for the Eusebian Numbers in the margin of a
   copy of the Greek Gospels the References which these numbers severally
   indicate. It will then become plain that the system of Sections and
   Canons which Eusebius invented,--ingenious, interesting, and useful as
   it certainly is; highly important also, as being the known work of an
   illustrious Father of the Church, as well as most precious occasionally
   for critical purposes [547] ,--is nothing else but a clumsy substitute
   for what is achieved by an ordinary "Reference Bible":--participating
   in every inconvenience incidental to the unskilfully contrived
   apparatus with which English readers are familiar [548] , and yet
   inferior in the following four respects:--

   (1st.) The references of Eusebius, (except those found in Canon X.),
   require in every instance to be deciphered, before they can be
   verified; and they can only be deciphered by making search, (and
   sometimes laborious search,) in another part of the volume. They are
   not, in fact, (nor do they pretend to be,) references to the inspired
   Text at all; but only references to the Eusebian Canons.

   (2ndly.) In their scope, they are of course strictly confined to the
   Gospels,--which most inconveniently limits their use, as well as
   diminishes their value. (Thus, by no possibility is Eusebius able to
   refer a reader from S. Luke xxii. 19, 20 to 1 Cor. xi. 23-25.)

   (3rdly.) By the very nature of their constitution, reference even to
   another part of the same Gospel is impossible. (Eusebius is unable, for
   example, to refer a reader from S. John xix. 39, to iii. 1 and vii.
   50.)

   But besides the preceding, which are disadvantages inherent in the
   scheme and inseparable from it, it will be found (4thly), That
   Eusebius, while he introduces not a few wholly undesirable references,
   (of which some specimens are supplied above), is observed occasionally
   to withhold references which cannot by any means be dispensed with.
   Thus, he omits to refer his reader from S. Luke's account of the visit
   to the Sepulchre (chap. xxiv. 12) to S. John's memorable account of the
   same transaction (chap. xx. 3-10): not because he disallowed the verse
   in S. Luke's Gospel,--for in a certain place he discusses its
   statements [549] .

   III. It is abundantly plain from all that has gone before that the work
   of Eusebius was entirely different in its structure and intention from
   the work of Ammonius. Enough, in fact, has been said to make it fully
   apparent that it is nothing short of impossible that there can have
   been any extensive correspondence between the two. According to
   Eusebius, S. Mark has 21 Sections [550] peculiar to his Gospel: S.
   Luke, 72: S. John, 97 [551] . According to the same Eusebius, 14
   Sections [552] are common to S. Luke and S. Mark only: 21, to S. Luke
   and S. John only. But those 225 Sections can have found no place in the
   work of Ammonius. And if, (in some unexplained way,) room was found for
   those parts of the Gospels, with what possible motive can Ammonius have
   subdivided them into exactly 225 portions? It is nothing else but
   irrational to assume that he did so.

   Not unaware am I that it has been pointed out by a most judicious
   living Critic as a "ground for hesitation before we ascribe the
   Sections as well as the Canons to Eusebius, that not a few ancient MSS.
   contain the former while they omit the latter [553] ." He considers it
   to be certainly indicated thereby "that in the judgment of critics and
   transcribers, (whatever that judgment may be doomed worth,) the
   Ammonian Sections had a previous existence to the Eusebian Canons, as
   well as served for an independent purpose." But I respectfully demur to
   the former of the two proposed inferences. I also learn with surprise
   that "those who have studied them most, can the least toll what use the
   Ammonian Sections can servo, unless in connection with Canons of
   Harmony [554] ."

   However irregular and arbitrary these subdivisions of the Evangelical
   text are observed to be in their construction, their usefulness is
   paramount. They are observed to fulfil exactly the same office as our
   own actual division of the Text into 89 Chapters and 3780 Verses. Of
   course, 1165 subdivisions are (for certain purposes) somewhat loss
   convenient than 3780;--but on the other hand, a place in the Gospels
   would be more easily discovered, I suspect, for the most part, by the
   employment of such a single set of consecutive numbers, than by
   requiring a Reader first to find the Chapter by its Roman numeral, and
   then the Verse by its Arabic figure. Be this as it may, there can be at
   least only one opinion as to the supreme convenience to a Reader,
   whether ancient or modern, of knowing that the copy of the Gospels
   which he holds in his hands is subdivided into exactly the same 1165
   Sections as every other Greek copy which is likely to come in his way;
   and that, in every such copy, he may depend on finding every one of
   those sections invariably distinguished by the self-same number.

   A Greek copy of the Gospels, therefore, having its margin furnished
   with the Eusebian Sectional notation, may be considered to correspond
   generally with an English copy merely divided into Chapters and Verses.
   The addition of the Eusebian Canons at the beginning, with numerical
   references thereto inserted in the margin throughout, does but superadd
   something analogous to the convenience of our Marginal References,--and
   may just as reasonably (or just as unreasonably) be dispensed with.

   I think it not improbable, in fact, that in the preparation of a Codex,
   it will have been sometimes judged commercially expedient to leave its
   purchaser to decide whether he would or would not submit to the
   additional expense (which in the case of illuminated MSS. must have
   been very considerable) of having the Eusebian Tables inserted at the
   commencement of his Book [555] ,--without which the References thereto
   would confessedly have been of no manner of avail. In this way it will
   have come to pass, (as Mr. Scrivener points out,) that "not a few
   ancient MSS. contain the Sections but omit the Canons." Whether,
   however, the omission of References to the Canons in Copies which
   retain in the margin the sectional numbers, is to be explained in this
   way, or not,--Ammonius, at all events, will have had no more to do with
   either the one or the other, than with our modern division into
   Chapters and Verses. It is, in short, nothing else but a "vulgar error"
   to designate the Eusebian Sections as the "Sections of Ammonius." The
   expression cannot be too soon banished from our critical terminology.
   Whether banished or retained, to reason about the lost work of Ammonius
   from the Sections of Eusebius (as Tischendorf and the rest habitually
   do) is an offence against historical Truth which no one who values his
   critical reputation will probably hereafter venture to commit.

   IV. This subject may not be dismissed until a circumstance of
   considerable interest has been explained which has already attracted
   some notice, but which evidently is not yet understood by Biblical
   Critics [556] .

   As already remarked, the necessity of resorting to the Eusebian Tables
   of Canons in order to make any use of a marginal reference, is a
   tedious and a cumbersome process; for which, men must have early sought
   to devise a remedy. They were not slow in perceiving that a far simpler
   expedient would be to note at the foot of every page of a Gospel the
   numbers of the Sections of that Gospel contained in extenso on the same
   page; and, parallel with those numbers, to exhibit the numbers of the
   corresponding Sections in the other Gospels. Many Codices, furnished
   with such an apparatus at the foot of the page, are known to exist
   [557] . For instance, in Cod. 262 ( = Reg. 53, at Paris), which is
   written in double columns, at foot of the first page (fol. 111) of S.
   Mark, is found as follows:--

   The meaning of this, every one will see who,--(remembering what is
   signified by the monograms MR, L[o]., Io, MTh [558] )--will turn
   successively to the II^nd, the I^st, the VI^th, and the I^st of the
   Eusebian Canons. Translated into expressions more familiar to English
   readers, it evidently amounts to this: that we are referred,

   (Â§ 1) From S. Mark i. 1, 2,--to S. Matth. xi. 10: S. Luke vii. 27.

   (Â§ 2) . . . . i. 3,--to S. Matth. iii. 3: S. Luke iii. 3-6.

   (Â§ 3) . . . . i. 4, 5, 6,--to S. Matth. iii. 4-6.

   (Â§ 4) . . . . i. 7, 8,--to S. Matth. iii. 11: S. Luke iii. 16: S. John
   i. 15, 26-27, 30-1: iii. 28.

   (I venture to add that any one who will compare the above with the
   margin of S. Mark's Gospel in a common English "reference Bible," will
   obtain a very fair notion of the convenience, and of the inconveniences
   of the Eusebian system. But to proceed with our remarks on the
   apparatus at the foot of Cod. 262.)

   The owner of such a MS. was able to refer to parallel passages, (as
   above,) by merely turning over the pages of his book. E.g. The parallel
   places to S. Mark's Â§ 1 (A) being Â§ 70 of S. Luke (O) and Â§ 103 of S.
   Matthew (R G),--it was just as easy for him to find those two places as
   it is for us to turn to S. Luke vii. 27 and S. Matth. xi. 10: perhaps
   easier.

   V. I suspect that this peculiar method of exhibiting the Eusebian
   references (Canons as well as Sections) at a glance, was derived to the
   Greek Church from the Syrian Christians. What is certain, a precisely
   similar expedient for enabling readers to discover Parallel Passages
   prevails extensively in the oldest Syriac Evangelia extant. There are
   in the British Museum about twelve Syriac Evangelia furnished with such
   an apparatus of reference [559] ; of which a specimen is
   subjoined,--derived however (because it was near at hand) from a MS. in
   the Bodleian [560] , of the vii^th or viii^th century.

   From this MS., I select for obvious reasons the last page but one (fol.
   82) of S. Mark's Gospel, which contains ch. xvi. 8-18. The Reader will
   learn with interest and surprise that in the margin of this page
   against ver. 8, is written in vermilion, by the original scribe, 281/1:
   against ver. 9,--282/10: against ver. 10,--283/1: against ver.
   11,--284/8: against ver. 12,--285/8: against ver. 13,--286/8: against
   ver. 14,--287/10: against ver. 15,--288/6: against ver. 16,--289/10:
   against ver. 19,--290/8. That these sectional numbers [561] , with
   references to the Eusebian Canons subscribed, are no part of the
   (so-called) "Ammonian" system, will be recognised at a glance.
   According to that scheme, S. Mark xiv. 8 is numbered 233/2. But to
   proceed.

   At the foot of the same page, (which is written in two columns), is
   found the following set of references to parallel places in the other
   three Gospels:--

   The exact English counterpart of which,--(I owe it to the kind help of
   M. Neubauer, of the Bodleian),--is subjoined. The Reader will scarcely
   require to be reminded that the reason why Â§Â§ 282, 287, 289 do not
   appear in this Table is because those Sections, (belonging to the tenth
   Canon,) have nothing parallel to them in the other Gospels.

   Luke  Matthew Mark John Luke Matthew Mark
   391
   . . . . . .
         426     286
                 288  247

                           393  421

                                        285

   The general intention of this is sufficiently obvious: but the Reader
   must be told that on making reference to S. Matthew's Gospel, in this
   Syriac Codex, it is found that Â§ 421 = chap. xxviii. 8; and Â§ 426 =
   chap. xxviii. 10, 20:

   That, in S. Luke's Gospel,--Â§ 390 = chap. xxiv. 8-10: Â§ 391 = chap.
   xxiv. 11; and Â§ 393 = chap. xxiv. 13-17 [562] :

   That, in S. John's Gospel,--Â§ 247 chap. xx. 17 (poreuou down to Theon
   humon. [563] .)

   So that, exhibited in familiar language, these Syriac Marginal
   References are intended to guide a Reader,

   (Â§ 281) From S. Mark xvi. 8,--to S. Matth. xxviii. 8: S. Luke xxiv.
   8-10: S. John xx. 17 (poreuou to the end of the verse).

   (Â§ 283) . . . . . . . xvi. 10,--to the same three places.

   (Â§ 284) . . . . . . . xvi. 11,--to S. Luke xxiv. 11.

   (Â§ 285) . . . . . . . xvi. 12,--to S. Luke xxiv. 13-17,

   (Â§ 286) . . . . . . . xvi. 13,--to S. Luke xxiv. 11.

   (Â§ 288) . . . . . . . xvi. 15,--to S. Matth. xxiv. 19, 20.

   Here then, although the Ten Eusebian Canons are faithfully retained, it
   is much to be noted that we are presented with a different set of
   Sectional subdivisions. This will be best understood by attentively
   comparing all the details which precede with the Eusebian references in
   the inner margin of a copy of Lloyd's Greek Testament.

   But the convincing proof that these Syriac Sections are not those with
   which we have been hitherto acquainted from Greek MSS., is supplied by
   the fact that they are so many more in number. The sum of the Sections
   in each of the Gospels follows; for which, (the Bodleian Codex being
   mutilated,) I am indebted to the learning and obligingness of Dr.
   Wright [564] . He quotes from "the beautiful MS. Addit. 7,157, written
   A.D. 768 [565] ." From this, it appears that the Sections in the Gospel
   according to,--

   S. Matthew, (instead of being from 359 to 355,) are 426: (the last
   Section, Â§ 426/6 consisting of ver. 19, 20.)

   S. Mark, ( . . . . 241 to 233,) are 290: (the last Section, Â§ 290/8
   consisting of ver. 19, 20.)

   S. Luke, ( . . . . 349 to 342) are 402: (the last Section, Â§ 402/10
   consisting of ver. 52, 53.)

   S. John, ( . . . . 232,) are 271: (the last Section, Â§ 271/10
   consisting of ver. 18-25.)

   The sum of the Sections therefore, in Syriac MSS. instead of being
   between 1181 and 1162 [566] , is found to be invariably 1389.

   But here, the question arises,--Did the Syrian Christians then retain
   the Ten Tables, dressing their contents afresh, so as to adapt them to
   their own ampler system of sectional subdivision? or did they merely
   retain the elementary principle of referring each Section to one of Ten
   Canons, but substitute for the Eusebian Tables a species of harmony, or
   apparatus of reference, at the foot of every page?

   The foregoing doubt is triumphantly resolved by a reference to
   Assemani's engraved representation, on xxii Copper Plates, of the X
   Eusebian Tables from a superb Syriac Codex (A.D. 586) in the Medicean
   Library [567] . The student who inquires for Assemani's work will find
   that the numbers in the last line of each of the X Tables is as
   follows:--

                            262
                            271

   The Syrian Church, therefore, from a period of the remotest antiquity,
   not only subdivided the Gospels into a far greater number of Sections
   than were in use among the Greeks, but also habitually employed
   Eusebian Tables which--identical as they are in appearance and in the
   principle of their arrangement with those with which Greek MSS. have
   made us familiar,--yet differ materially from these as to the numerical
   details of their contents.

   Let abler men follow up this inquiry to its lawful results. When the
   extreme antiquity of the Syriac documents is considered, may it not
   almost be made a question whether Eusebius himself put forth the larger
   or the smaller number of Sections? But however that may be, more
   palpably precarious than ever, I venture to submit, becomes the
   confident assertion of the Critics that, "just as Eusebius found these
   Verses [S. Mark xvi. 9-20] absent in his day from the best and most
   numerous [sic] copies, so was also the case with Ammonius when he
   formed his Harmony in the preceding century" [568] . To speak plainly,
   the statement is purely mythical.

   VI. Birch [Varr. Lectt. p. 226], asserts that in the best Codices, the
   Sections of S. Mark's Gospel are not numbered beyond ch. xvi. 8.
   Tischendorf prudently adds, "or ver. 9:" but to introduce that
   alternative is to surrender everything. I subjoin the result of an
   appeal to 151 Greek Evangelia. There is written opposite to,

   ver. 6, . . Â§ 232, in 3 Codices, (viz. A, U, 286)
   -- 8, . . Â§ 233, . . 34 . . . . (including L, 8) [569]
   -- 9, (?) Â§ 234, . . 41 . . . . (including G, D, P) [570]
   -- 10, (?) Â§ 235, . . 4 . . . . (viz. 67, 282, 331, 406)
   -- 12, (?) Â§ 236, . . 7 . . . . (the number assigned by Suidas) [571]
   -- 14, (?) Â§ 237, . . 12 . . . . (including L) [572]
   -- 15, . . Â§ 238, . . 3 . . . . (viz. Add. 19,387: 27,861, Ti^2)
   -- 17, . . Â§ 239, . . 1 . . . . (viz. G)
   -- 19, . . Â§ 240, . . 10 . . . . (including H, M, and the Codices from
   which the Hharklensian Revision, A.D. 616, was made) [573]
   -- 20, . . Â§ 241, . . 36 . . . . (including C, E, K, V) [574]

   Thus, it is found that 114 Codices sectionize the last Twelve Verses,
   against 37 which close the account at ver. 8, or sooner. I infer--(a)
   That the reckoning which would limit the sections to precisely 233, is
   altogether precarious; and--(b) That the sum of the Sections assigned
   to S. Mark's Gospel by Suidas and by Stephens (viz. 236) is arbitrary.

   VII. To some, it may not be unacceptable, in conclusion, to be
   presented with the very words in which Eusebius explains how he would
   have his Sections and Canons used. His language requires attention. He
   says:--

   Ei houn hen ti ton tessaron euangelion hopoiondepote, bouletheies
   epistenai tini ho boulei kephalaio, kai gnonai tines ta paraplesia
   eirekasi, kai tous oikeious en ekasto topous heurein en ois kata ton
   auton henechthesan, hes epecheis perikopes analabon ton prokeimenon
   arithmon, epizetesas te auton endon en to kanoni hon he dia tou
   kinnabareos huposemeiosis hupobebleken, eise men euthus ek ton epi
   metopou tou kanonos prographon, hoposoi kai tines ta paraplesia
   eirekasin; epistesas de kai tois ton loipon euangelion arithmois tois
   en to kanoni ho epecheis arithmo parakeimenois, epizetesas te autous
   endon en tois oikeiois hekastou euangeliou topois, ta paraplesia
   legontas eureseis.

   Jerome,--who is observed sometimes to exhibit the sense of his author
   very loosely,--renders this as follows:--

   "Cum igitur aperto Codice, verbi gratia, illud sive illud Capitulum
   scire volueris cujus Canonis sit, statim ex subjecto numero doceberis;
   et recurrens ad principia, in quibus Canonum est distincta congeries,
   eodemque statim Canone ex titulo frontis invento, illum quem quaerebas
   numerum, ejusdem Evangelistae, qui et ipse ex inscriptione signatur,
   invenies; atque e vicino ceterorum tramitibus inspectis, quos numeros e
   regione habeant, annotabis. Et cum scieris, recurres ad volumina
   singulorum, et sine mora repertis numeris quos ante signaveras,
   reperies et loca in quibus vel eadem, vel vicina dixerunt."

   This may be a very masterly way of explaining the use of the Eusebian
   Canons. But the points of the original are missed. What Eusebius
   actually says is this:--

   "If therefore, on opening any one soever of the four Gospels, thou
   desirest to study any given Section, and to ascertain which of the
   Evangelists have said things of the same kind; as well as to discover
   the particular place where each has been led [to speak] of the same
   things;--note the number of the Section thou art studying, and seek
   that number in the Canon indicated by the numeral subscribed in
   vermilion. Thou wilt be made aware, at once, from the heading of each
   Canon, how many of the Evangelists, and which of them, have said things
   of the same kind. Then, by attending to the parallel numbers relating
   to the other Gospels in the same Canon, and by turning to each in its
   proper place, thou wilt discover the Evangelists saying things of the
   same kind."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [543] Jerome evidently supposed that Ammonius was the author of the
   Canons as well:--"Canones quos Eusebius Caesariensis Episcopus
   Alexandrinum secutus Ammonium in decem numeros ordinavit, sicut in
   Graeco habentur expressimus." (Ad Papam Damasum. Epist.) And again:
   "Ammonius . . . . Evangelicos, Canones excogitavit quos postea secutus
   est Eusebius Caesariensis." (De Viris Illustr. c. 55 [Opp. ii.
   881.])--See above, p.128.

   [544] There was published at the University Press in 1805, a handsome
   quarto volume (pp. 216) entitled Harmonia quatuor Evangeliorum juxta
   Sectiones Ammonianas et Eusebii Canones. It is merely the contents of
   the X Canons of Eusebius printed in extenso,--and of course is no
   "Harmony" at all. It would have been a really useful book,
   notwithstanding; but that the editor, strange to say, has omitted to
   number the sections.

   [545] This last Â§ according to Tischendorf's ed. of the Eusebian
   Canons.

   [546] This last Â§ according to Tischendorf's ed. of the Eusebian
   Canons.

   [547] Thus, certain disputed passages of importance are proved to have
   been recognised at least by Eusebius. Our Lord's Agony in the Garden
   for instance, (S. Luke xxii. 43, 44--wanting in Cod. B,) is by him
   numbered Â§ 283: and that often rejected verse, S. Mark xv. 28, he
   certainly numbered Â§ 216,--whatever Tischendorf may say to the
   contrary. (See p. 293.)

   [548] It is obvious to suggest that, (1) whereas our Marginal
   References follow the order of the Sacred Books, they ought rather to
   stand in the order of their importance, or at least of their relevancy
   to the matter in hand:--and that, (2) actual Quotations, and oven
   Allusions to other parte of Scripture when they are undeniable, should
   be referred to in some distinguishing way. It is also certain that, (3)
   to a far greater extent than at present, sets of References might be
   kept together; not scattered about in small parcels over the whole
   Book.--Above all, (as the point most pertinent to the present
   occasion,) (4) it is to be wished that strictly parallel places in the
   Gospels might be distinguished from those which are illustrative only,
   or are merely recalled by their similarity of subject or expression.
   All this would admit of interesting and useful illustration. While on
   this subject, let me ask,--Why is it no longer possible to purchase a
   Bible with References to the Apocrypha? Who does not miss the reference
   to "Ecclus. xliii. 11, 12" at Gen. ix. 14? Who can afford to do without
   the reference to "1 Macc. iv. 59" at S. John x. 22?

   [561] It will be observed that, according to the Syrian scheme, every
   verse of S. Mark xvi, from ver. 8 to ver. 16 inclusive, constitutes an
   independent section (Â§Â§ 281-288): ver. 16-18 another (Â§ 289); and verr.
   19-20, another (Â§ 290), which is the last. The Greek scheme, as a rule,
   makes independent sections of verr. 8, 9, 14, 19, 20; but throws
   together ver. 10-11: 12-13: 15-16: 17-18. (Vide infrÃ , p. 311.)

   [562] Note that Â§ 302/9 = S. Luke xxiv. 12: Â§ 394/10 = ver. 18-34: Â§
   395/8 = ver. 35: Â§ 396/9 is incomplete. [Dr. Wright supplies the lacune
   for me, thus: Â§ 396/9 = ver. 36-41 (down to thaumazonton): Â§ 397/9 =
   eipen autois down to the end of ver. 41: Â§ 398/9 = ver. 42: Â§ 399/9 =
   ver. 43: Â§ 400/10 = ver. 44-50: Â§ 401/8 = 51: Â§ 402/10 = ver. 52, 3.]

   [563] Critical readers will be interested in comparing, or rather
   contrasting, the Sectional system of a Syriac MS. with that which
   prevails in all Greek Codices. S. John's Â§ 248/1 = xx. 18: his Â§ 249/9
   = ver. 19 to eirene humin in ver. 21: his Â§ 250/7 = ver. 21 (kathos to
   the end of the verse): his Â§ 251/10 = ver. 22: his Â§ 252/7 = ver. 23:
   his Â§ 253/[10] = ver. 24-5: his Â§ 254/[9] = ver. 26-7: his Â§ 255/10 =
   ver. 28 to the end of xxi. 4: his Â§ 256/9 = xxi. 5: his Â§ 257/9 = xxi.
   6 (to heuresete): his Â§ 258/9 = ver. 6, (ebalon to the end): his Â§
   250/[10] = ver. 7, 8: his Â§ 260/[9] = ver. 9: his Â§ 261/10 = ver. 10:
   his Â§ 262/9 = ver. 11: his Â§ 263/9 = first half of ver. 12: his Â§
   264/10 is incomplete. [But Dr. Wright, (remarking that in his MSS.,
   which are evidently the corrector ones, 263/10 stands opposite the
   middle of ver. 12 [oudeis de etolma], and 264/9 opposite ver. 13
   [erchetai oun,) proceeds to supply the lacune for me, thus: Â§ 264/9 =
   ver. 13: Â§ 265/10 = ver. 14-5 (down to philo se; legei auto: Â§ 266/9 =
   boske ta arnia mou (end of ver.15): Â§ 267/10 = ver. 16 (down to
   philose): Â§ 268/9 = legei auto, Poimaine ta probata mou (end of ver.

APPENDIX (H).

   On the Interpolation of the text of Codex B and Codex ' at

   S. Matthew xxvii. 48 or 49.

   (Referred to at pp. 202 and 219.)

   IT is well known that our two oldest Codices, Cod. B and Cod. ', (see
   above, p. 80,) exhibit S. Matthew xxvii. 49, as follows. After soson
   [Cod. Sinait. sosai] auton, they read:--

   (Cod. B.)            (Cod. '.)
   alloc de labo        de labon loGchEÂ¯
   loGchEn enuxen autou enuxen autou TEÂ¯
   TEn pleuran kai exEl pleuran kai exEl
   then udor kai aima   then udor kai ai
                        ma

   Then comes, o de is? palin kraxas k.t.l. The same is also the reading
   of Codd. C, L, U, G: and it is known to recur in the following
   cursives,--5, 48, 67, 115, 127 [575] .

   Obvious is it to suspect with Matthaei, (ed. 1803, vol. i. p. 158,)
   that it was the Lectionary practice of the Oriental Church which
   occasioned this interpolation. In S. John xix. 34 occurs the well-known
   record,--all' heis ton stratioton lonche autou ten pleuran enuxe, kai
   euthus exelthen haima kai hudor and it was the established practice of
   the Easterns, in the Ecclesiastical lection for Good Friday, (viz. S.
   Matth. xxvii. 1-61,) to interpose S. John xix. 31 to 37 between the
   54th and the 55th verses of S. Matthew. This will be found alluded to
   above, at p. 202 and again at pp. 218-9.

   After the pages just quoted were in type, while examining Harl. MS.
   5647 in the British Museum, (our Evan. 72,) I alighted on the following
   Scholion, which I have since found that Wetstein duly published; but
   which has certainly not attracted the attention it deserves, and which
   is incorrectly represented as referring to the end of S. Matth. xxvii.
   49. It is against ver. 48 that there is written in the margin,--

   (E [576] Hoti eic kath' historian euaGGelion Diadorou kai Tatianou kai
   allon diaphoron aEion pateron; touto proskeitai:

   (E Alloc de labon; loGchEn enuxen autou TE`n pleuran. kai exE??lthen
   hudor kai haima: touto leGei kai ho Chrusostomoc.

   This writer is perfectly correct in his statement. In Chrysostom's 88th
   Homily on S. Matthew's Gospel, (Opp. vii, 825 C: [vol. p. 526, ed.
   Field.]) is read as follows:--Enomisan Elian einai, phesi, ton
   kaloumenon, kai eutheos epotisan auton oxos: (which is clearly meant to
   be a summary of the contents of ver. 48: then follows) heteros de
   proselthon lonche autou ten pleuran enuxe. (Chrysostom quotes no
   further, but proceeds,--Ti genoit' an touton paranomoteron, ti de
   theriodesteron, k.t.l.)

   I find it impossible on a review of the evidence to adhere to the
   opinion I once held, and have partially expressed above, (viz. at p.
   202,) that the Lectionary-practice of the Eastern Church was the
   occasion of this corrupt reading in our two oldest uncials. A corrupt
   reading it undeniably is; and the discredit of exhibiting it, Codd. B,
   ', (not to say Codd. C, L, U, G,) must continue to sustain. That
   Chrysostom and Cyril also employed Codices disfigured by this self-same
   blemish, is certain. It is an interesting and suggestive circumstance.
   Nor is this all. Severus [577] relates that between A.D. 496 and 511,
   being at Constantinople, he had known this very reading strenuously
   discussed: whereupon had been produced a splendid copy of S. Matthew's
   Gospel, traditionally said to have been found with the body of the
   Apostle Barnabas in the Island of Cyprus in the time of the Emperor
   Zeno (A.D. 474-491); and preserved in the palace with superstitious
   veneration in consequence. It contained no record of the piercing of
   the Saviour's side: nor (adds Severus) does any ancient Interpreter
   mention the transaction in that place,--except Chrysostom and Cyril of
   Alexandria; into whose Commentaries it has found its way.--Thus, to
   Codices B, ', C and the copy familiarly employed by Chrysostom, has to
   be added the copy which Cyril of Alexandria [578] employed; as well as
   evidently sundry other Codices extant at Constantinople about A.D. 500.
   That the corruption of the text of S. Matthew's Gospel under review is
   ancient therefore, and was once very widely spread, is certain. The
   question remains,--and this is the only point to be determined,--How
   did it originate?

   Now it must be candidly admitted, that if the strange method of the
   Lectionaries already explained, (viz. of interposing seven verses of S.
   John's xixth chapter [ver. 31-7] between the 54th and 55th verses of S.
   Matth. xxvii,) really were the occasion of this interpolation of S.
   John xix. 34 after S. Matth. xxvii. 48 or 49,--two points would seem to
   call for explanation which at present remain unexplained: First, (1)
   Why does only that one verse find place in the interpolated copies? And
   next, (2) How does it come to pass that that one verse is exhibited in
   so very depraved and so peculiar a form?

   For, to say nothing of the inverted order of the two principal words,
   (which is clearly due to 1 S. John v. 6,) let it be carefully noted
   that the substitution of allos de labon lonchen, for all' eis ton
   stratioton lonche of the Evangelist, is a tell-tale circumstance. The
   turn thus licentiously given to the narrative clearly proceeded from
   some one who was bent on weaving incidents related by different writers
   into a connected narrative, and who was sometimes constrained to take
   liberties with his Text in consequence. (Thus, S. Matthew having
   supplied the fact that "ONE OF THEM ran, and took a sponge, and filled
   it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink," S. John
   is made to say, "And another--took a spear.") Now, this is exactly what
   Tatian is related by Eusebius to have done: viz. "after some fashion of
   his own, to have composed out of the four Gospels one connected
   narrative [579] ."

   When therefore, (as in the present Scholion,) an ancient Critic who
   appears to have been familiarly acquainted with the lost "Diatessaron"
   of Tatian, comes before us with the express declaration that in that
   famous monument of the primitive age (A.D. 173), S. John's record of
   the piercing of our Saviour's side was thrust into S. Matthew's History
   of the Passion in this precise way and in these very terms,--(for,
   "Note," he says, "That into the Evangelical History of Diodorus, of
   Tatian, and of divers other holy Fathers, is introduced [here] the
   following addition: And another took a spear and pierced His side, and
   there came out Water and Blood.' This, Chrysostom also says"),--it is
   even unreasonable to seek for any other explanation of the vitiated
   text of our two oldest Codices. Not only is the testimony to the
   critical fact abundantly sufficient, but the proposed solution of the
   difficulty, in itself the reverse of improbable, is in the highest
   degree suggestive as well as important. For,--May we not venture to
   opine that the same kath' historian euangelion,--as this Writer aptly
   designates Tatian's work,--is responsible for not a few of the monstra
   potius quam variae lectiones [580] which are occasionally met with in
   the earliest MSS. of all? And,--Am I not right in suggesting that the
   circumstance before us is the only thing we know for certain about the
   text of Tatian's (miscalled) "Harmony?"

   To conclude.--That the "Diatessaron" of Tatian, (for so, according to
   Eusebius and Theodoret, Tatian himself styled it,) has long since
   disappeared, no one now doubts [581] . That Eusebius himself, (who
   lived 150 years after the probable date of its composition,) had never
   seen it, may I suppose be inferred from the terms in which he speaks of
   it. Jerome does not so much as mention its existence. Epiphanius, who
   is very full and particular concerning the heresy of Tatian, affords no
   indication that he was acquainted with his work. On the contrary. "The
   Diatessaron Gospel," (he remarks in passing,) "which some call the
   Gospel according to the Hebrews, is said to have been the production of
   this writer [582] ." The most interesting notice we have of Tatian's
   work is from the pen of Theodoret. After explaining that Tatian the
   Syrian, originally a Sophist, and next a disciple of Justin Martyr
   [A.D. 150], after Justin's death aspired to being a heretical
   leader,--(statements which are first found in Irenaeus,)--Theodoret
   enumerates his special tenets. "This man" (he proceeds) "put together
   the so-called Diatessaron Gospel,--from which he cut away the
   genealogies, and whatever else shows that the Lord was born of the seed
   of David. The book was used not only by those who favoured Tatian's
   opinions, but by the orthodox as well; who, unaware of the mischievous
   spirit in which the work had been executed, in their simplicity used
   the book as an epitome. I myself found upwards of two hundred such
   copies honourably preserved in the Churches of this place," (Cyrus in
   Syria namely, of which Theodoret was made Bishop, A.D. 423,)--"all of
   which I collected together, and put aside; substituting the Gospels of
   the Four Evangelists in their room [583] ."

   The diocese of Theodoret (he says) contained eight hundred Parishes
   [584] . It cannot be thought surprising that a work of which copies had
   been multiplied to such an extraordinary extent, and which was
   evidently once held in high esteem, should have had some influence on
   the text of the earliest Codices; and here, side by side with a
   categorical statement as to one of its licentious interpolations, we
   are furnished with documentary proof that many an early MS. also was
   infected with the same taint. To assume that the two phenomena stand
   related to one another in the way of cause and effect, seems to be even
   an inevitable proceeding.

   I will not prolong this note by inquiring concerning the "Diodorus" of
   whom the unknown author of this scholion speaks: but I suppose it was
   that Diodorus who was made Bishop of Tarsus in A.D. 378. He is related
   to have been the preceptor of Chrysostom; was a very voluminous writer;
   and, among the rest, according to Suidas, wrote a work "on the Four
   Gospels."

   Lastly,--How about the singular introduction into the Lection for
   Good-Friday of this incident of the piercing of the Redeemer's side? Is
   it allowable to conjecture that, indirectly, the Diatessaron of Tatian
   may have been the occasion of that circumstance also; as well as of
   certain other similar phenomena in the Evangeliaria?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [575] But Cod. U inserts eutheos before exelthen; and (at least two of
   the other Codices, viz.) 48, 67 read aima kai udor.

   [576] Semeiosis is what we call an "Annotation" [On the sign in the
   text, see the Catalogue of MSS. in the Turin Library, P. i. p. 93.] On
   the word, and on semeiousthai, (consider 2 Thess. iii. 14,) see the
   interesting remarks of Huet Origeniana, iii. Â§ i. 4. (at the end of
   vol. iv. of Origen's Opp. p. 292-3.)--Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. v. 20) uses
   se9meiosis in this sense. (See the note of Valesius.) But it is plain
   from the rendering of Jerome and Rufinus (subscriptio), that it often
   denoted a "signature," or signing of the name. Eusebius so employs the
   word in lib. v. 19 ad fin.

   [577] He was Patriarch of Antioch, A.D. 512-9.--The extract (made by
   Petrus junior, Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, A.D. 578,) purports to
   be derived from the 26th Epistle, (Book 9,) which Severus addressed to
   Thomas Bp. of Germanicia after his exile. See Assemani, Bibl. Orient.
   vol. ii. pp. 81-2.

   [578] I cannot find the place in Cyril. I suppose it occurs in a lost
   Commentary of this Father,--whose Works by the way are miserably
   indexed.

POSTSCRIPT.

   (Promised at p. 51.)

   I PROCEED to fulfil the promise made at p. 51.--C. F. Matthaei (Nov.
   Test., 1788, vol. iii. p. 269) states that in one of the MSS. at Moscow
   occurs the following "Scholion of Eusebius:--kata Markon meta ten
   anastasin ou legetai ophthai tois mathetais." On this, Griesbach
   remarks (Comm. Crit. ii. 200),--"quod scribere non potuisset si
   pericopam dubiam agnovisset:" the record in S. Mark xvi. 14, being
   express,--Husteron anakeimenois autois tois hendeka ephanerothe. The
   epigrammatic smartness of Griesbach's dictum has recommended it to Dr.
   Tregelles and others who look unfavourably on the conclusion of S.
   Mark's Gospel; and to this hour the Scholion of Matthaei remains
   unchallenged.

   But to accept the proposed inference from it, is impossible. It ought
   to be obvious to every thoughtful person that problems of this class
   will not bear to be so handled. It is as if one were to apply the rigid
   mathematical method to the ordinary transactions of daily life, for
   which it is clearly unsuitable. Before we move a single step, however,
   we desire a few more particulars concerning this supposed evidence of
   Eusebius.

   Accordingly, I invoked the good offices of my friend, the Rev. W. G.
   Penny, English Chaplain at Moscow, to obtain for me the entire context
   in which this "Scholion of Eusebius" occurs: little anticipating the
   trouble I was about to give him. His task would have been comparatively
   easy had I been able to furnish him (which I was not) with the exact
   designation of the Codex required. At last by sheer determination and
   the display of no small ability, he discovered the place, and sent me a
   tracing of the whole page: viz. fol. 286 (the last ten words being
   overleaf) of Matthaei's "12," ("Synod. 139,") our Evan. 255.

   It proves to be the concluding portion of Victor's Commentary, and to
   correspond with what is found at p. 365 of Possinus, and p. 446-7 of
   Cramer: except that after the words "apokuliseie ton lethon :Â· ~," and
   before the words "allos de phesin" [Possinus, line 12 from bottom:
   Cramer, line 3 from the top], is read as follows:--

   scho^l' euse bioukata Markon; meta ten anastasin ou legetai ophthai

   tois mathetais: kata Matthaion; meta ten anastasin tois

   mathetais hophthe en te Galilaia :Â· ~

   kata Ioannen; en aute te hemera tes anastaseos ton

   thuron kakleismenon ho Iesous mesos ton matheton me

   parontos tou Thoma este; kai meth' hemeras palin okto

   sumparontos kai tou Thoma. meta tauta palin ephane

   Hierousalem ophthe te aute hemera sunegmenon ton loipon

   matheton; kai ophthe Simoni; kai palin exegagen autous

   eis Bethanian kai dieste ap' auton.

   But surely no one who considers the matter attentively, will conceive
   that he is warranted in drawing from this so serious an inference as
   that Eusebius disallowed the last Section of S. Mark's Gospel.

   (1.) In the first place, we have already [suprÃ , p. 44] heard Eusebius
   elaborately discuss the Section in question. That he allowed it, is
   therefore certain.

   (2.) But next, this scholion eusebiou at the utmost can only be
   regarded as a general summary of what Eusebius has somewhere delivered
   concerning our Lord's appearances after His Resurrection. As it stands,
   it clearly is not the work of Eusebius.

   (3.) And because I shall be reminded that such a statement cannot be
   accepted on my own mere ipso dixit,' I proceed to subjoin the original
   Scholion of which the preceding is evidently only an epitome. It is
   found in three of the Moscow MSS., (our Evan. 239, 259, 237,) but
   without any Author's name:--

   Deiknus de ho euangelistes, hoti meta ten anastasin ouketi sunechos
   autois sunen, legei, touto ede trito tois mathetais ophthe ho Kurios
   meta ten anastasin ou touto legon, hoti monon triton, alla ta tois

   gegonuias optasias tou Soteros hemon Iesou Christou. mian men para to
   Matthaio, treis de para to Ioanne, kai treis to Louka homoios [585] .

   (4.) Now, the chief thing deserving of attention here,--the only thing
   in fact which I am concerned to point out,--is the notable circumstance
   that the supposed dictum of Eusebius,--("quod scribere non potuisset si
   pericopam dubiam agnovisset,")--is no longer discoverable. To say that
   it has disappeared,' would be incorrect. In the original document it
   has no existence. In plain terms, the famous "scholion eusebiou" proves
   to be every way a figment. It is a worthless interpolation, thrust by
   some nameless scribe into his abridgement of a Scholion, of which
   Eusebius (as I shall presently show) cannot have been the Author.

   (5.) I may as well point out why the person who wrote the longer
   Scholion says nothing about S. Mark's Gospel. It is because there was
   nothing for him to say.

   He is enumerating our Lord's appearances to His Disciples after His
   Resurrection; and he discovers that these were exactly seven in number:
   one being peculiar to S. Matthew,--three, to S. John,--three, to S.
   Luke. But because, (as every one is aware), there exists no record of
   an appearance to the Disciples peculiar to S. Mark's Gospel, the Author
   of the Scholion is silent concerning S. Mark perforce. . . . . How so
   acute and accomplished a Critic as Matthaei can have overlooked all
   this: how he can have failed to recognise the identity of his longer
   and his shorter Scholion: how he came to say of the latter, "conjicias
   ergo Eusebium hunc totum locum repudiasse;" and, of the former,
   "ultimam partem Evangelii Marci videtur tollere [586] :" lastly, how
   Tischendorf (1869) can write,--"est enim ejusmodi ut ultimam partem
   evangelii Marci, de quo quaeritur, excludat [587] :"--I profess myself
   unable to understand.

   (6.) The epitomizer however, missing the point of his Author,--besides
   enumerating all the appearances of our Saviour which S. Luke anywhere
   records,--is further convicted of having injudiciously invented the
   negative statement about S. Mark's Gospel which is occasioning us all
   this trouble.

   (7.) And yet, by that unlucky sentence of his, he certainly did not
   mean what is commonly imagined. I am not concerned to defend him: but
   it is only fair to point out that, to suppose he intended to disallow
   the end of S. Mark's Gospel, is altogether to misapprehend the gist of
   his remarks, and to impute to him a purpose of which he clearly knew
   nothing. Note, how he throws his first two statements into a separate
   paragraph; contrasts, and evidently balances one against the other:
   thus,--

   kata Markon, meta ten anastasin ou legetai ophthai,--kata Matthaion
   meta ten anastasin ophthe,--tois mathetais en te Galilaia.

   Perfectly evident is it that the plena locutio' so to speak, of the
   Writer would have been somewhat as follows:--

   [The first two Evangelists are engaged with our Saviour's appearance to
   His Disciples in Galilee: but] by S. Mark, He is not--by S. Matthew, He
   is--related to have been actually seen by them there.

   [The other two Evangelists relate the appearances in Jerusalem: and]
   according to S. John, &c. &c.

   According to S. Luke,' &c. &c.

   (8.) And on passing the "Quaestiones ad Marinum" of Eusebius under
   review, I am constrained to admit that the Scholion before us is just
   such a clumsy bit of writing as an unskilful person might easily be
   betrayed into, who should attempt to exhibit in a few short sentences
   the substance of more than one tedious disquisition of this ancient
   Father [588] . Its remote parentage would fully account for its being
   designated "scholion eusebiou," all the same.

   (9.) Least of all am I concerned to say anything more about the longer
   Scholion; seeing that S. Mark is not so much as mentioned in it. But I
   may as well point out that, as it stands, Eusebius cannot have been its
   Author: the proof being, that whereas the Scholion in question is a
   note on S. John xxi. 12, (as Matthaei is careful to inform us,)--its
   opening sentence is derived from Chrysostom's Commentary on that same
   verse in his 87^th Homily on S. John [589] .

   (10.) And thus, one by one, every imposing statement of the Critics is
   observed hopelessly to collapse as soon us it is questioned, and to
   vanish into thin air.

   So much has been offered, only because of the deliberate pledge I gave
   in p. 51.--Never again, I undertake to say, will the "Scholion of
   Eusebius" which has cost my friend at Moscow, his Archimandrites, and
   me, so much trouble, be introduced into any discussion of the
   genuineness of the last Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S.
   Mark. As the oversight of one (C. F. Matthaei) who was singularly
   accurate, and towards whom we must all feel as towards a Benefactor,
   let it be freely forgiven as well as loyally forgotten!

L'ENVOY

   As one, escaped the bustling trafficking town,
   Worn out and weary, climbs his favourite hill
   And thinks it Heaven to see the calm green fields
   Mapped out in beautiful sunlight at his feet:
   Or walks enraptured where the fitful south
   Comes past the beans in blossom; and no sight
   Or scent or sound but fills his soul with glee:
   So I,--rejoicing once again to stand
   Where Siloa's brook flows softly, and the meads
   Are all enamell'd o'er with deathless flowers,
   And Angel voices fill the dewy air.
   Strife is so hateful to me! most of all
   A strife of words about the things of God.
   Better by far the peasant's uncouth speech
   Meant for the heart's confession of its hope.
   Sweeter by far in village-school the words
   But half remembered from the Book of Life,
   Or scarce articulate lispings of the Creed.

   And yet, three times that miracle of Spring
   The grand old tree that darkens Exeter wall
   Hath decked itself with blossoms as with stars,
   Since I, like one that striveth unto death,
   Find myself early and late and oft all day
   Engaged in eager conflict for God's Truth;
   God's Truth, to be maintained against Man's lie.
   And lo, my brook which widened out long since
   Into a river, threatens now at length
   To burst its channel and become a sea.

   O Sister, who ere yet my task is done
   Art lying (my loved Sister!) in thy shroud
   With a calm placid smile upon thy lips
   As thou wert only "taking of rest in sleep,"
   Soon to wake up to ministries of love,--
   Open those lips, kind Sister, for my sake
   In the mysterious place of thy sojourn,
   (For thou must needs be with the bless'd,--yea, where
   The pure in heart draw wondrous nigh to God,)
   And tell the Evangelist of thy brother's toil;
   Adding (be sure!) "He found it his reward,
   Yet supplicates thy blessing and thy prayers,
   The blessing, saintly Stranger, of thy prayers,
   Sure at the least unceasingly of mine!"

   One other landed on the eternal shore!
   One other garnered into perfect peace!
   One other hid from hearing and from sight! . . .
   O but the days go heavily, and the toil
   Which used to seem so pleasant yields scant joy.
   There come no tokens to us from the dead:
   Save--it may be--that now and then we reap
   Where not we sowed, and that may be from them,
   Fruit of their prayers when we forgot to pray!
   Meantime there comes no message, comes no word:
   Day after day no message and no sign:
   And the heart droops, and finds that it was Love
   Not Fame it longed for, lived for: only Love.
