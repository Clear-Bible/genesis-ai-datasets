Chapter 1

   1:1 Paul [Paulos]. He does not mention his apostleship as he usually
   does. Omitted also in I and II Thess. and Philemon. Timothy
   [Timotheos]. In no sense the author, but associated with Paul because
   with him here in Rome as in Corinth when I and II Thessalonians written
   and in Ephesus when I Corinthians sent and in Macedonia when II
   Corinthians written. Timothy was with Paul when the Philippian church
   was founded (Ac 16:1,13; 17:14). He had been there twice since (Ac
   19:22; 20:3f.). To all the saints [pasi tois hagiois]. The word saint
   [hagios] here is used for the professing Christians as in 1Co 1:2 which
   see as well as Ro 1:7 for the origin of the word. The word "all" [pasi]
   means that all individual believers are included. Paul employs this
   word frequently in Philippians. In Christ Jesus [en ChristOi Iesou].
   The centre for all Christian relations and activities for Paul and for
   us. In Philippi [en Philippois]. See on Ac 16:12 for discussion of this
   name. With the bishops [sun episkopois]. "Together with bishops," thus
   singled out from "all the saints." See Ac 20:17,28 for the use of this
   most interesting word as equivalent to [presbuteros] (elder). It is an
   old word from [episkeptomai], to look upon or after, to inspect, so the
   overseer or superintendent. In the second century [episcopos]
   (Ignatius) came to mean one superior to elders, but not so in the N.T.
   The two New Testament church officers are here mentioned (bishops or
   elders and deacons). The plural is here employed because there was
   usually one church in a city with several pastors (bishops, elders).
   And deacons [kai diakonois]. Technical sense here of the other church
   officers as in 1Ti 3:8-13, not the general use as in Mt 22:13. The
   origin of the office is probably seen in Ac 6:1-6. The term is often
   applied to preachers (1Co 3:5; 2Co 3:6). The etymology [dia, konis]
   suggests raising a dust by hastening.

   1:3 Upon [epi]. Basis of the thanksgiving. All [pasei]. Note frequent
   use of "all" here [pasei, pantote], always, [pasei], again, [pantOn
   humOn], you all). The use of "you all" recurs several times (4, 7 bis,
   8).

   1:4 With joy [meta charas]. Keynote of the Epistle. Paul is a happy
   prisoner as in Philippi when he and Silas sang praises at midnight
   though in prison (Ac 16:25).

   1:5 For your fellowship [epi tei koinOniai humOn]. "On the basis of
   your contribution" as in 2Co 8:4; 9:13; Ac 2:42. The particular kind of
   "partnership" or "fellowship" involved is the contribution made by the
   Philippians for the spread of the gospel (1:7 [sugkoinOnous] and 4:14
   where [sugkoinOnesantes] occurs). In furtherance of the gospel [eis to
   euaggelion]. "For the gospel." From the first day until now [apo tes
   prOtes hemeras achri tou nun]. As when in Thessalonica (Php 4:15f.), in
   Corinth (Ac 18:5; 2Co 11:7-10), and now in Rome.

   1:6 Being confident [pepoithOs]. Second perfect active of [peithO], to
   persuade. This very thing [auto touto]. Accusative of the inner object
   with [pepoithOs], "this thing itself." Will perfect it [epitelesei].
   Future active indicative of [epiteleO], will fully [epi-] finish. God
   began and God will consummate it (see 2Co 8:6; Ga 3:3 where both words
   occur together as here), but not without their cooperation and
   partnership. Until the day of Jesus Christ [achri hemeras Christou
   Iesou]. The second coming as in verse 10. See 1Th 5:2, 4; 2Th 1:10;
   2:2; 1Co 1:18; 3:13; 2Co 1:14; Ro 13:12. Paul never sets the time for
   the Lord's return, but he is cheered by that blessed hope.

   1:7 Because I have you in my heart [dia to echein me en tei kardiai
   humas]. Or "because you hold me in your heart." Literally, "because of
   the holding me (or you) in the heart as to you (or me)." One accusative
   is the object of the infinitive [echein], the other is the accusative
   of general reference. There is no way to decide which is the idea meant
   except to say that love begets love. The pastor who, like Paul, holds
   his people in his heart will find them holding him in their hearts. In
   the defence [en tei apologiai]. Old word (our word apology, but not our
   idea of apologizing), in the original sense in Ac 22:1; 25:16. So also
   in verse 16 below. Confirmation [bebaiOsei]. Old word from [bebaioO]
   [bebaios, bainO], to make stable. In N.T. only here and Heb 6:16 about
   oath. Partakers with me of grace [sugkoinOnous mou tes charitos].
   Literally, "my co-sharers in grace" (objective genitive). "Grace
   prompted them to alleviate his imprisonment, to cooperate with him in
   defending and propagating the gospel, and to suffer for its sake"
   (Vincent, Int. Crit. Comm.).

   1:8 My witness [martus mou]. Same solemn oath in Ro 1:9. I long after
   [epipothO]. Longing [pothos] directed toward [epi] the Philippians. Old
   word, chiefly in Paul in N.T. In the tender mercies [en splagchnois].
   Literally "in the bowels" as the seat of the affections.

   1:9 May abound [perisseuei]. Present active subjunctive of [perisseuO],
   may keep on overflowing, a perpetual flood of love, "yet more and more"
   [eti mallon kai mallon], but with necessary limitations (river banks),
   "in knowledge" [en epignOsei], in full knowledge) "and all discernment"
   [pasei aisthesei]. The delicate spiritual perception [aisthesis], old
   word from [aisthanomai], only here in N.T. as the verb only in Lu 9:45
   in N.T.) can be cultivated as in [aistheterion] (Heb 5:14)

   1:10 So that ye may [eis to humas]. Either purpose or result [eis to]
   plus infinitive as in Ro 1:11,20; 3:26, etc.). Approve the things that
   are excellent [dokimazein ta diapheronta]. Originally, "test the things
   that differ." Cf. same idiom in Ro 2:28. The verb was used for assaying
   metals. Either sense suits this context, but the first step is to
   distinguish between good and evil and that is not always easy in our
   complex civilization. Sincere [eilikrineis]. Old word of uncertain
   origin from [krinO], to judge, by [heile] (sunlight) or to sift by
   rapid rolling [eilos]. At any rate it means pure, unsullied. Void of
   offence [aproskopoi]. Alpha privative [pros] and [koptO], to cut, "not
   stumbled against" (not causing others to stumble) or if active "not
   stumbling against." Passive sense probably, not active as in 1Co 10:32.
   Common in the papyri, though not in ancient Greek writers.

   1:11 Fruits of righteousness [karpon dikaiosunes]. Singular, collective
   idea, fruit of righteousness. Accusative case retained with perfect
   passive participle.

   1:12 The things which happened unto me [ta kat' eme]. "The things
   concerning me" = "my affairs" as common in Josephus. Have fallen out
   rather [mallon eleluthen]. "Have come rather." Second perfect active
   indicative of [erchomai]. Unto the progress [eis prokopen]. Late word
   from [prokoptO], common verb, to cut or strike forward, but this late
   substantive does not occur in classical Greek. It is a technical term
   in Stoic philosophy for "progress toward wisdom" and it appears also in
   the papyri and the LXX. In N.T. only here, verse 25; 1Ti 4:15.

   1:13 Throughout the whole praetorian guard [en holOi tOi praitOriOi].
   There were originally ten thousand of these picked soldiers,
   concentrated in Rome by Tiberius. They had double pay and special
   privileges and became so powerful that emperors had to court their
   favour. Paul had contact with one after another of these soldiers. It
   is a Latin word, but the meaning is not certain, for in the other New
   Testament examples (Mt 27:27; Mr 15:16; Joh 18:28,33; 19:9; Ac 23:35)
   it means the palace of the provincial governor either in Jerusalem or
   Caesarea. In Rome "palace" would have to be the emperor's palace, a
   possible meaning for Paul a provincial writing to provincials
   (Kennedy). Some take it to mean the camp or barracks of the praetorian
   guard. The Greek, "in the whole praetorium," allows this meaning,
   though there is no clear example of it. Mommsen and Ramsay argue for
   the judicial authorities (praefecti praetorio) with the assessors of
   the imperial court. At any rate Paul, chained to a soldier, had access
   to the soldiers and the officials.

   1:14 The most of the brethren [tous pleionas tOn adelphOn]. "The more
   part of the brethren." The comparative with the article with the sense
   of the superlative as often in the Koine. In the Lord [en KuriOi]. It
   is not clear whether this phrase is to be connected with "brethren" or
   with "being confident" [pepoithotas], probably with [pepoithotas]. If
   so, then "through my bonds" [tois desmois mou] would be the
   instrumental case and mean that by means of Paul's bonds the brethren
   "are more abundantly bold" [perissoterOs tolmain].

   1:15 Even of envy and strife [kai dia phthonon kai erin]. "Even because
   of" (accusative after [dia]). Surely the lowest of motives for
   preaching Christ. Envy is an old word and an old sin and strife [eris]
   is more rivalry than schism. It is petty and personal jealousy of
   Paul's power and prowess by the Judaizers in Rome whom Paul has routed
   in the east, but who now exult at the opportunity of annoying their
   great antagonist by their interpretation of Christ. Jealousy is always
   against those of one's own class or profession as preachers with
   preachers, doctors with doctors. Of goodwill [di' eudokian]. Because of
   goodwill toward Paul.

   1:16 Of love [ex agapes]. Out of love to Paul as well as to Christ. Put
   1Co 13 here as a flash-light.

   1:17 Of faction [ex eritheias]. Out of partisanship. From [eritheuO],
   to spin wool, and that from [erithos], a hireling. The papyri examples
   suit the idea of selfish ambition (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).
   See 2Co 12:20; Ga 5:20. Not sincerely [ouch hagnOs]. "Not purely," that
   is with mixed and impure motives. To raise up affliction for my bonds
   [thlipsin egeirein tois desmois mou]. Now that Paul is down they jump
   on him in mean and nagging ways. Dative case in [desmois]. "To make my
   chains gall me" (Lightfoot).

   1:18 What then? [ti gar?]. Sharp problem put up to Paul by the conduct
   of the Judaizers. Only that [plen hoti]. Same idiom in Ac 20:23. [Plen]
   is adverb [pleon] (more besides). As a preposition [plen] means
   "except." This essential thing Paul sees in spite of all their envy and
   selfishness that Christ is preached. Whether in pretence [eite
   prophasei]. Either from [prophainO], to shew forth, or [prophemi], to
   speak forth, the ostensible presentation often untrue. See Ac 27:30.
   Paul sees clearly through the pious pretence of these Judaizers and
   rejoices that people get some knowledge of Christ. Some Christ is
   better than no Christ. Yea, and will rejoice [alla kai charesomai].
   Note affirmative, not adversative, use of [alla]. Volitive use of the
   future (second future passive) indicative [charesomai] of [chairO].
   Paul is determined to rejoice in spite of the efforts of the Judaizers
   to prod him to anger.

   1:19 Will turn [apobesetai]. Future middle indicative of [apobainO],
   old verb, to come from, to come back, to turn out. To my salvation [eis
   sOterian]. For his release from prison as he strongly hopes to see them
   again (1:26). Lightfoot takes the word to be Paul's eternal salvation
   and it must be confessed that verse 20 (the close of this sentence)
   does suit that idea best. Can it be that Paul carried both conceptions
   in the word here? Supply [epichoregias]. Late and rare word (one
   example in inscription of first century A.D.). In N.T. only here and
   Eph 4:16. From the late verb [epichoregeO] (double compound, [epi,
   choros, hegeomai], to furnish supply for the chorus) which see in 2Co
   9:10; Ga 3:5.

   1:20 Earnest expectation [apokaradokian]. In Paul alone from
   [apokaradokeO] (in papyri). See on Ro 8:19 for only other example.
   Shall be magnified [megalunthesetai]. Future passive indicative of
   [megalunO], old verb, to make great, from [megas] (great). See Ac
   19:17. In my body [en tOi sOmati mou]. See Ro 12:1f. It is harder often
   to make Christ great in the body than in the spirit.

   1:21 For to me [emoi gar]. Fine example of the ethical dative. Paul
   gives his own view of living. To live is Christ [to zein Christos]. No
   copula [estin], but [to zein] (the act of living present active
   infinitive) is the subject as is shown by the article [to]. Living is
   coextensive with Christ. Gain [kerdos]. Old word for any gain or
   profit, interest on money (so in papyri). In N.T. only here, Php 3:7;
   Tit 1:11. To die [to apothanein], second aorist active infinitive,
   single act) is to cash in both principal and interest and so to have
   more of Christ than when living. So Paul faces death with independence
   and calm courage.

   1:22 If this is the fruit of my work [touto moi karpos ergou]. There is
   no [ei] (if) here in the Greek, but [touto] (this) seems to be
   resumptive and to repeat the conditional clause just before. If so,
   [kai] just after means then and introduces the conclusion of the
   condition. Otherwise [touto] introduces the conclusion and [kai] means
   and. I wot not [ou gnOrizO]. "I know not." It seems odd to preserve the
   old English word "wot" here. But it is not clear that [gnOrizO] (old
   causative verb from [ginOskO] means just to know. Elsewhere in the
   N.T., as in Lu 2:15; Ro 9:22, it means to make known, to declare. The
   papyri examples mean to make known. It makes perfectly good sense to
   take its usual meaning here, "I do not declare what I shall choose."

   1:23 I am in a strait [sunechomai]. "I am held together." Present
   passive indicative of the common compound verb [sunechO], to hold
   together, to hem together as in Lu 8:45. "I am hemmed in on both sides"
   (Lightfoot). Betwixt the two [ek tOn duo]. "From the two (sides)."
   Pressure to live on, pressure to die and be with Christ. To depart [eis
   to analusai]. Purpose clause, [eis to] and the aorist active infinitive
   [analusai], old compound verb, to unloose (as threads), to break up, to
   return (Lu 12:36, only other N.T. example), to break up camp
   (Polybius), to weigh anchor and put out to sea, to depart (often in old
   Greek and papyri). Cf. [kataluO] in 2Co 5:1 for tearing down the tent.
   Very far better [pollOi mallon kreisson]. Double comparative (triple
   Lightfoot calls it because of [pollOi] like Isocrates and the Koine
   often. See 2Co 7:13 for [perissoterOs mallon]. [PollOi] is the
   instrumental case of measure (by much).

   1:24 In the flesh [en tei sarki]. So B D G, but Aleph A C do not have
   [en]. Unnecessary with [epimenO], to abide by (common verb).

   1:25 And abide with you all [kai paramenO pasin humin]. Common Pauline
   idiom to repeat the simple verb [menO] as a compound [paramenO], future
   active indicative), old verb, to remain beside followed by locative
   case. See same idiom in [chairO, sunchairO] (Php 2:17).

   1:26 In Christ Jesus in me [en ChristOi Iesou en emoi]. "In Christ
   Jesus" as the basis for the glorying [kauchema], "in me" as the
   instance in point. Through my presence [dia tes emes parousias]. The
   word so often used of the second coming of Christ, but here in its
   ordinary sense as in 2:12; 1Co 16:17.

   1:27 Let your manner of life [politeuesthe]. Old verb from [polites],
   citizen, and that from [polis], city, to be a citizen, to manage a
   state's affairs, to live as a citizen. Only twice in N.T., here and Ac
   23:1. Philippi as a colony possessed Roman citizenship and Paul was
   proud of his own possession of this right. The Authorized Version
   missed the figure completely by the word "conversation" which did refer
   to conduct and not mere talk as now, but did not preserve the figure of
   citizenship. Better render, "Only do ye live as citizens." Striving
   [sunathlountes]. Rather, "striving together" as in an athletic contest.
   Late and rare word (Diodorus). "The very energy of the Christian faith
   to produce energetic individualities" (Rainy). "Striving in concert"
   (Lightfoot). For the faith [tei pistei]. For the teaching of the
   gospel, objective sense of [pistis] (faith).

   1:28 Affrighted [pturomenoi]. Present passive participle of [pturO],
   old verb, to frighten. The metaphor is of a timid or scared horse and
   from [ptoeO] [ptoa], terror). "Not startled in anything." By the
   adversaries [hupo tOn antikeimenOn]. These men who were lined up
   against (present middle participle of [antikeimai] may have been Jews
   or Gentiles or both. See 2Th 2:4 for this late verb. Any preacher who
   attacks evil will have opposition. Evident token [endeixis]. Old word
   for proof. See 2Co 8:24; Ro 3:25f. "An Attic law term" (Kennedy) and
   only in Paul in N.T. Perdition [apOleias]. "Loss" in contrast with
   "salvation" [sOterias]. And that [kai touto]. Idiomatic adverbial
   accusative. "It is a direct indication from God. The Christian
   gladiator does not anxiously await the signal of life or death from the
   fickle crowd" (Lightfoot).

   1:29 In the behalf of Christ [to huper Christou]. Literally, "the in
   behalf of Christ." But Paul divides the idea and uses the article to
   again both with [pisteuein] and with [paschein]. Suffering in behalf of
   Christ is one of God's gifts to us.

   1:30 Conflict [agOna]. Athletic or gladiatorial contest as in 1Ti 6:12;
   2Ti 4:7. The Philippians saw Paul suffer (Ac 16:19-40; 1Th 2:2) as now
   they have heard about it in Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 If [ei]. Paul uses four conditions in this verse, all of the first
   class, assuming the condition to be true. Comfort [paraklesis]. Rather,
   "ground of appeal to you in Christ." See 1Co 1:10; Eph 4:1. Consolation
   [paramuthion]. Old word from [paramutheomai], persuasive address,
   incentive. Of love [agapes]. Objective genitive, "in love" (undefined
   as in 1Co 13). Fellowship [koinOnia]. Partnership in the Holy Spirit
   "whose first fruit is love" (Ga 5:22). Any tender mercies [tis
   splagchna]. Common use of this word for the nobler [viscera] and so for
   the higher emotions. But [tis] is masculine singular and [splagchna] is
   neuter plural. Lightfoot suggests an error of an early transcriber or
   even of the amanuensis in writing [ei tis] instead of [ei tina].

   2:2 Fulfil [plerOsate]. Better here, "fill full." Paul's cup of joy
   will be full if the Philippians will only keep on having unity of
   thought and feeling [to auto phronete], present active subjunctive,
   keep on thinking the same thing). Being of one accord [sunpsuchoi].
   Late word here for the first time, from [sun] and [psuche], harmonious
   in soul, souls that beat together, in tune with Christ and with each
   other. Of one mind [to hen phronountes]. "Thinking the one thing." Like
   clocks that strike at the same moment. Perfect intellectual telepathy.
   Identity of ideas and harmony of feelings.

   2:3 Through vainglory [kata kenodoxian]. Late word, only here in N.T.,
   from [kenodoxos] [kenos, doxa], Ga 5:26, only here in N.T.), empty
   pride. In lowliness of mind [tei tapeinophrosunei]. Late and rare word.
   Not in O.T. or early Greek writers. In Josephus and Epictetus in bad
   sense (pusillanimity). For ostentatious humility in Co 2:18,23. One of
   the words, like [tapeinos] (Mt 11:29) and [tapeinophrOn] (1Pe 3:8, here
   alone in N.T.) that Christianity has ennobled and dignified (Ac 20:19).
   Better than himself [huperechontas heautOn]. Present active participle
   of [huperechO] in intransitive sense to excel or surpass with the
   ablative, "excelling themselves." See Ro 12:10.

   2:4 Looking [skopountes]. Present active participle of [skopeO] from
   [skopos] (aim, goal). Not keeping an eye on the main chance for number
   one, but for the good of others.

   2:5 Have this mind in you [touto phroneite en humin]. "Keep on thinking
   this in you which was also in Christ Jesus" [ho kai en ChristOi Iesou].
   What is that? Humility. Paul presents Jesus as the supreme example of
   humility. He urges humility on the Philippians as the only way to
   secure unity.

   2:6 Being [huparchOn]. Rather, "existing," present active participle of
   [huparchO]. In the form of God [en morphei theou]. [Morphe] means the
   essential attributes as shown in the form. In his preincarnate state
   Christ possessed the attributes of God and so appeared to those in
   heaven who saw him. Here is a clear statement by Paul of the deity of
   Christ. A prize [harpagmon]. Predicate accusative with [hegesato].
   Originally words in [-mos] signified the act, not the result [-ma]. The
   few examples of [harpagmos] (Plutarch, etc.) allow it to be understood
   as equivalent to [harpagma], like [baptismos] and [baptisma]. That is
   to say Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be
   won ("robbery"). To be on an equality with God [to einai isa theoi].
   Accusative articular infinitive object of [hegesato], "the being equal
   with God" (associative instrumental case [theOi] after [isa]. [Isa] is
   adverbial use of neuter plural with [einai] as in Re 21:16. Emptied
   himself [heauton ekenOse]. First aorist active indicative of [kenoO],
   old verb from [kenos], empty. Of what did Christ empty himself? Not of
   his divine nature. That was impossible. He continued to be the Son of
   God. There has arisen a great controversy on this word, a [Kenosis]
   doctrine. Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took
   upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of
   power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man.
   It is here that men should show restraint and modesty, though it is
   hard to believe that Jesus limited himself by error of knowledge and
   certainly not by error of conduct. He was without sin, though tempted
   as we are. "He stripped himself of the insignia of majesty"
   (Lightfoot).

   2:7 The form of a servant [morphen doulou]. He took the characteristic
   attributes [morphen] as in verse 6) of a slave. His humanity was as
   real as his deity. In the likeness of men [en homoiOmati anthrOpOn]. It
   was a likeness, but a real likeness (Kennedy), no mere phantom humanity
   as the Docetic Gnostics held. Note the difference in tense between
   [huparchOn] (eternal existence in the [morphe] of God) and [genomenos]
   (second aorist middle participle of [ginomai], becoming, definite
   entrance in time upon his humanity).

   2:8 In fashion [schemati]. Locative case of [schema], from [echO], to
   have, to hold. Bengel explains [morphe] by forma, [homoiOma] by
   similitudo, [schema] by habitus. Here with [schema] the contrast "is
   between what He is in Himself, and what He appeared in the eyes of men"
   (Lightfoot). He humbled himself [etapeinOsen heauton]. First aorist
   active of [tapeinoO], old verb from [tapeinos]. It is a voluntary
   humiliation on the part of Christ and for this reason Paul is pressing
   the example of Christ upon the Philippians, this supreme example of
   renunciation. See Bruce's masterpiece, The Humiliation of Christ.
   Obedient [hupekoos]. Old adjective, giving ear to. See Ac 7:39; 2Co
   2:9. Unto death [mechri thanatou]. "Until death." See "until blood"
   [mechris haimatos], Heb 12:4). Yea, the death of the cross [thanatou de
   staurou]. The bottom rung in the ladder from the Throne of God. Jesus
   came all the way down to the most despised death of all, a condemned
   criminal on the accursed cross.

   2:9 Wherefore [dio]. Because of which act of voluntary and supreme
   humility. Highly exalted [huperupsOse]. First aorist indicative of
   [huperupsoO] [huper] and [hupsos] late and rare word (LXX and
   Byzantine). Here only in N.T. Because of Christ's voluntary humiliation
   God lifted him above or beyond [huper] the state of glory which he
   enjoyed before the Incarnation. What glory did Christ have after the
   Ascension that he did not have before in heaven? What did he take back
   to heaven that he did not bring? Clearly his humanity. He returned to
   heaven the Son of Man as well as the Son of God. The name which is
   above every name [to onoma to huper pan onoma]. What name is that?
   Apparently and naturally the name Jesus, which is given in verse 10.
   Some think it is "Jesus Christ," some "Lord," some the ineffable name
   Jehovah, some merely dignity and honour.

   2:10 That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow [hina en tOi
   onomati Iesou pan gonu kampsei]. First aorist active subjunctive of
   [kamptO], old verb, to bend, to bow, in purpose clause with [hina]. Not
   perfunctory genuflections whenever the name of Jesus is mentioned, but
   universal acknowledgment of the majesty and power of Jesus who carries
   his human name and nature to heaven. This universal homage to Jesus is
   seen in Ro 8:22; Eph 1:20-22 and in particular Re 5:13. Under the earth
   [katachthoniOn]. Homeric adjective for departed souls, subterranean,
   simply the dead. Here only in the N.T.

   2:11 Should confess [exomologesetai]. First aorist middle subjunctive
   of [exomologeomai] with [hina] for purpose. Lord [Kurios]. Peter (Ac
   2:36) claimed that God made Christ "Lord." See also 1Co 8:6; 12:3; Ro
   10:9. Kennedy laments that the term Lord has become one of the most
   lifeless in the Christian vocabulary, whereas it really declares the
   true character and dignity of Jesus Christ and "is the basis and the
   object of worship."

   2:12 Not as in my presence only [me hOs en tei parousiai monon]. B and
   a few other MSS. omit [hOs]. The negative [me] goes with the imperative
   [katergazesthe] (work out), not with [hupekousate] (obeyed) which would
   call for [ouch]. Much more [pollOi mallon]. They are not to render
   eye-service only when Paul is there, but much more when he is away.
   Work out [katergazesthe]. Perfective use of [kata] (down) in
   composition, work on to the finish. This exhortation assumes human free
   agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation. With fear and
   trembling [meta phobou kai tromou]. "Not slavish terror, but wholesome,
   serious caution" (Vincent). "A nervous and trembling anxiety to do
   right" (Lightfoot). Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy
   or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth. He exhorts as
   if he were an Arminian in addressing men. He prays as if he were a
   Calvinist in addressing God and feels no inconsistency in the two
   attitudes. Paul makes no attempt to reconcile divine sovereignty and
   human free agency, but boldly proclaims both.

   2:13 Which worketh in you [ho energOn en humin]. Articular present
   active participle of [energeO] from [energos] [en, ergon] one at work,
   common verb from Aristotle on, to be at work, to energize. God is the
   Energy and the Energizer of the universe. Modern scientists, like
   Eddington, Jeans, and Whitney, are not afraid to agree with Paul and to
   put God back of all activity in nature. Both to will and to work [kai
   to thelein kai to energein]. "Both the willing and the working (the
   energizing)." God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also
   and our part is essential, as he has shown in verse 12, though
   secondary to that of God. For his good-pleasure [huper tes eudokias].
   So Whitney puts "the will of God" behind gravitation and all the laws
   of nature.

   2:14 Without murmurings [chOris goggusmOn]. See on Ac 6:1 for this late
   onomatopoetic word from [gogguzO], to mutter, to grumble. Disputings
   [dialogismOn]. Or questionings as in Lu 24:38. The grumblings led to
   disputes.

   2:15 That ye may be [hina genesthe]. Rather, "that ye may become"
   (second aorist middle subjunctive of [ginomai], to become). Blameless
   [amemptoi]. Free from censure [memphomai], to blame). Harmless
   [akeraioi]. Unmixed, unadulterated as in Ro 16:19. Without blemish
   [amOma]. Without spot, "unblemished in reputation and in reality"
   (Vincent). In the midst of [meson]. Preposition with genitive. Crooked
   [skolias]. Old word, curved as opposed to [orthos], straight. See on Ac
   2:40. Perverse [diestrammenes]. Perfect passive participle of
   [diastrephO], to distort, to twist, to turn to one side [dia], in two).
   Old word. See Mt 17:17; Ac 13:10.

   2:16 As lights in the world [hOs phOsteres en kosmOi]. As luminaries
   like the heavenly bodies. Christians are the light of the world (Mt
   5:14) as they reflect the light from Christ (Joh 1:4; 8:12), but here
   the word is not [phOs] (light), but [phOsteres] (luminaries, stars).
   The place for light is the darkness where it is needed. Holding forth
   [epechontes]. Present active participle of [epechO]. Probably not
   connected with the preceding metaphor in [phOsteres]. The old meaning
   of the verb [epechO] is to hold forth or to hold out (the word of life
   as here). The context seems to call for "holding fast." It occurs also
   with the sense of attending to (Ac 3:5). That I may have [emoi].
   Ethical dative, "to me as a ground of boasting."

   2:17 And if I am offered [ei kai spendomai]. Though I am poured out as
   a libation. Old word. In N.T. only here and 2Ti 4:6. Paul pictures his
   life-blood as being poured upon (uncertain whether heathen or Jewish
   offerings meant and not important) the sacrifice and service of the
   faith of the Philippians in mutual service and joy (both [chairO] and
   [sunchairO] twice in the sentence). Joy is mutual when the service is
   mutual. Young missionaries offer their lives as a challenge to other
   Christians to match their money with their blood.

   2:19 That I also may be of good comfort [hina kagO eupsuchO]. Present
   subjunctive with [hina] in purpose clause of the late and rare verb
   [eupsucheO], from [eupsuchos] (cheerful, of good spirit). In papyri and
   [eupsuchei] (be of good cheer) common in sepulchral inscriptions. When
   I know [gnous]. Second aorist active participle of [ginOskO].

   2:20 Likeminded [isopsuchon]. Old, but very rare adjective [isos,
   psuche], like [isotimos] in 2Pe 1:1. Only here in N.T. Likeminded with
   Timothy, not with Paul. Truly [gnesiOs]. "Genuinely." Old adverb, only
   here in N.T., from [gnesios] (Php 4:3), legitimate birth, not spurious.

   2:21 They all [hoi pantes]. "The whole of them." Surely Luke was away
   from Rome at this juncture.

   2:22 The proof [ten dokimen]. "The test" as of metals (2Co 2:9; 9:13).
   Three times they had seen Timothy (Ac 16:13; 19:22; 20:3f.). With me
   [sun emoi]. Paul's delicacy of feeling made him use [sun] rather than
   [emoi] alone. Timothy did not serve Paul. In furtherance of [eis]. See
   Php 1:5 for this use of [eis].

   2:23 So soon as I shall see [hOs an aphidO]. Indefinite temporal clause
   with [hOs an] and the second aorist active subjunctive of [aphoraO].
   The oldest MSS. (Aleph A B D) have [aphidO] (old aspirated form) rather
   than [apidO]. How it will go with me [ta peri eme]. On the force of
   [apo] with [horaO] (look away) see Heb 12:2. "The things concerning
   me," the outcome of the trial. Cf. 1Co 4:17, 19.

   2:24 In the Lord [en KuriOi]. Not a perfunctory use of this phrase.
   Paul's whole life is centred in Christ (Ga 2:20).

   2:25 I counted it [hegesamen]. Epistolary aorist from the point of view
   of the readers. Epaphroditus [Epaphroditon]. Common name, though only
   in Philippians in N.T., contracted into Epaphras, though not the same
   man as Epaphras in Col 1:7. Note one article [ton] (the) with the three
   epithets given in an ascending scale (Lightfoot), brother [adelphon],
   common sympathy), fellow-worker [sunergon], common work),
   fellow-soldier [sunstratiOten], common danger as in Phm 1:2). [Mou]
   (my) and [humOn] (your) come together in sharp contrast. Messenger
   [apostolon]. See 2Co 8:23 for this use of [apostolos] as messenger
   (missionary). Minister [leitourgon]. See on Ro 13:6; 15:16 for this
   ritualistic term.

   2:26 He longed after [epipothOn en]. Periphrastic imperfect of
   [epipotheO] (Php 1:8), "he was yearning after." You all [pantas humas].
   So again (1:5, 7, 8). Was sore troubled [ademonOn]. Periphrastic
   imperfect again (repeat [en] of the old word [ademoneO] either from an
   unused [ademOn] [a] privative and [demos], away from home, homesick) or
   from [ademOn, adesai] (discontent, bewilderment). The Vocabulary of
   Moulton and Milligan gives one papyrus example in line with the latter
   etymology. See already Mt 26:37; Mr 14:33. In any case the distress of
   Epaphroditus was greatly increased when he knew that the Philippians
   (the home-folks) had learned of his illness, "because ye had heard that
   he was sick" [dioti ekousate hoti esthenese], "because ye heard that he
   fell sick" (ingressive aorist). He was sick [esthenese]. Ingressive
   aorist, "he did become sick." Nigh unto death [paraplesion thanatOi].
   Only example in N.T. of this compound adverbial preposition (from the
   adjective [paraplesios] with the dative case.

   2:28 Ye may rejoice [charete]. Second aorist passive subjunctive with
   [hina] in final clause of [chairO], to rejoice. That I may be the less
   sorrowful [kagO alupoteros O]. Present subjunctive with [hina] and
   comparative of old compound adjective [alupos] [a] privative and
   [lupe], more free from grief). Beautiful expression of Paul's feelings
   for the Philippians and for Epaphroditus.

   2:29 In honour [entimous]. Old compound adjective [en, time], prized,
   precious (Lu 7:2; 14:8; 1Pe 2:4,6). Predicate accusative. Noble plea in
   behalf of Christ's minister.

   2:30 Hazarding his life [paraboleusamenos tei psuchei]. First aorist
   middle participle of [paraboleuO] (from the adjective [parabolos], to
   place beside. The old Greek writers used [paraballomai], to expose
   oneself to danger. But Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 88)
   cites an example of [paraboleusamenos] from an inscription at Olbia or
   the Black Sea of the second century A.D. where it plainly means
   "exposing himself to danger" as here. Lightfoot renders it here "having
   gambled with his life." The word [parabolani] (riskers) was applied to
   the Christians who risked their lives for the dying and the dead.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 Finally [to loipon]. Accusative of general reference, literally,
   "as for the rest." So again in 4:8. It (or just [loipon] is a common
   phrase towards the close of Paul's Epistles (2Th 3:1; 2Co 13:11). In
   Eph 6:10 we have [tou loipou] (genitive case). But Paul uses the idiom
   elsewhere also as in 1Co 7:29; 1Th 4:1 before the close of the letter
   is in sight. It is wholly needless to understand Paul as about to
   finish and then suddenly changing his mind like some preachers who
   announce the end a half dozen times. To write the same things [ta auta
   graphein]. Present active articular infinitive, "the going on writing
   the same things." What things? He has just used [chairete] (go on
   rejoicing) again and he will repeat it in 4:4. But in verse 2 he uses
   [blepete] three times. At any rate Paul, as a true teacher, is not
   afraid of repetition. Irksome [okneron]. Old adjective from [okneO], to
   delay, to hesitate. It is not tiresome to me to repeat what is "safe"
   [asphales] for you. Old adjective from [a] privative and [sphallO], to
   totter, to reel. See Ac 21:34.

   3:2 Beware [blepete]. Three times for urgency and with different
   epithet for the Judaizers each time. The dogs [tous kunas]. The Jews so
   termed the Gentiles which Jesus uses in a playful mood [kunariois],
   little dogs) to the Syro-Phoenician woman (Mt 15:26). Paul here turns
   the phrase on the Judaizers themselves. The evil workers [tous kakous
   ergatas]. He had already called the Judaizers "deceitful workers"
   [ergatai dolioi] in 2Co 11:13. The concision [ten katatomen]. Late word
   for incision, mutilation (in contrast with [peritome], circumcision).
   In Symmachus and an inscription. The verb [katatemnO] is used in the
   LXX only of mutilations (Le 21:5; 1Ki 18:28).

   3:3 For we [hemeis gar]. We believers in Christ, the children of
   Abraham by faith, whether Jew or Gentile, the spiritual circumcision in
   contrast to the merely physical (Ro 2:25-29; Col 2:11; Eph 2:11). See
   Ga 5:12 for [apotemnein] (to cut off) in sense of mutilation also. By
   the Spirit of God [pneumati theou]. Instrumental case, though the
   dative case as the object of [latreuO] makes good sense also
   (worshipping the Spirit of God) or even the locative (worshipping in
   the Spirit of God). No [ouk]. Actual condition rather than [me] with
   the participle. In the flesh [en sarki]. Technical term in Paul's
   controversy with the Judaizers (2Co 11:18; Gal 6:13f.). External
   privileges beyond mere flesh.

   3:4 Might have [echOn]. Rather, "even though myself having." Confidence
   [pepoithesin]. Late word, condemned by the Atticists, from [pepoitha]
   (just used). See 2Co 1:15; 3:4.

   3:5 Thinketh to have confidence [dokei pepoithenai]. Second perfect
   active infinitive. Old idiom, "seems to himself to have confidence."
   Later idiom like Mt 3:9 "think not to say" and 1Co 11:16, "thinks that
   he has ground of confidence in himself." I yet more [egO mallon]. "I
   have more ground for boasting than he" and Paul proceeds to prove it in
   the rest of verses 5, 6. Circumcised the eighth day [peritomei
   oktaemeros]. "In circumcision (locative case) an eighth day man." Use
   of the ordinal with persons like [tetartaios] (Joh 11:39). Ishmaelites
   were circumcised in the thirteenth year, proselytes from Gentiles in
   mature age, Jews on the eighth day (Lu 2:21). Of the stock of Israel
   [ek genous Israel]. Of the original stock, not a proselyte. Benjamin
   [Beniamin]. Son of the right hand (that is, left-handed), son of
   Rachel. The first King, Saul (Paul's own Hebrew name) was from this
   little tribe. The battle cry of Israel was "After thee, O Benjamin"
   (Jud 5:14). A Hebrew of the Hebrews [Ebraios ex EbraiOn]. Of Hebrew
   parents who retained the characteristic qualities in language and
   custom as distinct from the Hellenistic Jews (Ac 6:1). Paul was from
   Tarsus and knew Greek as well as Aramaic (Ac 21:40; 22:2) and Hebrew,
   but he had not become Hellenized. A Pharisee [Pharisaios]. In
   distinction from the Sadducees (Ga 1:14) and he continued a Pharisee in
   many essential matters like the doctrine of the resurrection (Ac 23:6).
   Cf. 2Co 11:22.

   3:6 As touching zeal [kata zelos]. So the old MSS. treating [zelos] as
   neuter, not masculine. He was a zealot against Christianity,
   "persecuting the church" [diOkOn ten ekklesian]. He was the ringleader
   in the persecution from the death of Stephen till his own conversion
   (Ac 8:1-9:9). Found blameless [genomenos amemptos]. "Having become
   blameless" (Ga 1:14). He knew and practised all the rules of the
   rabbis. A marvellous record, scoring a hundred in Judaism.

   3:7 Were gain to me [en moi kerde]. "Were gains (plural, see on 1:21)
   to me (ethical dative)." Paul had natural pride in his Jewish
   attainments. He was the star of hope for Gamaliel and the Sanhedrin.
   Have I counted [hegemai]. Perfect middle indicative, state of
   completion and still true. Loss [zemian]. Old word for damage, loss. In
   N.T. only in Phil. and Ac 27:10,21. Debit side of the ledger, not
   credit.

   3:8 Yea, verily, and [alla men oun ge kai]. Five particles before Paul
   proceeds (yea, indeed, therefore, at least, even), showing the force
   and passion of his conviction. He repeats his affirmation with the
   present middle indicative [hegoumai], "I still count all things loss
   for the excellency of the knowledge [to huperechon], the
   surpassingness, neuter articular participle of [huperechO], Php 2:3) of
   Christ Jesus my Lord." Dung [skubala]. Late word of uncertain
   etymology, either connected with [skOr] (dung) or from [es kunas
   ballO], to fling to the dogs and so refuse of any kind. It occurs in
   the papyri. Here only in the N.T. That I may gain Christ [hina Christon
   kerdesO]. First aorist active subjunctive of [kerdaO], Ionic form for
   [kerdainO] with [hina] in purpose clause. Paul was never satisfied with
   his knowledge of Christ and always craved more fellowship with him.

   3:9 Be found in him [heurethO en autOi]. First aorist (effective)
   passive subjunctive with [hina] of [heuriskO]. At death (2Co 5:3) or
   when Christ comes. Cf. 2:8; Ga 2:17. Through faith in Christ [dia
   pisteOs Christou]. The objective genitive [Christou], not subjective,
   as in Ga 2:16,20; Ro 3:22. Explained further by [epi tei pistei] (on
   the basis of faith) as in Ac 3:16.

   3:10 That I may know him [tou gnOnai auton]. Genitive of the articular
   second aorist (ingressive) active infinitive (purpose) of [ginOskO], to
   have personal acquaintance or experience with. This is Paul's major
   passion, to get more knowledge of Christ by experience. The power of
   his resurrection [ten dunamin tes anastaseOs autou]. Power (Lightfoot)
   in the sense of assurance to believers in immortality (1Co 15:14f.; Ro
   8:11), in the triumph over sin (Ro 4:24f.), in the dignity of the body
   (1Co 6:13ff.; Php 3:21), in stimulating the moral and spiritual life
   (Ga 2:20; Ro 6:4f.; Col 2:12; Eph 2:5). See Westcott's The Gospel of
   the Resurrection, ii, 31. The fellowship of his sufferings [ten
   koinOnian tOn pathematOn autou]. Partnership in (objective genitive)
   his sufferings, an honour prized by Paul (Co 1:24). Becoming conformed
   to his death [summorphizomenos tOi thanatOi autou]. Present passive
   participle of [summorphizO], late verb from [summorphos], found only
   here and ecclesiastical writers quoting it. The Latin Vulgate uses
   configuro. See Ro 6:4 for [sumphutoi] in like sense and 2Co 4:10. "The
   agony of Gethsemane, not less than the agony of Calvary, will be
   reproduced however faintly in the faithful servant of Christ"
   (Lightfoot). "In this passage we have the deepest secrets of the
   Apostle's Christian experience unveiled" (Kennedy).

   3:11 If by any means I may attain [ei pOs katantesO]. Not an expression
   of doubt, but of humility (Vincent), a modest hope (Lightfoot). For [ei
   pOs], see Ro 1:10; 11:14 where [parazelOsO] can be either future
   indicative or aorist subjunctive like [katantesO] here (see subjunctive
   [katalabO] in verse 12), late compound verb [katantaO]. Resurrection
   [exanastasin]. Late word, not in LXX, but in Polybius and one papyrus
   example. Apparently Paul is thinking here only of the resurrection of
   believers out from the dead and so double [ex] [ten exanastasin ten ek
   nekrOn]. Paul is not denying a general resurrection by this language,
   but emphasizing that of believers.

   3:12 Not that [ouch hoti]. To guard against a misunderstanding as in
   Joh 6:26; 12:6; 2Co 1:24; Php 4:11, 17. I have already obtained [ede
   elabon]. Rather, "I did already obtain," constative second aorist
   active indicative of [lambanO], summing up all his previous experiences
   as a single event. Or am already made perfect [e ede teteleiOmai].
   Perfect passive indicative (state of completion) of [teleioO], old verb
   from [teleios] and that from [telos] (end). Paul pointedly denies that
   he has reached a spiritual impasse of non- development. Certainly he
   knew nothing of so-called sudden absolute perfection by any single
   experience. Paul has made great progress in Christlikeness, but the
   goal is still before him, not behind him. But I press on [diOkO de]. He
   is not discouraged, but encouraged. He keeps up the chase (real idea in
   [diOkO], as in 1Co 14:1; Ro 9:30; 1Ti 6:11). If so be that [ei kai]. "I
   follow after." The condition (third class, [ei?katalabO], second aorist
   active subjunctive of [katalambanO] is really a sort of purpose clause
   or aim. There are plenty of examples in the Koine of the use of [ei]
   and the subjunctive as here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1017), "if I also
   may lay hold of that for which [eph' hOi], purpose expressed by [epi] I
   was laid hold of [katelemphthen], first aorist passive of the same verb
   [katalambanO] by Christ Jesus." His conversion was the beginning, not
   the end of the chase.

   3:13 Not yet [oupO]. But some MSS. read [ou] (not). To have apprehended
   [kateilephenai]. Perfect active infinitive of same verb [katalambanO]
   (perfective use of [kata], to grasp completely). Surely denial enough.
   But one thing [hen de]. No verb in the Greek. We can supply [poiO] (I
   do) or [diOkO] (I keep on in the chase), but no verb is really needed.
   "When all is said, the greatest art is to limit and isolate oneself"
   (Goethe), concentration. Forgetting the things which are behind [ta men
   opisO epilanthanomenos]. Common verb, usually with the genitive, but
   the accusative in the Koine is greatly revived with verbs. Paul can
   mean either his old pre-Christian life, his previous progress as a
   Christian, or both (all of it). Stretching forward [epekteinomenos].
   Present direct middle participle of the old double compound [epekteinO]
   (stretching myself out towards). Metaphor of a runner leaning forward
   as he runs.

   3:14 Toward the goal [kata skopon]. "Down upon the goal," who is Jesus
   himself to whom we must continually look as we run (Heb 12:2). The word
   means a watchman, then the goal or mark. Only here in N.T. Unto the
   prize [eis to brabeion]. Late word (Menander and inscriptions) from
   [brabeus] (umpire who awards the prize). In N.T. only here and 1Co
   9:24. Of the high calling [tes anO kleseOs]. Literally, "of the upward
   calling." The goal continually moves forward as we press on, but yet
   never out of sight.

   3:15 As many as be perfect [hosoi teleioi]. Here the term [teleioi]
   means relative perfection, not the absolute perfection so pointedly
   denied in verse 12. Paul here includes himself in the group of
   spiritual adults (see He 5:13). Let us be thus minded [touto
   phronOmen]. Present active volitive subjunctive of [phroneO]. "Let us
   keep on thinking this," viz. that we have not yet attained absolute
   perfection. If ye are otherwise minded [ei ti heterOs phroneite].
   Condition of first class, assumed as true. That is, if ye think that ye
   are absolutely perfect. Shall God reveal unto you [ho theos humin
   apokalupsei]. He turns such cases over to God. What else can he do with
   them? Whereunto we have already come [eis ho ephthasamen]. First aorist
   active indicative of [phthanO], originally to come before as in 1Th
   4:15, but usually in the Koine simply to arrive, attain to, as here.

   3:16 By that same rule let us walk [tOi autOi stoichein] Aleph A B do
   not have [kanoni] (rule). Besides [stoichein] is the absolute present
   active infinitive which sometimes occurs instead of the principal verb
   as in Ro 12:15. Paul means simply this that, having come thus far, the
   thing to do is to go "in the same path" [tOi autOi] in which we have
   been travelling so far. A needed lesson for Christians weary with the
   monotony of routine in religious life and work.

   3:17 Imitators together of me [sunmimetai mou]. Found only here so far,
   though Plato uses [summimeisthai]. "Vie with each other in imitating
   me" (Lightfoot). Mark [skopeite]. Old verb from [skopos] (verse 14).
   "Keep your eyes on me as goal." Mark and follow, not avoid as in Ro
   16:17. An ensample [tupon]. Originally the impression left by a stroke
   (Joh 20:25), then a pattern (mould) as here (cf. 1Th 1:7; 1Co 10:6,11;
   Ro 5:14; 6:17).

   3:18 I told you often [pollakis elegon]. Imperfect active, repetition
   in Paul s warnings to them. Even weeping [kai klaiOn]. Deep emotion as
   he dictated the letter and recalled these recreant followers of Christ
   (cf. 2Co 2:4). The enemies of the cross of Christ [tous echthrous tou
   staurou tou Christou]. Either the Judaizers who denied the value of the
   cross of Christ (Ga 5:11; 6:12,14) or Epicurean antinomians whose loose
   living gave the lie to the cross of Christ (1Jo 2:4).

   3:19 Whose god is the belly [hou to theos he koilia]. The comic poet
   Eupolis uses the rare word [KoiliodaimOn] for one who makes a god of
   his belly and Seneca speaks of one who abdomini servit. Sensuality in
   food, drink, sex then as now mastered some men. These men posed as
   Christians and gloried in their shame. Who mind earthly things [hoi ta
   epigeia phronountes]. Anacoluthon. The nominative does not refer to
   [polloi] at the beginning, but with the accusative [tous echthrous] in
   between. See Mr 12:40.

   3:20 Our citizenship [hemOn to politeuma]. Old word from [piliteuO]
   (Php 1:27), but only here in N.T. The inscriptions use it either for
   citizenship or for commonwealth. Paul was proud of his Roman
   citizenship and found it a protection. The Philippians were also proud
   of their Roman citizenship. But Christians are citizens of a kingdom
   not of this world (Joh 18:36). Milligan (Vocabulary) doubts if
   commentators are entitled to translate it here: "We are a colony of
   heaven," because such a translation reverses the relation between the
   colony and the mother city. But certainly here Paul's heart is in
   heaven. We wait for [apekdechometha]. Rare and late double compound
   (perfective use of prepositions like wait out) which vividly pictures
   Paul's eagerness for the second coming of Christ as the normal attitude
   of the Christian colonist whose home is heaven.

   3:21 Shall fashion anew [metaschematisei]. Future active indicative of
   [metaschematizO] for which see 1Co 4:6; 2Co 11:13ff. Conformed to
   [summorphon]. For which [sun, morphe] see Ro 8:29, only N.T. examples.
   With associative instrumental case. The body of our state of
   humiliation will be made suitable to associate with the body of
   Christ's glory (1Co 15:54f.). According to the working [kata ten
   energeian]. "According to the energy." If any one doubts the power of
   Christ to do this transformation, Paul replies that he has power "even
   to subject all things unto himself."

Chapter 4

   4:1 Longed for [epipothetoi]. Late and rare verbal adjective (here
   alone in N.T.) from [epipotheO]. So stand fast [houto stekete]. Present
   active imperative of [stekO] (late present from perfect [hesteka] from
   [histemi]. See 1:27. They were tempted to defection. Standing firm is
   difficult when a panic starts.

   4:2 Euodia [Euodian]. This name means literally "prosperous journey"
   [eu, hodos]. It occurs in the inscriptions. Syntyche [Suntuchen]. From
   [suntugchanO], to meet with and so "pleasant acquaintance" or
   "good-luck." Occurs in the inscriptions and identified with Lydia by
   some. Klopper suggests that each of these rival women had church
   assemblies in their homes, one a Jewish-Christian church, the other a
   Gentile-Christian church. Vincent doubts the great influence of women
   in Macedonia held by Lightfoot who also suggests that these two were
   ladies of rank or perhaps deaconesses of the church in Philippi. Schinz
   suggests that in such a pure church even slight bickerings would make a
   real disturbance. "It may have been accidental friction between two
   energetic Christian women" (Kennedy).

   4:3 True yokefellow [gnesie sunzuge]. All sorts of suggestions have
   been made here, one that it was Lydia who is termed Paul's wife by the
   word [sunzuge]. Unfortunately for that view [gnesie] is masculine
   vocative singular. Some have suggested it as a proper name though it is
   not found in the inscriptions, but the word does occur as an
   appellative in one. Lightfoot even proposes Epaphroditus, the bearer of
   the Epistle, certainly a curious turn to take to address him. After all
   it matters little that we do not know who the peacemaker was. Help
   these women [sunlambanou autais]. Present middle imperative of
   [sunlambanO], to seize (Mt 26:55), to conceive (Lu 1:24), then to take
   hold together with one (associative instrumental case), to help as here
   (Lu 5:7). "Take hold with them." They laboured with me [sunethlesan
   moi]. First aorist active indicative of [sunathleO] (for which see
   1:27) with associative instrumental case [moi]. With Clement also [meta
   kai Klementos]. There is no evidence that he was Clement of Rome as the
   name is common. In the book of life [en biblOi zOes]. The only instance
   of this expression in the N.T. outside of the Apocalypse (3:5; 13:8;
   17:8, etc.). Hence real Christians in spite of their bickerings.

   4:4 Again I will say [palin erO]. Future active indicative of defective
   verb [eipon]. Rejoice [chairete]. Present active imperative as in 3:1,
   repeated for emphasis in spite of discouragements. Not in the sense of
   "Farewell" here.

   4:5 Your forbearance [to epieikes humOn]. "Your gentleness," "your
   sweet reasonableness" (Matthew Arnold), "your moderation." Old
   adjective [epi, eikos] as in Jas 3:17; 1Ti 3:3. Article and neuter
   singular here= [he epieikeia] (Ac 24:4; 2Co 10:1) like to [chreston] in
   Ro 2:4. The Lord is at hand [ho kurios eggus]. "The Apostle's
   watchword" (Lightfoot), as in 1Co 16:22 [Maran atha], Aramaic
   equivalent, Our Lord cometh). Unless, indeed, [eggus] here means near
   in space instead of nigh in time.

   4:6 In nothing be anxious [meden merimnate]. Present imperative in
   prohibition, "stop being anxious." See [me merimnate] in Mt 6:31. With
   thanksgiving [meta eucharistias]. In all the forms of prayer here named
   thanksgiving should appear.

   4:7 The peace of God [he eirene tou theou]. See in 2Th 3:16 "the Lord
   of peace" [ho Kurios tes eirenes] and verse 9 for "the God of peace"
   [ho theos tes eirenes]. Shall guard [phrouresei]. "Shall garrison,"
   future active indicative of [phroureO], old verb from [phrouros]
   [pro-horos, prooraO], to see before, to look out). See Ac 9:24; 2Co
   11:32. God's peace as a sentinel mounts guard over our lives as
   Tennyson so beautifully pictures Love as doing.

   4:8 Finally [to loipon]. See on 3:1. Whatsoever [hosa]. Thus he
   introduces six adjectives picturing Christian ideals, old-fashioned and
   familiar words not necessarily from any philosophic list of moral
   excellencies Stoic or otherwise. Without these no ideals can exist.
   They are pertinent now when so much filth is flaunted before the world
   in books, magazines and moving-pictures under the name of realism (the
   slime of the gutter and the cess-pool). Honourable [semna]. Old word
   from [sebO], to worship, revere. So revered, venerated (1Ti 3:8). Pure
   [hagna]. Old word for all sorts of purity. There are clean things,
   thoughts, words, deeds. Lovely [prosphile]. Old word, here only in
   N.T., from [pros] and [phileO], pleasing, winsome. Of good report
   [euphema]. Old word, only here in N.T., from [eu] and [pheme],
   fair-speaking, attractive. If there be any [ei tis]. Paul changes the
   construction from [hosa] (whatsoever) to a condition of the first
   class, as in 2:1, with two substantives. Virtue [arete]. Old word,
   possibly from [areskO], to please, used very often in a variety of
   senses by the ancients for any mental excellence or moral quality or
   physical power. Its very vagueness perhaps explains its rarity in the
   N.T., only four times (Php 4:8; 1Pe 2:9; 2Pe 1:3,5). It is common in
   the papyri, but probably Paul is using it in the sense found in the LXX
   (Isa 42:12; 43:21) of God's splendour and might (Deissmann, Bible
   Studies, p. 95) in connection with "praise" [epainos] as here or even
   meaning praise. Think on these things [tauta logizesthe]. Present
   middle imperative for habit of thought. We are responsible for our
   thoughts and can hold them to high and holy ideals.

   4:9 In me [en emoi]. Paul dares to point to his life in Philippi as an
   illustration of this high thinking. The preacher is the interpreter of
   the spiritual life and should be an example of it. These things do
   [tauta prassete]. Practise as a habit [prassO], not [poieO].

   4:10 I rejoice [echaren]. Second aorist passive indicative of [chairO],
   a timeless aorist. I did rejoice, I do rejoice. Greatly [megalOs]. Old
   adverb, only here in N.T., from [megas] (great). Now at length [ede
   pote]. In N.T. only here and Ro 1:10. [Pote] is indefinite past
   (interval), [ede] immediate present. Ye have revived [anethalete].
   Second aorist active indicative of old poetic word (Homer),
   [anathallO], to sprout again, to shoot up, to blossom again. So in the
   LXX five times, though rare and literary word. Your thought for me [to
   huper emou phronein]. Accusative case of the articular present active
   infinitive the object of [anethalete] used transitively. "You caused
   your thinking of me to bloom afresh." Wherein [eph' hOi]. "In which,"
   "upon which" (locative case). A loose reference to Paul's interests as
   involved in their thinking of him. Ye did indeed take thought [kai
   ephroneite]. Imperfect active, "ye were also (or had been also)
   thinking." Ye lacked opportunity [ekaireisthe]. Imperfect middle of
   [akaireomai], late and rare word, here only in N.T., from [akairos] [a]
   privative, [kairos], not to have a chance, the opposite of [eukaireO]
   (Mr 6:31).

   4:11 In respect of want [kath' husteresin]. Late and rare word from
   [hustereO], to be behind or too late, only here and Mr 12:44 in N.T. I
   have learned [emathon]. Simply, "I did learn" (constative second aorist
   active indicative of [manthanO], to learn, looking at his long
   experience as a unit). In whatsoever state I am [en hois eimi]. "In
   what things (circumstances) I am." To be content [autarkes einai].
   Predicate nominative with the infinitive of the old adjective
   [autarkes] (from [autos] and [arkeO], to be self-sufficient),
   self-sufficing. Favourite word with the Stoics, only here in N.T.,
   though [autarkeia] occurs in 2Co 9:8; 1Ti 6:6. Paul is contented with
   his lot and he learned that lesson long ago. Socrates said as to who is
   wealthiest: "He that is content with least, for [autarkeia] is nature's
   wealth."

   4:12 I know how [oida]. Followed by the infinitive [oida] has this
   sense. So here twice, with [tapeinousthai], to be humbled, from
   [tapeinos], and with [perisseuein], to overflow. Have I learned the
   secret [memuemai]. Perfect passive indicative of [mueO], old and common
   word from [muO], to close (Latin mutus), and so to initiate with secret
   rites, here only in N.T. The common word [musterion] (mystery) is from
   [mustes] (one initiated) and this from [mueO], to initiate, to instruct
   in secrets. Paul draws this metaphor from the initiatory rites of the
   pagan mystery-religions. To be filled [chortazesthai]. Old verb from
   [chortos] (grass, hay) and so to fatten like an animal. To be hungry
   [peinain]. Old verb from [peina] (hunger) and kin to [penes], poor man
   who has to work for his living [penomai].

   4:13 I can do all things [panta ischuO]. Old verb to have strength
   [ischus]. In him that strengtheneth me [en tOi endunamounti me]. Late
   and rare verb (in LXX) from adjective [endunamos] [en, dunamis].
   Causative verb to empower, to pour power into one. See same phrase in
   1Ti 1:12 [tOi endunamOsanti me] (aorist tense here). Paul has such
   strength so long as Jesus keeps on putting power [dunamis] into him.

   4:14 That ye had fellowship [sunkoinOnesantes]. First aorist active
   participle (simultaneous action with the principal verb [kalOs
   epoiesate]. "Ye did well contributing for my affliction."

   4:15 In the beginning of the gospel [en archei tou euaggeliou]. After
   he had wrought in Philippi (2Th 2:13). Had fellowship [ekoinOnesen].
   "Had partnership" (first aorist active indicative). In the matter [eis
   logon]. "As to an account." No other church opened an account with
   Paul. Of giving and receiving [doseOs kai lempseOs]. Credit and debit.
   A mercantile metaphor repeated in verse 17 by [eis logon humOn] (to
   your account). Paul had to keep books then with no other church, though
   later Thessalonica and Beroea joined Philippi in support of Paul's work
   in Corinth (2Co 11:8f.). But ye only [ei me humeis monoi]. Not even
   Antioch contributed anything but good wishes and prayers for Paul's
   work (Ac 13:1-3).

   4:16 Once and again [kai hapax kai dis]. "Both once and twice" they did
   it "even in Thessalonica" and so before Paul went to Corinth." See the
   same Greek idiom in 1Th 2:18.

   4:17 I seek for [epizetO]. Old verb, in N.T. only here and Ro 11:7
   (linear present, I am seeking for). Lightfoot calls it "the Apostle's
   nervous anxiety to clear himself" of wanting more gifts. Why not say
   his delicate courtesy?

   4:18 I have all things [apechO panta]. As a receipt in full in
   appreciation of their kindness. [ApechO] is common in the papyri and
   the ostraca for "receipt in full" (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 110).
   See Mt 6:2, 5, 16. I am filled [peplerOmai]. Perfect passive indicative
   of [pleroO]. "Classical Greek would hardly use the word in this
   personal sense" (Kennedy). An odour of a sweet smell [osmen euOdias].
   [Osme], old word from [ozO], to smell. [EuOdia], old word from [eu] and
   [ozO]. In Eph 5:2 both words come together as here and in 2Co 2:15 we
   have [euOdia] (only other N.T. example) and in verse 2Co 2:16 [osme]
   twice. [EuOdias] here is genitive of quality. Sacrifice [thusian]. Not
   the act, but the offering as in Ro 12:1. Well-pleasing [euareston]. As
   in Ro 12:1.

   4:19 According to his riches in glory [kata to ploutos autou en doxei].
   God has an abundant treasure in glory and will repay the Philippians
   for what they have done for Paul. The spiritual reward is what spurs
   men into the ministry and holds them to it.

   4:20 The glory [he doxa]. "The doxology flows out of the joy of the
   whole epistle" (Bengel).

   4:21 They that are of Caesar's household [hoi ek tes Kaisaros oikias].
   Not members of the imperial family, but some connected with the
   imperial establishment. The term can apply to slaves and freedmen and
   even to the highest functionaries. Christianity has begun to undermine
   the throne of the Caesars. Some day a Christian will sit on this
   throne. The gospel works upward from the lower classes. lt was so at
   Corinth and in Rome. It is true today. It is doubtful if Nero had yet
   heard of Paul for his case may have been dismissed by lapse of time.
   But this obscure prisoner who has planted the gospel in Caesar's
   household has won more eternal fame and power than all the Caesars
   combined. Nero will commit suicide shortly after Paul has been
   executed. Nero's star went down and Paul's rose and rises still.
