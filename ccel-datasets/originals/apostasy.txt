Prefatory note.

   It is not uncommon for Christians, in a desponding mood, to ascribe
   unusual degeneracy in morals and religion to their own age. The sudden
   change, however, from the strict decorum of the Commonwealth to the
   license which marked the reign of Charles II has often been the subject
   of speculation and inquiry. Mr Macaulay thus confirms our author's
   estimate of the rapid decline of morality at this time:-- "A change
   still more important took place in the morals and manners of the
   community. Those passions and tastes which, under the rule of the
   Puritans, had been sternly repressed, and, if gratified at all, had
   been gratified by stealth, broke forth with ungovernable violence as
   soon as the cheek was withdrawn." -- Hist. of Eng., vol. i. p. 179. The
   historian, dealing with the surface of affairs rather than with the
   springs of conduct, may account the vulgar theory of a reaction against
   enforced strictness sufficient to explain this sudden lowering of the
   moral tone of a community; and in regard to a portion of society the
   theory may be admitted to be correct. The causes of the change,
   however, must have lain deeper; the blighting influence extended even
   into Puritan circles, where the contamination of courtly vices could
   hardly reach, and where early training would countervail any cessation
   of restraint, and beyond Britain, into other countries, where a similar
   decline can be traced, for which it is impossible to account simply on
   the principle of a reaction. Puritan decorum might as well be said to
   have been a mere reaction against such irreligious frivolity as bore
   the stamp of royal sanction in the "Book of Sports." Besides, the
   austerity ascribed to the Puritans is absurdly exaggerated; many a
   glimpse we possess into their domestic life shows that in reality it
   was the chosen scene of every genial influence, and household
   affections never appeared to more advantage than in the families of the
   Henrys. Owen, with his usual wisdom, avoids the extreme generalization
   that would resolve the complex apostasy of his age into any one
   predominant cause, and reviews in succession various influences which
   conspired to produce the result deplored. His treatise will be found to
   be a successful treatment of a deeply interesting question; and it
   closes in a strain of solemn appeal, appropriate to a work written,
   according to its author, "amid prayers and tears."

   It is in substance an expansion of his commentary on Heb. vi. 4-6; and
   his Exposition on this passage is accordingly brief and meagre, having
   been forestalled by the publication of this treatise. Doddridge seems
   to regard it as most replete with the characteristic excellencies of
   Owen. "Owen's style," he remarks, "resembles St Paul's. There is great
   zeal and much knowledge of human life discovered in all his works,
   especially in his book on Apostasy. The Means of Understanding the Mind
   of God' is one of his best."

  Analysis.

   The basis of the discourse is Heb. vi. 4-6; and inquiry is made, -- 1.
   Into the connection of the words; 2. The persons spoken of; 3. The
   supposition implied respecting them; and, 4. The truth affirmed on that
   supposition, chap. i. A charge of partial, as distinguished from final
   and complete apostasy, is adduced against all the churches and nations
   of Christendom; the claim of the Church of Rome to be indefectible is
   refuted, ii. I. Apostasy from the doctrines of the gospel is
   illustrated by facts in the history of the ancient church, and by the
   predictions of the a apostles, who foretold, -- 1. That the teachers of
   the gospel would soon corrupt its simplicity, by an admixture of vain
   philosophy; 2. That heresies would arise, consisting of unintelligible
   vagaries, as Gnosticism, and affecting the person of Christ, as
   Arianism, or the grace of Christ, as Pelagianism; 3. That men would be
   impatient of sound doctrine; and, 4. That the mystery of iniquity would
   continue to be developed till it reached its consummation in the
   Papacy. Apostasy is traced in the decline of the zealous orthodoxy of
   the Reformation, the rise of Arminianism and Socinianism, and kindred
   errors, iii. The causes of this declension from orthodoxy in Britain
   are enumerated:-- 1. Rooted enmity to spiritual things; 2. Spiritual
   ignorance on the part of men who possess some knowledge, and make a
   profession of the truth; 3. Pride of heart; 4. Careless security; 5.
   Love of the world. 6. The influence of Satan; and lastly, Judicial
   blindness, iv.-vi. Particular reasons are assigned for such defection
   from the truth:-- ignorance of the necessity for the mediation of
   Christ, want of spiritual views of the excellency of Christ in his
   person and offices, inexperience of the efficacy of the Spirit,
   ignorance of the righteousness of God, reluctance to admit the
   sovereignty of God, and an incapacity to discern the self-evidencing
   power of the Word, vii. II. Apostasy from the holiness of the gospel is
   next considered theoretically, in reference, -- 1. To the morals of
   Romanism, defective because inconsistent with spiritual freedom:
   founded on human rules and systems, capable of being observed without
   faith in Christ, and pervaded by the vitiating principle of merit and
   supererogation; 2. To those who confine the whole of obedience to
   morality; and 3. To those who pretend to perfection in this life. The
   causes of this kind of apostasy are mentioned, viii. Practical apostasy
   into open profanity and vice is traced to defects in the public
   teachers of religion; the false appropriation of names and titles, as
   when men living in sin claim to be "The Church;" evil example in high
   places; the influence of persecution; want of due watchfulness against
   national vices; ignorance of the spiritual beauty of religion; the
   operations of Satan; and the scandal created by the strictest
   professors of religion through their divisions and inactivity in good
   works and offices, ix., x. III. Apostasy from purity of worship is
   exhibited, in the neglect of what God has appointed, and by additions
   which he has not appointed, in the ordinances of the gospel, xi. The
   danger arising from the prevailing apostasy is declared, and directions
   are given in order to escape being involved in it, xii., xiii. -- Ed.

To the Reader.

   Some brief account of the occasion and design of the ensuing discourse
   I judge due unto the reader, that, upon a prospect of them, he may
   either proceed in its perusal or desist, as he shall see cause.

   That the state of religion is at this day deplorable in most parts of
   the Christian world is acknowledged by all who concern themselves in
   any thing that is so called; yea, the enormities of some are come to
   that excess that others publicly complain of them, who, without the
   countenance of their more bold provocations, would themselves be judged
   no small part or cause of the evils to be complained of. However, this,
   on all hands, will, as I suppose, be agreed unto, that among the
   generality of professed Christians, the glory and power of Christianity
   are faded and almost utterly lost, though the reasons and causes
   thereof are not agreed upon; for however some few may please themselves
   in supposing nothing to be wanting unto a good state of things in
   religion, but only security in what they are and enjoy, yet the whole
   world is so evidently filled with the dreadful effects of the lusts of
   men, and sad tokens of divine displeasure, that all things from above
   and here below proclaim the degeneracy of our religion, in its
   profession, from its pristine beauty and glory. Religion is the same
   that ever it was, only it suffers by them that make profession of it.
   Whatever disadvantage it falls under in the world, they must at length
   answer for in whose misbelief and practice it is corrupted. And no man
   can express a greater enmity unto or malice against the gospel, than he
   that should assert or maintain that the faith, profession, lives, ways,
   and walkings of the generality of Christians are a just representation
   of its truth and holiness. The description which the apostle gives of
   men in their principles, dispositions, and actings, before there hath
   been any effectual influence on their minds and lives from the light,
   power, and grace of the gospel, is much more applicable unto them than
   any thing that is spoken of the disciples of Christ in the whole book
   of God: "Foolish are they, and disobedient, deceived, serving divers
   lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
   another." The way, paths, and footsteps of gospel faith, love,
   meekness, temperance, self-denial, benignity, humility, zeal, and
   contempt of the world, in the honours, profits, and pleasures of it,
   with readiness for the cross, are all [so] overgrown, and almost worn
   out amongst men, that they can hardly be discerned where they have
   been. But in their stead the "works of the flesh" have made a broad and
   open road, that the multitude travel in, which, though it may be right
   for a season in their own eyes, yet is the way to hell, and goeth down
   to the chambers of death; for these "works of the flesh are manifest"
   in the world, not only in their nature, what they are, but in their
   open perpetration and dismal effects: such are "adultery, fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
   emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
   drunkenness, revellings, and such like," as they are reckoned up by the
   apostle. How these things have spread themselves over the face of the
   Christian world, among all sorts of persons, is manifest beyond all
   contradiction or pretence to the contrary. And that so it should come
   to pass in the latter times is both expressly and frequently foretold
   in the Scripture, as in the ensuing discourse will be more fully
   declared.

   Many, indeed, there are who are not given up in the course of their
   lives unto the open practice of such abominations; and therefore, in
   that grand defection from the truth and holiness of the gospel which is
   so prevalent in the world, the grace of God is greatly to be admired,
   even in the small remainders of piety, sobriety, and modesty, and
   common usefulness that are yet left among us. But those openly
   flagitious courses are not the only way whereby men may fall off from,
   and even renounce, the power, grace, and wisdom of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. For even of those who will not "run out to the same excess of
   riot" with other men, the most are so ignorant of the mysteries of the
   gospel, so negligent or formal in divine worship, so infected with
   pride, vanity, and love of the world, so regardless of the glory of
   Christ and honour of the gospel, that it is no easy thing to find
   Christian religion in the midst of professed Christians, or the power
   of godliness among them who openly avow the form thereof.

   By this means is Christianity brought into so great neglect in the
   world, that its great and subtle adversary seems encouraged to attempt
   the ruining of its very foundations, that the name of it should no more
   be had in remembrance; for wherever religion is taken off from a solid
   consistency by its power in the lives and minds of men, when it hath no
   other tenure but an outward, unenlivened profession, and the secular
   interest of its professors, it will not long abide the shock of that
   opposition which it is continually exposed unto. And whilst things are
   in this state, those who seem to have any concernment therein are so
   engaged in mutual charging one another with being occasions thereof,
   mostly on such principles of difference in judgment as have no
   considerable influence thereinto, as that a joint endeavour after
   proper remedies is utterly neglected.

   And there is yet another consideration rendering the present state of
   Christian religion in the world yet more deplorable. The only principle
   of evangelical obedience is sacred truth, and our faith therein. That
   alone is "the doctrine which is according to godliness;" and all
   acceptable obedience unto God is "the obedience of faith." Whatever men
   do or pretend unto in a way of duty unto him, whereof the truth of the
   gospel is not the spring and measure, which is not guided and animated
   thereby, it is not what God at present requireth, nor what he will
   eternally reward. Wherefore, although men may, and multitudes do, under
   a profession of that truth, live in open rebellion against its power,
   yet the wounds of religion are not incurable nor its stains indelible,
   whilst the proper remedy is owned and wants only due application. But
   if this truth itself be corrupted or deserted, if its most glorious
   mysteries be abused or despised, if its most important doctrines be
   impeached of error and falsehood, and if the vain imaginations and
   carnal reasonings of the serpentine wits of men be substituted in their
   room or exalted above them, what hope is there of a recovery? the
   breach will grow like the sea, until there be none to heal it. If the
   fountains of the waters of the sanctuary be poisoned in their first
   rising, they will not heal the nations unto whom they come. Where the
   doctrine of truth is corrupted, the hearts of men will not be changed
   by it nor their lives reformed.

   How all this hath come to pass in the apostasy of the Roman church, and
   what multitudes of professed Christians are carried down the stream of
   that defection, is acknowledged among us who are called Protestants.
   How, therein, by various degrees, the corruption of the doctrine of the
   gospel gave occasion unto the depravation of men's manners on the one
   hand, and the wickedness of men's lives on the other hand, led the way
   unto, and served to make necessary, a farther perverting of the
   doctrine itself, until at length it is hard to determine whether the
   multiplied errors of that church have made the reintroduction of true
   holiness and evangelical obedience, or the corrupt, worldly
   conversation of the generality of the members of its communion has
   rendered the restoration of truth, more difficult and unpracticable in
   their present station, is in part declared in the ensuing discourses,
   and deserves yet a more particular and distinct inquiry into. In
   general, certain it is that as error, with superstition, on the one
   hand, in the minds of the teachers or guides of the church, and sin,
   with conformity unto the ways, manners, and course of the present evil
   world in the body of the people, were mutually assistant unto their
   joint introduction into the profession and lives of Christians; so
   having possessed themselves of the visible church-state of many
   nations, they are so interwoven in their interests as to be mutually
   assistant to the exclusion of that truth and holiness which they have
   dispossessed. And whereas, moreover, they have found out the pretence
   of infallibility, stretched wide enough, in their own apprehensions, to
   cover, patronize, and justify the most enormous errors and highest
   inconformity of life unto the gospel, all hopes of their recovery are
   utterly defeated, but what are placed on the sovereign grace and
   almighty power of God.

   That there is also another endeavour of the same kind, and for the same
   general end, -- namely, to corrupt the doctrine of the gospel, --
   though in another way, and unto another extreme, vigorously carried on
   in the world by the Socinians, and those who either absolutely or for
   the most part comply with them in their pernicious ways, is no less
   known, nor ought to be much less bewailed; for this endeavour also is
   attended with many advantages to give it success. The corruption of the
   doctrine of the gospel in the Roman church, as it sprang out of the
   ignorance, darkness, superstition, and carnal affections of the minds
   of men, so it is by the same means preserved. But although those
   things, in those ages and places where they abounded, gave sufficient
   and effectual advantage to its gradual introduction, and although the
   principles of it be now so inlaid with the secular interests of the
   generality of mankind in most of the nations in Europe as to secure its
   station and possessions; yet, in that emancipation of reason from under
   the bond of superstition and tradition, in that liberty of rational
   inquiry into the true nature and causes of all things, in that refusal
   to captivate their understandings in religion to the bare authority of
   men no wiser than themselves, which all pretend unto at present who
   dare venture on an ordinary converse in the world, it may seem
   marvellous how it should get ground and enlarge its territories, unless
   it be among them who are evidently bought off from themselves and from
   under the conduct of their own minds by some outward advantages, which
   they look upon as a valuable consideration. The true reasons hereof are
   inquired into in the ensuing discourse. But this new attempt, despising
   the baffled aids of superstition and carnal affections, which were in
   former ages predominant and effectual, takes shelter under a pretence
   of reason, and the suitableness of what is proposed in it unto the
   natural light and understandings of men. Whatever there is or is not in
   this matter of the relation that is between religion and reason, yet
   this being grown, through the increase of learning and converse, with a
   decay of the true fear of God, the very idol of this age, whoever will
   prepare a sacrifice unto it, though it be of the most holy mysteries of
   the gospel, he shall not fail of good entertainment and applause; and
   whoever shall refuse to cast incense on its altar shall be sure to be
   exploded, as one that professeth himself to be a fool, and even a
   common enemy unto mankind. Tell men that there are some things in
   religion that are above reason as it is finite and limited, and some
   things contrary unto it as it is depraved and corrupted, and they will
   reply (what is true in itself, but woefully abused) that yet their
   reason is the best, yea, only means which they have to judge of what is
   true or false. The liberty of men's own rational faculties having got
   the great vogue in the world (as indeed it is that which is most
   excellent therein of what is merely in and of it), it is fond to expect
   that it should not meet with a pernicious abuse, as every thing that
   hath any worth in it hath always done, when advanced unto such a
   reputation as might render it liable thereunto; for no man will ever
   adventure to prevail himself [1] of that which others have no respect
   unto or do despise.

   Herein, then, lies the advantage of this sort of men, -- the Socinians
   I mean, and their adherents, -- in attempting to corrupt the doctrine
   of the gospel, and hereon depends all their success therein: First,
   they get the advantage of the ground in general, by pretending to
   reduce all men unto right reason, as the just measure and standard of
   truth. Put in any exceptions unto this proposal, endeavour to affix its
   bounds and proper measure, offer the consideration of divine revelation
   in its proper use and place, and you give away the cause among the
   many, who design at least to come in as common sharers in the
   reputation that reason hath got above all things in the world. By the
   confident use of this artifice, and the most absurd application of this
   principle unto things infinite and the most holy mysteries of divine
   revelation, have this sort of men, otherwise, for the most part, as
   weak and insufficient in their reasonings as their predecessors in the
   like attempts, got the reputation of the most rational handlers of
   sacred things! And when, being harnessed with this advantage, they
   proceed to the proposal of their opinions in particular, they have such
   an interest beforehand in the minds of men by nature, and have things
   so disposed and prepared for their reception, that it is no wonder if
   ofttimes they obtain success. For they are all of them designed unto
   one of these two heads:-- first, "That there is no reason why we should
   believe any thing that reason cannot comprehend; so that we may safely
   conclude that whatever is above our reason is contrary unto it; and for
   what is so, it is destructive to the very natural constitution of our
   souls not to reject:" and, secondly, "That the mind of man is, in its
   present condition, every way sufficient unto the whole of its duties,
   both intellectual and moral, with respect unto God, and to answer
   whatever is required of us." Upon the matter, they pretend only to
   undertake the patronage of human nature, and the common reason and
   honesty of mankind, against those imputations of weakness, depravation,
   and corruption, in things spiritual, wherewith by some it is charged
   and defamed. And although it be contrary unto the universal experience
   of the whole world, yet might this design be allowed what commendation
   men please, so that the defence of nature were not undertaken expressly
   against the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the redemption that is in
   his blood, and the whole mystery of the gospel. But whereas it is a
   part of the depravation of our nature not to discover its own
   depravations, and all those opinions are suited to give it countenance
   against what it is not sensible of, and whereof it is not willing to
   own the charge, it is no wonder if with very many they receive a ready
   entertainment. And whereas they seem to interest men in that reputation
   which reason in the things of God hath obtained in the world, and
   thereby to countenance them in the contempt of others as weak and
   irrational, -- things pleasing to the depraved minds of men, -- it is
   more than probable that they will make a pernicious progress in one
   degree or another. So doth the subtle enemy of our salvation make his
   advantage of the disposition, inclination, and state of every age and
   season. Without his interposition, devotion of old might have been
   carried on without superstition, and in this age the use of reason
   might be vindicated without a rejection of the necessity of
   supernatural illumination and the great truths of the gospel. But the
   better any thing is, the more noisome it will be when once he hath
   mixed his poison with it.

   It were to be wished that the defection from the truth of the gospel
   complained of were confined unto the instances already mentioned,
   though in them the event be deplorable among multitudes of professed
   Christians. But the same, in some measure and degree, is come to pass
   among Protestants also. Men grow weary of the truths which have been
   professed ever since the Reformation, yea, of those in particular which
   gave occasion thereunto, and without which it had never been attempted;
   for besides that many fall off unto those extremes of error before
   insisted on, some on the one hand, and some on the other, the reformed
   religion is by not a few so taken off from its old foundations, so
   unhinged from those pillars of important truths which it did depend
   upon, and so sullied by a confused medley of noisome opinions, as that
   its loss in reputation of stability and usefulness seems almost
   irreparable. Hence are divisions, debates, and animosities multiplied
   about the principal articles of our religion, whereby those tongues are
   divided and hands engaged in mutual intestine conflicts, which all
   united were few enough to preserve the remainders of the protestant
   profession from the artifices and power of him who doth not despair
   once more to impose his yoke on the neck of the whole Christian world;
   for nothing can more prepare the way of his success than the shaking of
   the doctrine of the reformed churches from that consistency wherein for
   so long a time it stood firm and stable against all opposition.

   But there is in this matter nothing absolutely new under the sun. No
   instance can be given of any church or nation in the world, which ever
   received the profession of the gospel, that did not, sooner or later,
   either totally or in some considerable degrees, fall off from the
   doctrine which it reveals and the obedience which it requireth. Men do
   but deceive themselves who suppose that the purity of religion will be
   preserved in confessions and canons, whilst some make it their business
   to corrupt its truth, and few or none make it their business to
   preserve its power. And, therefore, at this day, on one account or
   other, the defection is almost catholic; for it is in vain for any to
   pretend that the present general visible profession of Christianity
   doth in any tolerable measure answer the original pattern of it in the
   Scripture, or the first transcript thereof in the primitive believers.
   And that which, in this degenerate state of things, doth principally
   exercise the minds of considerate men is, whether there ought to be an
   immediate endeavour to reduce as many as will or can comply therewith
   unto the original standard in profession, obedience, and worship, or
   whether the present posture of things be not so far to be complied
   withal as to preserve therein the small remainders of religion among
   the community of Christians, who are not capable of such a reduction.
   The difference that is in the judgments of men herein is the ground of
   all those lesser controversies and opinions, which will be composed and
   have an end put unto them when God shall graciously afford unto us all
   a fresh revival of evangelical faith, love, and holiness, and, I fear,
   not before.

   Upon some considerations of this state of things in the world, and
   under fears, perhaps not altogether groundless, that a farther progress
   will yet be made in this woeful declension from the power and purity of
   evangelical truth, I set myself unto a general inquiry what might be
   the secret causes and reasons whence it is that all sorts of persons,
   in all ages, have been so prone to apostatize from the sincere
   profession of the gospel in faith and obedience, as experience in the
   success of things manifests them to have been. And, moreover, an
   occasion was administered unto thoughts of that nature from my
   engagement in the exposition of the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, wherein the apostle so eminently describes the nature of total
   apostasy, with the end of apostates in the righteous judgment of God;
   for considering the greatness of that sin, and the terror of the Lord
   with respect thereunto, and not knowing whereunto the daily advance of
   impiety, profaneness, and abominable lusts, with ignorance, error, and
   superstition, might at length arrive, thoughtfulness of what might Be
   required at the last day of myself, though cast in a men and obscure
   condition in the world, did not a little exercise my mind. The glory of
   God, the honour of Christ and the gospel, and the eternal welfare of
   the souls of men, being eminently concerned, I knew not how he could
   have the least satisfaction in the truth and reality of his own
   Christianity who was not greatly affected with, and did not really
   mourn for, their suffering in this woful apostasy. What I have attained
   unto in that kind I have no reason to declare, but hope I may say,
   without the offence of any, that as I verily believe neither my prayers
   nor tears have been proportionable unto the causes of them in this
   matter, so I can and will say that they have been real and sincere.

   I was not ignorant of the weakness and impertinency of all thoughts
   that a person of my mean condition in the world, disadvantaged by all
   imaginable circumstances that might prejudice the most sincere
   endeavours, should attempt any thing with respect unto the relief of
   nations or national churches, which yet are not without the verge of
   this fatal evil. To mourn for them in secret, to labour in prayers and
   supplications for a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of Christ
   upon them for their good, are things which, although they may despise,
   yet God will accept in and from the meanest of them that call on his
   name in sincerity. Unto whom other opportunities and advantages are
   granted, from them other things will be required; and it is, no doubt,
   a great account they have to give who are admitted and esteemed as
   those whose place and duty it is to stem the current of overflowing
   impiety and profaneness, and effectually to apply the sovereign
   remedies of all those evils unto the souls and consciences of men. Sad
   will it be for them under whose hand this breach shall be, if they
   endeavour not to prevent it with their utmost diligence, and the open
   hazard of all their earthly concerns. A learned writer of the church of
   England affirms, "That there were two no small sins of noisome
   hypocrisy that he had espied among others; -- the one, an opinion that
   there can be no fit matter of martyrdom in a state authorizing the true
   profession of that religion which among many we like best, and, left
   unto ourselves, would make choice of; the other, which in part feeds
   this, a persuasion that mere errors in doctrine or opinion are more
   pernicious than affected indulgence to lewd practices, or continuance
   in sinful courses, or open breaches of God's commandments." And after
   he had declared that "ministers of the gospel may deny Christ, or
   manifest their being ashamed of the gospel, by not opposing his word at
   they ought unto the sins of men," he adds, "That any age, since
   Christian religion was first propagated, hath wanted store of martyrs,
   is more to be attributed unto the negligence, ignorance, and hypocrisy,
   or want of courage in Christ's ambassadors, or appointed pastors, than
   unto the sincerity, mildness, or fidelity of the flock, especially of
   the bell-weathers or chief ringleaders," Jac. tom. i. b. 4. c. 4; with
   much more to the same purpose, which well deserve some men's
   consideration before all things of this nature be too late.

   But there is a duty of trading with a single talent; and if there be a
   ready mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not
   according to what he hath not. And this alone hath made me adventure
   the proposal of my thoughts about the nature, causes, and occasions of
   the present defection from the gospel and decay of holiness, with the
   means of preservation from its infection, and prevention of its
   prevalency in private persons; for it is to no purpose to shut up all
   endeavours under fruitless complaints, nor yet to attempt an opposition
   unto effects whose causes are not well known and considered. Wherefore
   the investigation and declaration of the causes of this evil are the
   principal subject of the ensuing discourses. And if I have attained but
   thus much, that persons of more understanding and abilities to find out
   the hidden springs of the inundation of sin and errors in the Christian
   world, and who have more advantages to improve their discoveries unto
   public good, shall be hereby excited to undertake so necessary a work
   and duty, I shall esteem myself to have received a full reward.

   There is one thing yet whereof I must advise those readers which are
   pleased to concern themselves in any writings of mine. The publishing
   of this exposition of some verses of the sixth chapter of the Epistle
   unto the Hebrews may have an appearance of my deserting that continued
   exposition of the whole epistle which I had designed. But as I know not
   what I may attain unto in the very near approach of that season wherein
   I must lay down this tabernacle, and the daily warning which, through
   many infirmities, I have thereof, so I am resolved whilst I live to
   proceed in that work as God shall enable, and other present necessary
   duties will allow. And the sole reason, added unto the seasonableness,
   as I supposed, of this discourse, why this part of the Exposition is
   singly proposed unto public view, was because the thoughts which arose
   thereon were drawn forth into such a length as would have been too
   great a digression from the context and design of the apostle.

   The Nature and Causes of Apostasy from the Gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter I.

   The nature of apostasy from the gospel declared, in an exposition of
   Hebrews vi. 4-6.

   Intending an inquiry into the nature, causes, and occasions of the
   present defection that is in the world from the truth, holiness, and
   worship of the gospel, I shall lay the foundation of my whole discourse
   in an exposition of that passage in the Epistle of Paul the apostle
   unto the Hebrews, wherein he gives an account both of the nature of
   apostasy and of the punishment due unto apostates; for as this will
   lead us naturally unto what is designed, so an endeavour to free the
   context from the difficulties wherewith it is generally supposed to be
   attended, and to explain the mind of the Holy Ghost therein, may be
   neither unacceptable nor unuseful. And this is chap. vi. 4-6, whose
   words are these that follow:--

   Adunaton gar tous hapax photisthentas, geusamenous te tes doreas tes
   epouraniou, kai metochous genethentas Pneumatos hagiou, kai kalon
   geusamenous Theou rhema, dunameis te mellontos aionos, kai
   parapesontas, palin anakainizein eis metanoian, anastaurountas heautois
   ton Huion tou Theou kai paradeigmatizontas.

   Adunaton gar. "Impossibile enim," that is, "est;" -- "It is
   impossible." Syr., 'l' l' mskchyn?, -- "But they cannot." This respects
   the power of the persons themselves, and not the event of things; it
   may be not improperly as to the sense. Beza and Erasmus, "Fieri non
   potest," -- "It cannot be;" the same with "impossible." But the use of
   the word adunaton in the New Testament, which signifies sometimes only
   what is very difficult, not what is absolutely denied, makes it useful
   to retain the same word, as in our translation, "For it is impossible."

   Tous hapax photisthentas. hnvn dchd' zvn lmmvdyt' nchtv?; -- "Those who
   one time," or "once descended unto baptism;" of which intepretation we
   must speak afterward. All others, "Qui semel fuerint illuminati;" --
   "Who were once enlightened." Only the Ethiopic follows the Syriac. Some
   read "illustrati" to the same purpose.

   Geusamenous te tes doreas tes epouraniou. Vulg. Lat., "Gustaverant
   etiam donum coeleste;" "etiam," for "et." Others express the article by
   the pronoun, by reason of its reduplication: "Et gustaverint donum
   illud coeleste;" -- "And have tasted of that heavenly gift." Syr., "The
   gift that is from heaven." And this the emphasis in the original seems
   to require: "And have tasted of that heavenly gift."

   Kai metochous genethentas Pneumatos hagiou. "Et participes facti sunt
   Spiritus Sancti," Vulg. Lat.; -- "And are made partakers of the Holy
   Ghost." All others, "facti fuerint," "have been" made partakers of the
   Holy Ghost. Syr., rvch' dqvds'?, -- The Spirit of holiness."

   Kai kalon geusamenous Theou rhema. Vulg. Lat., "Et gustaverunt
   nihilominus bonum Dei verbum." Rhem., "Have moreover tasted the good
   word of God." But "moreover" doth not express "nihilominus." [It must
   be rendered,] "And have notwithstanding," etc., which hath no place
   here. Kalon rhema, -- "verbum pulchrum."

   Dunameis te mellontos aionos. "Virtutesque seculi futuri." Syr.,
   chyl'?, -- "virtutem," the "power." Vulg., "seculi venturi." We cannot
   in our language distinguish between "futurum" and "venturum," and so
   render it "the world to come."

   Kai parapesontas. Vulg., "Et prolapsi sunt." Rhem., "And are fallen."
   Others, "Si prolabantur," which the sense requires; "If they fall,"
   that is, "away," as our translation, properly. Syr., dtvv ychtvn?,
   "That sin again," -- somewhat dangerously, for it is one kind of
   sinning only that is included and expressed.

   Palin anakainizein eis metanoian. Vulg., "Rursus renovari ad
   poenitentiam," -- "To be renewed again to repentance," rendering the
   active verb passively. So Beza also, "Ut denuo renoventur ad
   resipiscentiam;" -- "That they should again be renewed to repentance."
   The word is active as rendered by ours, "To renew them again to
   repentance."

   Anastaurountas heautois ton Huion tou Theou. "Rursum crucifigentes
   sibimetipsis Filium Dei." Kai paradeigmatizontas. Vulg., "Et ostentui
   habentes." Rhem., "And making him a mockery." Erasmus, "Ludibrio
   habentes" Beza, "Ignominiæ exponentes." One of late, "Ad exemplum
   Judæorum excruciant;" -- "Torment him as did the Jews."

   "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
   tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
   and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
   come, if they shall fall away," (for any) "to renew them again to
   repentance; seeing they crucify again to themselves the Son of God, and
   put him to open shame" (or treat him ignominiously.)

   That this passage in our apostle's discourse hath been looked upon as
   accompanied with great difficulties is known to all, and many have the
   differences been about its interpretation; for both doctrinally and
   practically, sundry have here stumbled and miscarried. It is almost
   generally agreed upon that from these words, and the colourable but
   indeed perverse interpretation and application made of them by some in
   the primitive times, occasioned by the then present circumstances of
   things, to be mentioned afterwards, the Latin church was so backward in
   receiving the epistle itself, that it had not absolutely prevailed
   therein in the days of Jerome, as we have elsewhere declared. Wherefore
   it is necessary that we should a little inquire into the occasion of
   the great contests which have been in the church, almost in all ages,
   about the sense of this place.

   It is known that the primitive church, according to its duty, was
   carefully watchful about the holiness and upright walking of all that
   were admitted into the society and fellowship of it. Hence, upon every
   known and visible failing, they required an open repentance from the
   offenders before they would admit them unto a participation of the
   sacred mysteries. But upon flagitious and scandalous crimes, such as
   murder, adultery, or idolatry, in many churches they would never admit
   those who had been guilty of them into their communion any more. Their
   greatest and most signal trial was with respect unto them who, through
   fear of death, complied with the Gentiles in their idolatrous worship
   in the time of persecution; for they had fixed no certain general rule
   whereby they should unanimously proceed, but every church exercised
   severity or lenity according as they saw cause, upon the circumstances
   of particular instances. Hence Cyprian, in his banishment, would not
   positively determine concerning those of the church in Carthage who had
   so sinned and fallen, but deferred his thoughts until his return, when
   he resolved to advise with the whole church, and settle all things
   according to the counsel that should be agreed on amongst them. Yea,
   many of his epistles are on this subject peculiarly: and in them all,
   if compared together, it is evident that there was no rule agreed upon
   herein; nor was he himself well resolved in his own mind, though
   strictly on all occasions opposing Novatianus; wherein it had been well
   if his arguments had answered his zeal. Before this, the church of Rome
   was esteemed in particular more remiss in their discipline, and more
   free than other churches in their re-admission unto communion of
   notorious offenders. Hence Tertullian, in his book de Poenitentia,
   reflects on Zephyrinus, the bishop of Rome, that he had "admitted
   adulterers unto repentance, and thereby unto the communion of the
   church." But that church proceeding in her lenity, and every day
   enlarging her charity, Novatus and Novatianus, taking offence thereat,
   advanced an opinion in the contrary extreme: for they denied all hope
   of church pardon or of a return unto ecclesiastical communion unto them
   who had fallen into open sin after baptism; and, in especial,
   peremptorily excluded all persons whatsoever who had outwardly complied
   with idolatrous worship in time of persecution, without respect unto
   any distinguishing circumstances; yea, they seem to have excluded them
   from all expectation of forgiveness from God himself. But their
   followers, terrified with the uncharitableness and horror of this
   persuasion, tempered it so far as that, leaving all persons absolutely
   to the mercy of God upon their repentance, they only denied such as we
   mentioned before a re-admission unto church communion, as Acesius
   speaks expressly in Socrates, lib. i. cap. 7. Now, this opinion they
   endeavoured to confirm, as from the nature and use of baptism, which
   was not to be reiterated, -- whereon they judged that no pardon was to
   be granted unto them who fell into those sins which they lived in
   before, and were cleansed from at their baptism, -- so principally from
   this place of our apostle, wherein they thought their whole opinion was
   taught and confirmed. And so usually doth it fall out, very unhappily,
   with men who think they clearly see some peculiar opinion or persuasion
   in some singular text of Scripture, [2] and will not bring their
   interpretation of it unto the analogy of faith, whereby they might see
   how contrary it is to the whole design and current of the word in other
   places. But the church of Rome, on the other side, though judging
   rightly, from other directions given in the Scripture, that the
   Novatians transgressed the rule of charity and gospel discipline in
   their severities, yet, as it should seem, and is very probable, knew
   not how to answer the objection from this place of our apostle.
   Therefore did they rather choose for a season to suspend their assent
   unto the authority of the whole epistle than to prejudice the church by
   its admission. And well was it that some learned men afterward, by
   their sober interpretations of the words, plainly evinced that no
   countenance was given in them unto the errors of the Novatians; for
   without this it is much to be feared that some would have preferred
   their interest in their present controversy before the authority of it:
   which would, in the issue, have proved ruinous to the truth itself; for
   the epistle, being designed of God unto the common edification of the
   church, would have at length prevailed, whatever sense men, through
   their prejudices and ignorance, should put upon any passages of it. But
   this controversy is long since buried, the generality of the churches
   in the world being sufficiently remote from that which was truly the
   mistake of the Novatians; yea, the most of them do bear peaceably in
   their communion, without the least exercise of gospel discipline
   towards them, such persons as concerning whom the dispute was of old,
   whether they should ever in this world be admitted into the communion
   of the church, although upon their open and professed repentance. We
   shall not therefore at present need to labour in this controversy.

   But the sense of these words hath been the subject of great contests on
   other occasions also; for some do suppose and contend that they are
   real and true believers who are deciphered by the apostle, and that
   their character is given us in and by sundry inseparable adjuncts and
   properties of such persona Hence they conclude that such believers may
   totally and finally fall from grace, and perish eternally; yea, it is
   evident that this hypothesis of the final apostasy of true believers is
   that which influenceth their minds and judgments to suppose that such
   are here intended. Wherefore others who will not admit that, according
   to the tenor of the covenant of grace in Christ Jesus, true believers
   can perish everlastingly, do say that either they are not here
   intended, or if they are, that the words are only comminatory, wherein,
   although the consequence in them in a way of arguing be true, namely,
   that on the supposition laid down the inference is certain, yet the
   supposition is not asserted in order unto a certain consequent, whence
   it should follow that true believers might so really fall away and
   absolutely perish. And these things have been the matter of many
   contests among learned men.

   Again; there have been sundry mistakes in the practical application of
   the intention of these words unto the consciences of men, mostly made
   by themselves who are concerned; for whereas, by reason of sin, they
   have been surprised with terrors and troubles of conscience, they have
   withal, in their darkness and distress, supposed themselves to be
   fallen into the condition here described by our apostle, and
   consequently to be irrecoverably lost. And these apprehensions usually
   befall men on two occasions; for some having been overtaken with some
   great actual sin against the second table, after they have made a
   profession of the gospel, and having their consciences harassed with a
   sense of their guilt (as it will fall out where men are not greatly
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin), they judge that they are
   fallen under the sentence denounced in this Scripture against such
   sinners, as they suppose themselves to be, whereby their state is
   irrecoverable. Others do make the same judgment of themselves, because
   they have fallen from that constant compliance with their convictions
   which formerly led them unto a strict performance of duties, and this
   in some course of long continuance.

   Now, whereas it is certain that the apostle in this discourse gives no
   countenance unto that severity of the Novatians whereby they excluded
   offenders everlastingly from the peace and communion of the church; nor
   to the final apostasy of true believers, which he testifieth against in
   this very chapter, in compliance with innumerable other testimonies of
   Scripture to the same purpose; nor doth he teach any thing whereby the
   conscience of any sinner who desires to return to God and to find
   acceptance with him should be discouraged or disheartened; we must
   attend unto the exposition of the words in the first place, so as not
   to break in upon the boundaries of other truths, nor transgress against
   the analogy of faith. And we shall find that this whole discourse,
   compared with other scriptures, and freed from the prejudices that men
   have brought unto it, is both remote from administering any just
   occasion to the mistakes before mentioned, and is a needful, wholesome
   commination, duly to be considered by all professors of the gospel.

   In the words we consider, -- 1. The connection of them unto those
   foregoing, intimating the occasion of the introduction of this whole
   discourse. 2. The subject described in them, or the persons spoken of,
   under sundry qualifications, which may be inquired into jointly and
   severally. 3. What is supposed concerning them. 4. What is affirmed of
   them on that supposition.

   1. The connection of the words is included in the causal conjunction,
   gar, "for." It respects the introduction of a reason for what had been
   before discoursed, as also of the limitation which the apostle added
   expressly unto his purpose of making a progress in their farther
   instruction, "If God permit." And he doth not herein express his
   judgment that they to whom he wrote were such as he describes, for he
   afterward declares that he "hoped better things" concerning them; only,
   it was necessary to give them this caution, that they might take due
   care not to be such. And whereas he had manifested that they were slow
   as to the making of a progress in knowledge and a suitable practice, he
   lets them here know the danger that there was in continuing in that
   slothful condition; for not to proceed in the ways of the gospel and
   obedience thereunto is an untoward entrance into a total relinquishment
   of the one and the other. That therefore they might be acquainted with
   the danger hereof, and be stirred up to avoid that danger, he gives
   them an account of the miserable condition of those who, after a
   profession of the gospel, beginning at a non-proficiency under it, do
   end in apostasy from it. And we may see that the severest comminations
   are not only useful in the preaching of the gospel, but exceeding
   necessary, towards persons that are observed to be slothful in their
   profession.

   2. The description of the persons that are the subject spoken of is
   given in five instances of the evangelical privileges whereof they were
   made partakers; notwithstanding all which, and against their obliging
   efficacy to the contrary, it is supposed that they may wholly desert
   the gospel itself. And some things we may observe concerning this
   description of them in general; as, -- (1.) The apostle, designing to
   express the fearful state and judgment of these persons, describes them
   by such things as may fully evidence it to be, as unavoidable, so
   righteous and equal. Those things must be some eminent privileges and
   advantages, whereof they were made partakers by the gospel. These,
   being despised in their apostasy, do proclaim their destruction from
   God to be rightly deserved. (2.) That all these privileges do consist
   in certain especial operations of the Holy Ghost, which were peculiar
   unto the dispensation of the gospel, such as they neither were nor
   could be made partakers of in their Judaism; for the Spirit in this
   sense was not received by "the works of the law, but by the hearing of
   faith," Gal. iii. 2. And this was a testimony unto them that they were
   delivered from the bondage of the law, namely, by a participation of
   that Spirit which was the great privilege of the gospel. (3.) Here is
   no express mention of any covenant grace or mercy in them or towards
   them, nor of any duty of faith or obedience which they had performed.
   Nothing of justification, sanctification, or adoption, is expressly
   assigned unto them. Afterwards, when he comes to declare his hope and
   persuasion concerning these Hebrews, that they were not such as those
   whom he had before described, nor such as would so fall away unto
   perdition, he doth it upon three grounds, whereon they were differenced
   from them; as, -- [1.] That they had such things as did accompany
   salvation, -- that is, such as salvation is inseparable from. None of
   these things, therefore, had he ascribed unto those whom he describeth
   in this place; for if he had so done, they would not have been unto him
   an argument and evidence of a contrary end, that these should not fall
   away and perish as well as those. Wherefore he ascribes nothing to
   these here in the text that doth peculiarly "accompany salvation,"
   verse 9. [2.] He describes them by their duties of obedience and fruits
   of faith. This was their "work and labour of love" towards the name of
   God, verse 10. And hereby also doth he difference them from these in
   the text, concerning whom he supposeth that they may perish eternally,
   which these fruits of saving faith and sincere love cannot do. [3.] He
   adds, that in the preservation of those there mentioned the
   faithfulness of God was concerned: "God is not unrighteous to forget."
   For they were such he intended as were interested in the covenant of
   grace, with respect whereunto alone there is any engagement on the
   faithfulness or righteousness of God to preserve men from apostasy and
   ruin; and there is so with an equal respect unto all who are so taken
   into that covenant. But of these in the text he supposeth no such
   thing, and thereupon doth not intimate that either the righteousness or
   faithfulness of God was any way engaged for their preservation, but
   rather the contrary. This whole description, therefore, refers unto
   some especial gospel privileges, which professors in those days were
   promiscuously made partakers of; and what they were in particular we
   must in the next place inquire.

   The first thing in the description is, that they were hapax
   photisthentes, "once enlightened." Saith the Syriac translation, as we
   observed, "once baptized." It is very certain that, early in the
   church, baptism was called photismos, "illumination;" and photizein, to
   "enlighten,'' was used for to "baptize." And the set times wherein they
   solemnly administered that ordinance were called hemerai ton photon,
   "the days of light." Hereunto the Syriac interpreter seems to have had
   respect; and the word hapax, "once," may give countenance hereunto.
   Baptism was once only to be celebrated, according to the constant faith
   of the church in all ages. And they called baptism "illumination,"
   because it being one ordinance of the initiation of persons into a
   participation of all the mysteries of the church, they were thereby
   translated out of the kingdom of darkness into that of light and grace.
   And it seems to give farther countenance hereunto in that baptism
   really was the beginning and foundation of a participation of all the
   other spiritual privileges that are mentioned afterwards; for it was
   usual in those times, that, upon the baptizing of persons, the Holy
   Ghost came upon them, and endowed them with extraordinary gifts,
   peculiar to the days of the gospel, [3] as we have showed in our
   consideration of the order between baptism and imposition of hands. And
   this opinion hath so much of probability in it, that, having nothing
   therewithal unsuited unto the analogy of faith or design of the place,
   I should embrace it, if the word itself, as here used, did not require
   another interpretation; for it was good while aider the writing of this
   epistle and all other parts of the New Testament, at least an age or
   two, if not more, before this word was used mystically to express
   baptism. In the whole Scripture it hath another sense, denoting an
   inward operation of the Spirit, and not the outward administration of
   an ordinance. And it is too much boldness to take a word in a peculiar
   sense in one single place, diverse from its proper signification and
   constant use, if there be no circumstances in the text forcing us
   thereunto, as here are not. And for the word hapax, "once," it is not
   to be restrained unto this particular, but refers equally unto all the
   instances that follow, signifying no more but that those mentioned were
   really and truly partakers of them.

   Photizomai is to give light or knowledge by teaching, the same with
   hvrh?, which is therefore so translated ofttimes by the Greeks; as by
   Aquila, Exod. iv. 12, Ps. cxix. 33, Prov. iv. 4, Isa. xxvii. 11, as
   Drusius observes. And it is so by the LXX., Judges xiii. 8, 2 Kings
   xii. 2, xvii. 27. Our apostle useth it for to "make manifest," -- that
   is, to "bring to light," 1 Cor. iv. 5; 2 Tim. i. 10. And the meaning of
   it, John i. 9, where we render it "lighteth," is to teach. And
   photismos is knowledge upon instruction: 2 Cor. iv. 4, Eis to me
   augasai autois ton photismon tou euangeliou· -- "That the light of the
   gospel should not shine into them," -- that is, the knowledge of it. So
   verse 6, Pros photismon tes gnoseos· -- "The light of the knowledge."
   Wherefore, to be "enlightened" in this place is to be instructed in the
   doctrine of the gospel, so as to have a spiritual apprehension thereof;
   and this is so termed on a double account:--

   1. Of the objects, or the things known or apprehended; for "life and
   immortality are brought to light through the gospel," 2 Tim. i. 10.
   Hence it is called "light," -- "The inheritance of the saints in
   light." And the state which men are thereby brought into is so called
   in opposition to the darkness that is in the world without it, 1 Pet.
   ii. 9. The world without the gospel is the kingdom of Satan: Ho kosmos
   holos en to ponero keitai, 1 John v. 19. The whole of the world, and
   all that belongs unto it, in distinction from and opposition unto the
   new creation, is under the power of the wicked one, the prince of the
   power of darkness, and so is full of darkness. It is topos auchmeros, 2
   Pet. i. 19, -- "a dark place," wherein ignorance, folly, errors, and
   superstition do dwell and reign. By the power and efficacy of this
   darkness are men kept at a distance from God, and know not whither they
   go. This is called "walking in darkness," 1 John i. 6, whereunto
   "walking in the light," -- that is, the knowledge of God in Christ by
   the gospel, -- is opposed, verse 7. On this account is our instruction
   in the knowledge of the gospel called "illumination," because itself is
   light.

   2. On the account of the subject, or the mind itself, whereby the
   gospel is apprehended; for the knowledge which is received thereby
   expels that darkness, ignorance, and confusion which the mind before
   was filled and possessed withal. The knowledge, I say, of the doctrines
   of the gospel concerning the person of Christ, of God's being in him
   reconciling the world to himself, of his offices, work, and mediation,
   and the like heads of divine revelation, doth set up a spiritual light
   in the minds of men, enabling them to discern what before was utterly
   hid from them, whilst alienated from the life of God through their
   ignorance. Of this light and knowledge there are several degrees,
   according to the means of instruction which men do enjoy, the capacity
   they have to receive it, and the diligence they use to that purpose;
   but a competent measure of the knowledge of the fundamental and most
   material principles or doctrines of the gospel is required unto all
   that may thence be said to be illuminated, -- that is, freed from the
   darkness and ignorance they once lived in, 2 Pet. i. 19-21.

   This is the first property whereby the persons intended are described:
   they are such as were illuminated by the instruction they had received
   in the doctrines of the gospel, and the impression made thereby on
   their minds by the Holy Ghost; for this is a common work of his, and is
   here so reckoned. And the apostle would have us know that, --

   I. It is a great mercy, a great privilege, to be enlightened with the
   doctrine of the gospel by the effectual working of the Holy Ghost. But,
   --

   II. It is such a privilege as may be lost, and end in the aggravation
   of the sin, and condemnation of those who were made partakers of it.
   And, --

   III. Where there is a total neglect of the due improvement of this
   privilege and mercy, the condition of such persons is hazardous, as
   inclining towards apostasy.

   Thus much lies open and manifest in the text. But that we may more
   particularly discover the nature of this first part of the character of
   apostates, for their sakes who may look after their own concernment
   therein, we may yet a little more distinctly express the nature of that
   illumination and knowledge which is here ascribed unto them; and how it
   is lost in apostasy will afterward appear. And, --

   1. There is a knowledge of spiritual things that is purely natural and
   disciplinary, attainable and attained without any especial aid or
   assistance of the Holy Ghost As this is evident in common experience,
   so especially among such as, casting themselves on the study of
   spiritual things, are yet utter strangers unto all spiritual gifts.
   Some knowledge of the Scripture and the things contained in it is
   attainable at the same rate of pains and study with that of any other
   art or science.

   2. The illumination intended, being a gift of the Holy Ghost, differs
   from and is exalted above this knowledge that is purely natural; for it
   makes nearer approaches unto the light of spiritual things in their own
   nature than the other doth. Notwithstanding the utmost improvement of
   scientifical notions that are purely natural, the things of the gospel,
   in their own nature, are not only unsuited unto the wills and
   affections of persons endued with them, but are really foolishness unto
   their minds. And as unto that goodness and excellency which give
   desirableness unto spiritual things, this knowledge discovers so little
   of them that most men hate the things which they profess to believe.
   But this spiritual illumination gives the mind some satisfaction, with
   delight and joy in the things that are known. By that beam whereby it
   shines into darkness, although it be not fully comprehended, yet it
   represents the way of the gospel as a "way of righteousness," 2 Pet.
   ii. 21, which reflects a peculiar regard of it on the mind.

   Moreover, the knowledge that is merely natural hath little or no power
   upon the soul, either to keep it from sin or to constrain it to
   obedience. There is not a more secure and profligate generation of
   sinners in the world than those who are under the sole conduct of it.
   But the illumination here intended is attended with efficacy, so as
   that it doth effectually press in the conscience and whole soul unto an
   abstinence from sin and the performance of all known duties. Hence
   persons under the power of it and its convictions do ofttimes walk
   blamelessly and uprightly in the world, so as not with the other to
   contribute unto the contempt of Christianity. Besides, there is such an
   alliance between spiritual gifts, that where any one of them doth
   reside, it hath assuredly others accompanying of it, or one way or
   other belonging unto its train; as is manifest in this place. Even a
   single talent is made up of many pounds. But the light and knowledge
   which is of a mere natural acquirement is solitary, destitute of the
   society and countenance of any spiritual gift whatever. And these
   things are exemplified unto common observation every day.

   3. There is a saving, sanctifying light and knowledge which this
   spiritual illumination riseth not up unto; for though it transiently
   affect the mind with some glances of the beauty, glory, and excellency
   of spiritual things, yet it doth not give that direct, steady,
   intuitive insight into them which is obtained by grace. See 2 Cor. iii.
   18, iv. 6. Neither doth it renew, change, or transform the soul into a
   conformity unto the things known, by planting of them in the will and
   affections, as a gracious, saving light doth, 2 Cor. iii. 18; Rom. vi.
   17, xii. 2.

   These things I judged necessary to be added, to clear the nature of the
   first character of apostates.

   The second thing asserted in the description of them is, that they have
   "tasted of the heavenly gift," -- geusamenous te tes doreas tes
   epouraniou. The doubling of the article gives emphasis to the
   expression. And we must inquire, -- 1. What is meant by the "heavenly
   gift;" and, 2. What by "tasting" of it.

   1. The gift of God, dorea, is either dosis, "donatio," or dorema,
   "donum." Sometimes it is taken for the grant or giving itself, and
   sometimes for the thing given. In the first sense it is used, 2 Cor.
   ix. 15, "Thanks be unto God epi te anekdiegeto autou dorea," -- for his
   gift that cannot be declared;" that is, fully or sufficiently. Now this
   gift was his grant of a free, charitable, and bountiful spirit to the
   Corinthians in ministering unto the poor saints. The grant hereof is
   called "God's gift." So is the gift of Christ used also: Eph. iv. 7,
   "According to the measure of the gift of Christ;" that is, "According
   as he is pleased to give and grant of the fruits of the Spirit unto
   men." See Rom. v. 15-17; Eph. iii. 7. Sometimes it is taken for the
   thing given, properly doron or dorema, as James i. 17. So it is used
   John iv. 10, "If thou knewest the gift of God," ten dorean tou Theou,
   "The gift of God," -- that is, the thing given by him, or to be given
   by him. It is, as many judge, the person of Christ himself which in
   that place is intended; but the context makes it plain that it is the
   Holy Ghost, for he is that "living water" which the Lord Jesus in that
   place promiseth to bestow. And, so far as I can observe, dorea, the
   "gift," with respect unto God, as denoting the thing given, is nowhere
   used but only to signify the Holy Ghost; and if it be so, the sense of
   this place is determined, Acts ii. 38, "Ye shall receive ten dorean tou
   hagiou Pneumatos, -- the gift of the Holy Ghost;" not that which he
   gives, but that which he is. Chap. viii. 20, "Thou hast thought dorean
   tou Theou, -- that the gift of God may be purchased with money;" that
   is, the power of the Holy Ghost in miraculous operations. So expressly
   chap. x. 45, 11, 17. Elsewhere dorea, so far as I can observe, when
   respecting God, doth not signify the thing given, but the grant itself.
   The Holy Spirit is signally the gift of God under the new testament.

   And epouranios, "heavenly," or from heaven. This may have respect unto
   his work and effect, -- they are heavenly, as opposed to carnal and
   earthly; but principally it regards his mission by Christ, after his
   ascension into heaven: Acts ii. 33, being exalted, and having received
   the promise of the Father, he sent the Spirit. The promise of him was,
   that he should be sent from heaven, or mml?, "from above," as God is
   said to be above, which is the same with "heavenly," Deut. iv. 39; 2
   Chron. vi. 23; Job xxxi. 28; Isa. xxxii. 15, mmrvm?, and chap. xxiv.
   18. When he came upon the Lord Christ to anoint him for his work, "the
   heavens were opened," and he came from above, Matt. iii. 16. So Acts
   ii. 2, at his first coming on the apostles, there came "a sound from
   heaven." Hence he is said to be apostaleis ap' ouranou, -- that is, to
   be he dorea tou Theou, e epouranios, "sent from heaven," 1 Pet. i. 12.
   Wherefore, although he may be said to be "heavenly" upon other accounts
   also, which therefore are not absolutely to be excluded, yet his being
   sent from heaven by Christ, after his ascension thither and exaltation
   there, is principally here regarded. He therefore is this he dorea he
   epouranios, the "heavenly gift" here intended, though not absolutely,
   but with respect unto an especial work.

   That which riseth up against this interpretation is, that the Holy
   Ghost is expressly mentioned in the next clause: "And were made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost." It is not therefore probable that he
   should be here also intended.

   Ans. (1.) It is ordinary to have the same thing twice expressed, in
   various words, to quicken the sense of them; and it is necessary it
   should be so, when there are divers respects unto the same thing, as
   there are in this place.

   (2.) The following clause may be exegetical of this, declaring more
   fully and plainly what is here intended; which is usual also in the
   Scripture: so that nothing is cogent from this consideration to
   disprove an interpretation so suited to the sense of the place, and
   which the constant use of the word makes necessary to be embraced. But,
   --

   (3.) The Holy Ghost is here mentioned as the great gift of the gospel
   times, as coming down from heaven, not absolutely, not as unto his
   person, but with respect unto an especial work, -- namely, the change
   of the whole state of religious worship in the church of God, --
   whereas we shall see in the next words, he is spoken of only with
   respect unto external actual operations. But he was the great, the
   promised heavenly gift, to be bestowed under the new testament, by whom
   God would institute and ordain a new way and new rites of worship, upon
   the revelation of himself and his will in Christ. Unto him was
   committed the reformation of all things in the church, whose time was
   now come, chap. ix. 10. The Lord Christ, when he ascended into heaven,
   left all things standing and continuing in religious worship as they
   had done from the days of Moses, though he hod virtually put an end
   unto it [the Mosaic dispensation]; and he commanded his disciples that
   they should attempt no alteration therein until the Holy Ghost were
   sent from heaven to enable them thereunto, Acts i. 4, 5. But when he
   came as the great gift of God, promised under the new testament, he
   removes all the carnal worship and ordinances of Moses, and that by the
   full revelation of the accomplishment of all that was signified by
   them, and appoints the new, holy, spiritual worship of the gospel, that
   was to succeed in their room. The Spirit of God, therefore, as bestowed
   for the introduction of the new gospel state in truth and worship, is
   the "heavenly gift" here intended. Thus our apostle warneth these
   Hebrews that they "turn not away from him who speaketh from heaven,"
   chap. xii. 25, -- that is, from Jesus Christ speaking in the
   dispensation of the gospel by the "Holy Ghost sent down from heaven."
   And there is an antithesis included herein between the law and the
   gospel, the former being given on earth, the latter being immediately
   from heaven. God, in giving of the law, made use of the ministry of
   angels, and that on the earth; but he gave the gospel church-state by
   that Spirit which, although he worketh in men on earth, and is said in
   every act or work to be sent from heaven, yet is he still in heaven,
   and always speaketh from thence, as our Saviour said of himself with
   respect unto his divine nature, John iii. 13.

   2. We may inquire what it is to "taste" of this heavenly gift, The
   expression of "tasting" is metaphorical, and signifies no more but to
   make a trial or experiment; for so we do by tasting naturally and
   properly of that which is tendered unto us to eat. We taste such things
   by the sense given us to discern our food, and then either receive or
   refuse them, as we find occasion. It doth not therefore include eating,
   much less digestion and turning into nourishment of what is so tasted;
   for its nature being only thereby discerned, it may be refused, yea,
   though we like its relish and savour, upon some other consideration.
   Some have observed, that "to taste is as much as to eat; as 2 Sam. iii.
   35, I will not taste bread, or ought else.' "But the meaning is, "I
   will not so much as taste it," whence it was impossible he should eat
   it. And when Jonathan says that he only tasted a little of the honey, 1
   Sam. xiv. 29, it was an excuse and extenuation of what he had done. But
   it is unquestionably used for some kind of experience of the nature of
   things: Prov. xxxi. 18, tmh ky tvv schrh? -- "She tasteth that her
   merchandise is good," or hath experience of it, from its increase. Ps.
   xxxiv. 8, "O taste and see that the Lord is good;" which Peter
   respects, 1 Pet. ii. 3, "If so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious," or found it so by experience. It is therefore properly to
   make an experiment or trial of any thing, whether it be received or
   refused, and is sometimes opposed to eating and digestion, as Matt.
   xxvii. 34. That, therefore, which is ascribed unto these persons is,
   that they had had an experience of the power of the Holy Ghost, that
   gift of God, in the dispensation of the gospel, the revelation of the
   truth, and institution of the spiritual worship of it, Of this state,
   and of the excellency of it, they had made some trial and had some
   experience; a privilege that all men were not made partakers of. And by
   this taste they were convinced that it was far more excellent than what
   they had been before accustomed unto, although now they had a mind to
   leave the finest wheat for their old acorns Wherefore, although tasting
   contains a diminution in it, if compared with that spiritual eating and
   drinking, with that digestion of gospel truths, turning them into
   nourishment, which are in true believers, yet, absolutely considered,
   it denotes that apprehension and experience of the excellency of the
   gospel as administered by the Spirit, which is a great privilege and
   spiritual advantage, the contempt whereof will prove an unspeakable
   aggravation of the sin, and the remediless ruin of apostates The
   meaning, then, of this character given concerning these apostates is,
   that they had some experience of the power and efficacy of the Holy
   Spirit from heaven, in gospel administrations and worship. For what
   some say of faith, it hath here no place; and what others affirm of
   Christ, and his being the gift of God, comes in the issue unto what we
   have proposed. And we may observe, farther to clear the design of the
   apostle in this commination, --

   I. That all the gifts of God under the gospel are peculiarly heavenly,
   John iii. 12; Eph. i. 3; -- and that in opposition, 1. To earthly
   things, Col. iii. 1, 2, ii.. To carnal ordinances, Heb. ix. 23. Let
   them beware by whom they are despised.

   II. The Holy Ghost, for the remission of the mysteries of the gospel,
   and the institution of the ordinances of spiritual worship, is the
   great gift of God under the new testament.

   III. There is a goodness and excellency in this heavenly gift which may
   be tasted or experienced in some measure by such as never receive them
   in their life, power, and efficacy. They may taste, -- 1. Of the word
   in its truth, not its power; 2. Of the worship of the church in its
   outward order, not in its inward beauty; 3. Of the gifts of the church,
   not its graces.

   IV. A rejection of the gospel, its truth and worship, after some
   experience had of their worth and excellency, is a high aggravation of
   sin, and a certain presage of destruction.

   The third property whereby these persons are described is added in
   these words, Kai metochous genethentas Pneumatos hagiou, -- "And were
   made partakers of the Holy Ghost," This is placed in the middle or
   centre of the privileges enumerated, two preceding it and two following
   after, as that which is the root and animating principle of them all.
   They all are effects of the Holy Ghost, in his gifts or his graces, and
   so do depend on the participation of him. Now, men do so partake of the
   Holy Ghost as they do receive him; and he may be received either as
   unto personal inhabitation or as unto spiritual operations. In the
   first way, "the world cannot receive him," John xiv. 17, -- where the
   world is opposed unto true believers; and therefore those here intended
   were not in that sense partakers of him. His operations respect his
   gifts. So to partake of him is to have a part, share, or portion in
   what he distributes by way of spiritual gifts; in answer unto that
   expression, "All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
   dividing to every man severally as he will," 1 Cor. xii. 11. So Peter
   told Simon the magician that he had no part in spiritual gifts; he was
   not partaker of the Holy Ghost, Acts viii. 21. Wherefore, to be
   partaker of the Holy Ghost is to have a share in and benefit of his
   spiritual operations.

   But whereas the other things mentioned are also gifts or operations of
   the Holy Ghost, on what ground or for what reason is this mentioned
   here in particular, that they were "made partakers of him," which, if
   his operations only be intended, seems to be expressed in the other
   instances?

   Ans. 1. It is, as we observed before, no unusual thing in the Scripture
   to express the same thing under various notions, the more effectually
   to impress a consideration and sense of it on our mind, especially
   where an expression hath a singular emphasis in it, as this hath here
   used; for it is an exceeding aggravation of the sins of those
   apostates, that in these things they were "partakers of the Holy
   Ghost."

   2. As was before intimated also, this participation of the Holy Ghost
   is placed, it may be, in the midst of the several parts of this
   description, as that whereon they do all depend, and that they are all
   but instances of it. They were "partakers of the Holy Ghost" in that
   they were "once enlightened;" and so of the rest.

   3. It expresseth their own personal interest in these things. They had
   an interest in the things mentioned not only objectively, as they were
   proposed and presented to them in the church, but subjectively, as they
   themselves in their own persons were made partakers of them. It is one
   thing for a man to have a share in and benefit by the gifts of the
   church, another to be personally himself endowed with them.

   4. To mind them in an especial manner of the privilege, they enjoyed
   under the gospel, above what they had in their Judaism: for whereas
   they had not then so much as heard that there was a Holy Ghost, -- that
   is, a blessed dispensation of him in spiritual gifts, Acts xix. 2, --
   now they themselves in their own persons were made partakers of him;
   than which there could be no greater aggravation of their apostasy. And
   we may observe, in our way, that the Holy Ghost is present with many as
   unto powerful operations with whom he is not present as to gracious
   inhabitation; or, many are made partakers of him in his spiritual gifts
   who are never made partakers of him in his saving graces, Matt. vii.
   22, 23.

   Fourthly, It is added in the description, that they had tasted kalon
   Theou rhema, "the good word of God." And we must inquire, -- 1. What is
   meant by the "word of God;" 2. How it is said to be "good;" and, 3. In
   what sense they "taste" of it.

   1. Rhema is properly "verbum dictum," a word spoken; and although it be
   sometimes used in another sense by our apostle, and by him alone, --
   Heb. i. 3, xi. 3, where it denotes the effectual active power of God,
   -- yet both the signification of the word and its principal use
   elsewhere denote words spoken, and, when applied unto God, his word as
   preached and declared. See Rom. x. 17; John vi. 68. The word of God, --
   that is, the word of the gospel as preached, -- is that which they thus
   tasted of. But it may be said, that they enjoyed the word of God in
   their state of Judaism. They did so as to the written word, for "unto
   them were committed the oracles of God," Rom. iii. 2; but it is the
   word of God as preached in the dispensation of the gospel that is
   eminently thus called, and concerning which such excellent things are
   spoken, Rom. i. 16; Acts xx. 32; James i. 21.

   2. This word is said to be kalon, "good," desirable, amiable, as the
   word here used signifieth. Wherein it is so we shall see immediately.
   But whereas the word of God preached under the dispensation of the
   gospel may be considered two ways, -- (1.) In general, as to the whole
   system of truths contained therein; and, (2.) In especial, for the
   declaration made of the accomplishment of the promise in sending Jesus
   Christ for the redemption of the church, -- it is here especially
   intended in this latter sense. This is emphatically called rhema
   Kuriou, 1 Pet. i. 25. So the promise of God in particular is called his
   "good word:" Jer. xxix. 10, "After seventy years be accomplished I will
   visit you, and perform my good word toward you;" as he calls it the
   "good thing that he had promised," chap. xxxiii. 14. The gospel is the
   "good tidings" of peace and salvation by Jesus Christ, Isa. lii. 7.

   3. Hereof they are said to "taste," as they were before of the heavenly
   gift. The apostle, as it were, studiously keeps himself to this
   expression, on purpose to manifest that he intendeth not those who by
   faith do really receive, feed, and live on Jesus Christ as tendered in
   the word of the gospel, John vi. 35, 49-51, 54-56. It is as if he had
   said, "I speak not of those who have received and digested the
   spiritual food of their souls, and turned it into spiritual
   nourishment, but of such as have so far tasted of it as that they ought
   to have desired it as sincere milk, to have grown thereby; but they had
   received such an experiment of its divine truth and power as that it
   had various effects upon them." And for the farther explication of
   these words, and therein of the description of the state of these
   supposed apostates, we may consider the ensuing observations, which
   declare the sense of the words, or what is contained in them.

   I. There is a goodness and excellency in the word of God able to
   attract and affect the minds of men who yet never arrive at sincere
   obedience unto it.

   II. There is an especial goodness in the word of the promise concerning
   Jesus Christ and the declaration of its accomplishment.

   For the first of these propositions, we may inquire what is that
   goodness, and wherein it doth consist; as also, how apostatizing
   backsliders may taste thereof: which things tend to the explanation of
   the words, and what is designed by the apostle in them.

   1. (1.) This goodness and excellency of the word of God consists in its
   spiritual, heavenly truth. All truth is beautiful and desirable; the
   perfection of the minds of men consists in the reception of it and
   conformity unto it; and although "true" be one consideration of any
   thing, and "good" another, yet they are inseparable properties of the
   same subject. Whatever is true is also good. So are these things put
   together by the apostle, Phil. iv. 8. And as truth is good in itself,
   so is it in its effects on the minds of men; it gives them peace,
   satisfaction, and contentment. Darkness, errors, falsehood, are evils
   in themselves, and fill the minds of men with vanity, uncertainty,
   superstition, dread, and bondage. It is truth that makes the soul free
   in any kind, John viii. 32. Now, the word of God is the only pure,
   unmixed, and solid truth: "Thy word is truth," John xvii. 17. In most
   other things, as to the best evidence attainable, men wander in the
   wilderness of endless conjectures. The truth of the word of God alone
   is stable, firm, infallible; which gives rest to the soul. As God is a
   "God of truth," Deut. xxxii. 4, the "only true God," John xvii. 3, so
   he is, and he alone is, essentially truth, and the eternal spring of it
   unto all other things. Hereof is this word the only revelation. How
   excellent, how desirable, therefore, must it needs be! and what a
   goodness, to be preferred above all other things, must it be
   accompanied withal! As it is infallible truth, giving light to the eyes
   and rest to the soul, it is the "good word of God."

   (2.) It is so in the matter of it, or the doctrines contained in it;
   as, -- [1.] The nature and properties of God are declared therein. God
   being the only good, the only fountain and cause of all goodness, and
   in whose enjoyment all rest and blessedness do consist, the revelation
   made of him, his nature and attributes, reflects a singular goodness on
   it, John xvii. 3. If it be incomparably better to know God than to
   enjoy the whole world and all that is in it, that word must be good
   whereby he is revealed unto us, Jer. ix. 23, 24. [2.] It is exceeding
   good in the revelation of the glorious mystery of the Trinity, therein
   alone contained. This is that mystery the knowledge whereof is the only
   means to have a right apprehension of all other sacred truths; and
   without it no one of them can be understood in a due manner, nor
   improved unto a due end. This is that alone which will give true rest
   and peace to the soul. And there is not the meanest true believer in
   the world, who is exercised in faith and obedience, but he hath the
   power of this truth in and upon his mind, though he be not able to
   speak much of the notions of it. All grace and truth are built hereon
   and do centre herein, and thence derive their first power and efficacy.
   Not one saving apprehension can we have of any gracious dispensation of
   God towards us, but it is resolved into the existence of God in a
   trinity of persons, and the economy of their operations with respect
   unto us. It is a "good word" whereby that mystery is revealed. [3.] It
   is so in the revelation of the whole mystery of the incarnation of the
   Son of God, with all the effects of infinite wisdom and grace thereunto
   belonging. What a satisfactory goodness this is accompanied withal, it
   is the most part of my business in this world to inquire and declare.
   [4.] It is so in the declaration of all the benefits of the mediation
   of Christ, in mercy, grace, pardon, justification, adoption, etc.

   (3.) It is a good word with respect unto its blessed effects, Ps. xix.
   7-9; Acts xx. 32; James i. 21. On this account the psalmist assures us
   that it is "more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold;"
   that it is "sweeter than honey and the honey-comb," Ps. xix. 10; --
   that is, there is an incomparable excellency, worth, and goodness in
   it. And he who discerns not this goodness in the word of God is a
   stranger unto all real benefits by it.

   2. How apostatizing persons do taste of this good word of God may be
   briefly declared. And their so doing hath respect unto the threefold
   property of it mentioned, whence it is denominated "good:" (1.) Its
   truth; (2.) Its subject-matter; (3.) Its effects.

   And, -- (1.) They taste of it as it is true, in the convictions they
   have thereof, in their knowledge in it, and acknowledgment of it. This
   gives (as it is the nature of truth to do) some serenity and
   satisfaction unto their minds, although they are not renewed thereby.
   They that heard John preach the truth rejoiced in his light, as finding
   much present satisfaction therein, John v. 35. So was it with them,
   Luke iv. 22, John vii. 46, and others innumerable, on the like occasion
   of hearing our Saviour preach.

   When men, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   do escape the pollutions that are in the world through lust, and them
   that live in error, they taste a goodness, a sweetness, in the rest and
   satisfaction of their minds, so as that they suppose they are really
   possessed of the things themselves.

   (2.) With respect unto the matter of the word, they have a taste of its
   goodness in the hopes which they have of their future enjoyment. Mercy,
   pardon, life, immortality, and glory, are all proposed in the "good
   word of God." These, upon those grounds which will fail them at last,
   they have such hopes to be made partakers of as that they find a great
   relish and satisfaction therein, especially when they have relief
   thereby against their fears and convictions; for, even in those ways
   wherein they deceive themselves, they have a taste of what sweetness
   and goodness there is in these things unto them by whom they are
   enjoyed. And as those who really believe and receive Jesus Christ in
   the word do thereon "rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory," 1
   Pet. i. 8, so those who only taste of the word do feel in themselves a
   great complacency in their affections, Matt. xiii. 20; for, --

   (3.) By this taste they may receive many effects of the word on their
   minds and consciences, and therein have an experience of the word as
   unto its power and efficacy. It belongs unto the exposition of the
   place to speak a little hereunto, and withal to declare what the
   difference is between them, and wherein this tasting comes short of
   that receiving and feeding on the word by faith which is peculiar unto
   true believers.

   [1.] This taste is accompanied, or it may be so, with delight,
   pleasure, and satisfaction in hearing of the word preached, especially
   when it is dispensed by any skillful "master of assemblies," who finds
   out "acceptable words," or "words of delight," which yet are "upright,
   and words of truth," Eccles. xii. 10, 11. So was it with those naughty
   Jews, Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32; and with Herod, who heard John the Baptist
   gladly, finding delight and pleasure in his preaching. So was it with
   multitudes that pressed after Christ to hear the word; and so it is to
   be feared that it is with many in the days wherein we live.

   [2.] It gives not only delight in hearing, but some joy in the things
   heard. Such are the hearers of the word whom our Saviour compared to
   the stony ground; they receive it with joy, Matt. xiii. 20, as it was
   with the hearers of John the Baptist, John v. 35. The word, as tasted
   only, hath this effect on their minds, that they shall rejoice in the
   things they hear, not with abiding solid joy, not with joy unspeakable
   and full of glory, but with that which is temporary and evanid. And
   this ariseth from that satisfaction which they find in hearing of the
   good things declared; such are mercy, pardon, grace, immortality, and
   glory. They cannot but rejoice sometimes at the hearing of them, though
   they will not be at the pains of getting an interest in them.

   [3.] The word only thus tasted of will work on men a change and
   reformation of their lives, with a readiness unto the performance of
   many duties, 2 Pet. ii. 18, 20; Mark vi. 20. And, --

   [4.] What inward effects it may have on the minds and affections of
   men, in illumination, conviction, and humiliation, I have declared at
   large elsewhere. But, all this while, this is but tasting. The word of
   the gospel, and Christ preached therein, is the food of our souls; and
   true faith cloth not only taste it, but feed upon it, whereby it is
   turned into grace and spiritual nourishment in the heart. And hereunto
   is required:-- 1st. The laying it up, or treasuring of it in the heart,
   Luke i. 66, ii. 19. No nourishment will ever be obtained by food unless
   it be received into the stomach, where the means and causes of
   digestion and communication are placed; and if the word be not placed
   in the heart by fixed meditation and delight, it may please for a
   season, but it will not nourish the soul. 2dly. Food must be mixed and
   incorporated with the digestive humour, power, and faculty of the
   stomach, whereinsoever it consists, or it will not nourish. Give a man
   never so much food, if there be any noxious humour in the stomach
   hindering it from mixing itself with the means of digestion, it will no
   way profit him; and until the word in the heart be mixed and
   incorporated with faith, it will not advantage us, Heb. iv. 2; -- and
   there is nothing hereof where there is a taste of the word only. 3dly.
   When men feed on the word, it is turned into a principle of life,
   spiritual strength, and growth within; which a taste of it only will
   not give. As food, when it is digested, turns into flesh and blood and
   spirits, so doth the word, and Christ therein, unto the souls of men
   spiritually. Hence Christ becometh "our life," and "liveth in us," as
   the efficient cause of our spiritual life, Gal. ii. 20; Col. iii. 3;
   and we grow and increase by the word, 1 Pet. ii. 2. A mere taste,
   though it may yield present refreshment, yet it communicates no abiding
   strength. Hence multitudes relish the word when it is preached, but
   never attain life, or strength, or growth by it. 4thly. The word
   received as it ought will transform the soul into the likeness of God,
   who sends us this food to change our whole spiritual constitution, and
   to render our nature like unto his, in "righteousness and true
   holiness," Eph. iv. 21-24; 2 Cor. iii. 18. This a taste only will
   effect nothing towards; nor, to conclude, will it give us such a love
   of the truth as to abide by it in trials or temptations, 2 Thess. ii.
   10, nor bring forth the fruits of it in universal obedience. And I
   might farther discourse from hence of the deplorable condition of them
   who satisfy their minds in mere notions of the truth, and empty
   speculations about it, without once attaining so much as a taste of the
   goodness of the word, -- of which sort there are many in the world; as
   also show the necessity, which all the hearers of the word lie under,
   of a severe scrutiny into their own souls, whether they do not rest in
   a taste only of the word, but come short of feeding upon it and of
   Christ therein, but that I must not divert from the text. What hath
   been here spoken was needful to declare the true state and condition of
   the persons spoken of. The second proposition mentioned hath been
   treated of elsewhere.

   Lastly, It is added, Dunameis te mellontos aionos, -- "And the powers
   of the world to come." Dunameis are hgvvrvt? or nphl'vt?, the mighty,
   great, miraculous operations and works of the Holy Ghost. What they
   were, and how they were wrought among these Hebrews, hath been declared
   in our Exposition on chap. ii. 4, whither I refer the reader; and they
   are known from the Acts of the Apostles, where sundry instances of them
   are recorded. I have also proved on that chapter, that by "The world to
   come," our apostle in this epistle intends the days of the Messiah,
   that being the usual name of it in the church at that time, as the new
   world which God had promised to create. Wherefore these "powers of the
   world to come" were the gifts whereby those signs, wonders, and mighty
   works, were then wrought by the Holy Ghost, according as it was
   foretold by the prophets that they should be so. See Joel ii. 28-32
   compared with Acts ii. 16-21. These the persons spoken of are supposed
   to have tasted, for the particle te refers to geusamenous foregoing.
   Either they had been wrought in and by themselves, or by others in
   their sight, whereby they had had an experience of the glorious and
   powerful working of the Holy Ghost in the confirmation of the gospel.
   Yea, I do judge that themselves in their own persons were partakers of
   these powers, in the gift of tongues and other miraculous operations;
   which was the highest aggravation possible of their apostasy, and that
   which peculiarly rendered their recovery, impossible: for there is not
   in the Scripture an impossibility put upon the recovery of any but such
   as peculiarly sin against the Holy Ghost; -- and although that guilt
   may be otherwise contracted, yet in none so signally as by this of
   rejecting that truth which was confirmed by his mighty operations in
   them that rejected it; which could not be done without an ascription of
   his divine power unto the devil. Yet would I not fix on extraordinary
   gifts exclusively unto those that are ordinary. They also are of the
   "powers of the world to come;" so is every thing that belongs to the
   erection or preservation of the new world, or the kingdom of Christ. To
   the first setting up of a kingdom great and mighty power is required;
   but being set up, the ordinary dispensation of power will preserve it.
   So it is in this matter. The extraordinary miraculous gifts of the
   Spirit were used in the erection of Christ's kingdom, but it is
   continued by ordinary gifts; which therefore also belong unto the
   "powers of the world to come."

   From the consideration of this description in all the parts of it, we
   may understand what sort of persons it is that is here intended by the
   apostle. And it appears, yea, is evident, --

   1. That the persons here intended are not true and sincere believers in
   the strict and proper sense of that name, at least they are not
   described here as such; so that from hence nothing can be concluded
   concerning them that are so, as to the possibility of their total and
   final apostasy: for, -- (1.) There is in their full and large
   description no mention of faith or believing, either expressly or in
   terms equivalent. And in no other place of the Scripture are such
   intended, but [except where] they are mentioned by what belongs
   essentially to their state. And, (2.) There is not any thing ascribed
   to these persons that is peculiar to them as such, or discriminative of
   them, as taken either from their especial relation unto God in Christ,
   or any such property of their own as is not communicable unto others.
   For instance, they are not said to be called according to God's
   purpose; to be born again, not of the will of man, nor of the will of
   the flesh, but of God; not to be justified, or sanctified, or united
   unto Christ, or to be the sons of God by adoption; nor have they any
   other characteristical note of true believers ascribed to them. (3.)
   They are in the following verses compared to the ground on which the
   rain often falls, and beareth nothing but thorns and briers. But this
   is not so with true believers; for faith itself is an herb peculiar to
   the enclosed garden of Christ, and meet for him by whom we are dressed.
   (4.) The apostle, discoursing afterwards of true believers, doth in
   many particulars distinguish them from such as might be apostates,
   which is supposed of the persons here intended, as was in part before
   declared; for, -- [1.] He ascribes unto them in general "better
   things," and such as "accompany salvation," as we observed, verse 9.
   [2.] He ascribes unto them a "work and labour of love," as it is true
   faith alone which worketh by love, verse 10, whereof he speaks not one
   word concerning these. [3.] He asserts their preservation, on the
   account, -- 1st. Of the righteousness and faithfulness of God, verse
   10; 2dly. Of the immutability of his counsel concerning them, verses
   17, 18. In all these and sundry other instances doth he put a
   difference between these apostates and true believers. And whereas the
   apostle intends to declare the aggravation of their sin in falling away
   by the principal privileges whereof they were made partakers, here is
   not one word, in name or thing, of those which he expressly assigns to
   be the chief privileges of true believers, Rom. viii. 27-30.

   2. Our next inquiry is more particularly whom he doth intend; and, --
   (1.) They were such as not long before were converted from Judaism unto
   Christianity, upon the evidence of the truth of its doctrine, and the
   miraculous operations wherewith its dispensation was accompanied. (2.)
   He intends not the common sort of them, but such as had obtained
   especial privileges among them; for they had received extraordinary
   gifts of the Holy Ghost, as speaking with tongues or working of
   miracles. And, (3.) They had found in themselves and others convincing
   evidences that the kingdom of God and the Messiah, which they called
   "The world to come," was come unto them, and had satisfaction in the
   glories of it. (4.) Such persons as these, as they have a work of light
   on their minds, so, according unto the efficacy of their convictions,
   they may have such a change wrought upon their affections and in their
   conversation, as that they may be of great esteem among professors; and
   such these here intended might be. Now, it must needs be some horrible
   frame of spirit, some malicious enmity against the truth and holiness
   of Christ and the gospel, some violent love of sin and the world, that
   could turn off such persons as these from the faith, and blot out all
   that light and conviction of truth which they had received. But the
   least grace is a better security for heaven than the greatest or
   privileges whatever.

   These are the persons concerning whom our apostle discourseth; and of
   them it is supposed by him that they may "fall away," kai parapesontas.
   The especial nature of the sin here intended is afterward declared in
   two instances or aggravating circumstances. This word expresseth the
   respect it had to the state and condition of the sinners themselves;
   they "fall away," -- do that whereby they do so. I think we have well
   expressed the word, "If they shall fall away." Our old translations
   rendered it only, "If they shall fall," which expressed not the sense
   of the word, and was liable unto a sense not at all intended; for he
   doth not say, "If they shall fall into sin," this or that, or any sin
   whatever that can be named, suppose the greatest sin imaginable, --
   namely, the denial of Christ in the time of danger and persecution.
   This was that sin (as we intimated before) about which so many contests
   were raised of old, and so many canons were multiplied about the
   ordering of them who had contracted the guilt thereof. But one example,
   well considered, had been a better guide for them than all their own
   arbitrary rules and imaginations.

   But Peter fell into this sin, and yet was renewed again to repentance,
   and that speedily. Wherefore we may lay down this, in the first place,
   as to the sense of the words: There is no particular sin that any man
   may fall into occasionally, through the power of temptation, that can
   cast the sinner under this commination, so that it should be impossible
   to renew him to repentance. It must, therefore, secondly, be a course
   of sin or sinning that is intended. But there are various degrees
   herein also, yea, there are divers kinds of such courses in sin. A man
   may so fall into a way of sin as still to retain in his mind such a
   principle of light and conviction as may be suitable to his recovery.
   To exclude such from all hopes of repentance is expressly contrary to
   Ezek. xviii. 21, Isa. lv. 7, yea, and to the whole sense of the
   Scripture. Wherefore, men, after some conviction and reformation of
   life, may fall into corrupt and wicked courses, and make a long abode
   or continuance in them. Examples hereof we have every day amongst us,
   although, it may be, none to parallel that of Manasseh. Consider the
   nature of his education under his father Hezekiah, the greatness of his
   sins, the length of his continuance in them, with his following
   recovery, and he is a great instance in this case. Whilst there is in
   such persons any seed of light, or conviction of truth which is capable
   of an excitation or revival, so as to put forth its power and efficacy
   in their souls, they cannot be looked on to be in the condition
   intended, though their case be dangerous.

   3. Our apostle makes a distinction between ptaio and pipto, Rom. xi.
   11, between "stumbling" and "falling," and would not allow that the
   unbelieving Jews of those days were come so far as piptein, -- that is,
   to fall absolutely: Lego oun, Me eptaisan hina pesosi; me genoito· --
   "I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid!"
   that is, absolutely and irrecoverably. So, therefore, doth that word
   signify in this place. And parapipto increaseth the signification,
   either as to perverseness in the manner of the fall, or as to violence
   in the fall itself.

   From what hath been discoursed, it will appear what falling away it is
   that the apostle here intendeth. And, --

   (1.) It is not a falling into this or that actual sin, be it of what
   nature it will; which may be, and yet not be a "falling away."

   (2.) It is not a falling upon temptation or surprisal, for concerning
   such fallings we have rules of another kind given us in sundry places,
   and those exemplified in especial instances; but it is that which is
   premeditated, of deliberation and choice.

   (3.) It is not a falling by relinquishment or renunciation of some,
   though very material, principles of Christian religion, by error or
   seduction, as the Corinthians fell in denying the resurrection of the
   dead, and the Galatians by denying justification by faith in Christ
   alone. Wherefore, --

   (4.) It must consist in a total renunciation of all the constituent
   principles and doctrines of Christianity, whence it is denominated.
   Such was the sin of them who relinquished the gospel to return unto
   Judaism, as it was then stated, in opposition unto it and hatred of it.
   This it was, and not any kind of actual sins, that the apostle
   manifestly discourseth concerning.

   (5.) For the completing of this falling away, according to the
   intention of the apostle, it is required that this renunciation be
   avowed and professed, as when a man forsaketh the profession of the
   gospel and falls into Judaism, or Mohammedanism, or Gentilism, in
   persuasion and practice; for the apostle discourseth concerning faith
   and obedience as professed, and so, therefore, also of their
   contraries. And this avowment of a relinquishment of the gospel hath
   many provoking aggravations attending it. And yet whereas some men may
   in their hearts and minds utterly renounce the gospel, but, upon some
   outward, secular considerations, either dare not or will not profess
   that inward renunciation, their falling away is complete and total in
   the sight of God; and all they do to cover their apostasy, in an
   external compliance with Christian religion, is in the sight of God but
   a mocking of him, and the highest aggravation of their sin.

   This is the "falling away" intended by the apostle, -- a voluntary,
   resolved relinquishment of, and apostasy from, the gospel, the faith,
   rule, and obedience thereof; which cannot be without casting the
   highest reproach and contumely imaginable upon the person of Christ
   himself, as it is afterward expressed.

   Concerning these persons, and their thus "falling away," two things are
   to be considered in the text:-- 1. What is affirmed of them; 2. The
   reason of that affirmation.

   1. The first is, That it is impossible to renew them again unto
   repentance. The thing intended is negative; to "renew them again unto
   repentance," this is denied of them. But the modification of that
   negation turns the proposition into an affirmation, "It is impossible
   so to do."

   Adunaton gar. The importance [import] of this word is dubious; some
   think an absolute, and others only a moral impossibility is intended
   thereby. This latter most fix upon, so that it is a matter rare,
   difficult, and seldom to be expected, that is intended, and not that
   which is absolutely impossible. Considerable reasons and instances are
   produced for either interpretation. But we must look farther into the
   meaning of it.

   (1.) All future events depend on God, who alone doth necessarily exist.
   Other things may be or may not be, as they respect him or his will; and
   so things that are future may be said to be impossible, to be so either
   with respect unto the nature of God, or his decrees, or his moral rule,
   order, and law. Things are impossible with respect unto the nature of
   God, either absolutely, as being inconsistent with his being and
   essential properties; so it is impossible that God should lie; -- or on
   some supposition; so it is impossible that God should forgive sin
   without satisfaction, on the supposition of his law and the sanction of
   it. In this sense, the repentance of these apostates, it may be, is not
   impossible. I say it may be. It may be there is nothing in it contrary
   to any essential properties of the nature of God, either directly or
   reductively, but I will not be positive herein; for the things ascribed
   unto these apostates are such, -- namely, their "crucifying the Son of
   God afresh, and putting him to an open shame," -- as that I know not
   but that it may be contrary to the holiness, and righteousness, and
   glory of God, as the supreme ruler of the world, to have any more mercy
   on them than on the devils themselves or those that are in hell But I
   will not assert this to be the meaning of the place.

   (2.) Again; things possible in themselves and with respect unto the
   nature of God are rendered impossible by God's decree and purpose; he
   hath absolutely determined that they shall never be. So it was
   impossible that Saul and his posterity should be preserved in the
   kingdom of Israel It was not contrary to the nature of God, but God had
   decreed that it should not be, 1 Sam. xv. 28, 29. But the decrees of
   God respecting persons in particular, and not qualifications in the
   first place, they cannot be here intended; because they are free acts
   of his win, not revealed, neither in particular nor by virtue of any
   general rule, as they are sovereign acts, making differences between
   persons in the same condition, Rom. ix. 11, 12. What is possible or
   impossible with respect unto the nature of God we may know in some good
   measure, from the certain knowledge we may have of his being and
   essential properties; but what is so, one way or other, with respect
   unto his decrees or purposes, which are sovereign, free acts of his
   will, knoweth no man, no, not the angels in heaven, Isa. xl. 13, 14;
   Rom. xi. 34.

   (3.) Things are possible or impossible with respect unto the rule and
   order of all things that God hath appointed. When in things of duty God
   hath neither expressly commanded them, nor appointed means for the
   performance of them, then are we to look upon them as impossible; and
   then, with respect unto us, they are so absolutely, and so to be
   esteemed. And this is the impossibility here principally intended. It
   is a thing that God hath neither commanded us to endeavour, nor
   appointed means to attain it, nor promised to assist us in it. It is
   therefore that which we have no reason to look after, attempt, or
   expect, as being not possible by any law, rule, or constitution of God.

   The apostle instructs us no farther in the nature of future events but
   as our own duty is concerned in them. It is not for us either to look,
   or hope, or pray for, or endeavour the renewal of such persons unto
   repentance. God gives law unto us in these things, not unto himself. It
   may be possible with God, for ought we know, if there be not a
   contradiction in it unto any holy properties of his nature; only he
   will not have us to expect any such things from him, nor hath he
   appointed any means for us to endeavour it. What he shall do we ought
   thankfully to accept; but our own duty towards such persons is
   absolutely at an end, -- and indeed they put themselves wholly out of
   our reach.

   That which is said to be thus impossible with respect unto these
   persons is, palin anakainizein eis metanoian, "to renew them again unto
   repentance." Metanoia in the New Testament, with respect unto God,
   signifies a "gracious change of mind" on gospel principles and
   promises, leading the whole soul into conversion unto God. tsvvh?, this
   is the beginning and entrance of our turning to God, without which
   neither the will nor the affections will be engaged unto him, nor is it
   possible for sinners to find acceptance with him.

   It is impossible anakainizein, "to renew." The construction of the
   words is defective, and must be supplied. Se may be added, to renew
   "themselves," -- it is not possible they should do so: or tinas, that
   "some" should, that any should renew them; and this I judge to be
   intended, for the impossibility mentioned respects the duty and
   endeavours of others. In vain shall any attempt their recovery, by the
   use of any means whatever. And we must inquire what it is to be
   "renewed," and what it is to be "renewed again."

   Now, our anakainismos is the renovation of the image of God in our
   nature, whereby we are dedicated again unto him; for as we had lost the
   image of God by sin, and were separated from him as things profane,
   this anakainismos respects both the restoration of our nature and the
   dedication of our persons to God. And it is twofold:--

   (1.) Real and internal, in regeneration and effectual sanctification:
   "The washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost," Tit. iii.
   5; 1 Thess. v. 23. But this is not that which is here intended; for
   this these apostates never had, and so cannot be said to be renewed
   again unto it, for no man can be renewed again unto that which he never
   had.

   (2.) It is outward in the profession and pledge of it. Wherefore
   renovation in this sense consists in the solemn confession of faith and
   repentance by Jesus Christ, with the seal of baptism received thereon;
   for thus it was with all those who were converted unto the gospel. Upon
   their profession of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus
   Christ, they received the baptismal pledge of an inward renovation,
   though really they were not partakers thereof. But this estate was
   their anakainismos, their renovation. From this state they fell
   totally, renouncing Him who is the author of it, his grace which is the
   cause of it, and the ordinance which is the pledge thereof.

   Hence it appears what it is palin anakainizein, "to renew them again."
   It is to bring them again into this state of profession by a second
   renovation, and a second baptism as a pledge thereof. This is
   determined impossible, and so unwarrantable for any to attempt; and,
   for the most part, such persons do openly fall into such blasphemies
   against, and engage (if they have power) into such persecution of the
   truth, as that they give themselves sufficient direction how others
   should behave themselves towards them. So the ancient church was
   satisfied in the case of Julian. This is the sum of what is affirmed
   concerning these apostates -- namely, that "it is impossible to renew
   them again unto repentance;" that is, so to act towards them as to
   bring them to that repentance whereby they may be instated in their
   former condition.

   Hence sundry things may be observed for the clearing of the apostle's
   design in this discourse; as, --

   (1.) Here is nothing said concerning the acceptance or refusal of any
   upon repentance, or the profession thereof after any sin, to be made by
   the church; whose judgment is to be determined by other rules and
   circumstances. And this perfectly excludes the pretence of the
   Novatians from any countenance in these words; for whereas they would
   have drawn their warranty from hence for the utter exclusion from
   church communion of all those who had denied the faith in times of
   persecution, although they expressed a repentance whose sincerity they
   could not evince, those only are intended who neither do nor can come
   to repentance itself, nor make a profession of it; with whom the church
   had no more to do. It is not said that men who ever thus fell away
   shall not, upon their repentance, be admitted again into their former
   state in the church, but that such is the severity of God against them
   that he will not again give them repentance unto life.

   (2.) Here is nothing that may be brought in bar against such as, having
   fallen by any great sin, or any course in sinning, and that after
   light, convictions, and gifts received and exercised, desire to repent
   of their sins and endeavour after sincerity therein; yea, such a desire
   and endeavour exempt any one from the judgment here threatened.

   There is therefore in it that which tends greatly to the encouragement
   of such sinners; for whereas it is here declared, concerning those who
   are thus rejected of God, that "it is impossible to renew them," or to
   do any thing towards them that shall have a tendency unto repentance,
   those who are not satisfied that they do yet savingly repent, but only
   are sincerely exercised how they may attain thereunto, have no
   concernment in this commination, but evidently have the door of mercy
   still open unto them, for it is shut only against those who shall never
   endeavour to turn by repentance. And although persons so rejected of
   God may fall under convictions of their sin, attended with despair
   (which is unto them a foresight of their future condition), yet as unto
   the least attempt after repentance, on the terms of the gospel, they do
   never rise up unto it. Wherefore, the impossibility intended, of what
   sort soever it be, respects the severity of God, not in refusing or
   rejecting the greatest sinners which seek after and would be renewed
   unto repentance (which is contrary unto innumerable of his promises);
   but in the giving up such sinners as these are, here mentioned, unto
   such obdurateness and obstinacy in sinning, that blindness of mind and
   hardness of heart, as that they neither will nor shall ever sincerely
   seek after repentance, nor may any means, according to the mind of God,
   be used to bring them thereunto. And the righteousness of the exercise
   of this severity is taken from the nature of this sin, or what is
   contained in it, which the apostle declares in the ensuing instances.
   And we may in our passage observe, that, --

   In the preaching of the gospel, it is necessary to propose unto men,
   and to insist on, the severity of God in dealing with provoking sinners
   against it. And indeed the severity of God is principally, though not
   solely, exercised with respect unto sins against the gospel. This our
   apostle calls us to the consideration of in the case of the unbelieving
   Jews: Rom. xi. 22, Ide oun chrestoteta kai apotomian tou Theou· epi men
   tous pesontas apotomian· -- "Behold the goodness and severity of God:
   on them which fell" (those in the text), "severity." Apotomia is a
   sharp direction or cutting off. I do not, therefore, understand by it
   an essential property of the nature of God. It is not the same with his
   holiness, righteousness, or vindictive justice. These are essential
   properties of the divine nature, whence it is that he neither will nor
   can absolutely suffer men to sin and let them go for ever unpunished,
   without any satisfaction or atonement made for their sins; whereof we
   have treated elsewhere. But by God's "severity" is intended the free
   act of his will, acting according unto these properties of his nature
   in an eminent manner, when and how he pleaseth; and therefore into them
   it is resolved. So our apostle, when he would intimate this severity
   unto us, to ingenerate in us a holy fear and reverence of God in his
   worship, adds as his motive, "For our God is a consuming fire," Heb.
   xii. 29; that is, of an infinitely pure, holy, righteous nature,
   according to which he will deal with us, and so may unexpectedly break
   forth upon us in severity if we labour not for "grace to serve him
   acceptably with reverence and godly fear." Wherefore, this severity of
   God is his exemplary dealing with provoking sinners, according to the
   exigence of his holiness and wisdom, without an interposition of longer
   patience or forbearance. There are some sins, or degrees in sinning,
   that neither the holiness, nor majesty, nor wisdom of God can so bear
   withal as to suffer them to pass unpunished or unremarked on in this
   world. In such cases is God said to exercise his severity; and he doth
   so, --

   (1.) In extraordinary, outward judgments upon open, profligate sinners,
   especially the enemies of his church and glory. Hence on such an
   occasion doth God give that description of himself, Nahum i. 2, "God is
   jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious;
   the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath
   for his enemies. When God acteth towards his adversaries according to
   the description here given of himself, he deals with them in severity.
   And two things are required to make these judgments of God against his
   adversaries in this world to be instances thereof:-- [1.] That they be
   unusual, such as do not commonly and frequently fall out in the
   ordinary dispensation of divine providence, Num. xvi. 29, 30. God doth
   not, in the government of the world, suffer any thing to fall out or
   come to pass that in the issue shall be contrary to his justice or
   inconsistent with his righteousness; but yet he beareth with things so,
   for the most part, as that he will manifest himself to be exceedingly
   full of patience and long-suffering, as also to exercise the faith of
   them that believe in the expectation of a future judgment. Wherefore
   there must be somewhat extraordinary in those judgments wherein God
   will exercise and manifest severity. So it is expressed, Isa. xxviii.
   21, "The Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as
   in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and
   bring to pass his act, his strange act." The work he will do is his
   work, but it is his "strange work;" -- that is, not strange from or
   opposite unto his nature, for so he will do nothing; but that which is
   unusual, which he doth but seldom, and is therefore marvellous. Thus,
   in sudden destructions of persecutors or persons of a flagitious
   wickedness, in great desolations of provoking families, cities, and
   nations, in fire from heaven, in inundations, plagues, earthquakes, and
   such sudden, extraordinary, consuming judgments, God giveth instances
   of his severity in the world, Rom. i. 18. [2.] In this case it is
   required that such judgments be open, visible, and manifest, both unto
   those who are punished and to others who wisely consider them. So God
   speaketh of himself, Deut. vii. 10, "God that re-payeth them that hate
   him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that
   hateth him, he will repay him to his face;" -- that is, he will do it
   openly and manifestly, so that themselves and all others shall take
   notice of his severity therein. This, I say, is one way whereby God
   acts his severity in this world. And hereby he poureth everlasting
   contempt upon the security of his proudest and haughtiest adversaries;
   for when they think they have sufficiently provided for their own
   safety, and stopped all avenues of evil, according to the rules of
   their policy and wisdom, with the best observations they are able to
   make of the ordinary effects of his providence, and so give up
   themselves to take satisfaction in their lusts and pleasures, he breaks
   in upon them with an instance and example of his severity to their
   utter destruction. So, "when they say, Peace and safety; then sudden
   destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman With child; and
   they shall not escape," 1 Thess. v. 3. This will be the state one day
   of the whole Babylonish interest in the world, Rev. xviii. 7-10. But
   this is not directly intended in this place, although even this effect
   of God's severity overtook these apostates afterward.

   (2.) In spiritual judgments. By these God in his severity leaveth
   unprofitable, provoking, and apostate professors under the
   impossibility here intended of being renewed unto repentance. And this
   is the sorest of all God's judgments. There is in it a sentence of
   eternal damnation denounced on men aforehand in this world. So our
   apostle tells us, "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to
   judgment," 1 Tim. v. 24. God so passeth judgment concerning them in
   this world as that there shall be no alteration in their state and
   condition to eternity. And this severity of God towards sinners under
   the gospel, shutting them up under final impenitency, consists in these
   four things:--

   [1.] God puts an end unto all his expectation concerning them; he looks
   for no more from them, and so exerciseth no more care about them.
   Whilst God is pleased to afford the use of means for conversion and
   repentance unto any, he is said to look for and expect answerable
   fruits: "I did," saith he, "so and so to my vineyard; and I looked that
   it should bring forth grapes," Isa. v. 2, 4. Wherefore, when God takes
   away all means of grace and repentance from any, then he puts an end
   unto his own expectation of any fruits; for if a man can have no fruit
   from his vineyard whilst he dresseth it, or from his field whilst he
   tilleth it, he will never look for any after he hath given them up and
   laid them waste. And, on the other side, when he utterly ceaseth to
   look for any fruit from them, he will till them no more; for why should
   he put himself to charge or trouble to no purpose? Woe unto the souls
   of men when God in this sense looks for no more at their hands! -- that
   is, when he puts an end unto that patience or long-suffering towards
   them from whence all supplies of the means of conversion and repentance
   do arise and spring. This God doth by some, and that in such ways as we
   shall afterward declare.

   [2.] God will actually punish them with, or inflict on them, hardness
   of heart and blindness of mind, that they never shall repent or
   believe: John xii. 39, 40, "Therefore they could not believe, because
   that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their
   heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with
   their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them." God will now
   judicially blind them and harden them, and, by one means or other,
   every thing that befalls them shall promote their induration. So it was
   with these Jews; the doctrine of Christ filled them with envy, his
   holiness with malice, and his miracles with rage and madness. Their
   table was a snare to them, and that which should have been for their
   good turned to their hurt. So is it with all them whom God in his
   severity hardeneth. Whether the outward means be continued unto them or
   no, all is one; every thing shall drive them farther from God, and
   increase their obstinacy against him. From hence they become scoffers
   and persecutors, avowedly scorning and hating the truth; and herein, it
   may be, they shall please themselves until they are swallowed up in
   despair or the grave.

   [3.] God usually in his severity gives them up unto sensual lusts. So
   he dealt with the idolaters of old: he "gave them up unto vile
   affections," Rom. i. 26, such as those there described by the apostle;
   and in the pursuit of them "gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do
   those things which are not convenient," verse 28; whence they were
   "filled with all unrighteousness," verse 29. So doth God frequently
   deal with apostates from the gospel, or from the principal truths of
   it, unto idolatry and superstition. And when they are engaged in the
   pursuit of these lusts, especially when they are judicially given up
   unto them, they are held assuredly, as under cords and chains, unto
   final impenitency.

   [4.] God gave such persons up unto Satan, to be blinded, and led by him
   into pernicious delusions: "Because they received not the love of the
   truth, that they might be saved, God shall send them strong delusion,
   that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who
   believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness," 2 Thess.
   ii. 10-12. This was the state and condition of the persons here
   prophesied of. The truth of the gospel was preached unto them, and for
   some time professed by them. They received the truth; but they received
   not the love of it, so as to comply with it and improve it unto its
   proper end. This kept them barren and unfruitful under their
   profession; for where the truth is not loved, as well as believed or
   assented unto, it will bring forth no fruit. But this was not all; they
   had pleasure in their sins, lusts, and unrighteousnesses, resolving not
   to part with them on any terms. Whereas, therefore, these are all of
   them absolutely and without limitation judged and condemned by the
   truth of the gospel, they began to dislike and secretly to hate the
   truth itself. But whereas, together with their lusts and
   unrighteousnesses, wherein they had pleasure, they found a necessity of
   a religion, one or other, or the pretence of some religion or other, to
   give them countenance against the truth which they rejected, they were
   in a readiness to any thing that should offer itself unto them. In this
   condition, in the way of punishment, and as a revenge of their horrible
   ingratitude and contempt of his gospel, God gives them up to the power
   of Satan, who blinds, deludes, and deceives them with such efficacy as
   that they shall not only readily embrace, but obstinately believe and
   adhere to, the lies, errors, and falsehoods that he shall suggest unto
   them. And this is the way and course whereby so many carnal gospellers
   are turned off unto Romish idolatry every day.

   Other instances of the severity of God on this occasion might be given,
   but these are fully sufficient to declare the manner of his dealing
   with such as those described in the text: whence it follows that their
   renovation unto repentance is impossible; for what hopes or
   expectations should we have concerning such as God hath utterly
   forsaken, whom he hath judicially smitten with blindness and hardness
   of heart, whom he hath given up not only to the power and efficacy of
   their own lusts and vile affections, but also immediately unto Satan,
   to be deluded and led captive at his pleasure? In vain shall the
   repentance of such persons be either expected or endeavoured.

   And this severity of God ought to be preached and insisted on in the
   declaration of the gospel Let the reader consult what hath been already
   offered concerning the use of gospel threatenings and comminations on
   the third and fourth chapters. There is a proneness in corrupted nature
   to "despise the riches of the goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering
   of God, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth them to
   repentance;" and thereon, "after their hardness and impenitent heart,
   they treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath," as our
   apostle speaks, Rom. ii. 4, 5. Considering nothing in God but mercy and
   long-suffering, and nothing in the gospel but grace and pardon, they
   are ready to despise and turn them into lasciviousness, or from them
   both to countenance themselves in their sins. By this means, on such
   mistaken apprehensions, suited to their lusts and corrupt inclinations,
   heightened by the craft of Satan, do multitudes under the preaching of
   the gospel harden themselves daily to destruction. And others there are
   who, although they will not on such wicked pretences give up themselves
   to their lusts and carnal affections, yet, for want of constant
   vigilancy and watchfulness, are apt to have sloth and negligence, with
   many ill frames of spirit, to increase and grow upon them. Both sorts
   are to be stirred up by being put in mind of this severity of God. They
   are to be taught that there are secret powers, accompanying the
   dispensation of the gospel, continually "in a readiness to revenge all
   disobedience," 2 Cor. x. 6; -- that "God is not mocked, for whatsoever
   a man soweth, that shall he also reap: for he that soweth to his flesh,
   shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit
   shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting," Gal. vi. 7, 8. But I have
   elsewhere already showed the necessity there was of arming the gospel
   with threatenings, as well as confirming of it with promises, so as
   that it may not be here again at large insisted on.

   From what hath been discoursed, it is evident how necessary and
   wholesome a warning or threatening is here expressed by the apostle. It
   is the open mistakes of men that have drawn undue entanglements out of
   it; in itself it is both plain and necessary. Shall we be afraid to say
   that God will not renew such sinners as those before described unto
   repentance? or to declare unto sinners that without repentance they
   cannot be saved? or shall we preach to men, that whatever light they
   have had, whatever gifts they have received, whatever privileges they
   have been made partakers of, whatever profession they have made, or for
   how long a season soever, if they fall totally and despitefully from
   the gospel into that which is most opposite both to its truth and
   holiness, yet there is no doubt but they may again repent and be saved?
   God forbid so great a wickedness should fall from our mouths! Nay, we
   are to warn all persons in danger of such apostasies that "if any one
   so draw back, God's soul shall have no pleasure in him;" that "it is a
   fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God;" that he will
   harden such sinners, and "give them up to strong delusions, that they
   may be damned;" that he is not under the engagement of any promise to
   give them repentance, but hath rather given many severe threatenings to
   the contrary. He hath told us that such persons are as "trees twice
   dead, plucked up by the roots," of which there is no hope; that
   "denying the Lord that bought them, they bring on themselves, swift
   destruction, -- whose damnation slumbereth not;" with the like
   declarations of severity against them innumerable.

   But what shall be said unto them who, having through great temptations,
   and it may be fears and surprises, for a season renounced the gospel,
   or such as, by reason of great sins against light and backsliding in
   profession, do apprehend themselves to be fallen into this condition,
   and yet are greatly desirous of a recovery, and do cry to God for
   repentance and acceptance? I answer as before, they are not at all
   concerned in this text. Here is nothing excluding them from acceptance
   with God and eternal salvation, be they who or what they will that seek
   it by repentance; only there are some who are excluded by God, and do
   obstinately shut up themselves from all endeavours after repentance
   itself, with whom we have not any thing to do.

   It is true, those alone are here firstly and directly intended who in
   those days had received extraordinary or miraculous gifts of the Holy
   Ghost. But this, by just analogy, may be extended unto others, now
   those gifts are ceased in the church; for those gifts and privileges
   which are yet continued unto men do lay (in present circumstances) the
   same obligation upon them unto perseverance in profession, and give the
   same aggravation unto their apostasy, as did those extraordinary gifts
   formerly conferred upon profession. "Let us not, then, be high-minded,
   but fear." It is not good approaching too near a precipice. Let
   unprofitable hearers and backsliders in heart and ways be awaked, lest
   they may be nearer falling under God's severity than they are aware of.
   But we must return unto our apostle, giving an account of the nature of
   this sin, which is attended with so sore a judgment. And this he doth
   in a double instance.

   2. Anastaurountas heautois ton Huion tou Theou. Beza affirms that
   heautois, "to themselves," is absent from some copies, and then the
   words may admit of a sense diverse from that which is commonly
   received; for anastaurountas, "crucifying again;" may refer unto tinas
   included and supposed in anakinizein, that some or any should renew
   them. It is impossible that any should renew them to repentance; for
   this cannot be done without crucifying the Son of God again, since
   these apostates have utterly rejected all interest in and benefit by
   his death, as once undergone for sinners. This none can do. We ought
   not, we cannot, crucify Christ again, that they may be renewed and
   saved. Who can entertain a thought tending towards a desire that so it
   might be? And this sense, in the same or an alike case, the apostle
   plainly expresseth, chap. x. 26, 27, "If we sin wilfully after that we
   have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more
   sacrifice for sins." Christ cannot be offered again, and so crucified
   again, without which the sins of such persons cannot be expiated; for
   the unbloody sacrificing of Christ every day in the mass was not as yet
   invented, and it is a relief fit only for them to trust unto who have
   no interest in that sacrifice which he offered once for all. But there
   is in that other place an allusion to the sacrifices under the law.
   Because they could legally expiate no sins but what were past before
   their offering, they were to be frequently repeated, upon reiterated
   sinning. So from time to time they sinned (as no man liveth and sinneth
   not), and had sacrifices renewed for their sins, applied unto the
   particular sins they had committed. This could now be so no more.
   Christ being once offered for sin, whoever loseth his interest in that
   one offering, and forfeiteth the benefit of it, there is no more
   sacrifice for him: "Christ henceforth dieth no more." It cannot be
   hence imagined that the grace of the gospel is restrained, as being all
   confined unto that one sacrifice, from what was represented in the
   multiplied sacrifices of the law; for, --

   (1.) The one sacrifice of Christ extended farther, as to sins and
   persons, than all those of the law with all their repetitions put
   together: "By him all that believe are justified from all things, from
   which they could not be justified by the law of Moses," Acts xiii. 39.
   There were some sins under the law for which no sacrifice was provided,
   seeing he who was guilty of them was to die without mercy, as in the
   cases of murder and adultery, with respect whereunto David saith, "Thou
   desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in
   burnt-offering," Ps. li. 16, -- namely, in such cases as his then was.
   But, --

   (2.) In case of apostasy from the one and the other, the event was the
   same. There was under the law no sacrifice appointed for him who had
   totally apostatized from its fundamental principles, or sinned vyd
   chzqh?, "presumptuously," with a hand high and stubborn. This was that
   "despising of Moses' law," for which those that were guilty thereof
   were to "die without mercy," Heb. x. 28. And so it is under the gospel.
   Willful apostates forfeiting all their interest in the sacrifice of
   Christ, there is no relief appointed for them, but God will cut them
   off and destroy them; as shall, God willing, be declared on that place.
   And this may be the sense of the words, supposing heautois not to
   belong originally unto this place. God hath confined all hopes of
   mercy, grace, and salvation, unto the one single offering and sacrifice
   of Jesus Christ. This our apostle insisteth on and presseth, chap. ix.
   25-28, x. 12, 14. Infinite wisdom and sovereign pleasure have centered
   all grace, mercy, and blessedness in him alone, John i. 14, 16, 17;
   Acts iv. 12; Col. i. 19. And this "one offering" of his is so
   sufficient and effectually powerful unto all that by faith seek an
   interest therein, that this restraint is no restraint, nor hath any
   sinner the least cause to complain of it. If they reject and despise
   it, it is their own fault, and at their own peril; nor is it the
   reiterated sacrifice of the mass, or whatever else they may betake
   themselves unto, that will afford them any relief.

   But the word is constant enough in ancient copies to maintain its own
   station, and the context requires its continuance; and this makes the
   work of "crucifying again" to be the act of the apostates themselves,
   and to be asserted as that which belongs unto their sin, and not denied
   as belonging to a relief from their sin: "They crucify him again to
   themselves." They do it not really, they cannot do so; but they do it
   to themselves morally. This is in their sin of falling away, part of it
   comprised in it, which renders it unpardonable; they again crucify the
   Son of God, not absolutely, but in and to themselves.

   And we must inquire how they did it, or in what sense it is by the
   apostle charged on them. Now, this (to omit all other things that may
   be thought to concur herein) was --

   (1.) Principally by an accession in suffrage unto them who had
   crucified him once before. Hereby they went over the same work with
   them, and did that for their own parts which the others had done before
   for theirs. They approved of and justified the fact of the Jews in
   crucifying him as a malefactor; for there is no medium between these
   things. The Lord Christ must be esteemed to be the Son of God, and
   consequently his gospel to be indispensably obeyed, or be supposed to
   be justly crucified as a seducer, a blasphemer, and a malefactor; for
   professing himself to be the Son of God, and witnessing that confession
   unto his death, he must be so received or rejected as an evil-doer. And
   this was done by these apostates; for, going over to the Jews, they
   approved of what they had done in crucifying of him as such an one.

   (2.) They did it by declaring, that having made trial of him, his
   gospel and ways, they found nothing of substance, truth, or goodness in
   them, for which they should continue their profession. Thus that famous
   or infamous apostate, Julian the emperor, gave this as the motto of his
   apostasy, Anegnon, egnon, kategnon, -- "I have read, known, and
   condemned" your Gospel. And this hath been the way of apostates in all
   ages. In the primitive times they were the Gentiles' intelligencers,
   and, like the spies of old, brought up a false report upon the land;
   for they were not satisfied, for the most part, to declare their
   disapprobation of what was really taught, believed, and practised among
   the Christians, but, the more to countenance their apostasy, not only
   invidiously represented and odiously traduced what was really
   professed, but withal invented lies and calumnies about conspiracies,
   seditions, and inconsistencies with public peace among them, so [as],
   if it were possible, to ruin the whole interest and all that belonged
   unto it. This is to "crucify Christ afresh, and to put him to an open
   shame." And such is the manner of them unto this day. If any have made
   an accession to the more intimate duties of religion, as prayer and
   preaching, by virtue of spiritual gifts, with other acts of mutual
   spiritual communion, which the generality of men concern not themselves
   in, when, in compliance with their occasions and temptations, they fall
   from them and renounce them, they aim at nothing more than, by
   malicious, scurrilous representations of them, and false additions unto
   them of things perverse or ridiculous, to expose them to open shame and
   ignominy. Their language is, Anegnomen, egnomen, kategnomen, -- "We
   have known and tried these things, and declare their folly;" so hoping
   to be believed, because of their pretended experience, which alone is
   sufficient to render them suspected with all persons of wisdom and
   sobriety. Now, no man living can attempt a higher dishonour against
   Jesus Christ, in his person or in any of his ways, than openly to
   profess that upon trial of them they find nothing in them for which
   they should be desired. But "it had been better for such persons not to
   have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to
   turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."

   And this is the first aggravation of the sin mentioned, taken from the
   act ascribed unto the sinners, "they crucify him again;" they do it as
   much as in them lieth, and declare that they would actually do it if it
   were in their power. He adds another from the consideration of the
   person who was thus treated by them. It was the "Son of God" whom they
   dealt thus withal. This they did, not when he had "emptied himself, and
   made himself of no reputation," so that it was not an easy matter to
   look through all the veils of his outward weakness and condition in
   this world, to "behold his glory, as the glory of the only-begotten of
   the Father" (in which state he was crucified by the Jews); but now when
   he had been "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
   Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead," and when his
   divinity was variously attested unto in the world and among themselves.
   And this is the great aggravation of sin against the gospel, namely, of
   unbelief, that it is immediately against the "Son of God." His person
   is despised in it, both absolutely and in the discharge of all his
   offices; and therefore is God himself so, because he hath nothing to do
   with us but by his Son. Thirdly, The apostle adds, as another
   aggravation of their sin, kai paradeigmatizontas, "exposing him again
   to public ignominy," or "shame." Paradeigmatizo is to bring any
   supposed offenders unto such open punishment as is shameful in the eyes
   of men, and renders them vile who are so traduced and punished. The
   word is but once more used in the New Testament, namely, Matt. i. 19,
   where it is spoken of Joseph in reference unto his espoused wife, the
   holy Virgin: Me thelon auten paradeigmatisai, -- "Not willing to make
   her a public example;" that is, by bringing of her forth unto a
   shameful punishment, for the terror of others.

   According unto this sense, our apostle, expressing the death of Christ
   as inflicted by men, reduces the evils that accompanied it unto two
   heads, -- (1.) The pain of it; and, (2.) The shame: Heb. xii. 2, "He
   endured the cross and despised the shame;" for as the death of the
   cross was penal, or painful and dolorous, so in the manner of it, in
   all its circumstances of time, place, person, it was most highly
   shameful. He was in it paradeigmatistheis, "ignominiously traduced," or
   "put to an open shame;" yes, the death of the cross amongst all people
   was peculiarly shameful. Thus in calling over his death in this place,
   he refers it unto the same heads of suffering and shame, -- "crucifying
   him," and "putting him to an open shame." And in this latter he was not
   spared by these apostates more than in the former, so far as it lay in
   their power.

   And hence we may raise a sufficient answer unto an objection of no
   small importance that ariseth against our exposition of this place: for
   it may be said, "That if those, or many of them, or any of them, who
   actually and really crucified the Son of God in his own person, and put
   him to open shame, did yet obtain mercy and pardon of that and all
   other sins, as it is confessed they did, whence is it that those who
   renounce him, and do so crucify him and put him to shame only
   metaphorically and to themselves, should be excluded from all hopes of
   repentance and pardon?"

   I answer, That the sin of those who forsake Christ and the gospel,
   after their conviction of its truth and profession of it, is on many
   accounts far greater than that of those who crucified him in the days
   of his flesh. And there are sundry reasons whereon God will exercise
   more severity towards this latter sort of sinners than towards the
   former:--

   1. The sin is greater, because no way to be extenuated by ignorance.
   This is everywhere allowed as that which made the sin of crucifying of
   Christ pardonable upon their repentance, and their repentance possible.
   So Peter, in his sermon to them, lays down this as the foundation of
   his exhortation unto repentance: "And now, brethren, I wot that through
   ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers," Acts iii. 17. "Had they
   known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory," 1 Cor. ii.
   8; which our apostle pleads also in his own case, 1 Tim. i. 13. This
   put their sin among the number of those which sacrifices were allowed
   for of old, and which fell under the care of Him who knows how to have
   "compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way."

   But it may be inquired, "How they could be excused by ignorance who had
   so many means and evidences of conviction as to the truth of his
   person, that he was the Messiah, and of his doctrine, that it was from
   heaven? for besides the concurrent testimony of Moses and the prophets
   given unto him, the holiness of his person and life, the efficacy of
   his doctrine, and the evidence of his miracles, did abundantly prove
   and confirm the truth of those things, go that they could be no
   otherwise ignorant but by willful obstinacy."

   Ans. First, These were indeed such means of conviction as that their
   sin and unbelief against them had no real excuse, as himself everywhere
   expresseth, John xv. 22, xii. 47, 48, x. 36-38. Secondly, Nothing is
   allowed unto this ignorance, but that it left their repentance possible
   and their sin pardonable. Thirdly, This it will do until God hath used
   all the means of conviction which he intendeth, and no longer. This as
   yet he had not done. He had yet two farther testimonies unto the truth
   which he would graciously afford: First, His resurrection from the
   dead, Rom. i. 4, which was always afterward pleaded as the principal
   evidence of God's approbation of him; Second, The effusion of the Holy
   Spirit in his miraculous operations, Acts ii. 32, 33, v. 32; 1 Tim.
   iii. 16. But where at any time God hath granted all the means of
   conviction that he pleaseth, be they ordinary or extraordinary, if they
   are rejected, there is no hope, Luke xvi. 29-31. On the other side,
   this sin of rejecting Christ and the gospel after profession is
   absolutely willful and with a high hand, against all the light and
   conviction that God will give of the truth unto any of the children of
   men in this world.

   2. These persons had an experience of the truth, goodness, and
   excellency of the gospel, which those others had not, nor could have;
   for they had "tasted of the good word of God, and the powers of the
   world to come," and had received great satisfaction in the things they
   were convinced of, as was before at large declared. Wherefore, in their
   rejection of him and them, an unconquerable hatred and malice must be
   granted to be predominant. And let men take heed what they do when they
   begin to sin against their own experience, for evil lies at the door.

   3. In and under the crucifying of the Lord Christ God had yet a design
   of mercy and grace, to be communicated unto men by the dispensation of
   his Spirit. Therefore there was a way set open unto those who were
   guilty of that sin to repentance and pardon. But now, having made use
   of this also, that being sinned against, there is no place left for any
   thing but severity. Wherefore, --

   4. There was in the sin of these persons blasphemy against the Holy
   Ghost; for they had received in themselves, or seen in others, those
   mighty operations of his whereby he gave attestation unto Christ and
   the gospel. Therefore they could not renounce the Lord Christ without
   an ascription of these works of the Holy Ghost unto the devil, which
   the devil acted them unto. So saith our apostle, "No man speaking by
   the Spirit of God calleth Jesus anathema," or "accursed," 1 Cor. xii.
   3. To call him anathema is to declare and avow that he was justly
   crucified as an accursed person, as a public. This was done by these
   persons who went over to the Jews, in approbation of what they had done
   against him. This no man can do speaking by the Holy Ghost, -- that is,
   whosoever doth so is acted by the spirit of the devil; and if he have
   known the testimony of the Holy Spirit to the contrary, he doth it in
   despite of him, which renders the sin irremissible.

Chapter II.

   Partial apostasy from the gospel -- Pretenses of the church of Rome
   against the charge of this evil examined and rejected.

   Apostasy from the gospel is either total or partial. Of the former we
   have treated in a high and signal instance. When men willfully and
   maliciously (for they cannot do it willfully but they must do it
   maliciously) renounce Jesus Christ as a seducer and malefactor, going
   over in their suffrage unto the Jews, by whom he was crucified, they
   enter into that part of hell and darkness which properly constitutes
   this sin. It were well for such persons if their guilt had no other
   aggravation than theirs who actually "with wicked hands slew him, and
   hanged him on a tree." But rising up unto a contempt of all the means
   of conviction and evidences of truth that God will grant us in this
   world, they cast themselves without that line of divine mercy and
   pardon which some of the others were encompassed withal. So is it with
   many at this day in the world, who with wicked hearts and blinded
   minds, in the pursuit of carnal lusts, voluntarily and obstinately
   embrace Mohammedanism, with an open renunciation of Christ and the
   gospel Unto such persons there is nothing left but "a fearful looking
   for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the
   adversaries." Not that I would cast all persons who may be actually
   hurried into this abomination under the same dreadful doom, seeing the
   case in general will admit of many circumstantial differences, if not
   altering the nature of the crime, yet disposing of things unto various
   events. Not only surprisals by mighty temptations, with dread and
   terror, so shaking the powers of nature as to intercept the influence
   of light and convictions of truth, do claim an exemption from a
   decretory determination under this sentence; but other cases may also
   be attended with some such alleviating circumstances as, preserving
   their minds and souls from willful malice, leave room for the exercise
   of sovereign grace. I myself knew one, yea, was conversant with him,
   and assisting of him in the concerns of his soul, who in the Indies
   turned Mohammedan, was actually initiated by circumcision into their
   superstition, and lived in its outward practice a year or two, who yet
   was sincerely recovered unto repentance, and died in the faith of the
   Son of God.

   Partial apostasy is every crime against the gospel which partakes of
   the nature of the other in any measure or degree; and whatever doth so
   makes an accession towards the guilt of "crucifying the Son of God
   afresh, and putting him to an open shame:" for it is in his gospel and
   church alone wherein he can now suffer from the sons of men. When any
   important principle of evangelical truth is forsaken and renounced,
   especially when many of them are so; when the rule of obedience which
   the gospel prescribeth is habitually neglected; when men believe
   otherwise than it teacheth, and live otherwise than it requireth, --
   there is a partial apostasy from it, whose guilt and danger answer the
   degrees and measures which in each kind it proceeds unto.

   And this is that which we may charge, yea, which the Lord Christ in his
   word doth charge, on every nation under heaven where the gospel is
   publicly professed. Men are apt to please themselves, to approve of
   their own state and condition, wherein they have framed unto themselves
   rest and satisfaction. Churches content themselves with their outward
   order and administrations, especially when accompanied with secular
   advantages, and contend fiercely that all is well, and the gospel
   sufficiently complied withal, whilst their outward constitution is
   preserved and their laws of order kept inviolate. About these is the
   world filled with endless digladiations, wherein the most aim at no
   more but success in their especial contests. Only a few remain who
   fruitlessly complain that, under all these conflicts, the glory, power,
   and purity of Christian religion are lost in the world. And it is known
   that the judgment of Christ concerning churches, as unto their good or
   bad spiritual estate, is ofttimes very distant from their own
   concerning themselves. It was not only for their sakes, but as a
   warning unto all others in all ages, that it is entered on an
   everlasting record, that when the church of Laodicea judged and
   declared without hesitation that she was "rich, and increased with
   goods, and had need of nothing," the Lord Christ, "the Amen, the
   faithful and true witness," pronounced her "wretched, and miserable,
   and poor, and blind, and naked." That things at this day are in no
   better a condition in many, in most churches in the world, is too
   evident to be denied with any pretence of reverence to the word of God,
   and it will be afterward made to appear.

   Certainly the Lord Christ may say to the churches and nations among
   whom his name is yet owned in the world, what God said of old
   concerning that of the Jews, then his only church, "I had planted thee
   a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou trained into the
   degenerate plant of a wild vine unto me?" Jer. ii. 21. Yea, to most of
   them as in another place, "How is the faithful city become an harlot!
   it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
   Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water," Isa. i. 21, 22.
   The greatness of the evil complained of, the secret mystery of its
   accomplishment, the unreasonableness, folly, and ingratitude of the
   fact, the strangeness of the event, make the complaint to be formed
   into a scheme of admiration. And, indeed, if a man be able to consider
   the nature of the gospel, with the benefits communicated thereby unto
   mankind, he cannot but be astonished to find the generality of them to
   be so soon weary of it, and so ready on all occasions to relinquish it;
   for as future glory and a blessed immortality are attainable only
   thereby, so all that true freedom, tranquility, peace, and blessedness,
   whereof our nature in this life is capable, are by no other means
   communicable unto the souls of men. In brief, whatever is of advantage
   in any gracious communication from God unto us, -- without which we are
   nothing but the very worst and most malignant product of sin and
   misery, -- it is all confined unto the gospel and the contents thereof.
   Wherefore, the carelessness of men in neglecting of it, their
   wickedness in its relinquishment as to its principles and obedience,
   may well be expressed as God doth in the inferior instance of the
   apostasy of the Jewish church: Jer. ii. 11, 12, "Hath a nation changed
   their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their
   glory for that which doth not profit. Be astonished, O ye heavens, at
   this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord." Yet
   thus is it, and no otherwise, as we shall afterward manifest, amongst
   the generality of them that are called Christians in the world.

   The church of Rome violently pleads an exemption from this charge by
   virtue of special privilege; -- not an internal privilege of
   efficacious grace into their minds and wills, to preserve it and all
   that belongs unto it always in saving faith and obedience, wherein
   alone a compliance with the gospel consists; but an outward privilege
   of indefectibility, keeping them in the state the gospel requireth they
   know not how, but, as it were, whether they will or no!

   But there is no party or society of men under heaven (considering the
   notoriety of matter of fact to the contrary) but can with less violence
   unto common modesty make use of this pretence. So when the Jews of old
   were charged by the prophets with apostasy from the law and the
   obedience which it required, with threats of destruction for their
   sins, they warded themselves from a conviction of guilt and fear of
   punishment by an unreasonable, yea, outrageous confidence in church
   privileges, then not only appropriated but confined unto them, crying
   out, "The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the
   Lord, are these." This they thought sufficient to repel the charge of
   the prophets, to vindicate their innocency, and secure their peace. The
   reply of the prophet unto them will equally serve in both cases,
   "Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. Will ye steal,
   murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto
   Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; and come and stand
   before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are
   delivered to do all these abominations?" Jer. vii. 8-10. A plea of
   innocency and hope of impunity, under an evident guilt of the highest
   immoralities and the vilest of superstitions, do equally participate of
   folly and impudence.

   It is fallen out with this church of Rome somewhat in like manner as it
   did with him from whom she falsely pretends to derive her wonderful
   privilege of indefectibility; for when our Lord Christ foretold that
   all men should forsake him, he alone, with the highest confidence and
   in a singular manner, undertook the contrary for himself. But all the
   prerogative which he pretended unto issued only in this, that when all
   the other disciples forsook their Master and fled, according to his
   prediction, he alone forsook him and denied him. And that impossibility
   of failing which this church appropriates unto itself as its singular
   and incommunicable privilege hath possibly been a means of, but
   assuredly is accompanied with, a peculiar apostasy, above all other
   churches in the world. Nothing, certainly, can be more vain in itself,
   nor more pernicious unto the souls of them who are under the power of
   such an apprehension, than this pretence, when all evidences in matter
   of fact do openly testify to the contrary. The principal nations of its
   communion are at this day engaged in fierce, bloody, and causeless
   wars, and these so managed as to be accompanied with a confluence of
   all those evils and flagitious wickednesses which have a tendency to
   make mankind sinful and miserable. Is this that love and peace which,
   according to the rule of the gospel, ought to be among the disciples of
   Christ, and without which it is impossible they should have any
   evidences in themselves, or give any testimony unto the world, that so
   they are? Doth this answer the promises to be accomplished in the days
   of the Messiah, Isa. ii. 2-4, or the innumerable precepts given by
   Jesus Christ himself as to unity, love, and peace? "But wars," they
   say, "are lawful, and so no argument that those engaged in them are
   revolters from the rule of the gospel." I say, It may be so; but it is
   far safer to judge all war unlawful than to justify all the wars that
   rage in Christendom, or to suppose them consistent with the rule or
   doctrine of the gospel. The truth is, many things must concur to
   reconcile any of them unto that obedience which we owe to the Prince of
   Peace; nor is any of them of that nature or necessity, but that, if the
   gospel had its proper efficacy on the minds of all that are called
   Christians, and its due authority over their consciences, they would be
   all prevented. However, in a church pretending to be no way fallen off
   or apostatized from the evangelical rule, it is justly expected that
   another representation be made of the religion taught by Jesus Christ
   than that which appears in the desolations that are wrought in the
   earth through the lusts and rage of the members of it. The state of
   things amongst them seems not to constitute that kingdom of
   righteousness, love, and peace, which Christ came to set up in the
   world, and which indeed at present, by reason of the general apostasy
   of the nations, is little elsewhere to be found but in the souls of his
   sanctified ones; and those particular churches are blessed in a
   peculiar manner who endeavour, in their profession and obedience, in
   any measure to rise up unto an expression thereof.

   Besides, the lives of the generality of them who adhere unto the
   communion of that church, [and] of the most who preside therein, are
   openly contradictory unto the evangelical rule of obedience. It may for
   the most part be said concerning them with respect unto the whole, as
   one of them said of a part of the New Testament, "Either this is not
   gospel, or we are not Christians." In brief, if the kingdom of Christ,
   -- which was once a kingdom of light, and truth, and holiness; of
   separation, in principles, affections, and conversation, from the
   world; of communion with God and loving-kindness among men; of
   righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, -- may become, and is
   become, a kingdom of darkness, pride, ignorance, ambition, persecution,
   blood, superstition, and idolatry, then and not else doth it visibly
   remain among them, and they have nothing apostatized from the laws and
   government of it.

   But they can easily discharge themselves of the guilt of this
   imputation: for notwithstanding that the things mentioned be in part
   acknowledged to be so, (as to what purpose is it to deny the sun to
   shine at noonday?) yet the peace, love, and unity, the holiness and
   righteousness, that ought, according to the gospel, to be and reside in
   the church, are found amongst them on other accounts; -- for the whole
   body of the church and all the members of it agree and are united in
   one head, even the pope of Rome, which is the only evangelical unity
   required of the disciples of Christ! and the holiness of the worship,
   with that of the saints that have been among them, as also of their
   present retired devotionists, and the charity of many, testified by
   magnificent works of piety and bounty, do sufficiently answer that
   sanctification, holiness, and love, that conformity unto Christ in
   heavenly-mindedness and obedience, which the gospel requireth. But this
   is no other but an account of the true nature of that apostasy of the
   latter times which is foretold by the apostle, 2 Tim. iii. 1-5, "In the
   last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their
   own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
   parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers,
   false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
   traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
   God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." Under
   the power of the most filthy and outrageous lusts, men frame to
   themselves an outward shape, image, and representation of holiness;
   they delineate a form of religion by a substitution of other things in
   the room of the life and substance of it, which are lost. The power of
   Christianity is openly denied in their being acted by the power of all
   those lusts which are contrary unto it; for the grace of God in the
   gospel teacheth them by whom it is received to "deny all ungodliness
   and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this
   present world." This men cannot more perfectly renounce than in being
   "foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
   living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another;" such
   persons being sufficiently remote from being "saved by the washing of
   regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost." Whilst men live in this
   state and condition, wherein a complete denial or renunciation of the
   power of godliness or religion doth consist, if, to supply the absence
   thereof, they draw and take on themselves a scheme, form, and
   appearance of it, by the application of the names, offices, and
   properties of gospel effects unto outward, lifeless duties, or
   appearances of them, the apostasy foretold is completely accomplished.
   This is to let David go, and to foist an image covered with goats' hair
   in his stead; or at best, like Rehoboam, to make brazen shields in the
   room of those of gold taken away by Shishak. No otherwise doth the
   church of Rome deal in this matter. The power of faith, love, peace,
   holiness, conformity unto Christ, self-denial, and all the principles
   of a heavenly conversation, being lost and denied among the generality
   of its members, and all the real glory of Christianity thereby
   forfeited and despised, they have set up a form or image of it,
   wherewith they content themselves, and attempt to deceive others.
   Instead of that mystical, spiritual union with himself and among
   themselves which Christ prayed for and purchased for his disciples,
   they have substituted the morphosis or mormo of an agreement in
   professing subjection to the pope of Rome. For that heavenly love of
   one another in him, and for his sake, which he renews the souls of
   believers unto by his grace, we are presented in their profession with
   outward works of charity and bounty, measured and valued by the
   advantage which redounds unto the principal actors in this show. Peace
   (the great legacy of Christ unto his followers) with God in their own
   minds, with the whole creation not shut up under the curse, that
   comprehensive grace and mercy wherein is comprised all the blessedness
   which in this world we can be made partakers of, is preserved in the
   flourishing prosperity and temporal successes of the court of Rome. The
   internal, effectual operations of the Spirit of grace have the outward
   dispensations of ordinances shuffled in their place and stead;
   regeneration is baptism; growth in grace is episcopal confirmation; the
   application, by faith, of the blood of Christ, once offered in a holy
   sacrifice for us, must give way unto the daily sacrifice of the mass
   offered for the sins of the quick and the dead; disciplines and some
   outward bodily severities must supply the place of the mortification of
   sin, the power whereof is never more lost and denied than it is under
   the highest external pretences of it. So the whole work of the Spirit
   as a Spirit of grace and supplication in the church must be, and is
   unto themselves, satisfactorily represented by reading, saying,
   chanting with voices and musical instruments, prayers and praises
   invented and composed by they know not whom, and in a language which
   the most of those who are obliged to comply with them understand not at
   all.

   And even the worst part of their image is in what they have fixed on as
   the delineation and representation of the rule and discipline of Christ
   in the gospel; for, rejecting that humble, holy, meek, diligent
   endeavour to preserve all the faithful in obedience, love, unity, and
   fruitful walking, by the application of the commands of Christ unto
   their souls and consciences through his Spirit, and with his authority,
   they have erected a worldly domination over God's heritage, in whose
   exercise more force, fraud, extortion, oppression, violence, and
   bloodshed, have been acted and perpetrated, than it may be in the
   secular government of any tyrannical state in the world.

   Other instances of the like nature might be given. This is that
   morphosis tes eusebeias, or aletheias tes kat' eusebeian, that figure
   and representation of evangelical truth and holiness wherewith these
   men would countenance themselves in, and cover from others, that
   apostasy from the gospel which predominant lusts have cast them into
   and keep them under the power of, according as it was foretold it
   should come to pass in the latter days.

   It is yet replied, "That whatever apprehensions others may have, or
   whatever judgment shall be made, of the predominant evils reigning
   among the generality of them, and their seeming inconsistency with the
   doctrine of the gospel, yet the promise of the Spirit to lead into all
   truth is not only granted but confined unto them, so as that they are
   eternally secured as to faith and belief, whatever other miscarriages
   they may fall into." And the nature of this plea is so effectual, that
   if it could be made good and confirmed on their behalf, notwithstanding
   I see not as yet how it is possible to solve other difficulties that
   occur in this case, yet would it with me determine all things in
   controversy between them and us. Let them but evince that they alone do
   inherit the promised Spirit of Christ exclusively unto all others, --
   that he dwells, resides, works, guides in and among them alone, -- and
   in other things we will spare them the trouble of farther pleading
   their cause. But their pretence hereunto is impotent and contemptible;
   for what they insist upon amounts to no more but this, that they being
   "the church," the promise of giving the Spirit is made and fulfilled
   unto them alone; which only begs the matter that is in principal
   difference between us, and the disputes about it are endless. If,
   indeed, they argued, on the other hand, that they are the only church
   of Christ because they alone enjoy the promise of the Spirit, as the
   inference were undoubtedly certain (for it is the presence of Christ by
   his Spirit that gives being or existence unto the church), so the truth
   of the assertion were capable of an easy trial and a satisfactory
   determination; for where the Spirit doth so reside, according to the
   promise of Christ, and abide with any, as he doth with no others in the
   same kind, he will infallibly manifest his presence by his operations,
   and sufficiently evidence them with whom he is to be the church of
   Christ, seeing, as he is the promised Spirit of truth, the world cannot
   receive him. His operations are all of them either in a way of grace or
   gifts; and his gifts are either extraordinary or ordinary. When,
   therefore, those of the church of Rome can manifest that they enjoy
   such gracious operations of the Spirit as others enjoy nothing of the
   same kind, or that they are furnished and supplied with such spiritual
   gifts, either ordinary or extraordinary, as no others do participate of
   with them or besides them, -- not proving it by saying they alone are
   "the church," and therefore it must be so, but by the evidence of the
   things themselves, as it was in the primitive times, -- they shall not
   only free themselves from the charge of any dangerous apostasy from the
   gospel, but enjoy moreover all that their hearts can wish.

   But this pretence hath been so often and so fully evinced of falsehood,
   and that by all means of conviction, in the examination of causes and
   effects (it being undeniably demonstrated that as no such promise was
   ever peculiarly made unto them, much less on such terms of security as
   they imagine, and that in the issue, as unto matter of fact, instead of
   being "led into all truth," they have departed almost from all), that
   it needs not again to be insisted on. And, indeed, such a promise as is
   pretended is altogether inconsistent with the glory and honour of the
   gospel of God. The word of the gospel, -- that is, the truth contained
   therein, -- is the sole external instrument of the reconciliation of
   sinners unto God, and of their walking before him in obedience unto his
   glory; other end and use it hath none. To give by irrevocable grant the
   possession of this truth, and not in order unto that end, and so to
   continue it whether ever that effect be produced or no, yea, where it
   is not, corresponds not with other fruits of the wisdom of God in the
   dispensation of his grace. And whereas the gospel, as to the nature of
   its doctrine, will and may be interpreted by its fruits and effects in
   the lives of men, to allow them the security of its truth on a
   supposition of a course of sin, and a continuance in a state of
   irreconciliation or enmity against God, is to expose the doctrine of
   it, and the law of obedience contained in it, to just censure and
   reproach.

   Wherefore, notwithstanding these or any other pretences of an alike
   nature, we may safely proceed to show how the generality of Christians
   have partially apostatized from the gospel, and to inquire into the
   ways, means, causes, and reasons thereof.

Chapter III.

   Apostasy from the mystery, truth, or doctrine of the gospel --
   Proneness of persons and churches thereunto -- Proved by all sorts of
   instances.

   There are three things in the gospel which are as the essentially
   constitutive parts of it:-- 1. The mystery of its doctrine, which is
   the object of faith; 2. The holiness of its precepts, which are the
   matter of our obedience; and, 3. The purity of its institutions of
   worship, which is the trial of our faith and obedience as to their
   profession. With respect unto these we are to make our inquiry, both as
   unto matter of fact, and as unto the reasons, causes, and occasions of
   it, in the apostasy from them that is in the world. Instances hereof,
   in every one of the particulars mentioned, we shall find in our own
   days, and those both deplorable and of ill abode. [4] But I shall not
   confine myself unto the present age, nor unto what is done or come to
   pass among ourselves, but consider things with respect unto the whole
   course and progress of religion since the first preaching and
   declaration of the gospel.

   First, The mystery of the truth or doctrine of the gospel, which is the
   object of our faith, is the foundation of its precepts and
   institutions, of the holiness it requireth and of the worship that it
   appointeth. Where this is forsaken, the others cannot be retained. Men
   may profess the truth, and yet not yield obedience unto it, Tit. i. 16,
   2 Tim. iii. 5; but without the real belief of it, no man can be
   obedient as he ought. The obedience which the gospel requireth is the
   "obedience of faith," Rom. i. 5, or being "obedient to the faith," Acts
   vi. 7. It is this "grace of God" alone which "teacheth men to deny all
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and
   godly in this present world," so as to find acceptance with God
   therein, Tit. ii. 11, 12. Wherever, therefore, this is rejected,
   renounced, forsaken, declined from by any, so far as it is so, so far
   there is and will be an apostasy from all other concernments of the
   gospel. This, therefore, we are to inquire into. And we shall find in
   our inquiry that all sorts of persons, all churches, are, and always
   have been, exceedingly prone to turn aside from the mystery and truth
   of the doctrine of the gospel, that they have done so accordingly, and
   that those which are now in the world continue to be of the same temper
   and inclination. And as it will appear that no evil practices are
   indulged unto on this supposition, so it is desirable that those who
   are secure in this matter, on such principles as wherewith they are
   satisfied, would not with too much severity reflect on them who cannot
   but be jealous over themselves and others. The great apostle himself
   makes this the principal ornament in the preparation of his triumph
   upon the success of his ministry, that he had "kept the faith:" 2 Tim.
   iv. 6-8, "I am," saith he, "now ready to be offered, and the time of my
   departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
   course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
   crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give
   me at that day." Of all that made way for that triumphant glory which
   he now had a prospect of, he insists on this only in particular, that
   he had "kept the faith;" which he did not do without a severe warfare
   and conflict: so great a matter was that in his esteem, which most
   suppose so common, so easy, that little diligence or watchfulness is
   required thereunto. And the frequent solemn charges, with pathetical
   exhortations, which he gives unto his son Timothy to be careful herein,
   manifest both the weight he laid upon it, the difficulty that was in
   it, and the danger of miscarriage wherewith it was attended: 1 Tim. vi.
   20, 21, "O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
   profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so
   called: which some professing have erred concerning the faith." 2 Tim.
   i. 13, 14, "Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of
   me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing which
   was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."
   And the same apostle expressly mentions the proneness of some to
   relinquish the truth of the gospel; whom, therefore, he would have
   rebuked sharply, "that they might be sound in the faith, not giving
   heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, turning from the truth,"
   Tit. i. 13, 14. Neither would there be any need that some should
   "earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the saints," Jude
   8, but that others are very ready to corrupt it and turn away from it.

   Examples of this state and event of things among all the churches in
   the world, since the first planting of them in and by the doctrine of
   the gospel, will give more evidence unto the truth of our assertion,
   and a clear account of that matter of fact, whose reasons and causes we
   are to inquire into. And because I would confine myself unto the full
   declaration of the mystery of Christ, I shall not insist on the church
   of the Jews under the old testament. But it is known unto all how, from
   their first transgession in making the golden calf, -- whereon, as God
   complains, they quickly, in a few days, turned out of the way, -- they
   were continually prone unto all sorts of apostasy; and in the issue,
   the generality of them fell off from the promise and covenant of
   Abraham by their unbelief, as the apostle declares, Rom. xi.. And it is
   to be feared that the appearance and pretence of some Christian
   churches unto better success have this only advantage, that their ways
   and practices are not recorded by the Spirit of God, as theirs were.
   But I shall not insist on that instance.

   Of all the churches that are or ever were in the world, those gathered
   and planted by the apostles themselves had the greatest advantage to
   know the mystery and truth of the gospel, and the most forcible reasons
   unto constancy and perseverance therein. Considering the ability of
   their teachers to reveal unto them "all the counsel of God," with their
   faithfulness in "withholding nothing that was profitable unto them,"
   Acts xx. 18-21, 26, 27; their authority, as being sent immediately by
   Jesus Christ, and their absolute infallibility in all that they
   delivered; a man would rationally think that there were no room, no
   pretence, left for any to decline in the least from the doctrine
   wherein they were instructed by them, nor any advantage for Satan or
   seducers to practice upon them. There is no doubt but most of us
   suppose that had we been so taught by the apostles themselves, nothing
   could ever tempt us to doubt or waver, much less to relinquish any
   truth wherein we were so instructed. But, alas! this thought is not
   unlike the apprehension of the rich man in hell, who judged that if one
   rose from the dead to warn his brethren, they would repent and be
   converted unto God. But as Abraham told him, "if they would not believe
   Moses and the prophets, neither would they believe should one rise from
   the dead," no more would we, if we be not constant and steadfast in the
   doctrine of the gospel as revealed in the Scripture, be so, if we had
   been taught it by all the apostles together. An example of this
   proneness to relinquish evangelical principles we have in most of the
   churches called and gathered by them, whose faith and practice are
   recorded in their writings.

   The church of Corinth was planted by the apostle Paul, and watered by
   Apollos, that great evangelist; and none can question but that they
   were fully instructed by them in all the principles of the gospel;
   which is evident also from that abundance of spiritual gifts which,
   above any other church, they bad received. But yet, within a few years,
   before the writing of his first epistle unto them, which was not above
   five or six years at the most, many of them fell into that fundamental
   error of denying the resurrection of the dead; whereby they wholly
   annihilated, as the apostle declares, the whole death and resurrection
   of Christ, rendering what appeared to remain of their faith altogether
   vain, 1 Cor. xv. 12-18.

   The churches of the Galatians are yet a more pregnant instance.
   Converted they were unto the faith of Christ and planted in their
   church-state by the ministry of the same apostle; and although he
   instructed them in the whole counsel of God, yet it may be justly
   supposed that he laboured in nothing more than to establish them in the
   knowledge and faith of the grace of God in Christ, and the free
   justification of believers by faith in him or his blood alone: for this
   he everywhere declareth to have been his principal aim and design, in
   the whole course of his ministry. The doctrine hereof they received
   with so much joy and satisfaction that they valued the apostle as an
   angel of God, received him as Jesus Christ, and esteemed him above the
   sight of their own eyes, chap. iv. 14, 15. But yet after all this, upon
   a sudden, so as that he was surprised with it and amazed at it, they
   fell from the doctrine of grace and justification by faith alone, to
   seek after righteousness as it were by the works of the law: Chap. iii.
   1, "O foolish Galatians," saith he, "who hath bewitched you, that ye
   should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
   evidently set forth, crucified among you?" Notwithstanding the evident
   demonstration of the troth which they had received, and experience of
   the power of the word, which he mentions, verse 2, yet all on a sudden
   they apostatsized from it. And as the foundation hereof lay in the
   uncured folly and vanity of their minds (as we shall see afterward that
   it doth in all alike cases), yet the strangeness of the manner of it,
   that it should be so sudden, and, it may be, universal, makes him ask
   if there were not some strange fascination or spiritual witchcraft in
   it. So have we seen persons among ourselves, who in a day or two have
   renounced all those principles of truth wherein they have been
   instructed, and embraced a system of notions diametrically opposite
   unto them, insomuch as some have supposed that there hath been a real
   diabolical fascination in the matter. Now, this apostasy of the
   Galatians was such as the apostle peremptorily declares that Christ and
   all the benefits of his death were renounced therein.

   Wherefore, although we may be troubled at it and bewail it, that sundry
   persons are so ready to fall off from the same truth in the same
   manner, yet ought we not to think strange of it or be moved by it,
   seeing that whole churches called and instructed therein, and that
   particularly, by the apostle himself, did so fall in a short time after
   their first plantation.

   It is more than probable that those who endeavoured to make a spoil of
   the Colossians "by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of
   men," chap. ii. 8, had no small success among them. And such things
   they were wherewith they were attempted and beguiled as took them off
   from "holding the Head," turning them aside unto the curious
   speculations of men "vainly puffed up by their own fleshly minds,"
   verses 18, 19. Things of the like nature may be observed in most of the
   other churches unto whom the epistles are directed.

   And in those unto particular persons, as unto Timothy and Titus, he
   warns them of this readiness of all sorts of persons to apostatize from
   the truth, giving express instances in some by name who had done so
   themselves, and sedulously endeavoured the overthrow of the faith of
   others. The holy apostle John lived to see more of these woful turnings
   aside from the truth and relinquishments of evangelical mysteries.
   Hence in his epistles he gives an account expressly of the apostasies
   that were among professors of the gospel, of the seducers, and their
   pretences whereby they were promoted, warning believers of the danger
   thereof, and of sundry duties incumbent on them necessary to their
   preservation. And the Epistle of Jude is written to the same purpose.
   It is known, also, how most of the churches unto whom the Lord Jesus
   Christ granted the favour of his visitation, wherein he tried and
   judged their state and condition, their stability in and declensions
   from the truth, were found guilty by him as to some degrees of
   backsliding and apostasy, for which they were severely reproved.

   Certainly we can never enough admire the profound negligence and
   security of most churches and professors in the world with respect unto
   a due adherence unto the mysteries and truths of the gospel. Some think
   that they have such a privilege as that they can never decline from
   them or mistake about them, nor have done so in the long tract of
   sixteen hundred years, although they have been plunged into all manner
   of wickedness and carnal security. Others are wanton and careless under
   their profession, making little difference between truth and error; or,
   however, suppose that it is no great achievement to abide in the truth
   wherein they have been instructed. And these things have brought most
   churches and places under the power of that apostasy which shall
   afterwards be discovered. But if the churches thus planted by the
   apostles themselves were liable unto such defections, and many of them
   did actually, at least for a season, fall away from most important
   doctrines of the gospel (from whence, it may be, they had never been
   recovered if healing bad not been timely applied by apostolical
   authority and wisdom), can we, who have not their advantages, nor some
   of the evidences of the truth which they enjoyed, having all the same
   causes of apostasy, inward and outward, which they had to be tried
   withal, expect that we shall be preserved, unless we watchfully and
   carefully attend unto all the ways and means whereby we may so be? But
   these things will be spoken unto afterward.

   We may, in the next place, inquire what was the state of the churches
   after the ending and finishing of the sacred records, and the death of
   the apostles with all other persons divinely inspired. Here some would
   have us believe that all things were well, at least for a long season,
   and some that they are so to this very day. All that was believed and
   practised among them must be esteemed almost as sacred as the gospel
   itself, and be made a part of the rule of our faith and worship. It
   seems those very churches which, during the days of the apostles, and
   whilst they were under their inspection, were so prone to mistakes, to
   follow their own imaginations, or comply with the inventions of others,
   yea, in sundry instances so as to apostatise from the most important
   doctrines of the gospel, were all on a sudden, on no other advantage
   but being delivered from apostolical care and oversight, so changed,
   established, and confirmed, that they declined not in any thing from
   the truth and rule of the gospel. For my part, I pay as great a respect
   and reverence unto the primitive churches of the first, second, and
   third centuries, as I think any man living can justly do; but that they
   did in nothing decline from the grace, mystery, truth, or rule of the
   gospel, that they gave no admittance unto "vain deceit, after the
   tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world," there are such
   evidences unto the contrary as none can believe it but those who have a
   great mind it should be so, and [have] their credulity at their
   disposal. I shall therefore briefly inquire what was foretold that
   would ensue among those churches, and what came to pass accordingly.

   The apostle Paul tells the elders of the church of Ephesus that "he
   knew that after his departing grievous wolves would enter in among
   them, not sparing the flock," Acts xx. 29. Though he compares them to
   devouring wolves, yet are they not bloody persecutors by external force
   that he doth intend; for that expression, "Shall enter in among you,"
   denotes an admission into the society and converse of the church, under
   pretence of the same profession of religion. They are, therefore,
   heretics and seducers, who lie in wait to deceive through various
   sleights and cunning craftiness, being not (whatever they pretended)
   really of the church, not of the flock of sheep, no, not in profession,
   but devouring wolves. The same persons are intended who by Peter are
   called "false teachers," such as should "privily bring in damnable
   heresies, denying the Lord that bought them," 2 Pet. ii. 1. But the
   apostle adds, moreover, in the next place, "Also of your own selves
   shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after
   them," Acts xx. 30. I do not think that the apostle in that expression,
   "Also of your own selves," intended precisely any of those who were
   then personally present with him, or at least it is not necessary that
   we should so judge; but some that were quickly to succeed in their room
   and office are intended. And all the perverse things which they would
   teach, being contradictory to the doctrine of the gospel, contained
   some degrees of apostasy in them. That they prevailed in this attempt,
   that the church was leavened and infected by them, is evident from
   hence, that not long after that church is charged by our Saviour to be
   fallen in sundry things from its first purity, Rev. ii. 4, 5. So he
   assures Timothy that the time would come, and that speedily, as appears
   by the prescription he makes for its prevention, 2 Tim. iv. 1, 2, that
   men "would not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts should
   heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;" whereby they should
   "be turned from the truth, and be turned unto fables," verses 3, 4; --
   a plain prediction of that defection from evangelical truth and purity
   which was to befall the churches, and did so. And this, with the danger
   of it, he doth more vehemently urge, as from a spirit of prophecy, 1
   Tim. iv. 1, 2, "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
   times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
   spirits, and doctrines of devils." By that phrase of speech, "The
   Spirit speaketh expressly," the apostle understands not a plain,
   distinct revelation made thereof unto himself alone, but that the
   infallible Spirit of God, whereby himself and the rest of the apostles
   were guided, did everywhere testify the same. It is an expression not
   unlike that he useth, Acts xx. 23, "The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every
   city;" that is, in all places those who were divinely inspired agreed
   on the same prediction.

   And I judge the apostles did everywhere, by joint consent, acquaint the
   churches that after the gospel had been received and professed for a
   while, there would ensue a notable apostasy from the truth and worship
   of it. So Jude tells them, verses 17, 18, that "the apostles of our
   Lord Jesus Christ told them that in the last time there should be
   mockers, who should walk after their ungodly lusts." This all the
   apostles agreed in the prediction of, and warned all the churches
   concerning it, So John expresseth it, 1 John iv. 3, "This is that
   spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come." He
   speaks of the coming of antichrist, and therewithal an apostasy from
   the faith, as that which they had been fully instructed in. And the
   apostle Paul mentioneth it as that which not only they were forewarned
   of, but also acquainted with some particulars concerning; which it was
   not, it may be, convenient in those days to mention publicly, for fear
   of offence. "There must," saith he, "be a falling away," or an apostasy
   from the faith, under the leading of "the man of sin." And saith he,
   "Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
   things? and now ye know what withholdeth," 2 Thess. ii. 3, 5, 6. He had
   both told them of the apostasy, and also acquainted them with one
   particular about it, which he will not now mention. This being the
   great testimony of the Spirit of God in those days, that the visible
   church should so fall away from the faith, one of the chief ways
   whereby Satan brought it to pass was by the advancing of a contrary
   revelation and principle, -- namely, that this or that church, the
   church of Rome for instance, was infallible and indefectible, and could
   never fall away from the faith. By this means he obliterated out of the
   minds of men the former warnings given by the Spirit unto the churches,
   so rendering them secure, defeating the ends of the prediction; for
   hereby he not only led men insensibly into the greatest apostasy, but
   taught them to adhere invincibly unto what they had done, and with the
   highest confidence to justify themselves therein. But all those and
   many other warnings did the Holy Ghost give concerning the defection
   from the mystery of the gospel which the churches would in succeeding
   times fall into; which being neglected by secure professors, whilst
   their faith was weakened and undermined by innumerable artifices,
   issued in their apostasy. For these things being thus expressly
   foretold by the Spirit of God himself, we may briefly inquire into the
   event of the predictions mentioned, and whether indeed they came to
   pass or no.

   An account in general of the state of the church after the days of the
   apostles we have given us by Hegesippus, who lived in the next age
   after them, as his words are recorded by Eusebius, lib. iii. cap. 32.
   Relating the martyrdom of Simon, the son of Cleopas, he adds: "Unto
   these times the church continued a pure and incorrupted virgin, those
   who endeavoured to corrupt the rule of saving truth, where any such
   were, lying hid in obscurity. But after that the holy company of the
   apostles came to their several ends, and that generation was past who
   heard the divine Wisdom with their own ears, a conspiracy of wicked
   error, by the seductions of those that taught strange doctrines, began
   to take place; and when none of the apostles were remaining, they began
   to set up their science, falsely so called, with open face against the
   preaching of the truth." We have already seen that there were many
   declensions in the clays of the apostles themselves; but as they were
   jealous over all the churches with godly jealousy, -- for having
   "espoused them to one husband," they took care "to present them as a
   chaste virgin unto Christ" (the words which Hegesippus alludes unto),
   and thereon watched against all ways and means whereby as "the serpent
   beguiled Eve through his subtlety, their minds should be corrupted from
   the simplicity that is in Christ," by the teaching of other doctrines
   than what they had received from them, as Paul speaks, 2 Cor. xi. 2-4,
   -- so by their wisdom, diligence, and watchfulness, they were for the
   most part soon reduced from their wanderings and recovered from their
   mistakes. Hence this holy man pronounceth the church a pure virgin
   during the days of the apostles and their inspection, at least
   comparatively as to what ensued thereon, for immediately after he
   acknowledgeth that they were much corrupted and defiled, -- that is,
   fallen off from "the simplicity that is in Christ," -- intending,
   probably, those very things wherein after ages made them their example;
   for things quickly came unto that state in the world, and which yet
   with the most continueth therein, that men desired no greater warranty
   for their practice in religion than the shadow or appearance of any
   thing that was in use or prevailed among those churches, though
   themselves therein went off evidently from the simplicity that is in
   Christ.

   This account and unquestionable testimony we have in general of the
   accomplishment of the predictions before mentioned, concerning a
   declension that was to ensue from the power, purity, and simplicity of
   the gospel. But whatever is here intended, it must be looked on as the
   very beginning and entrance of the apostasy that ensued; which can
   scarce be taken notice of in comparison of that excess which it quickly
   proceeded unto. In particular, the parts of the sacred predictions
   mentioned may be reduced unto four heads:-- 1. "Men from among
   themselves speaking perverse things." 2. "Grievous wolves entering in,
   not sparing the flock." 3. Weariness, and "not enduring of sound
   doctrine," but turning the mind unto fables, and from the truth. 4. A
   gradual, secret, mysterious work of a general apostasy in the whole
   visible church. And it might be easily demonstrated by instances how
   all these had their particular accomplishment, until the whole apostasy
   foretold was formed and completed. We may give some short remarks upon
   them all:--

   1. It cannot be denied but that many of the principal teachers in the
   first ages of the church after the apostles, especially among those
   whose writings remain unto posterity, did, in a neglect of the gospel
   and its simplicity, embrace and teach sundry things, perverse, curious,
   and contrary to the form of wholesome words committed unto them;
   whilst, for any thing that appears, they were not so duly conversant in
   evangelical mysteries, with reverence and godly fear, as it was their
   duty to have been. It is known how instances hereof might be multiplied
   out of the writings of Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Clemens, Origen,
   Tatianus, Athenagoras, Tertullian, Lactantius, and others; but I shall
   not reflect with any severity on their names and memories who continued
   to adhere unto the fundamental principles of Christian religion,
   though, what by curious speculations, what by philosophical prejudices
   and notions, by wrested allegorical expositions of Scripture, by
   opinions openly false and contradictory to the word of God, they much
   corrupted and debased the pure and holy doctrine of Jesus and his
   apostles.

   2. The "grievous wolves" foretold of, who were to "spoil the flock," I
   look on as heretics in their various kinds. And on this account it
   would seem to exceed all belief what multitudes and shoals of all sorts
   of persons fell off from the mystery and truth of the gospel, after
   they had been declared unto them and professed by them, which is a full
   confirmation of the assertion before laid down. But they may in general
   be reduced unto two heads:--

   (1.) Of those who, in a regardlessness and contempt of the gospel which
   they had received and professed, fell away unto foolish, extravagant,
   heathenish imaginations, unintelligible endless fancies, for the most
   part (as is supposed) accompanied with wicked practices, whereby,
   although they would retain the name of Christians, they completely and
   absolutely fell off from Christ and his gospel. Such were the Gnostics
   in all their branches and under their several appellations,
   Marcionites, Manichees, and others almost innumerable, with whose
   names, rise, opinions, and course of lives, Epiphanius, Austin, and
   Philastrius, have filled up their catalogues. It may be said, "They
   were all of them persons of so great abominations that they deserve no
   consideration among such as own Christian religion." But the greater
   the abominations were which they fell into, the more wild, senseless,
   and wicked were their imaginations, considering the multitudes of
   professed Christians which fell into them, the more effectual is the
   testimony they give unto the truth of our assertion; for were there not
   an inexpressible proneness in the minds of men to relinquish the
   mystery of the gospel, were it not promoted by unutterable folly and
   secret enmity against the truth, would it have been possible that so
   early in the church, taking date immediately from the decease of the
   apostles, such multitudes of professed Christians should openly
   renounce those sacred truths for such noxious, foolish imaginations?
   These are they who are expressly prophesied of, that they should "bring
   in damnable heresies, denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing
   upon themselves swift destruction, many following their pernicious
   ways; by reason of whom the way of truth was to be evil spoken of," 2
   Pet. ii. 1, 2: for all their impious opinions and practices were by the
   heathen objected unto, and charged on Christian religion, as is evident
   in Origen's reply to Celsus, among others; and so by reason of them
   "the way of truth was evil spoken of."

   (2.) There was another sort of heresies, and so of real apostasy from
   the mystery of the gospel, whose authors and followers yet pretended an
   adherence unto and profession thereof. And these may be reduced to two
   heads:-- [1.] Concerning the person; and, [2.] Concerning the grace of
   Christ. Of the first sort, the principal and most prevalent was that of
   the Arians in denying his deity; of the latter, that of the Pelagians
   in opposing his satisfaction, merit, and grace. The first of these was
   poured out as a flood from the mouth of the old serpent, and bare all
   before it like a torrent; the latter insinuated itself as poison into
   the very vitals of the church. The first, as a burning fever, carried
   present death with it and before it; the latter, as a gangrene or
   hectical distemper, insensibly consumed the vital spirits of religion.
   In the flint we have a most woful evidence of the instability of
   professors, and their readiness to forego the saving mysteries of the
   gospel; for in little more than half an age after its first rise, the
   generality of Christians in the world, bishops, priests, and people,
   fell under the power of it, and in their public confessions renounced
   and denied the true eternal deity of the Son of God: for, having
   obtained the patronage of some emperors, as Constantius and Valens, and
   the suffrage of innumerable prelates, who jointly promoted this heresy
   by force and fraud, almost the whole world, as to outward profession,
   was for a season led into this apostasy, wherein some whole nations (as
   the Goths and Vandals) continued for sundry ages afterward. And for the
   latter, or Pelagianism, it secretly, subtilely, and gradually, so
   insinuated itself into the minds of men, that, for the substance of it,
   it continues to be no small part of that religion which the generality
   of Christians do at this day profess, and is yet upon a prevalent
   progress in the world.

   This is the second way of the apostasy of professors which was foretold
   by the Holy Ghost, which so came to pass as that the wounds which
   Christianity received thereby are not healed unto this day.

   3. Another way was, that men should grow weary of sound doctrine, and
   not being able, for the reasons afterward to be insisted on, to endure
   it any longer, should hearken after fables, and be turned away from the
   truth. And this no less eminently came to pass than any of the former.
   About the third century it was that monkish fables began to be broached
   in the world. And this sort of men, instead of the doctrines of the
   grace of God, of justification by the blood of Christ, of faith and
   repentance, of new obedience and walking before God according to the
   commands of Christ and rule of the gospel, which men grew weary of and
   could not well longer endure, filled their minds and satisfied their
   itching ears with stories of dreams and visions, of angelical
   perfection in themselves, of self-invented devotions, of uncommanded
   mortifications, and a thousand other foolish superstitions. By such
   fables were innumerable souls turned from the truth and simplicity of
   the gospel, thinking that in these things alone religion consisted,
   despising the whole doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles
   in comparison of them. These are particularly prophesied of and
   declared, 1 Tim. iv. 1-3. By the hypocrisy and lies, fabulous stories
   and doctrines of devils, of this sort of men, the body of the Christian
   people was so leavened and infected with the belief of vain delusions
   and the practice of foolish superstitions that little or nothing was
   left sound or wholesome among them.

   4. Lastly, The secret working of the "mystery of iniquity," in, under,
   and by all these ways, and other artifices innumerable, which the
   subtlety of Satan, with the vanity of the minds and lusts of the hearts
   of men, made use of, wrought out that fatal apostasy which the world
   groaned under and was ruined by when it came unto its height in the
   Papacy. The rise and progress of this catholic defection, the ways,
   means, and degrees of its procedure, its successful advance in several
   ages, have been so discovered and laid open by many, so far as the
   nature of so mysterious a work is capable of a discovery in this world,
   that I shall not need to repeat here any instance of it, In brief, the
   doctrine of the gospel was so depraved, and the worship of it so far
   corrupted, that the waters of the sanctuary seemed, like the river
   Jordan, to run and issue in a dead sea, or, like those of Egypt, to be
   turned into blood, that would yield no refreshment unto the souls of
   men. So was that prophetical parable of our Saviour fulfilled, Luke
   xix. 12-15, etc.

   Before I proceed to particulars among ourselves in this kind, I shall
   yet farther confirm our assertion in general by the consideration of
   the second venture, if I may so say, that God gave the gospel in the
   world, the second trial which he hath made of many churches and
   nations, and what hath been the event and success thereof.

   During the season spoken of the church was driven into the wilderness,
   as to its visible profession, where it was secretly nourished by the
   Spirit and word of God, and the few witnesses unto the truth which yet
   remained prophesied in sackcloth, ofttimes sealing their testimony
   (whereby the world was disquieted and tormented) with their blood. But
   when the time came that God would again graciously visit the remnant of
   his inheritance, he stirred up, gifted, and enabled many faithful
   servants of Christ, by whom the work of reformation was successfully
   begun and carried on in many nations and churches. It is true, they
   arrived not therein at the purity and peace of the apostolical
   churches; nor was it by some of them absolutely aimed at. And this
   quickly manifested itself by the great differences that were among them
   both in doctrine and worship; whereon those mutual contests and
   divisions ensued which proved the principal means of obstructing the
   progress of their whole work, and continueth to do so to this very day.
   But a state of a blessed and useful recovery it was from that apostasy
   into errors, heresies, superstitions, and idolatries, which the whole
   professing church of these parts of the world was fallen into. And many
   ways did it manifest itself so to be. For, --

   1. The doctrine taught by them generally was agreeable to the
   Scripture, which they strenuously vindicated from the corruptions of
   the foregoing apostasy, and the worship of the churches was freed from
   open idolatry.

   2. The consciences of men, pressed, harassed, and distorted with
   innumerable vain affrightments, superstitions, foolish imaginations,
   and false opinions, whereby they were brought into bondage to their
   pretended guides of all sorts, and forced unto services, under the name
   of religious duties, merely subservient unto their carnal interests,
   were set at liberty by the truth, and directed into the ways of gospel
   obedience.

   3. Multitudes had it given unto them on the behalf of Christ, not only
   to believe in him, but also to suffer for him; so that no less numbers
   sealed their testimony with their blood, under the power of those who
   undertook the patronage of the present apostasy, than did under the
   rage of the heathens at the first introduction of Christian religion
   into the world.

   4. The fruit which it hath brought forth in many nations, by the real
   conversion of multitudes to God, their edification and holy obedience,
   their solid spiritual consolation in life and death, with many other
   things, do give testimony unto this work that it was of God.

   It cannot therefore be denied but that many churches were by the
   reformation brought into a state of revalescency or recovery from that
   mortal disease they had been under the power of. But all men know what
   care and diligence is required to attain perfect health and soundness
   in such a condition, and to prevent a relapse; which if it should fall
   out, the last error would be worse than the first. It might therefore
   have been justly expected from them, and it was their duty, to have
   gone on in the work of reformation until they had come to a perfect
   recovery of spiritual health. But instead thereof, things are so fallen
   out (by whose default God knows) that not only the work hath received
   little or no improvement among themselves, in the increase of light,
   truth, and holiness, nor been progressive or successful in the world
   towards others, but also hath visibly and apparently lost its force,
   and gone backwards on all accounts. Wherefore, we have here also
   another sad evidence of the proneness of men to forego the truths of
   the gospel after they have been instructed in them. I shall instance
   only in the known doctrines of the reformed churches, aiming especially
   at what is of late years fallen out among ourselves in a sort of men
   whom the preceding generations were unacquainted withal, which I shall
   therefore insist on apart and by itself afterward.

   It is not unknown how ready many, yea, multitudes, are in all places to
   desert the whole protestant faith and religion, casting themselves into
   the baffled, prostituted remainders of the old apostasy. Every slight
   occasion, every temptation of pleasure, profit, favour, preferment,
   turns men unto the Papacy; and some run the same course merely to
   comply with the vanity of their minds in curiosity, novelty, and
   conformity unto what is in fashion among men. Some flee unto it as a
   sanctuary from guilt, as that which tendereth more ready ways for the
   pacification of conscience than that faith and repentance which the
   gospel doth require. Some having lost the sense of all religion in the
   pursuit of their lusts, finding themselves uneasy in their atheism, or
   disadvantaged by the reputation of it, take shelter in the Roman dress.
   Some are really entangled and overcome by the power and subtlety of
   numerous seducers who lie in wait to deceive. By one way and means or
   another, on motives known to themselves and him who useth them as his
   engines to subvert the faith, many in all places fall off daily to the
   Papacy, and the old superstition seems to be upon a new advance, ready
   to receive another edition in the world; yea, it is to be feared that
   there is in many places such a general inclination unto a defection, or
   such an indifferency to all religion, that multitudes want nothing but
   a captain to conduct them back into Egypt: for whereas they have lost
   all sense of the power, use, and excellency of that religion, or
   profession of truth, wherein they have been educated and instructed,
   and that by giving up themselves unto their lusts and pleasures, which
   will not fail to produce that cursed effect, they either embrace the
   Roman religion, to supply the place of that no religion which they had
   left unto themselves, or if they pretend to soar to such a pitch of
   reason as to disown the vanity and folly of that profession, and its
   inconsistency with all the principles of free, generous, and rational
   minds, they betake themselves for a while unto a kind of skeptical
   atheism, which, having given them a sorry talkative entertainment for a
   little space, by debasing and corrupting their minds, gives them up
   again unto what they did before despise. By such means are the numbers
   of apostates multiplied amongst us every day.

   But there are yet other instances of the proneness of men in foregoing
   the faith that the church was retrieved unto at the first reformation.
   How great an inroad hath been made on our first profession, at least an
   alteration made therein (whether for better or for worse the great day
   will discover), by that system of doctrines which from its author, and
   for distinction's sake, is called Arminianism! I am not bound to
   believe what. Polinburgh affirms in his preface to the second part of
   Episcopius' works, namely, "That the most of the prelates and learned
   men in England are of their way and judgment,'' which, as stated by
   Episcopius, hath many Racovian additions made unto what it was at
   first; nay, I do believe that what he asserts is false and calumnious
   unto the persons he intends; -- but yet I wish withal that too much
   countenance were not given by many unto his insinuation.

   A late writer, [5] in a treatise which he calls "A sober and
   compassionate Inquiry," etc., among other things of the like nature,
   fancieth that some dislike the church of England on the account of its
   doctrine; and this they do, as he farther supposeth, because it "doth
   not so punctually agree with the synod of Dort as they could wish." To
   evidence the unreasonableness hereof, he informs us, "That no one
   father or writer of the church, whether Greek or Latin, before St
   Austin's time, agreed in doctrine with the determinations of that
   synod; and as for St Austin, he was a devout, good man, but whose piety
   was far more commendable than his reason;" -- and therefore he rejects
   it with indignation (as he well may), that "a novel Dutch synod should
   prescribe doctrines to the church of England, and outweigh all
   antiquity;" and so closeth his discourse with some unworthy calumnies
   cast on the divines of that assembly, which were esteemed of the best
   that all the reformed churches of Europe (that of France alone
   excepted) could afford at that time.

   But the interest of the present design which he had in hand was more
   regarded in these assertions than that of the truth. It is but a
   pretence, that those whom he reflects upon do dislike the doctrine of
   the church of England; for, look upon it as it is contained in the
   Articles of Religion, the Books of Homilies, and declared in the
   authenticated writings of all the learned prelates and others for sixty
   years after the reformation, wherein the doctrine taught, approved, and
   confirmed in this church was testified unto all the world, and the
   generality of those reflected on by him do sacredly adhere unto it. It
   is a defection from this doctrine that is by some complained of, and
   not the doctrine itself. And how the doctrine of the person before
   mentioned, or of Curcellæus, -- of whose works Limborch, in his preface
   unto them, boasts that they were so earnestly desired in England, --
   can be brought into a consistency with that of this church so confirmed
   and declared, will require a singular faculty in the reconciliation of
   open multiplied contradictions, and those in the most weighty points of
   religion, to declare. Let but the doctrine established at the first
   reformation, as explained and declared in the writings of the principal
   persons who presided, lived, and died in the communion of this church,
   -- which are the measure of it in the judgment of all other churches in
   the world, -- be continued and adhered unto, and there will be neither
   difference nor complaint on this matter. For the disputes which have
   been, and which it may be always will be, among learned men, concerning
   some abstruse and philosophical notions about the order of the divine
   decrees, predetermination, the nature of human liberty, and the like
   innumerable, neither ever did nor ever will much disturb the peace of
   the church; for as they are understood by very few, if by any at all,
   so the community of Christians are altogether unconcerned with them,
   either as to their faith or obedience. Differences about them will be
   ended at the last day; and it may be, as to the great end of the
   gospel, that is time enough.

   But the pretence of this author, "That no one father or writer of the
   church, Greek or Latin, before St Austin's time, agreed with the
   determinations of the synod of Dort," is of little importance in this
   cause; for as I suppose he may not speak this absolutely on his own
   trial and experience, but rather on the suggestions of others, so it is
   no more than what is strongly pretended concerning the doctrine of the
   holy Trinity itself with respect unto the determination and declaration
   made of it at the council of Nice. And it were to be wished that too
   much countenance had not been given unto this imagination by Petavius
   and some others, whose collections of ambiguous expressions out of the
   ancient writers of the church, and observations upon them, are highly
   boasted of by our present Photinians. And as, it may be, it will not be
   easy for this author positively to declare what was the judgment of any
   one ancient writer on all points of Christian belief, especially on
   such as had not received an especial discussion from oppositions made
   unto them in their own days or before them: so it is confessed by all
   that an allowance is to be given unto general expressions of such
   writers as seem occasionally to declare their present thoughts on any
   particular doctrines about which there had never been any controversy
   in the church; for the proper signification of words themselves,
   whereby men express their minds, is never exactly stated until the
   things themselves which they would signify have been thoroughly
   discussed. Hence the same words have had various uses and divers
   significations in several ages. And by this rule, whatever be supposed
   that none of the ancients before Austin were of the same mind with
   those who assembled at Dort, it may with more truth be affirmed that
   none of them were otherwise minded but Origen only, and those who were
   influenced by him, he being by many, on evident grounds, accused to
   have prepared the way and opened the door both unto Arianism and
   Pelagianism.

   The censure passed on Austin, namely, "That his piety was far more
   commendable than his reason," is at least as novel as the Dutch synod;
   for it is not the commendation of his piety, but the disparagement of
   his reason, that is intended. And I must take the liberty to say, that
   either this author hath not been much conversant in the writings of
   this great and holy person, or he is a very incompetent judge of the
   rational abilities of them in whose writings he is conversant. This
   confidence in pronouncing a censure so contrary to the concurrent sense
   of the generality of learned men of all sorts in the church for twelve
   hundred years savours too much of partiality and prejudice. But it is
   some relief, that the adversaries of the truth with whom he had to do
   were never able to discover nor make advantage of the weakness of his
   reason. It was sufficient for the work whereunto God designed him;
   which was, not only to check and suppress the many instances wherein
   sundry crafty persons apostatized from the truths of the gospel, both
   in his own days and before, but also to give over the light of truth,
   clearly discovered and strenuously vindicated, unto posterity, for the
   benefit of the church in all ages. Persons may freely despise the men
   of their present contests, against whom they have all the advantages
   which may prompt them thereunto, and they have so much countenance in
   casting contemptuous reflections on the principal first reformers as
   not to think therein they invade the bounds of Christian modesty; but
   what will be the apology for their confidence in such censures of the
   rational abilities of Austin I cannot conjecture, though the reason of
   it I can easily guess at. However, it needeth not be much taken notice
   of, seeing a censure somewhat more severe hath not long since been
   passed on St Paul himself, by a writer of the same strain and judgment.

   There is little ground of fear, as I suppose, that a "novel Dutch
   synod," as it is called, though consisting of persons delegated from
   all the principal reformed churches of Europe (that of France only
   excepted), "should prescribe doctrines to the church of England,"
   seeing in that synod the church of England did rather prescribe
   doctrines to the Dutch than receive any from them; for the divines
   which had the pre-eminence of suffrage and authority in that assembly
   were those of the church of England, sent thither by public authority
   to testify the doctrine of this church, and to lead the Dutch into the
   same confession with themselves.

   But to return; it is to be feared that as Pelagianism, in its first
   edition, did secretly and gradually insinuate itself into the animal
   and vital spirits of the body of the church in those days, proving a
   poison unto it, so under its new varnish and gilding it will be
   received, until it diffuse itself into the veins and vitals of the
   present reformed church-state in the world. This I know, that some
   pretending a zeal for holiness and reformation of life do yet, with a
   shameful partiality, charge those doctrines as a principal means of the
   decay of piety, which they cannot but know were generally believed and
   avowed then when piety most flourished in this nation. But this is part
   of that entertainment which the church of England meets with at this
   day from her degenerate offspring. The doctrine of all the ancient
   bishops must be traduced, as the means of the decay of piety; and,
   which increaseth the wonder, it had not this effect till it began to be
   publicly deserted and renounced I for whether they are the one the
   cause of the other or no, yet there is a demonstrative coincidence
   between the originals of our visible apostasy from piety and the
   admission of these novel opinions, contrary to the faith of the first
   reformed churches, and that they both bear the same date among us.

   But there is yet a greater abomination effectually taking place among
   us, to the utter overthrow of the faith of some, and the corrupting of
   the minds of others from the truth of the gospel. This is the leprosy
   of Socinianism, which secretly enters into the walls and timber of the
   house, whence it will not be scraped out. It commenced in the world
   some time before the other spring of a partial apostasy before
   mentioned; but for a good space it lay fermenting in some obscure
   places of Poland and the countries adjacent. When the books and
   writings of the authors and promoters of the opinions called by that
   name came once to be known and read in other places, they were
   continually all of them abundantly answered and confuted by learned men
   of all sorts, so as it was justly hoped it would obtain no great
   success or progress in the world. But, --


   "Latius excisæ serpit contagio gentis

   Victoresque suos natio victa premit."

   The vanity of the minds of men, their weariness of sound doctrine,
   which they will endure no longer, whatever they embrace, have given it
   admission, either in part or in whole, among multitudes who once
   professed the faith of the gospel: for whereas the whole system of the
   opinions of those men is but a collection of such errors as formerly
   perplexed the church and overthrew the faith of many, the principal and
   most material of them may be referred unto two heads, -- 1.
   Photinianism; and, 2. Pelagianism. Unto the first are referred their
   denial of the Trinity, and consequently of the divine person and
   incarnation of the Son of God. Under the latter, their opposition unto
   the satisfaction of Christ, the true nature of his priesthood and
   sacrifice, justification by faith in his blood and the imputation of
   his righteousness, the efficacy of his grace, and the corruption of our
   nature by the fall, may be comprised. The denial of the resurrection of
   the same bodies, the eternity of the punishment of the damned in hell,
   with other of their imaginations, were also traduced from some of old.
   The first part of their heresy as yet takes no great place but only
   among themselves, the doctrine opposite unto it being secured by law,
   and the interest of men therein who have advantage by the public
   profession. But yet it is to be feared that the coldness of many in
   asserting and defending those fundamental doctrines of the gospel which
   they oppose, yea, their indifferency about them, and the horrid
   notions, with strange expositions, that some have embraced and do use
   concerning the person of Christ, do proceed from some secret influence
   on the minds of men, which the venom of their opinions and sophistical
   disputes have had upon them. And from a just improvement of their
   sentiments have proceeded those bold efforts of atheistical
   imaginations and oppositions unto the Scripture, both the letter and
   sense of it, which have of late been divulged in public writing; which,
   being brought from the neighbour nation, do find no slack entertainment
   by many among us.

   But as to the latter branch of their profession, or their Pelagianism,
   it hath diffused itself among multitudes of persons who were some time
   of another persuasion, and have yet engagements on them so to be. All
   that unreasonable advancement of reason in matters of religion which we
   have amongst us; the new notions men have of the satisfaction of
   Christ, pretending to the acknowledgment of it, indeed destructive unto
   it; the noisome conception of the little use of the person of Christ in
   religion beyond the revelation and confirmation of the gospel;
   doctrines of the possibility, yea, facility of yielding acceptable
   obedience unto all evangelical commands without the aids of effectual
   grace, of the powers and incorruption of our nature, of justification
   by and upon our own obedience, of the suitableness of all gospel
   mysteries to unrenewed reason or an unsanctified mind, of regeneration
   as consisting only in the reformation of our lives; with a rejection of
   all internal real efficacy in converting grace, and the substitution of
   morality in the room of grace; with the denial of any influences of
   grace from Jesus Christ unto the holiness of truth; and many other
   opinions wherewith men even pride themselves, to the contempt of the
   doctrine received and established in the reformed churches of old, --
   are borrowed out of the storehouses of their imaginations, shall I say,
   or raked out of their dunghill. And whither the infection may diffuse
   itself I know not. The resurrection of the same bodies substantially,
   the subsistence and acting of the soul in its separate state and
   condition, the eternity of hell torments, the nature of Christ's
   sacerdotal office as distinguished from his regal, begin to be either
   questioned or very faintly defended amongst many. And many other
   noisome opinions there are, about the Scriptures, the nature of God,
   his attributes and decrees, the two covenants, our union with Christ,
   the gifts and operations of the Spirit, which some vent as pure
   mysteries and discoveries of truth, and value themselves for being the
   authors or maintainers of them, that came all from the same forge, or
   are emanations from the same corrupt fountain of Socinianism.

   We have, as I suppose, sufficiently demonstrated the truth of what we
   before observed concerning the proneness and readiness of mankind to
   relinquish and fall off from the mystery and doctrine of the gospel,
   after it hath been declared unto them and received by them. Withal we
   have stated the matter of fact, -- namely, that such a defection there
   hath been, and is in the world at this day; the reasons and causes
   whereof we are now to inquire into. Only I must premise, that the
   principal instance designed, and which is among ourselves, I have
   referred to an especial consideration by itself, wherein we shall
   inquire into the especial reasons of it, which are superadded unto
   those more general, which equally respect apostasies of this kind.

Chapter IV.

   The reasons and causes of apostasy from the truth or doctrine of the
   gospel, and the inclination of all sorts of persons thereunto in all
   ages, inquired into and declared -- Uncured enmity in the minds of many
   against spiritual things, and the effects of it in a wicked
   conversation, the first cause of apostasy.

   For an entrance into the ensuing discourse, I shall lay down that
   principle which, I presume, all men will give their assent unto, --
   namely, that a defection from the truth of the gospel once professed is
   a sin of the highest guilt, and that which will issue in the most
   pernicious events. God himself did frequently complain, by his prophets
   of old, that his people "had forsaken him," and were gone away from
   him, -- that is, from the doctrine and institutions of his law, the
   only means of conjunction and communion between him and them, Deut.
   xxviii. 20; 1 Sam. viii. 8; 2 Chron. xxxiv. 25; Jer. v. 7, 19, xvi. 11.
   To convince them of their horrible folly and iniquity herein, he
   demands of them what iniquity they had seen in him, what inequality in
   his ways, what disappointments they had met withal, that they should
   grow weary of his laws and worship, so as to relinquish them for such
   things and ways as would end in their temporal and eternal ruin, Jer.
   ii. 5, Ezek. xviii. 25: for if there were nothing in them whereof they
   had cause to complain; if they were all holy, just, and good; if in the
   observance of them there was great reward; if by them God did them good
   and not evil all their days, -- there was no apology or excuse to be
   made for their folly and ingratitude. That so it was with them, that
   their defection from the law and institutions of God was the highest
   folly and greatest wickedness imaginable, is by all acknowledged: yea,
   it will be so by them who at the same time are under a greater guilt of
   the same kind; for the judgments of men are ofttimes so bribed by their
   present interests, or corrupted by the power of depraved affections, as
   to justify themselves in worse evils than those which they condemn in
   others.

   But as it was with the people of old, so it is at present with them who
   decline from the mysteries or renounce the doctrines of the gospel,
   after they have been received and professed by them, or have done so at
   any time: yea, their guilt hath greater aggravations than accompanied
   the idolatrous revolts of the Jews of old; for the gospel is a clearer
   revelation of God, and much more glorious, than that which was made by
   the law. There is therefore no reason to be taken from itself why men
   should desert it, either in its doctrines and precepts or the worship
   which it doth require. Nothing can be charged on the gospel, nothing on
   any thing contained in it or produced by it, which should countenance
   any in a defection from it. It is in itself a blessed emanation from
   the eternal Fountain of wisdom and truth, and hath more impressions and
   characters upon it of divine excellencies than the whole creation
   besides. Neither hath it any proper operations or effects on the souls
   of men but what are means and causes of deliverance from their original
   apostasy from God, with all the evil that ensued thereon, which is all
   that is evil; for the recovery of lost mankind from a state of
   darkness, bondage, and misery, into that of liberty, light, and peace,
   the present favour and future enjoyment of God, with order and mutual
   usefulness in this world whilst they continue therein, is the great and
   immediate design of the truths of the gospel. Neither is there any
   thing that is truly good, holy, just, benign, or useful among men, but
   what is influenced by them and derived from them. Some there have been,
   indeed, perhaps in all ages, who, pretending unto the liberty of it,
   have really been servants of corruption, and have turned the grace of
   God into lasciviousness; and some have charged the principal doctrines
   of it as those which give men a discharge from a necessity of holy
   obedience and the utmost use of their own endeavours therein. And there
   are those who, being given up to sensuality of life, living under the
   power of darkness, in the pursuit of secular ends, have no other
   thoughts of it But what the devils in the possessed man had of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, -- that it comes to "torment them before the time." And
   there are not wanting some who fear no evil But from the gospel, who
   suppose that the minds of all men would be serene and peaceable, that
   all things would be quiet, flourishing, and orderly in the world, if
   the gospel were out of it; for whatever disturbances men make
   themselves, in envy, wrath, malice, persecution of others, the guilt
   and blame of them shall be charged on the gospel itself. And it is
   notoriously known how a false pretence of some grants made in, and
   appointments settled by, the gospel, hath been made use of to
   countenance some sorts of men in the crafty acquisition and violent
   possession of worldly power, grandeur, and wealth, venting themselves
   in ambition, cruelty, luxury, and pride of life. But the iniquity and
   folly of all these abominations, cursed artifices of the father of lies
   and fountain of malice, shall be, if God will, elsewhere discovered. At
   present I shall take it for granted that in itself it is a glorious
   representation of divine wisdom, goodness, grace, and love; neither
   doth it produce any effects but whereof God is the immediate author,
   and will be the everlasting rewarder. Wherefore the reasons and causes
   of apostasy from the part of the gospel under present consideration, --
   that is, the mysteries and truth of its doctrine, -- must be searched
   for in the minds of them by whom it is forsaken, with the external
   furtherances that do accompany them.

   It is not unnecessary such an inquiry should be engaged into; for
   things are in that posture and condition in the Christian world in this
   present age, that if it should be supposed that the lives of professed
   Christians do make a due representation of the gospel, that the
   generality of men were led and influenced into that course of life and
   conversation which they openly pursue by the doctrines and principles
   of it, it could scarce stand in competition with heathenish philosophy
   for usefulness unto the glory of God and the good or advantage of
   mankind. It is not, therefore, the gospel, but it is apostasy from it,
   which hath produced so many deplorable effects in the world, and which,
   by drenching mankind in wickedness, makes way for their misery and
   ruin. And this, in the vindication of the gospel, will be made in some
   measure to appear in the discovery of the causes and reasons of this
   apostasy; for let men pretend what they please, unless they have first
   forsaken the gospel in their hearts and minds, they would not, they
   could not, forsake all rules of holiness and morality also in their
   lives.

   Again; the prevalency of this defection is so great, and the neglect of
   men (either intent on their private occasions, desires, and interests,
   or captivated under the power of it unto the approbation of the
   greatest and most dangerous evils) so visible and shameful, as that
   every sincere attempt to warn them of their danger, to excite them unto
   their duty, or direct them in its performance, whereby the progress of
   this product of the counsels of hell may be obstructed and themselves
   defeated, ought to have a candid reception of all those who have a due
   regard unto the interest of Christ and the gospel in the world, or the
   everlasting concernments of their own souls.

   These are the general ends which are aimed at in the ensuing
   discourses; and if any one of greater abilities for this work shall be
   hereby provoked, or take occasion from hence, to make a more diligent
   inquiry into the causes and reasons of that defection from the glory
   and power of Christian religion which prevails in the world, and shall
   thereon prescribe more suitable and effectual remedies for the healing
   of this epidemical distemper, I shall rest abundantly satisfied in the
   success of this attempt and essay. And the reasons which present
   themselves to my thoughts are these that follow.

   I. That rooted enmity which is in the minds of men by nature unto
   spiritual things, abiding uncured under the profession of the gospel,
   is the original and first spring of this apostasy. So the apostle tells
   us that "the carnal mind is enmity against God," Rom. viii. 7; -- that
   is, unto the revelation of the will and mind of God in Christ, with the
   obedience which he requireth thereunto; for of these things doth he
   there discourse. The nature of this enmity, and how it operateth on the
   minds of men, I have elsewhere [6] declared at large, and shall not
   here again insist upon it. It is sufficient unto our present purpose
   that men, on various accounts, may take upon them the profession of the
   truths of the gospel whilst this enmity unto spiritual things abides
   uncured, yea, predominant in their minds. So was it with them of whom
   the apostle complains that under their profession they manifested
   themselves, by their wicked lives, to be "enemies of the cross of
   Christ," Phil. iii. 18; as those also are who, "professing that they
   know God, do yet in works deny him, being abominable, and disobedient,
   and to every good work reprobate," Tit. i. 16.

   Thus, upon the first preaching of the gospel, many were convinced of
   its truth, and took upon them its profession, merely on account of the
   miracles that were wrought in its confirmation, whose hearts and minds
   were not in the least reconciled unto the things contained in it. See
   John ii. 23, 24; Acts viii. 13.

   Some are so far prevailed with as to acknowledge its truth, by the
   efficacy of its dispensation as an ordinance of God for their
   conviction and instruction, and yet do not part with their enmity
   against it. Thus John was among the Jews as "a burning and a shining
   light," and they rejoiced for a season in his ministry, John v. 35,
   insomuch that the body of the people were initiated into his doctrine
   by the token and pledge of it in baptism, Matt. iii. 5, 6; but though
   all of them confessed their sins, according to his direction, very few
   forsook them, according to their duty.

   When both these concurred, preaching and miracles, in an eminent
   manner, as when our Saviour preached on his feeding five thousand with
   five barley loaves and two small fishes, being prepared in their minds
   by the miracle they saw, they were so affected with his doctrine about
   "the bread of life that came down from heaven," that they cried out,
   "Lord, evermore give us this bread," John vi. 34; but, their natural
   enmity unto spiritual things being yet uncured, upon his procedure to
   instruct them in heavenly mysteries, they put in exceptions to his
   doctrine, verses 41, 52, 60, and immediately forsook both him and it,
   verse 66. And our Saviour assigns the reason of their defection to have
   been their unbelief, and that it was not given unto them of the Father
   to come unto him, verses 64, 65, or the enmity of their carnal minds
   was yet unremoved. Hence what they esteemed a hard and unintelligible
   saying, verses 52, 60, his true disciples understood to be "the words
   of eternal life," verse 68.

   In process of time, many are prepossessed with notions of the truth of
   the gospel in their education, by the outward means of instruction that
   have been applied unto them; but yet, notwithstanding this advantage,
   they may still abide under the power of this depravation of their
   minds.

   Evangelical truths being by these or the like means entertained in the
   minds of men, which are also variously affected with them, they will
   move and act towards their proper end and design. And hereof there are
   three parts:--

   1. To take off the soul of man from rest and satisfaction in itself, as
   unto present peace in the condition wherein it is, and hope of future
   blessedness by its own endeavours; for neither of these are we capable
   of in our depraved, apostate state. Wherefore the first work of the
   gospel is to influence, guide, and direct the minds of men to renounce
   themselves as to these ends, and to seek after righteousness, life,
   peace, and blessedness, by Jesus Christ.

   2. The renovation of our minds, wills, and affections, into the image
   or likeness of God, is another part of its design. And this it doth by
   presenting spiritual things unto us in that light and evidence, with
   that power and efficacy, as to transform us into their likeness, or to
   bring the substantial image of them upon our whole souls, 2 Cor. iii.
   18; Eph. iv. 23, 24; Col. iii. 10.

   3. It engageth the whole soul, in all its powers and faculties, through
   the whole course of its activity, or in all it doth, to live unto God
   in all holy obedience, Rom. xii. 1.

   But when this work, or any part of it, is urged on the consciences and
   practice of men, they like it not in any measure. The uncured enmity
   whereof we speak riseth up in opposition unto them all. It begins to
   suppose that it hath admitted a troublesome inmate, that came in, as it
   were, to sojourn, and will now be a judge. Whilst the mind is exercised
   only about the notions of truth in speculation and reasonings, it is
   satisfied and pleased with them; yea, it will come unto a compliance
   with its guidance in sundry things and duties which it may perform, and
   yet abide upon its old foundations of self-sufficiency and
   satisfaction, Mark vi. 20. But when, in pursuit of the ends before
   mentioned, the gospel presseth to take men off wholly from their old
   foundations and principles of nature, to work them unto a universal
   change in powers, faculties, operations, and ends, to make them new
   creatures, it proves irksome unto that enmity which is predominant in
   them; which therefore stirreth up all the lusts of the mind and the
   flesh, all the deceitful policies of the old man and powers of sin, all
   carnal and unmortified affections, in opposition unto it. Hence
   spiritual truths are first neglected, then despised, and at last, on
   easy terms, parted withal. For men, by conviction, and on rational
   grounds or motives, whether natural or spiritual, may receive that as
   truth, and give an assent unto it, which, when it should be reduced
   unto practice, the will and affections will not comply withal. So it is
   said of some, that ouk edokimasan ton Theon echein epignosei, Rom. i.
   28, -- "it liked them not," it pleased them not, they approved not of
   it, "to hold," retain, or keep, "God in their knowledge," or to
   continue in that acknowledgment of him whereof they were convinced. The
   inbred notions which they had by the light of nature, with their
   consideration of the works of creation and providence, gave them
   conceptions and apprehensions of the being and power of God, verses 19,
   20. Hereby they are said to "know God," as they did with respect to the
   things mentioned; that is, the essential properties of his nature, --
   "his eternal power and Godhead," verse 21. This knowledge, these
   notions and conceptions, did immediately direct them to "glorify him as
   God," in holy worship and obedience, as it is expressed in the same
   verse; but this, through the depravation of their minds and affections,
   they liked not, and therefore would not retain this knowledge of him,
   but gave themselves up unto all abominable idolatries and brutish
   lusts, which were inconsistent therewithal, as the apostle at large
   declares. Wherefore, even as unto divine things that are conveyed unto
   us by natural light, and such as is unavoidable unto all mankind, the
   will, the affections, and the practical understanding are more vitiated
   and corrupted than are the preceptive and directive powers of the mind;
   and hence it was that all the world, who had nothing to conduct them
   but the light of nature, apostatized from its guidance, and lived in
   contrariety unto it. They were all rebels against that light which they
   had; and so will all mankind be without the especial grace of God.

   It is so also with respect unto truths communicated by supernatural
   revelation. It is given as the character of those who were to carry on
   the great apostasy from the mysteries and worship of the gospel, that
   "they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved," 2
   Thess. ii. 10. The truth itself, as to the profession of it, they did
   receive and own for a time; but such an approbation of it, such a love
   unto it, as should incline them unto obedience, or the improvement of
   it unto its proper ends, that so they might be saved, they neither had
   nor endeavoured after. This made them prone, on all occasions and
   temptations, to forego and relinquish the profession of it, to change
   it for the vilest errors and grossest superstitions; for in such a
   posture of mind, men's corruptions will prevail against their
   convictions. First they will stifle the truth as to its operation, and
   then reject it as to its profession. Let other notions be proposed unto
   them more suited unto the vanity of their minds or the sensuality of
   their affections, and they will not fail of a ready entertainment.

   There are instances among all sorts of men, how, when they have imbibed
   persuasions and opinions, even such as are false, vain, and foolish,
   and have them riveted in their minds by powerful interests or
   inveterate prejudices, neither the evidence of truth nor the fear of
   danger can prevail with them for their renunciation or relinquishment.
   All false ways in Christianity, and that of Mohammedanism, give us
   examples hereof. But we have two general instances of it that may well
   fill the minds of men with astonishment. The first is of the Jews, who
   for so many successive generations, under all manner of difficulties
   and calamities, continue obstinate in the most irrational unbelief and
   apostasy from the faith of Abraham their forefather and the expectation
   of all their ancestors that can enter into the heart of any man to
   imagine. For many generations, those who from among them have been so
   convinced of their folly as really and sincerely to embrace the gospel
   do scarce answer one unto a century of years. The other is in the
   church of Rome. It is known how that communion aboundeth with men
   otherwise wise and learned, what kings and rulers of the earth do
   adhere thereunto; and this they continue to do, and will do so,
   notwithstanding that the errors, impieties, superstitions, and
   idolatries of that church are so many and so manifest. Other instances
   there are sufficiently pregnant to evince that no opinions in religion
   can be so foolish or contemptible but that some will be found
   pertinaciously to adhere unto them against all endeavours for their
   relief, either in the way of God by rational and spiritual convictions,
   or in the way of the world by persecution.

   It may be more may and will be found to be obstinate in error upon
   trials, with difficulties, dangers, and oppositions, than will on the
   like trials be constant in the profession of the truth, -- I mean among
   them who together with its external profession have not received its
   internal power and efficacy, with the love of it in their hearts: for
   both sorts receive their notions and apprehensions of things in the
   same way, and on the same grounds of appearing reasons, though the
   understanding be imposed on and deceived in the one and not in the
   other; but error once received under the notion of truth takes firmer
   root in the carnal minds of men than truth doth or can whilst their
   minds are so carnal. And the reason of it is, because all error is some
   way suited unto the mind as thus depraved, and there is nothing in it
   that is enmity thereunto. Neither in itself nor any of its effects doth
   the mind dislike it, for being fallen off from the first Truth and
   Goodness, it wanders and delights to wander in crooked or by paths of
   its own; for "God made man upright, but they have sought out many
   inventions," Eccles. vii. 29. These it pleaseth itself withal and is
   conformed unto; for there is somewhat in every error to recommend
   itself unto the vanity, or curiosity, or pride, or superstition of the
   carnal mind. But it is otherwise with evangelical truths, which the
   mind disrelisheth because of its innate enmity unto the things which
   they propose and exhibit. Hence it is easier, for the most part, to
   draw off a thousand from the profession of it, who have no experience
   of its power and efficacy in their souls, than to turn one from an
   erroneous way, especially if he be confirmed in it by interest and
   prejudice. And so it is at present in the world. Every sort or party of
   false professors, as Papists and others, do carry off multitudes of
   common professors from the truth which they had owned, but seldom do we
   hear of any one recovered from their snares. Nor need any seducers
   desire a greater advantage than to have admittance unto their work
   where persons live in an outward profession of the truth and inward
   enmity unto it. They shall be filled with proselytes unto satiety.

   This was the fundamental cause of that apostasy from the doctrine and
   truths of the gospel which has prevailed in almost the whole visible
   church. Had the generality of men received the truth in the love
   thereof, had they not had a secret enmity in their hearts and minds
   against it, had not things vain, curious, and superstitious been suited
   unto the prevailing principles of their minds and affections, they
   would not, they could not, upon any suggestions or temptations, so
   easily, so universally, have forsaken the gospel for the traditions of
   men, nor gone away from Christ to follow after Antichrist, as we know
   them to have done. But when an external profession of the truth became
   to be transmitted from one generation to another, the spirit and power
   of it being wholly neglected, men did but wait for opportunities
   gradually to part with it, and give it up for any thing else that was
   suggested unto them, many in the meantime setting their wits on work to
   find out inventions suited to their lusts and corrupt affections. That
   it was thus with them who were carried away with the great apostasy,
   that they did by all outward ways and means, in their lives and
   conversations, manifest that so it was with them, shall be afterward
   declared; and had it not been so with them, the event complained of had
   not ensued.

   And herein lies the present danger of the persons, churches, and
   nations, which at this day make profession of the gospel: for if a
   pressing trial or vigorous temptation, if a coincidence of various ways
   and means of seduction, do befall them who have received the truth, but
   not in the love and power of it, they will be hardly preserved from a
   general apostasy; for when any attempts shall be made from without upon
   them, they have treachery from the deceitfulness of their own hearts at
   the same time working in them, for their uncured enmity against the
   truth doth but watch for an opportunity to part with it and reject it.
   Any thing that will but free them from the efficacy of those
   convictions or power of the traditions under which they are held
   captive unto the profession of the truth, as it were whether they will
   or no, shall be cheerfully embraced and complied withal. And the danger
   hereof doth sufficiently evidence itself in that open dislike of the
   rule and conduct of the truth which most men testify in the whole
   course of their lives.

   It is plain, therefore, that unless this enmity be conquered or cast
   out of the mind; unless the mind be freed from its corrupt agency and
   effects; unless the truth obtain its real power and efficacy upon the
   soul; unless it be so learned "as it is in Jesus," whereby men, "put
   off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt
   according to the deceitful lusts, and are renewed in the spirit of
   their minds, putting on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness;" unless they love and value it for the
   effects of spiritual peace, power, and liberty, which it produceth in
   them, -- there will be found among them little constancy or
   perseverance in their profession when temptations shall concur with
   opportunities for a revolt: for who can give security that what hath
   formerly fallen out amongst the generality of mankind shall not in any
   place do so again, where the same causes of it do again concur?

   Having discovered this first cause of defection from the gospel, we may
   easily discern what are the only true effectual ways and means of the
   preservation and continuance of the true religion in any place or among
   any people where it hath been professed, especially if temptations unto
   a revolt should abound, and the season be made perilous by advantageous
   opportunities. Love of the truth, and experience of its power in the
   hearts of men, will produce this effect, and nothing else [will.] All
   other means, where these have been wanting, have failed in all places
   in the world, and will do so again when a time of trial shall come.
   True religion may be established by law, countenanced by authority,
   have a prescription of a long profession, or be on other accounts so
   fixed on the minds of men as that multitudes shall promise the firmest
   stability in the profession thereof; but there is no security in things
   of this nature, and we shall quickly see all the hopes that are built
   upon them vanish into nothing. Convictions or traditions, unto whose
   power a secret enmity is retained, may make a bluster and noise for a
   season, but every breath of temptation will carry them away before it.
   Were it not so with the most of men, had it been possible that so many
   nations in less than an age should fall into Arianism, after the truth
   had been so long known and professed among them; or that the body of
   this nation after a blessed reformation should again relapse into
   Popery, as in the days of Queen Mary, when many who had professed the
   gospel east others into flames who continued so to do?

   It is greatly complained of that Popery doth increase in this nation;
   and some express their fears of its farther prevalency, and that
   perhaps not without cause. And although there are several other ways
   whereby men may and do apostatize from the truth, yet all those who
   take any other measure of things besides their own secular interests,
   with the corrupt affections of their minds, in wrath, envy, and
   revenge, do look on this as far the most dangerous, as that which will
   be most compliant with the predominant lusts of the present age, and
   most comprehensive to receive the community of men. Besides, by what it
   hath done formerly, it sufficiently instructs what it is likely enough
   to do again. Wherefore very many industriously attempt its prevention,
   as that which would prove (if it should prevail) deplorably ruinous
   unto the nation and their posterity therein. To this end some implore
   the aid of authority for the enacting of severe laws for the
   prohibition of it. This, according to the opinion of late ages, some
   suppose the most effectual means for the preservation of the truth; for
   if they can but destroy all that are otherwise minded, the rest of
   mankind will have the face of peace unto them who are advantaged
   thereby. Some write books in the confutation of the errors of it, and
   that to very good purpose. But in the meantime, if there be any thing
   of truth in reports, the work is as effectually progressive as if no
   opposition had been made unto it; and we may assure ourselves that
   these and such like means as these, if they are alone, will never keep
   Popery out of England, if it should ever have an advantage and
   opportunity for a return, nor prevent the entrance of any other false
   way in religion.

   As for the use and severity of penal laws, I meddle not with it, as
   that which is to be referred to the wisdom of our governors. But I must
   needs say, it seems not to be unto the advantage of truth, or, at
   least, not unto the reputation of them by whom it is professed, that
   they should no otherwise be able to preserve its station amongst men.
   Neither can it be honourable unto any religion, that where it pretends
   unto all the advantages and rights of truth, and [is] in the real
   possession of all outward emoluments and supportments, yet that it
   cannot secure itself or maintain its profession without outward force
   and violence, things so remote from the first introduction and planting
   of truth in the world. But these things are not of our present
   consideration. [As] for the confutation of the errors, superstitions,
   and idolatrous practices of the church of Rome, in books of
   controversy, it is no doubt a work good, useful, and necessary in its
   kind; but when all is done, these things reach but a few, nor will many
   divert from other occasions to the serious consideration of them.
   Wherefore some other way must be fixed on and engaged in to secure the
   truth and interest of protestant religion among us; and this is no
   other but the effectual communication of the knowledge of it unto the
   minds, and the implantation of the power of it on the hearts of the
   people. This is that alone which will root out of them that enmity unto
   evangelical mysteries and spiritual things which betrays the souls of
   men into apostasy.

   Unless men know what they are to value religion for, and what benefit
   they really receive by its profession, it is irrational to expect that
   they will be constant therein when a trial shall befall them. If once
   they come to say, "It is in vain thus to serve God," or, "What profit
   is it that we have kept his ordinances?" they will easily admit the
   yoke of any falsehood or superstition that pretends to gratify them
   with greater advantages. And at one time or other it will be no
   otherwise with them with whom this enmity is predominant.

   But, on the other side, when God by the gospel "shines in the hearts of
   men, to give them the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face
   of Jesus Christ;" when they find their consciences set free thereby
   from the intolerable yokes of superstition and tradition; and that by
   the word of truth which they do profess they are begotten anew unto the
   hope of eternal life, their inward man being renewed and their lives
   reformed thereby; that their expectation of a blessed immortality is
   well founded on it and safely resolved into it, -- they will, through
   the effectual supplies of the Spirit of Christ, abide constant in the
   profession of it, whatever may befall them.

   On these terms, on these experienced evidences of truth and goodness,
   was the gospel first entertained among men, and the reformation of
   religion first introduced into this nation; for although sundry other
   things concurred unto its reception and establishment, yet if the minds
   of multitudes had not received an experience of its power and efficacy
   unto the ends mentioned, it would never have been of any permanency
   among us. The mere outward form of true religion is not able to contend
   with that appearance which error and superstition will represent unto
   the minds of men, as knowing how much they stand in need thereof.

   These things I know are by some despised. They suppose they have surer
   ways and better expedients for the preservation of the profession of
   the gospel amongst us than its own power and efficacy. What those ways
   are we need not conjecture, seeing themselves declare them continually;
   but they shall not be here spoken unto. But it is to be feared that
   they may be filled with the fruit of their own imaginations when those
   things shall fail them wherein they have placed their confidence.
   Wherefore, if there be a neglect about these things in the ministry and
   others whose duty it is to promote them, the issue will be sad, it may
   be beyond what is feared: for if the body of the people be suffered to
   live without any evidence of an acquaintance with the power of that
   truth which they do profess, or any demonstrative fruits of it in a
   holy conversation, we may cry out, "Popery, Popery," as long as we
   please; but when temptations, opportunities, and interests do concur,
   their profession will fall from them as dry leaves from a tree when
   they are moved with the wind. The apostle tells us that those who "went
   out from them were not of them, for if they had been of them they would
   have continued with them," 1 John ii. 19. They were among them by the
   profession of the truth, or they could not have gone out from them; --
   but they were "not of them" in the participation of the power of the
   truth, and "communion thereby with the Father and the Son;" for if they
   had, "they would have continued with them," -- that is, steadfast in
   their profession.

   This is that which ought to be fixed on the minds of all persons
   concerned, of all that are zealous for the truth of the protestant
   religion, or are obliged, what lies in them, to provide for its
   preservation. When things are come unto the appointed season, when they
   are issuing in that period which they have a natural tendency unto, all
   other expedients and devices will be of none effect. A diligent
   communication unto the body of the people, through the dispensation of
   the word, or preaching of it, of the power of the truth they profess in
   all its blessed effects, -- whereon they will have an experience and
   witness within themselves of the reasons why they ought to abide
   constantly in its profession, -- will alone secure the continuance of
   the gospel in succeeding generations. All other means will be
   ineffectual unto that end; and so far as without this they are or may
   be effectual, it will be of no advantage unto the souls of men.

   That there is a danger at all times of a defection among professed
   Christians from the truth hath been before evinced. That this danger at
   present hath many especial circumstances rendering it dangerous in a
   peculiar manner is in like manner acknowledged by all such as call
   these things into serious consideration. And it will not, I presume, be
   denied but that every man, according as he is called and warranted by
   especial duty, is obliged to his utmost endeavours for the prevention
   of a revolt from the truth. The whole inquiry is, What is the best way,
   means, or expedient, to be plied unto this end? And this, I say, is
   only by the diligent ministerial dispensation of the word, with such an
   exemplary zeal and holiness in them by whom it is dispensed, and all
   other things requisite unto the discharge of that work, as may
   reconcile the hearts of the people unto evangelical truths, beget in
   them a delight in obedience, and implant the power of the word in their
   whole souls. Want hereof was that which lost the gospel in former ages,
   and will do so wherever it is, in this or those which are to come. And
   I shall not, in my own thoughts, blamably digress from my present
   subject, if I confirm this opinion with some few obvious
   considerations; for, --

   1. It is the way, the only way, which God hath ordained, and which he
   blesseth to this end and purpose. None will pretend, as I suppose, that
   God hath appointed any other way to bring men unto the profession of
   the truth but by the preaching and dispensation of the word alone. When
   they are wrought upon or convinced thereby, so as to give up themselves
   unto the profession of it, it will be hard to find an ordinance of God
   of another kind for their preservation therein. When the apostle took
   his last farewell of them who were converted by his ministry at
   Ephesus, he "commended them to the word of God's grace, which," as he
   judged, "was able to build them up, and to give them an inheritance
   among all them which are sanctified," Acts xx. 32.

   A man would think it were a more difficult work to convert men from
   Judaism or Paganism, or any false religion, unto the profession of the
   gospel, than to retain them in that profession when they are initiated
   thereinto: for in that first work there are all sorts of prejudices and
   difficulties to be conflicted withal, and not the least advantage from
   any acknowledged principles of truth; but as to the preservation of men
   in the profession of truth which they have received and owned, the work
   on many accounts seems to be more expedite and easy. If, therefore, the
   dispensation of the word, as it is God's ordinance unto that end, hath
   been a sufficient and effectual means for the former, what reason can
   be assigned that it should not be so for the latter also, without
   farther force or violence?

   It will be said that the first preachers of the gospel were furnished
   with extraordinary gifts, whereby their ministry was rendered effectual
   unto the first conversion of the nations; but whereas now those gifts
   do cease, the efficacy of the ministry doth so also, and therefore
   stands in need of such outward assistance as the former did not. I say,
   for my part, I wish it all the assistance which those unto whom it is
   committed can desire, so that no force be offered to the consciences or
   persons of other men. But why shall we not think that the ordinary
   gifts of the ministry are as sufficient for the ordinary work of it as
   the extraordinary were for that which was extraordinary? To speak the
   truth, the difference lieth in persons in the discharge of their duty,
   and not in the things, gifts, or duties themselves. Were all those who
   are called, or profess themselves to be called, unto the preservation
   of the truth of the gospel in the work of the ministry, as
   conscientiously diligent in the discharge of their duty, as well
   fitted, according to the rules of the gospel, with those ordinary
   spiritual gifts which are necessary unto their work and calling, did as
   fully represent the design and nature of their message unto men in a
   holy conversation, as those first appointed unto the conversion of the
   nations were and did, according to their larger measures of grace and
   gifts, the work would have a proportionate success in their hands unto
   what it had in the beginning. But whilst those unto whom this charge is
   committed do neglect the use of this means, which is the ordinance of
   God unto this purpose, that the truths of the gospel be preserved
   amongst men; whilst either they judge that the principal end of their
   office is to capacitate them for secular advantages, and to give them
   outward rest therein, with the enjoyment of those things which unto the
   most in this world seem desirable; and therewithal think meet to betake
   themselves unto other expedients for the preservation of the truth,
   which God hath not appointed nor sanctified to that end, -- it is no
   wonder if faith and truth fail from amongst men.

   The apostle Paul foresaw that a time would come wherein some men would
   "not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts would heap to
   themselves teachers, having itching ears," who should "turn them away
   from the truth, and turn them unto fables," 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4; and we may
   see what course he prescribeth for the prevention of this evil, that it
   might not proceed unto a general apostasy. It must also be observed
   that the advice he gives in this case, though originally directed unto
   one individual person, who was immediately concerned, yet it lies in
   charge on all that are or shall be called unto the rule of or ministry
   in the church. This course he proposeth, verses 1, 2, 5, of that
   chapter: "I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
   shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
   preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
   exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. Watch in all things,
   endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of
   thy ministry." This is that course and way which he prescribeth for the
   preservation of the truth against the corruptions of men's minds and
   the craft of seducers; and the charge of this duty he giveth with so
   great a solemnity, and urgeth with so many motives emphatically
   expressed, as manifest of how great moment he conceived it to be.

   Perhaps this way of the preservation of the truth and the salvation of
   the souls of men, by continual labouring in the word and doctrine, with
   an undergoing of all those difficulties which attend it, is not
   esteemed so advisable as formerly; for what good would men's lives or
   preferments do unto them if they should be obliged thus to labour in
   this sweaty kind of preaching? But if it be so, they must at one time
   or another be contented to part with the truth and all the advantages
   they have by the profession of it; for let men turn themselves which
   way they please, let them traverse their methods and multiply their
   counsels, to secure religion according to their apprehension, however
   they may hereby chain their idols, as the heathens did their gods of
   old to prevent their departure from them, and fix a profession of lies,
   the truth of the gospel, as unto any useful end of it, will be no
   otherwise preserved in a nation, church, or people, but by this means
   of God's appointment.

   2. This is such a way and expedient for the preservation of the truth
   and the profession of the gospel as none can have the impudence to
   complain of or except against. There is in all places, among all sorts
   of persons, a pretence of zeal for the retaining of what they conceive
   to be the truth or right in religion. But the ways which, for the most
   part, they have chosen unto that purpose have been full of scandal unto
   Christian religion; so far from being rational means of preserving men
   in it as that they are effectual to deter them from it. Such is that
   outward force which hath been now tried in this nation, as elsewhere by
   all sorts of persons; and wise men may easily observe what it is
   arrived unto. In the meantime, it is openly evident that, let the end
   aimed at be never so good, the means used for the attaining of it are
   accompanied with much evil. What peace or satisfaction they have in
   themselves who are the prosecutors of this way I know not. It is above
   my understanding to apprehend that the minds of any Christians can be
   thoroughly at ease, rejoicing in God through Jesus Christ, whilst they
   cause others to be terrified, pursued, ruined, and destroyed, merely
   for that which is their faith and hope in Christ Jesus. But I know not
   the principles of the minds of other men, the make or constitution of
   their consciences, nor the rules of their walking before God, much less
   their prevailing prejudices and interests, that influence them beyond
   all evidence of reason to the contrary; and therefore they may have a
   satisfactory peace in this way, though I understand not how. On the
   other side, those who are practised upon and forced to suffer in this
   course of proceeding are filled with alienation from them and their
   profession by whom they suffer. Hence it is known what mutual
   animosities, hatreds, contentions, severe reflections, and dreadful
   scandals, this way is attended withal. We see at this day what clamours
   and contests are raised about it, what pleas are managed against such
   procedures, how uncouth it is unto human nature to suffer all
   extremities for that which men are fully persuaded they deserve well in
   of mankind; nor can any man give assurance but that, at one time or
   other, the wheat shall be plucked up instead of tares.

   But as to the way now proposed, of preserving the truth by the
   diligent, effectual dispensation of the word of the gospel unto the
   generality of the people, who can pretend a provocation by it or take
   offence at it? No mortal man will be prejudiced by it in any thing that
   he dares own a concernment in. The devil, indeed, will be enraged at
   it, not only as that which is designed unto the ruin of his interest
   and kingdom in the issue, but as that wherein he hath no share, nor can
   interpose his endeavours; for he is a spirit as restless and active as
   he is malicious, and loves not to be excluded out of any business that
   is on foot in the world. Wherefore, although he equally hates the truth
   in the management of all men, yet in the way of preserving of it before
   mentioned he can and doth so apparently immix himself and his effectual
   workings that he is very well satisfied with it; for what he may
   possibly lose on the one hand in point of truth, he gains ten times
   more on the other in the loss of love, peace, holiness, with all the
   fruits of goodness, meekness, and benignity, which ought to be among
   men. And let him have but his hand effectually in the promotion of this
   loss, and have the contrary fruits to feed upon, he is little concerned
   with the profession of truth in this or that way of worship amongst
   men. Be it, therefore, that he is or will be enraged at this way of
   preserving the truth, we know that the kingdom of Christ will be no
   otherwise maintained in the world but by a conquest of his rage; and
   for those who manage the same design with him, their wrath and envy,
   which they dare not manifest, will but torment and consume themselves.

   3. Setting aside some few instances of violence and blood, consuming
   the persons of men, as among the Waldenses, Bohemians, and some others,
   which yet were never totally prevalent, and revolutions of government
   attended with the like cruelties, as in the days of Queen Mary in
   England, which was but of short continuance, no instance can be given
   of the defection of any church or nation from the truth but where there
   was a neglect of implanting the power of the gospel on the minds and
   hearts of men by those unto whom that charge was committed. This sinful
   neglect was that which constantly opened the door unto all apostasy.
   Wherefore on this foundation the weight of all useful profession of the
   gospel among us doth depend. And if God will be pleased to put it into
   the hearts of all them who are concerned in this duty to labour
   effectually therein, and to give unto the people an example of the
   power of the gospel in their own holy, humble, useful, fruitful
   conversation among them, and shall be pleased, moreover, to furnish
   them with the gifts of his Spirit, enabling them unto a successful
   discharge of their duty, evangelical truth would certainly receive an
   unconquerable establishment among us. And it may be it is not suited
   unto the exigence of this season that any of those who are called and
   enabled unto this work, being willing to engage their utmost in defence
   of the truth, especially in this way of its preservation, by leavening
   the minds of men with a sense of its power and worth, should be
   prohibited the discharge of their duty. But the purposes of God in all
   things must stand, and himself be humbly adored, where "his judgments
   are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out."

   Again: this innate and yet uncured enmity unto things spiritual and
   heavenly becomes a cause and means of apostasy from the truths of the
   gospel, by filling the hearts of men with a love of sin, and their
   lives with the fruits of it in wicked works; for men are "alienated and
   enemies in their mind," in or "by wicked works," Col. i. 21. The enmity
   which is in their minds doth operate and manifest itself in wicked
   works. And the alienation wherewith this enmity is accompanied is from
   the "life of God:" Eph. iv. 18, "Having the understanding darkened,
   being alienated from the life of God;" that is, from the spiritual,
   heavenly life of faith and holiness, which God requireth, and whereof
   he is the end and object. Of this life the truths of the gospel are the
   spring, rule, and measure. See Acts v. 20; Eph. iv. 20, 21. Wherefore,
   when men are "alienated from the life of God," and through the love of
   sin are given up unto wicked works, they cannot but secretly dislike
   and hate that truth, that spiritual and heavenly doctrine, which is the
   spring and rule of holiness, and whereby both the love of sin and the
   fruits of it in wicked works are everlastingly condemned. Let, then,
   men pretend and profess what they please, whilst this enmity is in them
   as a predominant principle of sin and wicked conversation, they are
   practically and really enemies unto the gospel itself; and where any
   persons are so, it is easily imaginable how ready and prone they will
   be to part with it on any occasion, for none will retain that in their
   minds which is useless to them, and troublesome unto their principal
   inclinations, any longer than they have a fair opportunity to part with
   it. That this frame of mind is an effectual obstruction unto the due
   receiving of the gospel, our Saviour expressly declares: John iii. 19,
   20, "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
   For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
   light, lest his deeds should be reproved." Wherever the power of sin
   abideth, and men are engaged in the practice of it, so as that their
   deeds are evil, they will not receive the light of the gospel, -- that
   is, in its own nature and power, and for its proper ends; and when they
   are, by conviction or any other means, wrought unto a compliance with
   it, yet they do it but partially and hypocritically, nor can do it
   otherwise whilst their deeds are evil. So was it with them who are said
   to believe in Christ. Being some way convinced of the truth of his
   doctrine, yet would they not confess him, because "they loved the
   praise of men more than the praise of God," John xii. 42, 43. By the
   reigning power of this one sin of ambitious hypocrisy most of them were
   kept off from any assent unto the gospel; as our Saviour speaks unto
   them, "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and
   seek not the honour that cometh from God only?" John v. 44. With the
   residue, who were not able wholly to withstand their convictions, it
   prevailed so far as that they should not receive it sincerely, but
   partially and hypocritically. Now, that which so effectually keeps the
   most from giving any admission at all unto the gospel, and which
   suffers none to receive it in a due manner, will easily prevail, where
   it abides in its power, unto a total relinquishment of it when occasion
   is offered.

   Seeing, therefore, that all those whose deeds are evil, who through the
   enmity that is in their minds do give up themselves in their lives unto
   wicked works, are really alienated from the truths of the gospel, they
   are and will be ready at all times for a defection from them; for being
   kept under the dominion of sin, they have no real benefit by them, but
   rather find them inconsistent with their principal interests and
   chiefest joys.

   Hence is that description which the apostle giveth of those who were
   evangelically converted unto God: Rom. vi. 17, 18, "God be thanked,
   that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart
   that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free
   from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness." There is no
   obedience from the heart unto the gospel, no possibility of being cast
   into the mould of the doctrine delivered in it, unless we be made free
   from the service of sin.

   We may therefore, without scruple, fix [on] this as one principal means
   and cause of that apostasy from the truth of the gospel which hath been
   in the world, and which is yet deplorably progressive. Men who love sin
   and live in sin, whose works are wicked and whose deeds are evil, are
   all of them in their hearts alienated from the spiritual, holy
   doctrines of the gospel, and will undoubtedly, on any occasion of
   temptation or trial, fall away from the profession of them.

   What reason have we to hope or judge that drunkards, swearers, unclean
   persons, covetous, proud, ambitious, boasters, vain, sensualists, and
   the like enemies of the cross of Christ, should adhere unto the truth
   with any constancy if a trial should befall them? "Look diligently,"
   saith the apostle, "lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as
   Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright," Heb. xii. 15,
   16. Esau's birthright was his right unto and interest in the promise of
   the gospel made unto Abraham. This he, being a profane person, when he
   was pressed with a little hunger, parted withal for one morsel of meat.
   And if others, saith the apostle, are like him, profane persons,
   fornicators, or such as live in any course of sin, if a temptation
   befall them, and their lusts call to be satisfied, they will for
   morsels of bread, for the smallest earthly advantages, part with their
   interest in and profession of the gospel. So he tells us of them who,
   having put away a good conscience, did make shipwreck of the faith, 1
   Tim. i. 19. After men have debauched their consciences by living in
   sin, they may for a while speed on their voyage with full sails of
   profession; but if a storm come, if a trial befall them, if they meet
   with a rock or shelf in their way, they quickly make shipwreck of the
   faith, and lose that, whatever else they labour to preserve.

   What should secure such persons unto any constancy in profession for
   whilst they are in this condition, it is altogether indifferent unto
   them, as to their present or future advantage, what religion they are
   of, or whether they are of any at all or no. It is true, one way of
   religion may more harden them in sin, lay more prejudices against and
   hinderances of their conversion, than another; but no religion can do
   them good or yield them the least eternal advantage whilst they abide
   in that condition. It will be all one at the last day what religion
   wicked and ungodly sinners have been of, unless it be that the
   profession of the truth will prove an aggravation of their sins, Rom.
   ii. 11, 12.

   Besides, when a temptation unto the relinquishment of the truth doth
   befall them, it hath nothing but a few traditional prejudices to
   contend withal. When they are taken off from them, and begin to search
   themselves for reasons why they should adhere unto the truth which they
   have outwardly professed, they quickly find in their own hearts a
   predominant dislike and hatred of that light and truth which they are
   solicited to part withal; for every man, as our Saviour testifieth,
   hateth the light whose deeds are evil.

   This is that which abroad in the world hath lost the gospel so many
   princes, nobles, and great men, who for a while made profession of it.
   This is that which is of such dismal abode at this day as to the danger
   of a general apostasy. All sorts of persons do give up themselves unto
   the service of sin. The complaint of the prophet is not unsuited to our
   occasion, Isa. i. 4-6. Many are openly flagitious, beyond precedent or
   example among the heathen. Worldliness, pride, ambition, vanity, in all
   its variety of occasions and objects, with sensuality of life, have
   even overrun the world. And that which is of the most dreadful
   consideration is, that the sins of many are accompanied with the
   highest aggravation of all provocations, -- namely, that they proclaim
   them like Sodom, and hide them not, but glory in their shame. In all
   these things men do really, though not in words, proclaim that they are
   weary of the gospel, and are ready to leave it; some for any pretence
   of religion, some for none at all.

   And this is the most dangerous posture that any place, church, or
   people can be found in; for whereas men are of themselves ready and
   prone unto a spiritual revolt and defection, when this ariseth from and
   is promoted by the love of sin and a life therein, God is ready also
   penally to give them up unto such delusions as shall turn them off from
   the gospel. So the apostle expresseth it, 2 Thess. ii. 10-12, "They
   received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
   this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." Where men, under the
   profession of the truth, will continue profligate in sin, and take
   pleasure in unrighteousness, God will not always suffer the gospel to
   be prostituted to give them countenance in their wickedness, but will
   judicially give them up unto such delusions as shall flood them away
   into an open apostasy from it.

   This was the great cause of that general and almost catholic apostasy
   that was in the world before the reformation. The body of the Christian
   people, by such means and on such occasions as shall be afterward
   declared, were grown worldly, sensual, wicked, and obstinate in sin.
   The complaints hereof are left on record in the writings of many in
   those days. And in vain it was for any to attempt to reduce them unto a
   conformity unto the gospel, especially considering that the most of
   their guides were no less infected than themselves. Chrysostom was
   almost the only person, at least he was the most eminent, who set
   himself in his ministry to stem, if it were possible, the rising tide
   of impiety and wickedness among all sorts of persons; but instead of
   any success, his holy endeavours ended in his own banishment and death.
   All degrees and orders of men undertook the patronage of public sinning
   against him, and to his ruin. Wherefore there remained but two ways of
   dealing with the generality of men in such a condition. The one was,
   according to the advice of the apostle, to "turn away" or withdraw from
   them, 2 Tim. iii. 5, so leaving them out of the communion of the
   church; the other was, to accommodate religion unto their temper and
   lusts, whereby a face and appearance of Christianity might be preserved
   among them. And the generality of their leaders preferring their
   interest before their duty, the latter way was chosen and gradually
   promoted.

   Hence were opinions and practices invented, advanced, and taken into
   religion, that might accommodate men in their lusts, or give
   countenance and pretended relief unto them who were resolved to live in
   their sins. Such were auricular confession, penances, absolutions,
   commutations of all sorts, missatical sacrifices for the living and the
   dead, the church's treasury of merit and power of pardon, suffrage and
   help of saints, especially purgatory, with all its appendages.

   Hereby was the apostasy completed; for men being grown carnal and
   wicked, there appeared no way to keep them up unto the profession of
   the gospel but by corrupting the whole doctrine and worship of it, that
   their lusts might be some way accommodated. To this end external things
   were substituted in the room of things internal, having the same names
   given unto them; ecclesiastical things in the room of things spiritual;
   outward offices, orders, and multiplied sacraments, with their efficacy
   by virtue of the work wrought, in the place of real conversion unto
   God, purity of heart, with strict universal holiness; disciplines and
   corporeal severities in the room of evangelical repentance and
   mortification; -- nor could the lusts of men have possibly a higher
   accommodation, whilst any pretence of religion was necessary to be
   preserved. So formerly did wickedness of life lead the way unto
   apostasy from the truth. And the whole of the papal apostasy may be
   reduced unto these two heads:-- First, An accommodation of the doctrine
   and worship of the gospel unto the carnal minds and lusts of men, with
   the state of their consciences that ensued thereon; and, secondly, The
   accommodation of the lusts, ignorance, and superstition of men unto the
   interests and worldly advantage of the pope and his clergy.

   And herein lieth the danger of this age. The great design of the
   generality of men is, to live in sin with as little trouble at present,
   and as little fear of what is future, as they can arrive unto. And
   there are but two ways whereby such a posture of mind may be attempted.

   The one is by obliterating all notions of good and evil, all sense of
   future rewards and punishments, or of God's government in the world.
   This some in all ages have endeavoured: for "the fool hath said in his
   heart, There is no God;" and thereon are "they corrupt, and do
   abominable works," Ps. xiv. 1. And no age could ever give more
   instances of this affected atheism than that wherein we live. Neither
   do any deceive themselves into it, but merely with this design, to live
   in sin without control from themselves; which is the last restraint
   they can acquit themselves of. And some of them do please themselves
   with the attainment of them in the psalmist: "The wicked, through the
   pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all
   his thoughts," Ps. x. 4. But God hath inlaid the minds of men,
   antecedently unto all actings of their wills and affections, with such
   a tenacious and unanswerable witness to the contrary, that it is very
   difficult for any to bring themselves unto any tolerable satisfaction
   this way: for "that which may be known of God is manifest in
   themselves," whether they will or no, Rom. i. 19; neither can they free
   themselves from prevailing apprehensions that it is "the judgment of
   God, that they who commit sin are worthy of death," verse 32. Wherefore
   we have not many instances of men who pretend a senselessness of these
   things out of principle, or that find no disquietment on the account of
   sin. And by the most of them this is but pretended. Their outward
   boasting is but a sorry plaster for their inward fears and vexations;
   nor will the pretended security of such impious persons endure the
   shock of the least of those surprisals, calamities, and dangers, which
   human nature is obnoxious unto in this life, much less of death itself.
   The end therefore mentioned, be it never so earnestly desired, is not
   this way to be attained.

   Another way, therefore, must be found out unto the same end, and this
   must be by a religion. Nothing but religion can convert men from sin,
   and nothing but religion can secure them therein. To this purpose is
   that of our apostle: "In the last days perilous times shall come. For
   men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
   blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
   natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
   despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers
   of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but
   denying the power thereof," 2 Tim. iii. 1-5. Had they the power of
   religion in them, they could not give themselves up unto the pursuit of
   such brutish lusts; and had they not some form or other of it, they
   could not be secure in their practice: for, --

   Sin and conscience are stubborn in their conflict whilst immediately
   opposed, conscience pleading that there should be no sin, and sin
   contending that there may be no conscience; but, as nature is
   corrupted, they will both comply with an accommodation. Wherefore a
   device to satisfy sin and to deceive conscience will not fail of a
   ready entertainment; and this is the design in part or in whole of
   every false way in religion that men apostatize unto from the purity
   and simplicity of the gospel. See 2 Peter ii. 18, 19. One way or other
   is proposed to take men off from the necessity of regeneration and the
   renovation of their nature into the image of God, in the first place;
   for this is that lion in the way which deters all sorts of sluggards
   from attempting any thing seriously in religion. And whereas our Lord
   Jesus Christ hath placed the necessity of it at the first entrance into
   the kingdom of God, there is no false way of religion but its first
   design is to destroy its nature or take away its necessity. Hence some
   would have it to be only baptism, with the grace it confers by the work
   wrought; some substitute a moral reformation of life in the room of it,
   which, as they suppose, is sufficiently severe; and the light within
   makes all thoughts of it useless; -- for if this point be not well
   secured, all ensuing attempts to accommodate men with a religion will
   be in vain; it will still be returning on them, that "except they be
   born again, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Internal
   sanctification of the whole person, the mortification of all the
   motions of sin that are in the flesh, with that universal obedience
   which is required unto the life of God, must also be provided for or
   against, and yet conscience be satisfied therewithal. Wherefore, if you
   can obtain that persons who live in sin, and are resolved so to do, not
   troubling themselves about these things, shall suppose that they may be
   secured eternally in such a way of religion as you propose unto them,
   -- that what is wanting in themselves shall be done for them by
   absolutions and masses, and various supplies out of the church's
   treasury, with the great reserve of purgatory when things come to the
   worst, -- there is no great fear (especially if some other
   circumstances fall in also to promote the design) but that you will
   find them very ductile and pliable unto your desires. Add hereunto,
   that the ways whereby any may be interested in these efficacious means
   of eternal salvation, -- namely, by confession, penances, and alms, --
   are possible, yea, easy to persons who never intend to leave their
   sins. Of this sort are the most of those visibly who every day fall off
   to the Roman church. And it were to be desired that the wickedness of
   men did not give grounds of fearing additions to their number; for if
   there be no assurance of the constancy of men in the profession of the
   truth, unless their souls and lives are transformed into the image of
   it (as there is not), certainly those ways wherein men are furiously
   engaged in the pursuit of their lusts must needs be perilous, and may,
   without the especial help of divine grace, bring forth a fatal
   defection.

Chapter V.

   Darkness and ignorance another cause of apostasy.

   II. The second spring or cause of defection from the gospel in any
   kind, is that spiritual darkness and ignorance which abides in the
   minds of men under the profession of the truth.

   The gospel may fall under a double consideration: First, Of the things
   themselves that are contained, revealed, and proposed therein; -- these
   are the material objects of our faith. Secondly, With respect unto the
   doctrinal way of their declaration. With respect unto the first, there
   is a spiritual darkness on the minds of all men by nature, so as that
   they cannot discern them in their own native form and beauty. With
   respect unto the latter, men are said to be ignorant, namely, when they
   do not in a due manner understand and comprehend the doctrines of the
   gospel, and so perish for want of knowledge. These things being of a
   distinct consideration, and of different influence into this pernicious
   event, the first shall be first spoken unto.

   1. That there is such a spiritual darkness on the minds of men by
   nature, and wherein their depravation by sin cloth principally consist,
   is fully testified in the Scripture, as I have at large elsewhere
   evinced. [7] Hence all men grant, so far as I know, that there is need
   of spiritual illumination to enable us to discern spiritual things in a
   due manner, though all are not agreed in the nature and causes of that
   illumination. But to deny the thing itself is to deny the gospel, and
   to make the promises of God of none effect. Now, where illumination is
   needful, there darkness is to be removed; for the end of the bringing
   in of light is to dispel darkness. Wherefore, such a depravation of the
   minds of men in spiritual darkness must be acknowledged, or the gift
   and grace of God in illumination must be rejected; and they by whom it
   is done do by their own blindness give new evidence unto the truth
   which they do oppose, there being no more certain demonstration of the
   power of darkness in any than for them to affirm that they stand in no
   need of light to be communicated unto them by the effectual operation
   of the Spirit of God. As to the nature of this illumination I shall not
   here dispute, but take it at present for granted that it is an act of
   His power who of old "commanded light to shine out of darkness, shining
   in our hearts, to give us the knowledge of his glory in the face of
   Jesus Christ," 2 Cor. iv. 6.

   There is a glory and beauty in those spiritual things which are the
   subjects of the truths of the gospel. There is in them the wisdom of
   God, "the wisdom of God in a mystery," 1 Cor. ii. 6, 7, yea, "the
   manifold wisdom of God," Eph. iii. 10; the glory of the Lord, which is
   represented unto believers in the glass of the gospel, 2 Cor. iii. 18,
   or "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ," chap. iv. 6; --
   things expressly beyond discovery by the use of any means whatever
   merely natural, 1 Cor. ii. 9, 10. Even the philosophers of old
   contended that there was a beauty in all truth, which would engage the
   minds and affections of men unto it were they able to discern it; and
   if they saw and granted this in things natural and moral, which are
   earthly and exposed unto the common reason of mankind, how much more
   must it be granted of the truth of things heavenly, spiritual, and
   divine! See John iii. 12. In brief, whatever there is of divine glory
   or excellency in the divine nature itself, in any or all of its holy
   properties, in the great and most glorious effect of them in the person
   and grace of Christ, in the renovation of our nature into the image of
   God, in the divine life of faith and obedience, it is proposed unto us
   in the truths of the gospel.

   2. Whatever doctrinal proposition may be made of these things unto the
   minds of men, yet the things themselves cannot be comprehended nor
   spiritually discerned without the illumination of the Holy Ghost before
   mentioned. Hence it follows that men may be instructed in the doctrines
   of truth, yet, continuing under the power of natural darkness, not
   discern the things themselves in their own spiritual nature and glory,
   nor have any experience of their power and efficacy. This all the
   prayers of holy men in the Scripture for spiritual light and
   instruction, all the promises of God savingly to enlighten the minds of
   men, and the descriptions given of that work of his grace whereby he
   doth effect it, do undeniably evince. One consideration will be
   sufficient unto our purpose. Whosoever hath a spiritual view and
   knowledge of these things, his mind will be, and is, certainly changed
   and transformed into the image of them. So the apostle tells us
   expressly, 2 Cor. iii. 18, "We all, with open face beholding as in a
   glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image." They are
   cast into the same mould with the doctrine whereunto they are given up,
   Rom. vi. 17. The mind is united unto the things so discerned, and the
   image of them is so brought forth therein as that there is an exact
   conformity between them. But we see by open and palpable experience,
   that notwithstanding the knowledge which many have of spiritual things,
   their minds continue carnal and fleshly, filled with corrupt and
   depraved affections, and are no way changed into the image or likeness
   of the things themselves. There needs no farther demonstration that men
   have never had a spiritual view of or insight into the glory of gospel
   truths, be their doctrinal knowledge of them what it will, than this,
   that their minds are not renewed thereby, nor transformed into the
   likeness of them.

   Where it is thus with men, they have no stable grounds whereon to abide
   in the profession of the truth against temptation, opposition, or
   seduction; for their steadfastness must be an effect of such an
   assurance in their minds of the truth of the things which they do
   believe, as will be prevalent against all that force and artifice
   wherewith they may be assaulted, and such as will not suffer their own
   minds to be indifferent, careless, or negligent about them. But whence
   should this arise? Assurance from outward natural sense in spiritual
   things we are not capable of, nor are they evidenced unto our minds by
   rational demonstration All the full persuasion or assurance we can have
   of them, which will be prevalent against temptations and oppositions,
   ariseth from such a spiritual view of them as gives an experience of
   their reality, power, and efficacy upon our minds: and this respects
   both the renovation of the mind itself in light and faith; the adhesion
   of the will unto the things known and believed, with a holy, heavenly,
   unconquerable love; and the constant approbation of the good,
   acceptable, and perfect will of God in all things. Hence this
   assurance, though it be neither that of sense nor that of reason, yet
   in the Scripture is compared with them and preferred above them, as
   that which giveth the mind a more certain satisfaction than they can
   do, although it be of another kind. And without this it is impossible
   that men should attain any such evidence or full persuasion of that
   evangelical truth which they may profess, as to secure them in their
   profession in such a juncture of circumstances and occasions as they
   may fall into.

   Here, therefore, I place another means and cause of apostasy from the
   truth of the gospel after it hath been received and professed.
   Multitudes in all ages have been instructed in the truth, some have
   been learned and knowing in the doctrines of it; but whereas, by reason
   of their darkness, as being destitute of spiritual illumination, they
   did not discern the things themselves which they assented unto, in
   their supernatural, heavenly nature and glory, and therefore had no
   experience of their proper power and efficacy on their own minds,
   affections, and lives, they could not have any such evidence of their
   truth as would upon trials confirm their adherence unto them or secure
   them from apostasy.

   Had the minds of men been transformed in their renovation to "prove
   what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God," -- had they
   by beholding of spiritual things "been changed into the same image from
   glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord," -- they would not have
   abandoned the most important doctrines of the gospel, as we know them
   to have done, nor have embraced foolish imaginations in their stead, on
   every plausible courtship and address unto their fancies How came men
   under the papal apostasy gradually to desert the principal truths of
   the gospel and all the spiritual glory of its worship? Not discerning
   the internal glory and beauty of things evangelical and purely divine,
   not having an experience of the power of them in and upon their own
   minds, they chose to comply with, and give admission unto, such things
   whose outward painted beauty they could discern, and whose effects on
   their natural and carnal affections they had experience of.

   We have seen, in all ages, men learned and skilled in the doctrines of
   the truth, so as that they might have been looked on as pillars of it,
   yet to have been as forward as any unto apostasy from it when they have
   been tried; yea, such have been the leaders of others thereinto. So
   many of this sort fell into Arianism and Pelagianism of old, as some
   have done into Socinianism, and many into Popery in our days When such
   fall away, usually they overthrow the faith of some, and shake the
   confidence of others.

   But the apostle gives a double relief against this temptation:-- first,
   The stability of God's purpose in the preservation of the elect; and,
   secondly, The means of preservation in holiness of them that believe, 2
   Tim. ii. 19. And we may be assured concerning them all, that they never
   had that intuition into nor comprehension of spiritual things which
   alone could secure their stability. They never saw so much or that in
   them for which they should be preferred above all other things. No man
   who forsakes the truth ever saw the glory of it, or had experience of
   its power. "They went out from us, but they were not of us," saith the
   apostle of such persons; "for if they had been of us" (whose fellowship
   is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ), "they would no
   doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be
   made manifest that they were not all of us," 1 John ii. 19.

   Thus when the apostle had described the woeful apostasy of some among
   the Hebrews, he adds concerning them whose preservation he believed,
   "But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
   accompany salvation," Heb. vi. 9. Whatever knowledge men may have of
   the doctrines of the gospel, and whatever profession they may make,
   unless they have withal those things which are inseparable from
   salvation, such as is the saving illumination of the Holy Ghost,
   whereby the darkness of our minds is removed, there can be no assurance
   that they will always "quit themselves like men," and "stand fast in
   the faith." And this consideration doth not a little evidence the
   danger of a defection from the truth which attends the days wherein we
   live.

   For, first, it is from hence that we have such a numerous generation of
   sceptics in religion among us, -- a sort of men who pretend not to
   renounce or forsake the truth, only they will talk and dispute about it
   with the greatest indifferency as to what is true or false. The
   Scripture, the holy Trinity, the person of Christ, his offices, the
   nature of justification and grace, whether it be or be not, this or
   that church, all or any in the world, as to their profession and
   worship, are weighed in the defiled, tottering scales of bold,
   irreverent discourses. For some reasons known to themselves, this sort
   of persons will own the public profession of religion, perhaps be
   teachers in it. But on all occasions they fully manifest that they are
   utterly ignorant of the fundamental difference between truth and error,
   and so give no firm assent unto what they do profess; for this
   difference lieth in their glory and beauty in themselves, and in their
   power and efficacy towards us. Spiritual, heavenly truth, by its
   relation unto the being, infinite wisdom, goodness, love, and grace of
   God, by the characters of all these things impressed on it and
   represented by it, is glorious, amiable, and desirable; -- all error,
   as an effect of darkness, and by its relation unto Satan as the head of
   the apostasy which drew off our minds from the original essential
   Truth, is distorted, deformed, and brings the mind into confusion.
   Truth is powerful and effectual to conform the soul unto God, and to
   principle it with a love of and power unto obedience; -- error turns
   the mind aside into crooked and by paths of folly or superstition, or
   pride and self-advancement. Were men practically acquainted with this
   difference between truth and error, it would take away that
   indifferency in their minds unto them which this sceptical humour doth
   discover. Truth so known in its nature and efficacy will beget that
   reverence, that love, that sacred esteem of itself, in the souls of
   men, as they shall not dare to prostitute it to be bandied up and down
   with every foolish imagination. And from this sort of men, who are
   commonly the most bold and forward in undertaking the conduct of
   others, by a pretended generous contempt of their narrow principles,
   groundless scruples, and pusillanimous fears, nothing is to be expected
   but a wise and safe compliance with any ways or means of apostasy from
   the truth which shall be advantageously presented unto them.

   And by the means of this darkness, it is easy to conceive how uncertain
   and unstable the minds of the generality of men, who perhaps also are
   somewhat ignorant (whereof we shall treat afterward), must needs be in
   their assent unto the truth and the profession of it, They are no way
   able to discover it in such a way or manner as to give them an
   assurance which will be infallibly victorious against temptations and
   oppositions; nor can they have that holy love unto it which will secure
   their minds and affections from being enticed and ravished from it.
   But, all the difference between truth and error which they can discern
   lying in bare different notions and apprehensions, wherein also they
   are dark and unskilled, it is no wonder if at any time they make an
   easy transcursion from the one to the other. So did the body of the
   people lose the truth gradually under the papal defection without any
   great complaint, yea, with much complacency and satisfaction; and it is
   to be feared that multitudes are ready at once to steer the same course
   if occasion be offered unto them.

   From this consideration we may rectify the seeming solecism that is in
   the profession of religion, or the professors of it. Truth in every
   kind is the only guide of the mind in all its actings; wherein it
   proceeds not according unto it, it is always out of the way. Divine
   truth is the sole conduct of the mind in all its actings towards God;
   it is the only fountain, immediate cause, and rule of all our
   obedience. But yet, whereas in other things men generally walk in the
   light of those sparks of truth which they have received, we see that
   many by whom divine truth is owned and professed in its greatest purity
   and highest discovery are ofttimes no less wicked and vicious in their
   lives, no less enemies unto holiness, no less barren and unfruitful in
   those good and useful works it guides and directs unto, than those who,
   having the greatest aversation from it, are, under the conduct of other
   principles, erroneous and superstitious. Thus the lives of the common
   sort of Protestants are no better than those of the Papists, nor are
   theirs to be compared with those of some of the Mohammedans; yea, by
   the power of false and superstitious apprehensions imposed on their
   minds and consciences, some are carried out unto greater and more
   frequent acts of bounty and charity, of the mortification of the flesh,
   the denial of its sensual appetites and satisfactions, than are to be
   found among the most who profess themselves to be under the conduct and
   rule of truth. Hence no profession of religion, be it never so corrupt
   or foolish, is advanced amongst us, but instantly (at least for a
   season, and while it is new) it pretends an advantage as unto life and
   conversation against the truth, measured by the lives of its common
   professors; yea, this is made the principal motive and argument to
   prevail with honest and well-meaning people unto a compliance with the
   profession of their way, because of the effects which (as it is
   pretended) it produceth in their lives and conversations above those
   which profess the truth. And how prevalent this pretence hath been
   among us is known unto all.

   Wherefore, I say, we cannot allow that the lives of the common sort of
   professors should be esteemed a just and due representation of the
   doctrine which they do profess. It is true, that where it is not so men
   will have no benefit by their profession, nor will they be steadfast in
   it when a trial shall befall them. Where the mind is internally and
   really conformed unto the truth, there the actions of the life may be
   allowed to represent sincerely, though not perfectly, the truths which
   are believed; and he is no firm Christian in any kind, he is brought
   into no spiritual order, whose mind doth not receive by the Spirit of
   Christ the transforming influence of evangelical truth, and who exerts
   not the power of it in a holy conversation, so as that he is not
   unwilling that what he believeth may be impartially judged by what he
   liveth, as to sincerity, though not as to perfection. But if we should
   allow the lives of men in general to be a rule whereby judgment might
   be safely passed in these things, it cannot be denied but that
   sometimes, and in some ages and places, error would, at least for a
   season, carry it in glory and reputation from the truth, yea, the light
   of nature from grace, tradition from the Scripture, and the Alcoran
   from the Gospel.

   But we have sufficient ground of exceptions unto this interpretation
   and exposition of the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that
   without the least apology for the ungodly lives of its professors.
   Among these, that now insisted on is of the first rank and evidence.
   Multitudes of those who profess the truth never had a view of its
   spiritual glory because of the darkness of their minds, and therefore
   have no experience of its power and efficacy, nor are their hearts and
   lives influenced or guided by it; for the gospel will not have its
   effects on the minds of men unless it first communicates unto them
   those internal spiritual principles which are necessary unto all the
   operations that it doth require. Put this new wine into old bottles and
   all is lost, both bottles and wine also. The doctrine of the gospel,
   taken notionally into the old, unrenewed, corrupt minds of men, is
   utterly lost as unto all the proper ends of it. And wherever there is a
   reformation of life, with any diligent attendance unto duties moral or
   religious, wrought in persons by the light and dispensation of the
   gospel, they are the immediate effects of those doctrines which it hath
   in common with the light of nature and the law in its power, and not of
   those which are peculiarly its own. And this they seem to understand
   well enough who, finding, either in their own experience, or from the
   observation they have made of others, how ineffectual the truth of
   gospel mysteries is towards the minds of carnal men, have upon the
   matter abandoned the preaching of it, and have taken up only with those
   principles which are suited unto the light of nature and convictions of
   the law.

   The holiness which the gospel requireth is the transforming of our
   whole souls into the image and likeness of God, with the actings of
   renewed nature in a universal approbation of his "good, and acceptable,
   and perfect will," Rom. xii. 2. But this will not be effected unless we
   can "behold the glory of the Lord" in it, whereby alone we may be
   "changed into the same image from glory to glory," 2 Cor. iii. 18. Nor
   can we so behold that glory unless he "who commanded the light to shine
   out of darkness do shine in our hearts to give us the knowledge of it,"
   chap. iv. 6. Hence is the doctrine of it ineffectual in the hearts and
   upon the lives of many by whom its truth is openly professed.

   It is otherwise with every false religion. The motives which they make
   use of, and the instruments they apply, unto the hearts of men, to
   effect the reformation of their lives, and to engage them unto such
   works and duties as they require, are all of them suited either unto
   their natural light, or unto their superstitions, fears, desires,
   pride, and other depraved affections. Those of the first sort, --
   namely, such as are suited unto natural light, -- are common, in some
   degree or measure, unto all religion whatever, be it on other accounts
   true or false. Every thing that is called religion pretends at least
   unto the improvement of natural light, as did the philosophers among
   the heathen of old. It urgeth also the law so far as it is made known
   unto them, though by other presumptions and prejudices some do abate
   and take off from its force and efficacy, making void the commandments
   of God through their own traditions. Whatever change is wrought or
   effected on the minds and lives of men by virtue of these principles,
   and motives taken from them, doth not belong unto any one way in
   religion more than another; nor is it to be accounted unto the glory or
   advantage of any of them. In these things Mohammedanism and all false
   ways in Christianity have an equal share and interest, unless where, by
   some corrupt opinions of their own, men deprave the light of nature and
   the rule of the law itself.

   Some finding, as they say, more of justice, temperance, veracity,
   righteousness in dealings, with common usefulness unto mankind, among
   Turks and Banians, [8] than among the common sort of Christians, do
   foolishly begin to think that their religion is better than
   Christianity. But as this scandal will be surely required at the hands
   of them who give it by their flagitious lives, so it is foolishly and
   wickedly taken by others; for those truths and laws which produce these
   effects in them are common unto all religions, and are equally suited
   unto the light and reason of all mankind, and have more evidence and
   efficacy communicated unto them by the gospel than by any other kind of
   religion whatever. And so it is with them among ourselves who would
   plead an advantage unto their profession by the effects of it in their
   lives as to a moral conversation, when they can pretend unto no real
   motive thereunto, -- namely, unto what is good and useful, and not mere
   affectation and hypocrisy, -- but what is owned and pressed in the
   doctrine of the gospel which we adhere unto. The differences,
   therefore, that are in this kind are not from the doctrines men
   profess, but they arise from the persons themselves who embrace them,
   with their various lusts, inclinations, and temptations.

   It is evident, therefore, that whatever there is of moral good, duty,
   or usefulness among men in any false way of religion, it all proceeds
   from those principles and is the effect of those motives which are
   owned and improved in that which is true; and it may be easily evinced
   that they are more cultivated and cleared, have more evidence, life,
   light, and power given them, by the truths of the gospel, than by any
   other means or way whatever. And where they have not an equal effect
   upon those who profess that truth which they have on some by whom it is
   deserted, it is from the power of their own cursed lusts and carnal
   security. The difference on the part of religion itself consists in
   what is superadded unto these general principles by any notions of it.
   Now this, in every false religion, is what is suited unto the natural
   principles of men's minds, their innate pride, vanity, curiosity,
   superstition, irregular hopes and fears. Such among the Romanists are
   the doctrines of merit, of outward disciplines, of satisfactions for
   sin, of confession, penances, of purgatory, and the like. They were all
   of them found out to put some awe on the minds, and to have some
   influence on the lives of men, who had lost all sense of the principles
   and motives of gospel obedience, though some considerable respect was
   had unto the benefit and advantage of them by whom they were invented;
   for why should men labour and beat their brains merely for others,
   without some income and revenue of advantage unto themselves? And it is
   no wonder if they produce in many, as they have done, great appearing
   acts of devotion, many outward works of bounty and charity, yea, in
   some, real austerities of life and renunciations of the pleasures of
   the world. I doubt not but that the sensual, wicked paradise of
   Mohammed doth effectually prevail in the minds of many of his followers
   unto that kind of virtuous and devout life which they suppose may bring
   them unto its enjoyment.

   The inquiry, then, on the whole matter is, wherefore the truths of the
   gospel do not produce, in all by whom they are professed, effects as
   much more excellent than those mentioned as truth is more excellent
   than error, heavenly light than superstition, faith than frightful
   apprehensions of feigned torments, true peace and tranquility of mind
   than outward reputation and glory. And the principal reason hereof is,
   because such persons as are barren in the knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ do not discern those troths in their spiritual
   nature, nor can therefore take in the power and efficacy of them on
   their souls.

   There is a holiness, obedience, and fruitfulness in good works,
   wrought, preserved, and maintained by the truth of the gospel, in them
   who are truly regenerated and sanctified thereby, who receive the
   proper efficacy of it on their minds and souls, which differ in the
   whole kind and nature from any thing which the principles and motives
   before mentioned, which have their efficacy from their suitableness
   unto the depraved affections of men's minds, can produce; and this
   alone is acceptable with God. But it must be granted, that where men
   are ignorant of the power mad unacquainted with the internal efficacy
   of the gospel, their lives under the profession of the truth may be as
   bad, and it is a great wonder they are not worse than those of the
   Papists, of the most erroneous persons, or even of the Mohammedans
   themselves: for they have many superstitious imaginations and false
   principles that are suited to put some outward restraint upon their
   lusts, and to press them unto actions praiseworthy in themselves; but
   these being no way influenced by such apprehensions, and being not
   under the power of gospel truth, it is a wonder, I say, if they exceed
   them not in all manner of wicked conversation. It is not merely the
   outward profession of the truth, but the inward power of it, that is
   useful either unto the world or the souls of men.

   And hence it is that the preaching of any person which principally
   dwelleth on and argueth from the things which the light of nature can
   of itself reach unto, and the convictions which are by the law, is
   better accepted with, and appears more useful unto, multitudes of
   common professors, than the declaration of the mysteries of the gospel
   is: for such things are suited unto the natural conceptions of men and
   the working of their own reason, which gives them a sense of what
   efficacy they have; but being in the dark unto the mysteries of the
   gospel, they neither see their excellency nor experience their power.
   Nevertheless, they and they only are the true spring, cause, and rule
   of all acceptable obedience, even "the power of God unto salvation to
   every one that believeth." From the whole it appears how prone such
   persons must be unto an apostasy from the truth who have no spiritual
   light to discern its glory nor to let in the power of it upon their
   souls.

   If, then, we would be established in the truth, if we would stand fast
   in the faith, if we would be preserved from the danger of that
   defection from the gospel which the world is prone, disposed, and
   inclined unto, it must be our principal endeavour to have a spiritual
   acquaintance with the things themselves that are declared in the
   doctrine of truth which we do profess, and to have an experience of
   their efficacy upon our own souls. Mere notions of truth, or the
   knowledge of the doctrines of it, enabling us to talk of them or
   dispute for them, will not preserve us. And although this spiritual
   light be the grace, promise, and gift of God, yet is it that which we
   are to endeavour after in a way of duty; and the directions ensuing may
   contribute somewhat towards the right discharge of our duty herein:--

   1. Pray earnestly for the Spirit of truth go lead us into all truth.
   For this end is he promised by our Saviour unto his disciples; and
   there are no teachings like his. If we learn and receive the truths of
   the gospel merely in the power and ability of our natural faculties, as
   we do other things, we shall not abide constant unto them in spiritual
   trials. What we learn of ourselves in spiritual things, we receive only
   in the outward form of it; what we are taught by the Spirit of God, we
   receive in its power. The apostle grants that "the spirit of man," his
   mind, reason, and understanding, is able to conceive of and apprehend
   "the things of a man," things merely natural, civil, or moral, which
   are cognate unto human nature; but saith he, "The things of God," the
   mystery of his wisdom, love, and grace in Christ Jesus, "knoweth no
   man, but the Spirit of God," and by him are they revealed unto them
   that do believe, 1 Cor. ii. 9-12. Without his especial aid, men may, by
   their natural sagacity and industry, attain an acquaintance with the
   doctrines of truth, so as to handle them (like the schoolmen) with
   incredible subtilty and curiosity; but they may be far enough for all
   that from an establishing knowledge of spiritual things. That horrible
   neglect which is among Christians of this one duty of earnest prayer
   for the teaching of the Spirit of Christ, that scorn which is cast upon
   it by some, and that self-confidence in opposition unto it which
   prevails in the most, sufficiently manifest of what nature is their
   knowledge of the truth, and what is like to become of it when a trial
   shall befall them. The least spark of saving knowledge inlaid in the
   minds of the poorest believers, by the gracious operation of the Holy
   Ghost, will be more effectual unto their own sanctification, and more
   prevalent against oppositions, than the highest notions or most subtle
   reasonings that men have attained in leaning unto their own
   understanding. Wherefore the Scripture abounds in examples, instances,
   and directions for prayer, unto this end, that we may have the
   assistance of the Holy Spirit in learning of the truth of the mysteries
   of the gospel, without which we cannot do so in a due manner: Eph. i.
   16-20, "Making mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of
   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your
   understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of
   his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the
   saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who
   believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
   in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own
   right hand in the heavenly places." Chap. iii. 14-19, "For this cause I
   bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the
   whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you,
   according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by
   his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
   faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to
   comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
   and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,
   that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God." Col. ii. 1-3, "I
   would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at
   Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; that
   their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto
   all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
   acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
   in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

   2. Rest not in any notions of truth, unless you find that you have
   learned it as it is in Jesus What it is to learn the truth as it is in
   Jesus, the apostle fully declares, Eph. iv. 20-25, "But ye have not so
   learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught
   by him, as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off concerning the former
   conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on
   the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness." This it is to learn the truth as it is in Jesus, -- namely,
   together with the knowledge of it, to have an experience of its power
   and efficacy in the mortification of sin, in the renovation of our
   nature, and transforming of the whole soul into the image of God in
   righteousness and the holiness of truth. When men learn that they may
   know, and are satisfied with what they know, without an endeavour to
   find the life and power of what they know in their own hearts, their
   knowledge is of little use, and their assent unto the truth will have
   no stability accompanying of it. The immediate end (with respect unto
   us) of the whole revelation of the mind and will of God in the
   Scripture is, that it may put forth a spiritual, practical power in our
   souls, and that we may do the things which are so revealed unto us.
   Where this is neglected, where men content themselves with a bare
   speculation of spiritual truths, they do what lies in them to frustrate
   the end, and "reject the counsel of God" in them. If, therefore, we
   would know any evangelical truths in a due manner, if we would have
   that evidence and assurance of them in our minds which may secure our
   profession against temptations and oppositions, let us not rest in any
   apprehensions of truth whose efficacy we have no experience of in our
   hearts, nor think that we know any more of the mysteries of the gospel
   than we find effectually working in the renovation of our minds, and
   the transforming of our souls into the image of the glory of God in
   Christ.

   3. Learn to esteem more of a little knowledge which discovers itself in
   its effects to be sanctifying and saving, than of the highest
   attainments in notions and speculations, though gilded and set off by
   the reputation of skill, subtilty, eloquence, wit, and learning, which
   do not evidence themselves by alike operations. We are fallen into days
   wherein men of all sorts, sects, and parties, are vying for the
   reputation of skill, ability, knowledge, subtilty, and cunning in
   disputes about religion. And few there are who are cast under such
   disadvantages by apparent want of learning, but that they hope to make
   it up one way or other, so as to think as well of their own knowledge
   and abilities as of other men's. He who hath learned to be meek,
   humble, lowly, patient, self-denying, holy, zealous, peaceable, to
   purify his heart, and to be useful in his life, is indeed the person
   who is best acquainted with evangelical truth. Wherefore, let this
   knowledge be esteemed, both in ourselves and others, above all that
   proud, presumptuous, notional, puffing knowledge, which sets up for so
   great a reputation in the world, and we shall have experience of a
   blessed success in our pursuit of it.

   4. Be not satisfied without a discovery of such a goodness, excellency,
   and beauty in spiritual things, as may attract your hearts unto them,
   and cause you to cleave unto them with unconquerable love and delight.
   This is that necessary, inseparable adjunct, property, fruit, or effect
   of faith, without which it is not essentially differenced from the
   faith of devils. That knowledge, that perception and understanding of
   the truth, which doth not present the things known, believed,
   perceived, as lovely, excellent, and desirable unto the will and
   affections, is a "cloud without water," which every wind of temptation
   will scatter and blow away. Do not, therefore, suppose that you have
   learned any thing of God in Christ, of the mystery of his grace, of his
   acceptable and perfect will, unless you see therein such evidence of
   infinite wisdom, goodness, holiness, love, in all things so suited unto
   the eternal glory of God and advantage of your own souls, in the
   uttermost rest, peace, and satisfaction that they are capable of, as
   that you may admire, adore, delight in them, and cleave unto them with
   a holy, prevalent, unconquerable love. When you do so, then will you be
   established in the truth, and be able to bid defiance unto the
   artifices of Satan, with the solicitations of men, that would withdraw
   or separate you from it. But I will not farther digress in these
   discourses.

   Ignorance is another occasion of apostasy from the truth, which was
   named under this head of the depravation of the minds of men. It is the
   want of a due perception, understanding, or knowledge of the principal
   doctrines of the gospel, with the evidence which is given unto them,
   and the use of them in the Scriptures, that we intend hereby. A general
   knowledge of some doctrines, without an acquaintance with their grounds
   and reasons, their use and effects in the life of God, is of no value
   in these things When persons know not in religion what they ought to
   know, as they ought to know it, or what it is their duty to know, and
   without the knowledge whereof they can perform no other duty of
   religion in a right manner, then are they culpably ignorant, and so as
   to be exposed unto all other evils that may befall them; for whether
   this be for want of due instruction from others, or want of diligence
   in themselves to learn, the event is equally pernicious. In the first
   way, the Holy Ghost assures us that "where there is no vision, the
   people perish," Prov. xxix. 18. The people will suffer where those
   whose duty it is so to do are not able to instruct them; for "if the
   blind lead the blind, both must fall into the ditch." And in general it
   is affirmed, that the "people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,"
   Hos. iv. 6. Of such ruinous consequence, by one means or other, is the
   people's ignorance of what it is their duty to know; and by no one way
   doth it so effectually operate unto their destruction as by this of
   disposing them to a defection from the truth which they have professed
   when any trial or temptation doth befall them.

   Multitudes, yea, whole nations, are often brought unto an outward
   general profession of the truth of religion, especially with respect
   unto the opposition of any other that is made thereunto. The influence
   and example of some that are in power and esteem among them, falling in
   with a season of encouraging circumstances, may produce this effect,
   where men have little knowledge of what they profess, and less sense of
   its power and efficacy. So the body of the people of old turned unto
   the profession of the true religion under the reformation made by
   Josiah; nevertheless, as the prophet observes, "they did it not with
   their whole hearts, but feignedly," Jer. iii. 10. They did it not out
   of love to the truth, or a cordial respect unto the ways of God, but in
   a hypocritical compliance with their ruler. The conversion of the
   northern nations after they had possessed the western parts of the
   Roman empire was a pledge of what their future profession was like to
   prove. The first conversion of the world was by the laborious preaching
   of apostles, evangelists, and others, accompanied with many miraculous
   operations, exemplified in holiness of life, and patience under all
   sorts of persecutions; and by this means none were received or admitted
   into the profession of Christian religion but such as were personally
   convinced of its truth, instructed in its mysteries, conformed in their
   lives to its precepts, and engaged unto its profession against
   persecution. But in these latter conversions, some kings, rulers, or
   potentates, being dealt withal by popes or other princes, and thereon
   (perhaps with no small influence from secular considerations) admitting
   of the Christian religion in opposition unto Paganism, their allies,
   kindred, and subjects, usually followed them therein; having indeed
   little more of Christianity than the administration of some external
   rites, and a relinquishment of their old idols for the new saints
   proposed unto them. By this means their first profession of
   Christianity was laid in profound ignorance of the principles and most
   important doctrines and duties of the gospel. Hence it became most easy
   for them who were looked on as their guides to lead them into all those
   foolish opinions, idolatrous practices, superstitious devotions, and
   blind subjection to themselves, whence at length issued the fatal
   apostasy. Knowing but little of what they ought to have known, and
   delighting not in obedience unto what they did know, they willingly
   embraced themselves, and God judicially gave them up unto, those strong
   delusions which turned them wholly from the gospel.

   Thus the generality of this nation hath received and professed the
   protestant religion in opposition unto Popery; and no doubt many did so
   through a sincere and effectual conviction of its truth, upon the first
   reformation. But it is so come to pass, that what through their own
   supine negligence and carelessness about all things invisible and
   eternal, what through the sloth, ignorance, laziness, and wretched
   indifferency in religion, of some of those that should instruct them,
   multitudes are become shamefully ignorant of the rudiments and
   principles of that religion which they account themselves to profess.
   So hath it been almost in all ages and places after profession became
   national. Many will not make use of the means of instruction which they
   have, and more want that means in an effectual measure. Nor, it may be,
   can there be an instance given where there hath been sufficient care
   taken, or at least sufficient provision made, for the instruction of
   the body of the people in all parts of it; neither is that ordinary
   course of the ministry which is passant in the world sufficient to this
   purpose. Can any man who knows any thing of the gospel, or of the
   nature of men with respect unto spiritual things, once suppose that the
   reading of prayers unto a people, or the rehearsing of a sermon without
   zeal, life, power, or evidence of compassion for the souls of men,
   accompanied with a light, vain, worldly conversation (as it is with
   many), should answer the apostolical pattern of laying the foundation,
   and then carrying on of men by continual instruction unto perfection?
   From hence (as also from other reasons obvious unto all impartial
   observers) it is that "darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness
   the people," ignorance prevailing on all sorts of men. Some will not
   learn, some have none to teach them, some are engaged in the pursuit of
   sensual lusts and vanities, some swallowed up in the love of and cares
   about the things of the world; few in any age have been conscientiously
   diligent in the things which are of eternal concernment unto them.

   This was that which facilitated the papal apostasy, from whence it took
   its rise, and by which it received its progress. Those who would on the
   motives mentioned be accounted Christians, and which it was the
   interest of the pretended presidents in religion to have so esteemed,
   being profoundly ignorant, they first accommodated the practices of
   religion unto their carnal, superstitious minds, and then gradually led
   them into all errors and fables; for they were blind, and knew not
   whither they went. So were the important truths of the gospel abandoned
   for monkish dreams, for legends of foolish, lying miracles, and other
   heathenish superstitions. It was by ignorance, I say, principally, that
   the people gave themselves up unto the power of seducers; which enabled
   the architects of the Roman apostasy to carry them into opinions, ways,
   and practices, suited unto their secular interest: and so sensible have
   they been of their advantage hereby, as that some of them have
   commended ignorance, as the most useful qualification of the people in
   religion!

   We may therefore well fix this as another cause, or occasion at least,
   of apostasy. When men are ignorant of the religion which themselves
   profess, as to its doctrines, and the principal grounds of them; when
   they are like the Samaritans, who understood not their own religious
   worship, which they had received by tradition, but "worshipped they
   knew not what," John iv. 22, -- they are no way able to defend
   themselves against the least impressions of seducers. They may plod on
   in the old track of some formal outward duties, but if any one meet
   them in their way, it is easy for him to turn them out of it. So the
   apostle, showing the danger that professors were in because of
   apostatical seducers, assigns the means of their preservation to be
   "the unction which they had received, whereby they knew all things," 1
   John ii. 19, 20, 27. Had they not been taught and instructed in the
   truth, they could not, at such a season, have persevered in the
   profession of the faith. Yea, such persons are very ready to think that
   there is something worthy their consideration in what is proposed unto
   them by the most corrupt seducers, whereas they have really found
   nothing in what themselves have so long professed; for no man can find
   any real benefit, profit, or advantage, in that whereof he is ignorant.
   So it is said that some by "good words and fair speeches deceive the
   hearts of the simple," Rom. xvi. 18. Every thing they say hath a
   plausible pretence and appearance unto persons under that character, so
   as that they are apt to be taken and pleased with it. Hence is that
   advice of the apostle unto them who design establishment in faith and
   order: "Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice
   be ye children, but in understanding be men," 1 Cor. xiv. 20. Teleioi
   ginesthe tais phresi, Be ye complete, perfect," well instructed in your
   minds, fully initiated into the doctrines of the gospel. Such the
   apostle calls teleious, "perfect men," 1 Cor. ii. 6; Heb. v. 14. Those
   who, in opposition hereunto, are "children," -- that is, weak and
   ignorant, -- will also be uncertain and unstable. They will be as
   children, "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
   doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they
   lie in wait to deceive," Eph. iv. 14.

   For let some crafty papal emissaries come among this sort of people,
   and let them confidently tell them that they neither have, nor ever
   will have, any benefit by the religion they profess, and that they have
   no evidence or assurance of the truth of it; -- they tell them no more
   but what they will know to be true if once they take it into
   consideration; for whereas they have seemed to be "always learning," by
   resorting to church, and the like outward means whereby religion is
   expressed, yet they "never came to the knowledge of the truth."
   Wherefore, when by any means they are put unto a stand, and are forced
   to consider themselves, they are amazed to find how little it is that
   they believe of the religion which they profess, or know of the ground
   of what they would be thought to believe.

   Let such persons add (as they will not fail to do) that with them of
   Rome is full assurance, that none ever mistook the way who accompanied
   them that are of the old religion, which their forefathers professed so
   many ages before this new-fangledness came up, which hath filled all
   things with confusion, disorder, sects, and divisions, whereas before
   all were of one mind (which was the most plausible argument of Paganism
   against Christianity), every troublesome personal circumstance of their
   present condition makes them inclinable to believe that it may be as
   they say. Let them tell them, moreover, of the power granted unto the
   priesthood of their church to pardon all sorts of sins; of the
   effectual intercession of saints and angels, among whom they may choose
   out particular patrons and guardians for themselves; of the mercy,
   grace, goodness, power, and interest in heaven of the blessed Virgin,
   all continually exercised in the behalf of Catholics; of the miracles
   that are daily wrought among them; of the wondrous sanctity and
   devotion which some among them have attained; -- they begin to think
   that there is somewhat in these things which they can feel or see,
   whereas in their own religion they can understand little or nothing at
   all. The "great things" of the gospel are "strange things" unto them;
   they neither do nor can understand them by all the diligence they think
   meet to use in this case. But the things now proposed unto them have
   the nature of tales, which the mind of man is accustomed unto, and apt
   both to receive and retain. And it is not imaginable how easy a
   transition will prove from a religion whereof men know little or
   nothing at all, unto that which at one view presents unto their fancies
   and senses all that they need believe or do that they may be eternally
   happy.

   Suppose one of another sort to come among such persons, and at once
   call them off from the profession of that religion which they pretend
   unto, confidently requiring them to attend wholly unto a light within
   them, which will be their guide and direct them unto God; -- they find
   by natural experience that there is some such light within them as that
   which he seems to propose unto them; for there is so in all men, as the
   apostle declares, even the light of conscience, accusing or excusing as
   unto sin or duty, Rom. ii. 14, 15. Having, therefore, by reason of
   their ignorance, no experience of any power or efficacy in that
   religion which themselves profess, they begin to think there is a
   reality in what is proposed unto them, and so are easily inveigled; for
   there is no security of his constancy for one moment, when a trial or
   temptation shall befall him, who hath not light or knowledge enough of
   the truth to give him some inward experience of the efficacy of what he
   doth profess.

   But it is no way necessary to insist any longer on that which is so
   evident, both in matter of fact and in the reasons of it. An apostasy
   from a traditional profession of those truths which indeed men
   understand not, is easy, and in a time of temptation unavoidable. In
   all ages, multitudes have thus perished for want of knowledge; for such
   persons are destitute of defence against any external cause or means of
   defection. They have nothing in their minds to oppose to force, nothing
   unto seductions or fraud, nothing to the examples of great leaders,
   nothing to conflict with the superstition of their own minds; and will
   therefore, when wind and tide suit the design, comply with any fair
   pretence for a revolt.

   And herein lieth no small part of the danger of the public profession
   of the protestant religion among us. By whose defect principally God
   knows, but it is incredible how stupidly ignorant multitudes are. Such
   there are who know no difference in religion, whilst the same names of
   God and Christ are commonly used, and the same places frequented for
   worship. Yet will this sort of men show great zeal and earnestness
   against Popery and other heresies! None more forward to revile,
   contemn, and prosecute them to their power; as ready as Mohammedans are
   to persecute Christians, or Papists sincere believers, and that on the
   same grounds. But if at any time they are put unto a stand, and
   necessitated to give an account unto themselves of the reason of their
   own religion, what it is they believe, and why they do so, their
   confidence will fail them, and, like unto men fallen into cross-paths
   and ways, they will not know what to do. And on such occasions they are
   the readiest of all men, in a kind of shame of themselves, to give up
   the religion which they have professed for any other, wherein it is
   promised they shall have more skill, and by which they may have some
   benefit, as it is pretended, whereas by their own they have had none at
   all.

   Whatever, therefore, is amongst us or elsewhere an occasion of
   ignorance among the people, it doth expose them unto a fatal defection
   from the truth If those upon whom it is incumbent to instruct them in
   the knowledge of the truths and mysteries of the gospel are unskillful
   or negligent in the discharge of their duty, they do what lieth in them
   to give them up bound hand and foot to the power of their spiritual
   adversaries; and they will be found chargeable with no less guilt who
   lay obstructions in the way of others who would willingly labour in the
   instruction of them unto their power. A man would think, from all
   circumstances, and all indications of the present inclinations of the
   minds of men, that it were the chief interest of all that really love
   the protestant religion to preserve its professors from apostasy or any
   disposition thereunto. That this will be done effectually without a
   continual instruction of them in the truths which are to be professed,
   with their grounds, reasons, and effects, is so fond an imagination as
   that it deserves no consideration. It is but to build castles in the
   air, to suppose that men will be kept constant in the profession of
   religion by outward laws, the observance of external forms, and the
   secular advantage of some persons by it, wherein they are not
   concerned. They will not be so, I say, when a trial shall befall them.
   There is no other means that is appointed of God, or is rational in
   itself, for the attaining of this end, but that those who are so
   concerned do what in them lies personally to instruct the people in the
   truth, encouraging them unto obedience by their own example; and to
   prevail with them who have the same design to be assisting with them
   therein. But to cry out of the great danger of protestant religion in
   the growth of Popery, and at the same time not only to be negligent
   themselves in the great duty of communicating the real effectual
   knowledge of it unto the souls of men, but also to lay needless
   obstructions in the way of others who would sincerely endeavour so to
   do, is an unaccountable solecism in religion. Either we are not in
   earnest in our pretended zeal for the truth and our fears of the
   prevalency of Popery, or we believe not that instruction in the truth
   is the only means to preserve men in the useful profession of it; which
   is to renounce the gospel and all rational consideration therewithal,
   or we are influenced by other things, which we far more esteem than
   evangelical truth and the purity of religion.

   The reformation of the church consisted principally in the deliverance
   of the people from darkness and ignorance; and if through our neglect
   they should be reduced again into the same state and condition, they
   would be a ready prey for the Papacy to seize upon. The advice of the
   apostle, as to the duty of all gospel ministers and officers in such a
   season as we are fallen into, is that alone which will preserve us, 2
   Tim. iv. 1-5.

   But it may be supposed that so much labour and diligence in the
   instruction and teaching of the people, as some assert, is altogether
   unnecessary. It is enough if they be taught what are the general
   principles of religion, and do thereon comply with the conduct of the
   church whereunto they do belong. Besides, if this burden be incumbent
   on the ministry, that those called thereunto are to have no relaxation
   from constant, sedulous "labouring in the word and doctrine," and are
   moreover required to exemplify what they teach in the whole course of
   their conversation, who would ever take upon him that office that can
   advantage himself in the world any other way? It must needs prove very
   burdensome if we have a religion that will not be preserved in the
   minds of men without all this constant., endless toil and labour. In
   the Roman church we see how easy a thing it is to keep up the people
   unto its profession, whilst the clergy are at liberty to pursue and use
   the pleasures and honours of this world, nor are any of them obliged
   unto those irksome and endless pains which we seem to require; yea,
   they find by experience that ignorance in the people is the best
   expedient to keep them in subjection to the priests, and then all
   things are secure. I wish that such thoughts as these do not influence
   the minds of some unto a readiness for a change, if so be it might be
   effected without hazard. But if more pains, diligence, labour, with
   perseverance therein, be required by us in the ministers of the gospel
   and guides of the church, than the Holy Ghost in the Scripture doth
   plainly, positively, frequently enjoin, let it be rejected and
   despised. Alas! the best of us, of all that are alive, do come short in
   many things of the rules and examples that are proposed unto us
   therein, nor do I know on what grounds or by what measures the most of
   us do intend to give in our accounts at the last day. Nor is there any
   more impious opinion, nor more contradictory to the gospel, than that
   it is enough for the people to be instructed only in the general
   principles of religion, without any farther improvement or growth in
   knowledge: for those who are thus called "The people" are, I suppose,
   esteemed Christians, -- that is, disciples of Jesus Christ, and members
   of his mystical body; and if they are so, their growth in
   understanding, their edification in knowledge, their being carried on
   unto perfection, their acquaintance with the whole counsel of God, with
   the mysteries of his love and grace in Christ Jesus, are as necessary
   for them as the "saving of their souls," indispensably depending
   thereon, can render them. And if we will be ministers of the gospel, it
   will not be best for us to prescribe unto ourselves our rules and
   measures of duty. It will be our wisdom to accept of that office on the
   terms limited by the Holy Ghost, or utterly to let it alone. And we
   must know, that the more exactly our profession is suited unto the
   gospel, the less mixture there is in it of any thing human, the more
   difficult it is thoroughly to instruct men in the knowledge of it. The
   mind of man is far more apt and able to comprehend and retain fables,
   errors, and superstitions, than evangelical truths. The former are
   natural unto it; against the latter it hath a dislike and enmity, until
   they are removed by grace. Hence, some will make a more appearing
   proficiency in a false religion in four or five days than others will
   do in the knowledge of the truth almost in so many years. We may have
   well-grown Papists in a month's time, that shall be expert in the
   mysteries of their devotion; and there is another profession that two
   or three days will bring men unto a perfection in: but slow is the
   progress of most in learning the truth and mysteries of the gospel. If
   peculiar diligence and constant sedulity be not used in their
   instruction, they will be made a prey unto the next opportunity for a
   defection from the truth.

Chapter VI.

   Pride and vanity of mind, sloth and negligence, love of the world,
   causes of apostasy -- The work of Satan, and judgments of God in this
   matter.

   III. The innate pride and vanity of the minds of men is another means
   whereby they are disposed and inclined unto an apostasy from the
   profession of evangelical truth. With respect hereunto the design and
   work of the gospel is, to "cast down imaginations, and every high thing
   that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God," taught therein,
   "bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ," 2
   Cor. x. 4, 5. The mind of man is naturally lifted up with high thoughts
   in itself and of itself. That it is sufficient unto all the ends of its
   being, all the duties of its condition, without any special aid or
   assistance from above, is the prevailing principle whereby it is acted.
   Men do not only by nature say, "With our tongue will we prevail; our
   lips are our own: who is lord over us?" Ps. xii. 4, -- "We have a
   sovereignty over all our outward actions;" but also, that nothing is,
   or can, or ought to be required of us, but what we have power in
   ourselves to comprehend, comply withal, and perform. This in all ages
   of the church, under various forms and pretences, hath been contended
   for. The true state of all controversies about the powers of nature and
   grace is this, That, on the one hand, the minds and wills of men are
   asserted to be self-sufficient as to internal abilities unto all duties
   of obedience necessary unto eternal blessedness; on the other, that we
   have no sufficiency of ourselves, but that all our sufficiency is of
   God. See 2 Cor. iii. 5, ix. 8. This principle, which sprung immediately
   out of that pride whereby, aiming at an enlargement of our
   self-sufficiency, we utterly lost what we had, was never yet rooted out
   of the minds of the generality of professed Christians.

   In all things the mind of man would be its own measure, guide, and
   rule, continually teeming with these two evils:--

   1. It exalts imaginations of its own, which it loves, applauds, dotes
   on, and adheres unto. This is the original of heresy, this hath given
   birth, growth, and progress, to error; for "God hath made man upright,
   but they have sought out many inventions," Eccles. vii. 29. Seeking out
   and exalting inventions of our own, in things spiritual and religious,
   is the principal and most pernicious consequent of our fall from that
   state of uprightness wherein of God we were created.

   2. It makes itself the sole and absolute judge of what is divinely
   proposed unto it, whether it be true or false, good or evil, to be
   received or rejected, without desire or expectation of any supernatural
   guidance or assistance; and whatever is unsuited unto its own
   prejudicate imaginations, it is ready to scorn and despise.

   That, therefore, which we are now to demonstrate is, that where this
   pride and principle are predominant, where the one is not mortified by
   grace nor the other eradicated by spiritual light, there men can never
   receive the truths of the gospel in a due manner, and are ready to
   renounce them when they have by any means been brought unto the
   profession of them for a season; for, --

   The gospel, -- that is, the doctrines of it and truths contained in it,
   -- is proposed unto us in the name and on the authority of God, having
   his image and superscription upon it. It hath such impressions of
   divine wisdom, goodness, grace, holiness, and power upon it, as
   manifests it to be the "glorious gospel of the blessed God," 1 Tim. i.
   11. Hence it ought to be received with a holy reverence, with a due
   sense of the glory of God, and as his voice speaking unto us from
   heaven. Hence is the caution of the apostle, that we would "not refuse"
   or "turn away from him that speaketh from heaven," Heb. xii. 25.
   Without this it will never be duly received, truly understood, nor
   steadfastly believed. It is not to be received as "the word of men, but
   as it is in truth, the word of God," 1 Thess. ii. 13. It must be
   received with that frame of spirit, with that submission, that
   subjection of soul and conscience, which becomes poor worms of the
   earth when they have to do with the great and holy God, expressed Gen.
   xviii. 27. So our Saviour tells us that "unless we be converted, and
   become as little children, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
   Unless we deny ourselves and all our own imaginations, unless we become
   humble and teachable, we can never arrive at a useful acquaintance with
   the mysteries of it. And he convinced the learned Pharisees that by
   reason of their pride, vain-glory, and hypocrisy, they could not
   perceive or understand the doctrine which he taught.

   God promiseth that he will teach the meek or humble in judgment: "The
   meek will he teach his way," Ps. xxv. 9. "The secret of the Lord is
   with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant," verse 14.
   "Whom shall he teach knowledge? whom shall he make to understand
   doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the
   breasts," Isa. xxviii. 9. Unless men become as weaned children, as
   David affirms of himself, Ps. cxxxi. 2, when "his heart was not
   haughty, nor his eyes lofty," verse 1, God will not teach them. There
   is, therefore, no such effectual obstruction of divine teachings as the
   pride of men's minds, which is utterly inconsistent with them. Hence it
   is that men come with carnal confidence in themselves, the ability and
   sagacity of their own minds, to the consideration of the gospel and the
   things contained in it, without the least peculiar awe or reverence of
   God from whom it is; and hence do they suppose themselves, without more
   ado, competent judges of the mind of the Holy Ghost in all divine
   revelations. Can men who have once read the Scripture imagine that this
   is the way to learn heavenly truth or to partake of the teachings of
   God? Will the same frame of spirit suffice them in this design as that
   which they have when they are exercised about their other occasions?
   When we consider how men for the most part learn the truth, we need not
   wonder to see how easily they unlearn and forsake it. If the truth at
   any time be entertained by a soul whose mind is unhumbled and whose
   affections are unmortified, it is a troublesome inmate, and will, on
   the first occasion, be parted withal. It is true, we ought to employ
   the utmost of our rational abilities in the investigation of sacred
   truth; but yet if therein we follow the conduct of our own minds,
   diving perhaps into subtilties and niceties, forsaking a humble
   dependence on the teachings of God, it may be under apprehensions of
   singular wisdom, we betray ourselves into ruinous folly. This was that
   which corrupted all the endeavours of the schoolmen, and left them, in
   the height of their inquiries, to wax vain in their imaginations. The
   way of handling spiritual things in a spiritual manner, in the words
   which the Holy Ghost teacheth, -- that is, not with curious, subtile
   reasonings and inventions of carnal, unsanctified minds, but with that
   evidence and plainness in argumentation, suited practically to affect
   the minds and consciences of men, which the Scripture giveth us both
   example and rule for, -- was despised by them; but they came to the
   study of sacred things with their minds stuffed and prepossessed with
   philosophical notions and conceptions, with sophisms, distinctions, and
   various expressions of the serpentine wits of men, which they mixed
   with divinity, or the doctrine of the Scripture, woefully corrupting,
   debasing, and perverting it thereby. Most of their disputes were such
   as had never had foundation nor occasion in the world, if Aristotle had
   not invented some odd terms and distinctions, remote from the common
   understanding and reason of men wiser than himself. To inquire into
   divine revelation with a holy, humble frame of heart, waiting and
   praying for divine teaching and illumination of mind, that themselves
   might be made wise in the knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel, and
   able to instruct others in the knowledge and fear of God, it never came
   into their minds; but being furnished and puffed up with a conceit of
   their own sagacity, philosophical ability, and disputing faculty,
   harnessed with syllogisms, distinctions, solutions, and most
   preposterous methods of craft, they came with boldness on Christian
   religion, and forming it to their own imaginations, dressing it up and
   exposing of it in foolish terms of art, under a semblance of wondrous
   subtilty they wholly corrupted it, and drew off the minds of men from
   the simplicity of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. Not one article
   of religion did this proud, self-conceited generation of men leave,
   that (whether their conclusions were true or false about it) any man
   could come to the understanding of it who had not been a better
   proficient in the school of Aristotle than of Christ. To believe and
   teach the doctrine of the Scripture, though with sound reason and
   judgment, and in the way of the Scripture to affect the minds and
   consciences of men, without their philosophical notions, niceties, and
   distinctions, whereby they had carved a corrupt, depraved, monstrous
   image of all things, and the knowledge of them, was, among them, to be
   a heretic or a blockhead. By the pride, confidence, and pretended
   subtilty of these men was religion totally corrupted, and the fountains
   poisoned from whence others sought for the waters of the sanctuary.
   Even what was left of truth among them was so debased, so divested of
   its native heavenly glory, beauty, and majesty, was rendered so
   deformed and unsuited unto that spiritual light wherein alone it can be
   usefully discerned, as to render it altogether useless and
   inefficacious unto its proper ends. Nor are we ever in more danger to
   subduct ourselves from under the teachings of God than when we lean
   unto our own understandings in our inquiries into spiritual things, so
   as to forget that humble, lowly frame of heart wherein alone we are
   meet to be taught or to learn in a due manner. And this is one way
   whereby men, through the innate pride of their minds, are obstructed in
   the receiving and disposed unto the relinquishment of evangelical
   truths.

   Again; it is confessed that there is nothing proposed unto us in the
   gospel that is contrary unto reason, as reason is the due comprehension
   and measure of things as they are in their own nature; for how should
   there be so, seeing it is in itself the principal external effect of
   the reason or wisdom of God, which hath given unto all things their
   natures, properties, and measures? But yet there are things revealed in
   it which are above the comprehension of reason, as planted in the
   finite, limited understanding of man; nor is the ground hereof the
   accidental corruption of our nature, but the essential constitution of
   its being. There are, I say, divine mysteries in the gospel whose
   revelation we may understand, but the nature of the things themselves
   we cannot comprehend. And this reason itself cannot but acknowledge;
   for whereas it knows itself to be finite, limited, and bounded, how
   should it be able perfectly to comprehend things infinite, or all the
   effects of infinite wisdom? "Can we by searching find out God? can we
   find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is high as heaven; what can
   we dot deeper than hell; what can we know? The measure thereof is
   longer than the earth, and broader than the sea," Job xi. 7-9. These
   things so exceed the natural and duly proportionate objects of our
   understandings as that we cannot find them out to perfection. The
   reason of man hath nothing here to do, but humbly to comply with the
   revelations that are made of them.

   Moreover, there are in the gospel things that are unsuited, yea,
   contradictory unto reason as it is corrupted. Reason in us is now no
   longer to be considered merely as it is finite and limited, but as, in
   the subject and exercise of it, it is impaired, depraved, and
   corrupted. To deny this, is to deny the fundamental principle and
   supposition that, in all things, the gospel proceedeth on; that is,
   that Jesus Christ came into the world to restore and repair our nature.
   In this state, as it is unable of itself to discern and judge of
   spiritual things in a due manner, so it is apt to frame unto itself
   vain imaginations, and to be prepossessed with innumerable prejudices,
   contrary unto what the gospel doth teach and require; and whatever it
   doth so fancy or frame, the mind esteems as proper acts and effects of
   reason as any it exerciseth or is capable of.

   With respect unto both these, -- namely, the weakness of reason as it
   is finite and limited, and the depravation of reason as it is
   corrupted, -- it is the design of the gospel to bring every thought
   into captivity unto the obedience of faith; for, --

   1. As to the former, it requires men to believe things above their
   reason, merely on the authority of divine revelation. Things they must
   believe which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have they
   entered into the heart of man to conceive;" only they are "revealed
   unto us by the Spirit," 1 Cor. ii. 9, 10. It will not admit of an
   inquiry how those things may be which the mouth of the Lord hath
   spoken. The sense and meaning of the revelation it may inquire into,
   but cannot comprehend the things revealed. "Nobis curiositate opus non
   est post Jesum Christum, nec inquisitione post evangelium; cum credimus
   nihil desideramus ultra credere, hoc enim prius credimus, non esse quod
   ultra credere debemus," Tertull. Præscrip. adv. Hæres. And when of old
   the wise, the scribes, the disputers of this world, would not submit
   hereunto, under the supposed conduct of their reason, they fell into
   the most brutish unreasonableness, in judging the wisdom of God to be
   folly and his power to be weakness, 1 Cor. i. 18-25. And it is an
   unparalleled attempt of atheism which some in our days (who would yet
   be accounted Christians) have engaged in; -- they would exalt
   philosophy or human reason into a right of judicature over all divine
   revelations. Nothing must be supposed to be contained in them but what
   is measurable by its principles and rules. What pretends to be above
   them, they say ought to be rejected; which is to make itself infinite,
   or the wisdom and understanding of God finite and limited. Wherefore,
   as to the things that are revealed in the gospel, because many of them
   are absolutely above the comprehension of our minds or reasons, they
   are not the judges of them, but are the servants of faith only in
   bearing witness unto them; for "the things of a man knoweth the spirit
   of man which is in him; but the things of God knoweth no man, but the
   Spirit of God," 1 Cor. ii. 11. In brief, to affirm that we can be
   obliged to believe no more than we can comprehend, or nothing but what
   we can perfectly understand the nature of in itself, or that we may
   reject what is really above reason, on a supposition that it is
   contrary unto reason, is to renounce the gospel, and therewith all
   divine revelations. And this is spoken not of reason as it is
   corrupted, but merely as it is human reason, finite and limited.

   2. As in things infinite, spiritual, and heavenly, the gospel proposeth
   unto men things quite above their comprehension, supposing their reason
   to be pure and incorrupted, only allowing it to be that which is finite
   and limited; so in things which practically respect the obedience of
   faith which it doth require, it prescribeth things contrary unto our
   natural conceptions, or reason as it is in us depraved: for the natural
   conceptions of our minds about religious duties and the way of living
   unto God are all of them suited unto the covenant of works, for they
   are the effects of the remainders of that light which did direct us to
   walk with God thereby. But hereunto the disposal of things in the
   covenant of grace is diametrically opposed, so that their accounts will
   never intermix, Rom. xi. 6; yea, the carnal mind, -- that is, reason as
   it is corrupted, -- acts its contradiction unto the will of God as
   revealed in the gospel with enmity and hatred, chap. viii. 7. And [as]
   for those duties which are suited unto the light of nature, the gospel
   doth so change them, with the respect it gives them unto the mediation
   of Christ and the efficiency of the Holy Spirit, as that corrupted
   reason defies them, being so qualified, as foreign unto its
   conceptions. The duties themselves it can approve of, but not of their
   respect unto Jesus Christ, whereunto they are disposed by the gospel.

   Hence it is that of old those who pretended such an absolute
   sovereignty of their own reason as to admit of nothing as truth but
   what its dictates complied withal, were of all men the slowest to
   receive and the forwardest to oppose the mysteries of the gospel;
   because they were above it in some things, and contrary unto it in
   more, as it is in most things corrupted, they looked on them as folly,
   and so despised them. This the apostle declares and records, 1 Cor. i.
   2. Especially was it so among them who, unto the vain imaginations
   wherein in general "their foolish heart was darkened," had superadded
   some peculiar sect in philosophy which was of reputation among the wise
   men of the world; for they conceived and maintained all the maxims of
   their sect as the absolute dictates of right reason, though most of
   them were foolish fancies, either taken up by tradition or
   sophistically imposed on their understandings. Hence, every thing that
   was contrary unto such principles or inconsistent with them, they
   looked on as opposite unto reason, and so despised it. Nor is it much
   otherwise at this day with many Christians, who make the traditional
   principles of their sect or party the rule whereby every thing that is
   in religion proposed unto them may be examined. Thus, though the
   generality of philosophers and wise men at Athens rejected the doctrine
   of the apostle, yet were there none so forward and fierce in their
   opposition unto him, so contemptuously proud in their censures of him,
   as were the Epicureans and Stoics, Acts xvii. 18; and the reason hereof
   was, because the doctrine which he taught was eminently contrary to the
   maxims of their peculiar sects: for whereas the Epicureans denied the
   providence of God in the government of the world, the existence of the
   souls of men after this life, all eternal rewards or punishments, there
   was no admission of any one word of the apostle's doctrine without a
   renunciation of all their impious sentiments, and so the ruin of their
   sect. And as for the Stoics, the fundamental principle of their
   philosophy was, that a man should look for all blessedness or happiness
   in and from himself alone, and from the things that were in his own
   power, as being every way sufficient unto himself for that end. All
   that the apostle taught concerning the mediation of Christ and the
   grace of God by him was also diametrically opposite unto this
   principle. Wherefore those of these two sects opposed him in a peculiar
   manner, not only from the pride and darkness that are naturally in the
   minds of men, and are improved by the advancement of corrupted reason
   above its own proper place and dignity, but from the prejudicate
   opinions which, on the reputation of their sects, they adhered unto, as
   assured dictates of right reason in general. And when some such persons
   as these afterward, upon a general conviction of its truth, took upon
   them a profession of the gospel, they were the men who corrupted its
   principal mysteries by their vain philosophy, as the apostle intimates,
   Col. ii. 8. So Tertullian, "Hæreses a philosophia subornantur. Inde
   Æones et formæ, et nescio quæ, et Trinitas hominum apud Valentinum,
   [qui] Platonicus fuerat. Inde Marcionis Deus melior de tranquillitate,
   a Stoicis venerat; et ubi anima interire dicatur ab Epicuræis
   observatur; et ut carnis restitutio negatur, de una omnium
   philosophorum schola sumitur."

   We may apply these things unto our present purpose. The design of the
   gospel, in all its especial truths and mysteries, is to bring every
   thought into subjection unto the obedience of faith. Hence is that
   direction which flesh and blood will never comply withal, "If any man
   among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that
   he may be wise," 1 Cor. iii. 18. Unless men renounce their carnal
   wisdom, in all its principles, effects, and operations, they will never
   become wise with that wisdom which is from above; and he who knoweth
   not what it is so to become a fool, be he who he will, was never yet
   wise towards God. Wherefore, when men have taken on them the outward
   profession of the gospel, they begin to find, upon inquiry, that the
   mysteries and principles of its doctrine are unsuited unto the natural
   pride of their minds, and inconsistent with that absolute sovereignty
   which they would in all things give unto their own reason. Hereon "many
   inventions are sought out" to cast off the yoke of faith, and to
   re-enthrone reason in the room thereof; -- not that men depart from the
   faith with this express design, but this is that which secretly
   influenceth them thereunto. Hence the generality of those who forsake
   the truth on this ground and occasion are such as, trusting too soon to
   their own rational abilities, having neither will, nor humility, nor
   industry to inquire into the principles and reasons of truth in a due
   manner, do give up themselves unto the conduct and teaching of others,
   who have invented opinions more suited unto the innate pride of their
   minds and carnal reasonings; and some, by an over-earnest pursuit of
   the workings of their own rational faculties in spiritual things,
   having subducted their minds from that humble frame wherein alone they
   are capable of divine teaching, are betrayed into the same miscarriage.
   All ancient heresies sprung from this root, yea, those of them which
   are most absurd and foolish, and most diametrically opposite unto right
   reason, arose from a pretence thereof: for when men will have reason to
   have an absolute supremacy in religion, it is unavoidable but they must
   judge that their own is the reason which is intended; and that some may
   be led hereby into very foolish imaginations is easy to be conjectured,
   unless we shall suppose all men to be equally wise and sober.

   I shall briefly exemplify these things in one instance, and that in a
   prevalent apostasy from the truth, and which at present is visibly
   progressive in the world; this is that of Socinianism. And I shall give
   an instance herein, because the poison of it is highly efficacious
   where it meets with the complexion and constitution of mind before
   described, and is more diffused than many are aware of: for although
   the name of it be generally condemned, and there are some opinions
   comprised under it whose profession is inconsistent with the interest
   of the most, yet all those deviations from the truth which we have
   amongst us, under several denominations, are emanations from that
   corrupt fountain; yea, the whole of it being a system of opinions
   craftily suited unto the first notions and conceptions of corrupted
   reason, and the inbred pride of men's minds, in them who on any account
   own divine revelation, the first proposal of them finds ready
   entertainment with many of those whose souls are not prepared and
   fortified against them by a spiritual experience of the excellency,
   power, and efficacy, of the mysteries of the gospel. They no sooner
   hear of them but they know they express what they would have, as
   gratifying all the corrupt desires and carnal reasonings of their
   minds.

   There are, as was observed before, two sorts of things in the doctrines
   of the gospel:-- 1. Such as are above the comprehension and measure of
   reason in its best condition, as it is in us limited and confined; 2.
   Such as are contrary unto it as corrupted and depraved. And unto these
   two heads is this kind of apostasy reducible.

   1. What is above reason, incomprehensible by it, those of this way do
   absolutely reject. Such are the doctrines of the Trinity and of the
   incarnation of the Son of God. Because the things taught in these
   doctrines are not comprehensible by their reason, they conclude that
   they are repugnant unto right reason. And by others the same doctrines
   are refused, as not compliant with the light that is within them; for
   the existence of the divine nature in three distinct persons, with the
   hypostatical union of the natures of God and man in the same person,
   they cannot acknowledge. These things, so fully, so plainly, so
   frequently revealed and asserted in the Scripture, so attested by the
   primitive catholic church, are rejected on no other reason but that
   they are against reason; nor is there any pretence that they are so,
   but because they are above it. When they have puzzled themselves with
   Nicodemus' question, "How can these things be?" they peremptorily deny
   their existence, because they cannot comprehend the manner of it.

   2. As unto those things which are contrary unto reason as corrupted,
   these they deprave and wrest unto a compliance therewithal. So they
   deal with the doctrines of the attributes of God, of his eternal
   decrees, of the office and mediation of Christ, of justification by his
   righteousness, of the power and efficacy of the grace of the Holy
   Spirit in the conversion of sinners, and of the resurrection of the
   dead. Because they cannot bring their reason as corrupted and depraved
   unto a compliance with these truths, they will force, hale, torture,
   and rack the truths themselves, to bring them into slavery unto their
   own reasons, or carnal, fleshly conceptions of spiritual things; for,
   allowing the words, terms, and propositions wherein they are expressed,
   they put absurd senses upon them, destructive unto the faith and
   contrary to the whole scope and design of the Scripture. So do they
   endeavour expressly to bring every divine revelation into captivity
   unto the bondage of their own perverse reasonings and imaginations.

   It is, therefore, evident that this kind of apostasy springs from no
   other root but the pride of the minds of men, refusing to admit of
   evangelical truths on the mere authority of divine revelation, where
   they are above reason as it is limited, or contrary unto it as
   corrupted. On these terms the gospel can nowhere keep its station, nor
   will it forego its prerogative by subjecting itself to be tried by
   these uncertain measures or weighed in these uneven, tottering
   balances. The humble, the meek, the teachable, those who are made free
   and willing to captivate their understandings unto the obedience of
   faith, are those alone with whom it will abide and continue.

   But it may be said, that, this being only one private heresy, of no
   great extent or acceptation in the world, there is no danger of any
   influence from it unto a more general defection. So, it may be, it
   seems unto many; but I must acknowledge myself to be otherwise minded,
   and that for two reasons:--

   1. Because of the advance which it maketh every day in the addition of
   new, bold, proud imaginations unto what it hath already made its
   successful attempts in: for, in the pursuit of the same principles with
   those of the men of this way and persuasion, not a few begin absolutely
   to submit the Scripture, and every thing contained in it, to the
   judgment and sentence of their own reason; which is the true form and
   spirit of Socinianism, visibly acting itself with some more than
   ordinary confidence. What is suited unto their reason they will
   receive, and what is not so, let it be affirmed a hundred times in the
   Scripture, they will reject with the same ease and confidence as if
   they were imaginations of men like themselves. Both books that are
   written unto this purpose, and the common discourses of many, do fully
   testify unto this advance of the pride of the minds of men; and he is
   careless about these things who seeth not that the next stage is
   downright atheism. This is that dunghill which such blazing exhalations
   of pride do at last fall into. And herein do many countenance
   themselves with a false and foolish pretence that all those whom they
   differ from are fanatical enemies of reason, when they ascribe unto it
   all that any man in his wits can so do who believeth divine revelation,
   and doth not absolutely disavow the corruption of nature by the fall.

   2. The poison of these principles is greatly diffused in the world; for
   hence it is that all those doctrines of the gospel which have any thing
   of spiritual mystery in them, which are constituent principles of, or
   do any way belong unto, the covenant of grace, and so not absolutely
   reconcilable unto reason as corrupt and carnal, are by many so laden
   with contempt and scorn that it is sufficient to expose any man unto
   the contumelies of "ignorant, irrational, and foolish," who dares to
   avow them. Such are the doctrines of eternal predestination, of the
   total corruption of the nature of men as unto spiritual things by the
   fall, of the power and efficacy of the grace of God in the conversion
   of sinners, of the nature and necessity of regeneration, of union with
   Christ, of justification by the imputation of his righteousness, of the
   nature of internal, inherent righteousness or evangelical holiness, of
   the necessity of continual supplies of the Spirit in actual grace unto
   all duties of obedience, of the power of the Holy Ghost evidencing the
   divine authority of the Scriptures in and by themselves, with sundry
   others. Many can see no reason for the admittance of these things, or
   they cannot see the reason of them; and therefore, although they are
   fully and plainly declared in the Scriptures, yet are they, by no small
   generation among us, so derided and exploded as that the very names of
   them are grown into contempt. But why all this scorn, all this
   severity? Men may do well to consider, that not long since all the
   prelates of England owned those doctrines as articles of faith which
   now they so deride; and although they are not obliged by any divine
   precept to be of the same judgment with them because it was theirs, yet
   it may be they are under some obligation from the laws of the land not
   to renounce the ancient doctrines of the church, and are certainly
   bound by the laws of Christian modesty and sobriety not to vilify and
   scorn the doctrines they owned, and all that do profess them.

   But it is warrant sufficient unto some for the utmost detestation of
   any principles in religion, that they have a seeming incompliance with
   their reason, though apparently corrupted by prejudice and weakened by
   ignorance. Hence they will not admit that there can be a consistency
   between the unchangeableness of God's decrees and the freedom of our
   wills; that justification by the blood of Christ doth not render our
   own obedience needless; that the efficacy of God's grace and the
   necessity of our duty are reconcilable. And herein they seem to take
   along with them, as their security, these two principles, seeing
   without them they have no foundation to build upon:--

   (1.) That reason as it acts in them is the same with right reason in
   general, -- that whatever respect is due to the one is so to the other.
   It were well, in the meantime, if prejudices, corrupt affections, and
   gross ignorance, did not, on great variety of occasions, manifest
   themselves among this sort of persons; and not only so, but such a
   course of conversation among some of them as none can think consistent
   with the divine teachings who believe the Scriptures. But it is so come
   to pass, that all that humility, meekness, self-diffidence, all that
   conscientious fear of sinning and practice of holiness, which the word
   of God makes so necessary unto them who would learn the truth as it is
   in Jesus, are by many (puffed up with a conceit of their own ability to
   know all things) utterly disregarded.

   (2.) That there is no time or instance wherein those thoughts which
   seem to us most rational are to be captivated unto the obedience of
   faith; and yet without this there is no true knowledge of the mind of
   God in the gospel to be attained. What such principles will carry men
   out unto in religion were easy to conjecture, if experience did not
   render conjecture useless in this case.

   Wherefore, this pride of the minds of men, refusing to bow or subject
   themselves unto the authority of divine revelation, designing to exalt
   self, in its intellectual and moral abilities, in its powers to know
   what it should and do what it ought, hath in all ages been a great
   principle of opposition unto and apostasy from evangelical truth: nor
   was it ever more rampant than in the days wherein we live; for besides
   that it hath openly spawned that whole brood of errors which some
   entire sects do espouse, it diffuseth itself in its effects among all
   sorts of professors of Christianity. An humble subjection of mind and
   conscience unto the authority of God in his word, -- which alone, upon
   trial, will be found to answer the experience of believers, -- is the
   only security against this distemper. This we may, this we ought to,
   pray for, not only for ourselves, but that it might be given of God
   unto them who scarce believe that God gives any thing that is spiritual
   and supernatural unto the souls of men, in any such way as that the
   effect should depend on the efficiency of grace, and not on their own
   wills.

   Unto this pride, as inseparable from it, we may adjoin that vanity and
   curiosity that are in the minds of men. These are those which the
   apostle marketh under the outward sign and effect of them, namely,
   "itching ears," 2 Tim. iv. 3; for hence an inclination and hankering of
   mind after things novel, vain, and curious, doth arise. Under the power
   of these affections, men "cannot endure sound doctrine,'' nor will
   abide in the simplicity of the gospel They know not how to be wise unto
   sobriety, and to keep their speculations about spiritual things within
   the bounds of sober modesty; but they are still intruding themselves
   into things they have not seen, being vainly puffed up by their own
   fleshly minds, Col. ii. 18. And as this curiosity hath produced many of
   these needless, vain opinions, subtle, nice, philosophical disputations
   and distinctions, wherewith some have filled religion; so from the
   uncured vanity of mind doth proceed that levity and inconstancy which
   are in many, whereby they are "tossed to and fro with every wind of
   doctrine" that blows upon them, from the "cunning sleights of men who
   lie in wait to deceive."

   Unto all we may add carnal pride and ambition (where the outward
   affairs of the church or the profession of religion are accompanied
   with such secular advantages of wealth, honour, and rule, as to stir up
   envy and emulation among men of earthly minds); which, as they have
   occasioned many scandalous outrages in religion, so they have been the
   rise and occasion of many heresies also.

   IV. Careless security and groundless confidences do betray men into
   apostasies from the gospel when unexpected trials do befall them. To
   give evidence hereunto we may do well to consider the things that
   ensue:--

   1. The Holy Spirit hath sufficiently warned us all that defections and
   backslidings from the truth would fall out among the professors of it.
   This hath been already abundantly manifested in the express instances
   of such warnings and predictions before produced and insisted on. And
   there is in the word a vehement application made of all these warnings
   unto us and our duties. Hence are those exhortations and precepts
   multiplied, to "watch," to "stand fast in the faith," to "be strong and
   quit ourselves like men" in this matter. Nothing but a diligent
   attendance unto all gospel duties and a vigorous acting of all gospel
   graces will preserve us, if the Scripture may be believed. And as for
   those by whom these things are despised, it is no matter at all what
   religion they are of.

   2. We are foretold and forewarned of the great danger that will attend
   the professors of the gospel when such a season of apostasy shall by
   any means come upon them. So prevalent shall the means of it be as that
   many shall be deceived, and if it were possible even the elect
   themselves, Matt. xxiv. 11, 24. Such a season is an "hour of temptation
   that cometh on all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth,"
   Rev. iii. 10; and the woful event in them that shall be overtaken with
   the power of it, in their utter and eternal destruction, is in many
   instances set before us.

   3. It is also plainly intimated that such a season of the prevalency of
   a defection from the truth shall be a time of great security among the
   generality of professed Christians. Churches shall be asleep, persons
   shall cry, "Peace, peace," when that day cometh as a snare.

   We are not, therefore, left without sufficient warning in this case,
   both of the certainty of our trial, the greatness of our concernment,
   and the danger of security; and yet, notwithstanding all these means of
   excitation unto a vigorous attendance unto our condition, danger, and
   duty, it is evident unto every discerning eye how desperately secure
   are the generality of professors of the gospel with respect unto this
   evil and the consequents of it. Nothing can awake them unto the
   consideration of their own state, although their neighbours' houses are
   set on fire from hell. Love of the world, with prosperity and ease, on
   the one hand, or the cares and businesses of it on the other, do so
   take up the minds of men that they are not sensible of any concernment
   in these things. And we may briefly consider the various ways whereby
   this security puts forth its efficacy in disposing men unto apostasy
   when they fall into the occasions of it:--

   (1.) It doth so by possessing and overpowering them with a proud,
   careless, supine negligence. Men hear of this evil and the danger of
   it, but, like Gallio, they "care for none of these things." They know
   not of any concernment they have in them, nor of any need they have to
   provide against them. Unto some others, perhaps, these things may
   belong, but unto them not at all. Those who would press them on their
   minds and consciences they look on as persons causelessly importunate,
   or troubled with groundless suspicions and fears. If there be any
   danger about religion, they doubt not but sooner or later provision
   will be made against it by law; but as unto any special duty incumbent
   on themselves with respect unto their own souls, they know nothing of
   it, nor will consider it, Had not the world been asleep in this
   security, had not men been utterly regardless of their interest in the
   truth, it had not been possible that religion should have been so
   totally corrupted as it was in the Papacy, and yet so few take any
   notice thereof. At some seasons God raised up among them witnesses for
   the truth, who not only declared and professed it, but also sealed
   their confession with their blood; but the generality of Christians
   were so far from being excited thereby to the consideration of their
   own concern and duty as that they opposed and persecuted them unto
   destruction, as the disturbers of the public tranquillity. And it is no
   otherwise at this day. Many complain of, more fear, a defection from
   the gospel. It is also evident in how many things the doctrine of it is
   already by some corrupted by whom it was formerly professed. Instances
   of as great apostasies as the name of Christianity is capable of are
   multiplied among us; and yet how few are there that do at all regard
   these things, or once consider what is either their duty or their
   danger in such a season!

   (2.) It worketh and is effectual by a wicked indifferency as unto all
   things in religion. Men under the power of this security neither see,
   nor will understand, nor can be made sensible of, the difference that
   is between truth and error, piety and superstition, so as to value one
   more than another. "It is all religion, and it is no more but so. If
   persons change from one way to another, so as they do not utterly
   renounce Jesus Christ, they may be saved in the way they betake
   themselves unto." The profession of such persons attends on all
   occasions, and an apostasy from the mysteries of the gospel will be but
   a useful compliance with opportunity.

   We judge no men, no party of men, as to their eternal state and
   condition, upon the account of their outward profession in religion,
   unless they are open idolaters or flagitious in their lives God only
   knows how it is between him and their souls The framing of churches (as
   the church of Rome) according unto men's minds, fancies, opinions, or
   interests, and then confining salvation unto them, is an effect of
   pride and folly, as contradictory to the gospel as any thing that can
   be imagined. But yet there is a wide difference to be made between
   apostates and others. "Better men had never known the way of
   righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
   commandment." Those who have been instructed in the truth of the
   gospel, and have made profession of it, are for the most part acted by
   such depraved principles, moved by such corrupt lusts, and do show so
   much ingratitude against the Lord Jesus Christ in their defection,
   "denying the Lord that bought them," that they put a peculiar character
   and mark upon themselves; and although we will not judge any, yet is it
   our duty to put men in remembrance of the danger that attends such
   apostasies. So the apostle expressly tells the Galatians, that upon
   their admittance of legal ceremonies, and falling from the grace of the
   gospel in the one point of justification, "Christ should profit them
   nothing," or they should have no benefit by what they yet retained of
   the profession of the gospel, chap. v. 2-6. And as to those who are
   carried away by the "strong delusion" of the grand apostasy, foretold 2
   Thess. ii. 3-12, he says plainly that "they shall be damned," verse 12;
   and Peter also affirms that those who introduce "damnable heresies'' do
   bring on themselves, and those that follow their pernicious ways,
   "swift destruction," 2 Pet. ii. 1, 2. So little countenance doth the
   Scripture give unto this effect of cursed security.

   (3.) It likewise worketh by vain confidences. Most men think with
   Peter, and on no better grounds than he did (nor so good neither, as
   not being conscious unto themselves of so much sincerity as he was),
   that though all men should forsake the truth and purity of religion,
   yet they will not do so. But they understand not at all what it is to
   be preserved in an hour of temptation, nor what is required thereunto.
   They scorn to fall away, and yet they scorn all the means whereby they
   may be preserved from so doing. Tell them that they stand in need of
   the power of God for their preservation, of the intercession of Christ,
   of the constant supplies of the Spirit, of an experience of the
   goodness and efficacy of the truth, with the benefits which their own
   souls have received thereby; and that for this end they are to watch,
   pray, and live in a constant attendance unto all evangelical duties;
   and they despise them all through their pride, or neglect them through
   their spiritual sloth that they are given up unto. Such persons as
   these, if they meet with any thing that mates [9] their confidence,
   fall at once under the power of the next temptation they are assaulted
   withal.

   Wherefore, whereas the generality of professed Christians are
   influenced, one way or other, by this woful security, it is no wonder
   if they are surprised and hurried away from their profession by
   seducers, or that they will be easily carried down the stream when they
   fall into a general inclination unto a defection.

   V. Love of this present world and the perishing satisfactions of it
   betrays innumerable souls into frequent apostasies from the gospel. So
   the apostle assures us in the instance of Demas: 2 Tim. iv. 10, "Demas
   hath forsaken me, having loved this present world." And as he forsook
   the apostle, so also the work of the ministry, and it may be
   Christianity therewithal. I shall not insist on that love of the world
   which works by covetousness in the course of men's lives, though this
   be a means also disposing them unto apostasy; for our Saviour affirms
   that the "seed which falls among thorns is choked," -- the word which
   is received by men whose hearts are filled with the cares of this
   present world never comes to the perfection of fruit-bearing. I shall
   only make mention of two seasons wherein the predominancy of this love
   in the hearts of men multiplies apostates from the truth.

   The first is that of persecution, wherein the professors compared by
   our Saviour unto the stony ground do presently fall away. "Such
   persons," saith he, "have no root in themselves, but, during for a
   while, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
   they are offended," Matt. xiii. 20, 21. The first thing that
   persecution attacks the minds of men withal is their secular interests
   in this world; their wealth, their houses, lands, and possessions, are
   put into hazard by it. Willing, it may be, this sort of men are to
   follow Christ for a while, with the young man in the gospel; but when
   they hear that all they have will be hazarded, it may be must be parted
   withal, they go away sorrowful. Sorry they are for a while to leave
   that word or doctrine which before they had received with joy, as Matt.
   xiii. 20, but sorrowful as they are, love of the world overcomes all
   other considerations, and away they go. What multitudes such seasons
   have driven from the truth, what stars they have cast down from heaven,
   no nation hath had greater experience than our own in the days of Queen
   Mary. I pray God it never meet with another trial, and also hope that
   it is not likely so to do!

   The other season when love of the world gives up men unto this fatal
   evil is, when and where superstition and error are enthroned. We may
   look into some foreign nations where the gospel had once taken great
   place, especially a great part of the nobles were obedient unto the
   faith; but the supreme power of the nations abiding in the hands of
   those of the Roman profession, and therewith the disposal of authority,
   fiches, and honour, those vain bubbles of the world, and idols of
   corrupted minds, it is known what influence it hath had upon the
   profession of religion, most of the posterity of those great and truly
   noble persons which once professed the protestant religion being in
   most places fallen back into the old apostasy: for, their minds being
   filled with the love of this world, and precipitated by ambition into a
   fierce pursuit of their desires, finding the way to worldly honour and
   wealth shut up unto all that would steadfastly adhere unto the truth,
   they have generally sacrificed their convictions, consciences, and
   souls, unto this predominant lust. And such a season as this is more to
   be feared than persecution itself. Many have a generous stoutness not
   to be violently forced out of their persuasion and profession; but when
   these cursed baits are laid before men, with various pretences to
   stifle their consciences and advantages to keep up their reputation,
   there is no setting up a dam against the torrent of their love of this
   world. The warmth of the sun caused him to cast away his garment which
   the blustering of the wind did but wrap closer about him. The rays of
   power in honours and favours have made more cast away their religion in
   the neighbouring nations than persecutors ever could do. Whilst,
   therefore, the world is enthroned in the minds of men, whilst it is
   made their idol, whilst hopes of advance and fears of loss are the
   principal affections whereby their course of life is steered,
   profession of the truth stands upon very uncertain and ticklish terms.
   And therefore, whilst we see that the minds of multitudes are under the
   power of this lust, all the security which can be had of their
   continuance in the profession of the truth is their not being led into
   either of the temptations mentioned.

   I shall not insist on other depraved affections of the minds of men.
   The truth is, there is no one prevalent lust, no one predominant sin no
   spiritual or moral disorder indulged unto, but it disposeth the soul
   first unto an under-valuation and then to a relinquishment of the
   truth, as occasions are offered.

   VI. The hand of Satan is in this matter. He was the head of the first
   apostasy from God. Having himself fallen away from that place and order
   in the obediential part of the creation wherein he was made, the first
   work he engaged in (and he did it effectually) was, to draw mankind
   into the guilt of the same crime and rebellion; and ever since the
   revelation of the means of recovery for man (from which he was justly
   excluded), he hath pursued the same design towards all unto whom that
   way of recovery is proposed.

   Thus he quickly carried away the whole old world upon the matter into
   idolatry. And ever since God hath been pleased to make known the way of
   life and salvation by Jesus Christ, his two great designs and works in
   the world have been to keep men off from receiving the gospel, and to
   turn them aside who have received it. The first he managed two ways, --
   first, by stirring up raging, bloody persecutions against them that
   professed it, to deter others from engaging into the like way; and the
   other, by blinding the eyes of men, and filling them with prejudices
   against the truth, as the apostle declares, 2 Cor. iv. 4. By what ways
   and means in particular he carried on this first design, in both parts
   of it, belongs not unto our present inquiry. Failing herein, his
   principal design in the world hath been, and continueth yet to be, the
   corrupting of the minds of men about the truth, and drawing them off
   from it, in part or in whole. So the apostle intimates, 2 Cor. xi. 3,
   "I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
   subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
   in Christ." It was the serpent by whom Eve was beguiled, but who is it
   the apostle is jealous that the Corinthians might have their minds
   corrupted by, from the simplicity that is in Christ; that is, by false
   doctrine, or, as it were, "another gospel," as he speaks, verse 4? It
   was the same serpent, by himself and in his agents, as he expresseth
   it, verses 14, 15. And he compareth his attempt to draw off professors
   from the gospel unto his attempt on Eve, whereby he began the apostasy
   from God in the state of nature. The tenor of the covenant was proposed
   unto our first parents in the prohibition of eating of the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil, and the threatening annexed thereunto; and
   he beguiled Eve by corrupting the threatening by his false
   interpretation of it, whereby he corrupted her mind. The tenor of the
   covenant of grace is proposed unto us principally in the promises of
   the gospel, which are the centre of the whole doctrine of it. These,
   therefore, he endeavours by all means to pervert, in opposition unto
   the wisdom and grace of God in them. Hereby he hopes to draw off men
   from the simplicity that is in Christ, or the plain declaration of the
   will of God in the gospel, unto false and foolish imaginations of his
   own suggestion. And what a hand he was to have in the great apostasy
   the apostle foretells, 2 Thess. ii. 9-11. There was to be the working
   of Satan in it, and strong or effectual delusions, unto the, belief of
   lies; which are all from him, who is the father of them. So men
   departed from the faith by "giving heed to seducing spirits," 1 Tim.
   iv. 1, -- that is, to the devil and his agents. It would be too long a
   digression, to engage into a particular inquiry how, by what ways and
   means, Satan prevails with men to turn them off from the truth, and
   turn them unto fables. How he blinds their minds, how he inflames their
   lusts, how he presents occasions, how he suggests temptations, with
   false and corrupt reasonings; what colours and pretences he puts upon
   his designs when he transforms himself into an angel of light; with
   what power, signs, and lying wonders, he gives countenance to his
   delusions; how he works on the minds of seducers, how on the minds of
   them that are to be seduced; how he stirs up persecution against the
   truth and its profession, -- would require a discourse, fully to
   declare, longer than the whole of this is designed to be. It may
   suffice to know that he is not weary nor wanting unto any of those
   manifold advantages which are administered unto him. He is at work in
   all places at this day; in some, making havoc of the churches; in
   others, by various wiles and artifices, filling the minds of men with
   prejudices against the truth, and turning them from it.

   Lastly, God doth not look on all these things as an unconcerned
   spectator. He, indeed, "is not tempted with evil;" he tempteth none, he
   seduceth none; but he rules them all, and overrules all events unto his
   own glory. He will not suffer men first to undervalue and despise, and
   then to reject and forsake, the chiefest of his mercies, such as his
   word and truth are, without reflecting on them with some acts of his
   severity. Wherefore, when men, from the corrupt principles mentioned,
   seduced by the lusts of their own hearts and entangled by the deceits
   of Satan, do relinquish the truth, God, in his holy, righteous
   judgment, gives them up unto farther delusions, so that they shall
   complete their apostasy, and grow obstinate therein unto their
   destruction. When a people, a nation, a church, or private persons,
   have received the gospel and the profession thereof, not walking
   answerably thereunto, God may forsake them, and withdraw from them the
   means of their edification and preservation. The rule of his
   continuance with any people or church, as to the outward dispensation
   of his providence and the means of grace, is that expressed 2 Chron.
   xv. 2, "The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him,
   he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you."
   He judicially forsakes them by whom he is wilfully forsaken.

   God may be forsaken by men in one way, and he may righteously forsake
   them in another. For instance; under the profession of the truth, men
   may give up themselves unto all ungodliness and unrighteousness, unto a
   flagitious course of life in all abominations, so holding the truth
   captive in unrighteousness. In this case God ofttimes, in a way of
   punishment, gives men up unto an apostasy from the truth which they
   have professed, to show that he will not always have it prostituted
   unto the lusts of men. So the apostle speaks expressly, 2 Thess. ii.
   10-12. Although they received the truth in the profession of it, yet
   they loved it not; they yielded not obedience unto it, but took
   pleasure in sin: therefore God ordered things so that they should
   reject the truth itself also, and believe lies, unto their own
   destruction. Herein at this day lies the danger of a total and ruinous
   apostasy. Multitudes, the generality of all sorts, the body of the
   people, do yet assent unto and profess the truth; but, alas! what are
   the lives and conversations of many under that profession? How do all
   manner of sins abound among us! The profession of the truth by not a
   few is the greatest dishonour and disparagement that can be cast upon
   it. The best service many can do it is by forsaking it, and declaring
   that the belief of it is inconsistent with their cursed wicked lives.
   And may we not justly fear lest such persons should speedily be given
   up, by one means or other, to "strong delusion, to believe a lie," unto
   their just damnation? And on the other hand, also, God sometimes gives
   men up to sins and wickednesses in practice, because of the rejection
   of the truth which they have received. So he dealt with them who liked
   not those notions of truth which they had concerning him, his being and
   his providence, from the light of nature, Rom. i. 28. And so he usually
   deals with all apostates. If they will forsake the truth, they shall
   forsake righteousness and holiness, which are the proper fruits of it,
   and be given up unto all abominable lusts and practices.

   We may therefore inquire by what ways and means God doth so punish and
   revenge the beginnings of wilful apostasy from the gospel, so that men
   shall complete them and prove obstinate in them unto their eternal
   destruction. And this he doth, --

   First, By removing his candlestick from among them. This the Lord Jesus
   threatens his backsliding church withal, Rev. ii. 5. God will, by one
   means or another, deprive them of the light and means of the knowledge
   of the truth, so that ignorance and darkness shall cover them and
   irresistibly increase upon them. Some of the instruments of light, it
   may be, shall be taken away by death, and some shall lie under
   prejudices; the gifts of the Spirit shall be restrained or withheld
   from others, that they shall have darkness for vision, and "the sword
   of the Lord shall be upon their right eye, that it shall be quite dried
   up." In this condition of things, the minds of apostates, already bent
   upon backsliding, are, by their ignorance and darkness, more and more
   filled with prejudices against the truth, and alienated from it; for as
   they lose the knowledge and faith of any part of truth, their minds are
   possessed with what is opposite thereunto.

   Secondly, In this condition God "sends them strong delusion, that they
   may believe a lie," 2 Thess. ii. 11. God is, as it were, now resolved
   on the end of these persons, -- what they have righteously deserved;
   and therefore he makes use of any means, as it is merely penal, to
   bring them thereunto. And as by the former act of his displeasure he
   took from them the knowledge of his truth, so by this he gives them up
   irrecoverably to adhere unto a lie. They shall not only profess it, but
   believe it; which is the cruellest slavery the mind of man is capable
   of. Now, God's sending on men "strong delusion, that they may believe a
   lie," consists in these things:--

   1. Delivering them up to the power of Satan. He is the grand seducer,
   the deluder of the souls of men, the first author of lying, whose
   principal design it is to win over the faith and assent of men
   thereunto. This work he stands continually ready for, but that God is
   pleased to limit, bound, and restrain him, with respect unto those who
   are yet under his especial care. But as to these apostates, God breaks
   down all his fences about them, and by his efficacious permission
   suffers Satan to act his part to the utmost for their delusion. This
   was the state of things under the papal apostasy, wherein Satan had
   deluded men, as it should seem, to the satisfaction of his utmost
   malice; and to show how absolute he was in his success, he did, as it
   were, make sport with the deluded souls of men. There was nothing so
   foolish and sottish that he did not impose on their credulity. Many
   volumes will not contain the stories of those ridiculous follies which
   he so imposed on the minds of poor deluded mortals, wherein he seemed
   to sport himself in the misery of blinded mankind. God grant that he
   never receive a commission to act the same part among us, whose sins
   seem to cry aloud for it, and men live as if they longed to be again
   given up to the power of the devil!

   2. By suffering seducers and false teachers to come among a people with
   such advantageous outward circumstances as shall further their success.
   These seducers prepare themselves for their work by their own
   inclinations and the suggestions of Satan; but God, for the executing
   of his just displeasure, will, by his providence, put advantages into
   their hands of prevailing over the minds of men. So the chief seducers
   in the world at this day, -- namely, the pope and those acting with or
   under him, -- have possessed such place and obtained such reputation
   among men as gives them ofttimes an uncontrollable success in their
   work. Did men stand upon even ground with them who were in the
   profession of the truth, should any so come unto them to persuade them
   unto the errors, superstitions, and idolatry of the Papacy, they could
   not but despise their offer; but these men having once gotten the name
   of "The temple of God," and showing themselves to the people in the
   stead and place of God, what could they not draw and seduce them unto?
   Neither is their superstition or profession continued on any other
   grounds on the minds of the multitude, but only by that power over the
   consciences of men which names, titles, and the places they seem to
   possess in the church, do give unto them. Then, therefore, doth God
   give up men to delusions, when in his providence he affords such
   advantages unto them by whom they are to be deluded; for those who
   possess the places of outward veneration may lead a backsliding
   multitude unto what they please.

   Lastly, God doth judicially smite such persons with blindness of mind
   and hardness of heart, that they shall not see, nor perceive, nor
   understand, even when the means of light and truth are proposed unto
   them. This effect of God's severity is declared, Isa. vi. 9, 10; and
   application is made of it unto the Jews under the ministry of our
   Saviour himself, John xii. 39-41, and that of the apostles, Acts
   xxviii. 25-27, and is expounded, Rom. xi. 7, 8.

   When things are come to this issue; when God subducts the means of
   grace from men in whole or in part, or as unto their efficacy; when he
   permits Satan to deceive them by strong delusions; and, moreover,
   himself smites them with hardness of heart and blindness of mind, --
   then is the state of such apostates miserable and irrecoverable. We are
   not, therefore, to think it strange that the light of the gospel
   diffuses itself no more in the world, -- that so eminent a stop is put
   unto its progress. God hath put an end unto his gracious dealings with
   some kinds of apostates, and they are reserved for another dispensation
   of his providence.

   These are some of the general principles of that defection which is in
   the world from the mystery and truth of the gospel, with the reasons
   and causes of them; unto which more, I doubt not, of the like nature
   may be added.

   But there is, moreover, a particular consideration to be had of those
   especial truths which any turn away from, and the imaginations they
   fall into; whereof the especial grounds and reasons, superadded unto
   those we have considered, as equally respecting every kind of defection
   from the gospel, are also to be inquired into; and it shall be done in
   one instance among ourselves.

Chapter VII.

   Instance of a peculiar defection from the truth of the gospel; with the
   reasons of it.

   Besides the reasons insisted on, which have a general influence into
   all apostasies from the doctrine or mystery of the gospel, each
   especial defection in every kind hath reasons and causes peculiarly
   suited unto its rise and furtherance. There are, indeed, not a few who
   forsake the truth which they have professed merely on the impressions
   of outward circumstances, in the encouraging examples of some who go
   before them in the same paths, from whom they expect advantage. And
   every age giveth us, in one place or another, renewed evidence, that,
   -- where either secular interest or weariness of the truth, through the
   love of the present world and hatred of holiness or strict evangelical
   obedience, doth give a propensity unto a declension from any doctrines
   of the gospel unto persons whose grandeur and outward advantages are
   sufficient to attract a compliance from the minds of men under the
   power of ambition, or any importunate desire of earthly things, --
   multitudes of all sorts suppose there is nothing left for them but to
   crowd who shall come nearest the leaders in the apostasy. And it is not
   seldom that, meeting with new temptations, they outrun both them and
   themselves also into such extremes as at first they designed not; for
   hence it is that so many do even at present issue their recessions from
   the truth, under the conduct of those "ignes fatui" or erratic
   exhalations of countenance and favour, in the undesigned bogs of Popery
   on the one hand, or Socinianism on the other. But I shall not at
   present take them into farther consideration; nor, indeed, are they
   worthy of any at all whose minds are visibly biassed, in the profession
   of things spiritual and heavenly, with those that are earthly and
   carnal.

   They are of another sort from whom we may take an instance of the
   especial reasons of a peculiar defection from the gospel; for it is
   manifest how some among ourselves are fallen off from the whole mystery
   of it, with respect unto the person and grace of Christ, the
   satisfaction for sin made by his death, the atonement by the blood of
   his sacrifice, justification by his righteousness, and sanctification
   by his Spirit. If any shall think themselves unduly charged herein,
   they may be pleased to know that none are intended but those who are
   really guilty. Whosoever owns the things mentioned, though he will
   causelessly make use of peculiar words of his own for their expression,
   neither scriptural nor proper, nor such as believers have in former
   ages been accustomed unto, yet whilst the things themselves are
   believed and received, at present we lay nothing to his charge. But
   unless, to secure a groundless, useless, irrational charity, we
   wilfully shut our eyes and stop our ears, we cannot avoid the evidence
   that these things are by many even totally renounced: yea, and this is
   done by them to the greatest disadvantage of themselves and dishonour
   of the truth that can be well imagined; for their profession is, that
   they have tried Christ and the gospel in these things, and find there
   is nothing in them for which they should abide in the faith of them or
   place their confidence in them.

   I hope none of them have gone unto such length as to cast themselves
   under the dreadful doom in the apostolical, passage insisted on; but
   that their condition is dangerous cannot be denied. To prevent the like
   state in ourselves and others, we may do well to consider what are the
   true, real, next and immediate springs and reasons of such men's
   apostasy from the mystery of the gospel, as added unto the general
   reasons of all apostasy of this kind before mentioned; for so it is,
   that besides those general reasons and causes which have their efficacy
   and influence in all apostasies, and must always be considered in this
   matter, there are also reasons that are peculiar unto every especial
   instance of backsliding in any kind.

   First, Ignorance of the necessity of Jesus Christ and the benefits of
   his mediation unto life and salvation hath betrayed them first into an
   indifferency about them, and then into a defection from them. They want
   a true, and in their own souls a full, conviction of their personal
   want of these things. Such apostates arise out of loose, notional
   professors, who never had any sound convictions of the want of Christ,
   like them [mentioned in] Acts ii. 37, or him, chap. xvi. 30. And
   although they lived, some of them, a long time in the outward
   profession that such a conviction of the worth and use of Christ and
   his grace was necessary unto them that would be saved, yet dare they
   not own that ever themselves had any such conviction; for if they had,
   why do they now forsake him as unto those ends for which they were
   convinced he was so to be desired? That faith alone will never forsake
   Christ which springs out of or is built on a conviction of the want of
   him. They who are well and in health will not always esteem the
   physician.

   Unto this conviction of the want of Christ two things are required in
   all men, according to the measure of the light which they have
   received:--

   1. The knowledge of the nature, guilt, filth, and desert of sin: for he
   came to save us from our sins; and no man will look after him to be
   delivered from he knows not what, or look to the brazen serpent who is
   not stung. Few have any knowledge hereof but what they cannot avoid,
   and fewer are sensible of these things in a due manner. The great
   design of Satan at this day in the world is, to extenuate sin in
   opinion, and so countenance it in practice Indeed, it ever was so; but
   it is in a peculiar manner at present visible and open, though the
   conspiracy be so strong that a public resistance unto it is scarcely
   maintainable. His aim in it is, and ever was, to take off from the
   necessity and usefulness of Christ and his grace, against which his
   malice is principally bent; and when once he can convey away the
   relief, he will be ready enough to aggravate the evil. Hence are those
   opinions so diligently advanced and greedily embraced against the guilt
   and power of original sin and the depravation of our nature, wherein
   men of all sorts conspire. Whatever some men may design, his end in
   them all is no other but to prevent a conviction of the want we have of
   Christ. So, also, are sins in practice extenuated; spiritual sins
   against the gospel are made nothing of, yea, laughed at, and
   immoralities against the law are lightly esteemed and easily passed
   over. To take off at present a sense of the want of Christ, and to make
   way for future apostasy, is the end of these and the like corrupt
   opinions. Accordingly it is come to pass in the world. Never was there
   less regard of the person and offices of Christ, of his grace, and
   benefits of his mediation, among them that are called Christians, than
   is found among many at this day. Unless God graciously relieve, the
   world is like to lose Christ out of the gospel, as to the true glory of
   his person and use of his mediation. Thus was it with the generality of
   them concerning whom we speak. They never had a thorough practical
   conviction of the want of Christ; for if they had had, they would not
   so shamefully have left him as they have done. The general notions they
   had hereof serve only to entitle them unto a defection I know these
   things are despised by many, unto whom the want of Christ and the
   receiving of him, or an interest in him, are contemptible things. But
   that is all one. We must not forego the gospel, with our own
   experience, and ruin our souls, to escape their reproaches. Sin will be
   sin, and Christ will be Christ, and salvation by him will be what it
   is, when they have done what they can.

   2. Hereunto is required a knowledge and sense of the weakness of the
   best of our duties, and their utter insuffciency to abide the trial in
   the sight of God. Without the former we cannot have, and without the
   latter we can never abide in, a sense of the want of Christ. A right
   consideration of the instability of our minds in them, the weak actings
   of grace for the most part, the weariness of the flesh that accompanies
   them, secret impressions from self, and inward oppositions from sin,
   that attend them, with the greatness and holiness of God with whom we
   have to do in them, is indispensably necessary to keep the Lord Christ
   and his grace always desirable unto us. Want hereof makes some dream of
   a perfection in themselves, and others of a justification by their own
   obedience; the first tending to the contempt, the latter unto the
   neglect, of Christ and his grace. This is the beginning of
   transgression unto many apostates. They never had a due sense of the
   want of Christ, either as to their deliverance from the guilt of sin,
   or as to the procuring of a righteousness wherewith they might appear
   in the presence of God. This are they to inquire after who shall
   endeavour their recovery. To contend with them about their own
   imaginations is, for the most part, endless and fruitless. Let it be
   inquired whether they ever had any conviction of the want of Christ for
   the pardon of sin, or for the obtaining of life and salvation. If they
   shall grant they had, it may be asked why they do not make use of him
   unto the ends with respect whereunto they were convinced of the want of
   him; and if they do so, we have no contest with them in this matter. If
   they acknowledge that they never had any such conviction, this is that
   which we are to confirm, that such a conviction of the want of Christ
   is indispensably necessary unto the salvation of all that are adult;
   and herein we have the testimony, upon the matter, of the whole
   Scripture, the law and the gospel, to confirm the truth we contend for.
   Want, therefore, hereof was one spring of this defection. For those who
   have owned the necessity of him, or an interest in him, for the ends
   mentioned, and afterward declare that there is nothing of goodness or
   truth in what they have found and discovered for which they should
   continue so to do, their profession is, that they have considered this
   matter, known it, and do condemn it; wherein the formal nature of
   apostasy doth consist. And all those disciples which they draw after
   them, they do it by hiding from them, or drawing them off from, any
   sense of a want of Christ or of his mediation. That which is the
   foundation of our profession, in opposition hereunto, which we lay the
   weight of all our eternal concerns upon, is, that without Christ,
   before we receive him as set forth by God to be a propitiation through
   faith in his blood, we are in a lost, undone, and accursed condition;
   that our closing with him, our believing in him, is upon a conviction
   of our want of him for life, righteousness, and acceptation with God,
   both before and after believing. And it is in vain for Satan himself to
   attempt the faith of God's elect herein. A concurrence of plain
   revelation and evident experience is invincible. But he who never knew,
   who never was made deeply sensible of, the want of an interest in
   Christ, will never persevere in the pin, suit of it, nor abide in what
   he hath attained, when attacked by any vigorous temptation.

   Secondly, Want of a spiritual view of the excellency of Christ, both in
   his person and offices, is another spring and cause of this declension
   from the faith of the gospel. This view of him in types, shadows, and
   promises, was the life of the faith of the saints under the old
   testament. Herein "Abraham saw his day, and rejoiced," John viii. 56.
   So Cant. ii. 8, 17. And it is mentioned as their chiefest privilege,
   Isa. xxxiii. 17. These things they diligently inquired into, 1 Pet. i.
   11, and longed after, desiring, if it were possible, to see them, Matt.
   xiii. 17; for the glory and life of all religion, of all intercourse
   with God, lay in them from the giving of the first promise. Christ was
   "all and in all" unto them, no less than unto us. Take a respect unto
   him and his offices out of the old administrations, and they are things
   of no value or signification. And it was better for them who were
   inquiring after Christ diligently under dark types and shadows, than it
   will be for those among us who shut their eyes at the glorious light of
   the gospel And the reason why he was rejected by the Jews at his coming
   (for "he came unto his own, and his own received him not," John i. 11),
   was, because they could "see neither form, nor comeliness, nor beauty
   in him, why he should be desired," Isa. liii. 2. None can or will abide
   constant in his doctrine who is not able spiritually to discern the
   glory of his person and offices. Hence the apostles lay it down as the
   foundation of their faith, that "they beheld his glory, the glory as of
   the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth," John i. 14;
   and that which they had in themselves they endeavoured to communicate
   unto others, that they also might believe through their word, and have
   fellowship with him, 1 John i. 3. So he himself makes this the
   foundation of his church, the rock upon which he will build it; for on
   the confession of Peter that he was "the Christ, the Son of the living
   God" (which expresseth the glory both of his person as the Son of the
   living God, and of his offices as the Christ), he says, "On this rock
   will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
   it," Matt. xvi. 16-18. Whosoever builds not hereon builds on the sand,
   and will be prevailed against. So our apostle declares that those that
   hold him not as the Head will be beguiled, and vainly puffed up by
   their fleshly minds, falling into foolish errors and vain curiosities,
   Col. ii. 18, 19. And he rests the whole foundation of all gospel faith
   in this glory of his person and offices, Heb. i. 2, 3; Col. i. 15-19.
   It is this knowledge of him alone that will make us disesteem and
   despise all other things in comparison of him, Phil. iii. 8-10.

   Wherefore, a spiritual view of him, an acquaintance with him, as "the
   brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person,"
   as him in whom all the perfections of the divine nature, as wisdom,
   goodness, and grace, do centre, as to their manifestation, even in the
   union of his natures, the glory of his offices, the suitableness of his
   person and grace unto all the wants and desires of the souls of men, is
   indispensably necessary unto our preservation from apostasy. And I
   could easily manifest by particular instances that a failing herein
   hath had a principal and prevalent influence into all the apostasies
   that have been in the Christian world, both as unto faith and worship.
   It is, though a new, yet a most wicked attempt that Satan is making by
   some against the whole of our religion; whilst allowing his person to
   be what it is (which for secular ends they dare not deny), they
   endeavour to render him of little or no use in our profession. This is
   to "fight neither against small nor great, but against the King of
   Israel;" and if such serpentine attempts be not prevented, the public
   profession of religion among us will issue in atheism, or somewhat of a
   near alliance thereunto.

   Thus it seems to be with some of them of whom we speak. They had, among
   other notional professors, an historical knowledge of Christ, and
   thereof made profession, but they were never spiritually acquainted
   with the glorious excellencies of his person and offices; for if they
   had, they would not have forsaken the "great mystery of godliness, God
   manifested in the flesh," for other uncouth notions of their own. Who
   can think it possible that any one who hath known the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Lord of glory, the Son of God incarnate, receiving our
   nature into a hypostatical union with himself and a blessed subsistence
   in his own person, as proposed unto us in the gospel, as evidently
   therein crucified before our eyes, as the apostle and high priest of
   our profession, as our advocate with the Father, as making peace for us
   and reconciliation through the blood of his cross, as made of God unto
   us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; -- who that
   ever had experience or benefit, in his temptations and trials, of his
   love, care, tenderness, compassion, readiness and ability to succour
   them that come to God by him, -- can renounce all these things, to
   betake himself to vain notions of a light and perfection of his own in
   their stead? I hope they are few who do so practically, but the
   expressions of many have a dangerous aspect that way; and it is certain
   there is nothing more necessary unto all that are called Christians
   than to have clear, distinct notions in themselves of the person of
   Christ, and plainly to declare how they place their whole faith, hope,
   and trust in him. And for such as really do so, though not able to
   express themselves in a due manner, yea, though unduly captivated unto
   some novel conceptions and expressions, the good Lord pardon them, and
   let mercy and peace be on them, and on the whole Israel of God!
   Whereas, therefore, some who have made a profession of these things do
   now relinquish them, I shall pray they may take heed that they do not
   thereby "crucify the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
   Neither is it a verbal acknowledgment, in owning that Christ which
   suffered at Jerusalem, which will free any from this charge and guilt.
   Unless the Lord Christ, that Christ which is God and man in one person,
   be owned, received, believed in, loved, trusted unto, and obeyed in all
   things, as he is proposed unto us in the Scripture, and with respect
   unto all the ends of righteousness, holiness, life, and salvation, for
   which he is so proposed, he is renounced and forsaken. Who can
   sufficiently express the cunning sleights of Satan? who can
   sufficiently bewail the foolishness of the hearts of men, that after
   they have, at least doctrinally, known and professed these things, they
   should be turned aside from the glory, truth, and holiness of them? Let
   Christians therefore know and beware, that if they find any decay in
   faith, love, delight, and trust in the person and mediation of Christ,
   they are in the way that leads to some cursed apostasy of one kind or
   another.

   But where the divine person of Christ is denied, or all acquaintance
   with him is despised; where the communication of grace from him unto
   believers is scorned; where no use by faith of his love, care,
   compassion, and power, as our high priest and advocate with the Father,
   in our duties, sins, temptations, and sufferings, is allowed, -- we
   need not represent the danger of falling into apostasy; such persons
   are already in the depth of it. I speak this with the more earnestness,
   because, of all the evils which I have seen in the course of my
   pilgrimage (now hastening unto its period), there hath been none more
   grievous than the public contempt I have lived to see cast on the
   person of Christ, as to its concernment in our religion, and the
   benefits we receive from him. But God taketh care of these things.

   Thirdly, Want of experience of the power and efficacy of the Spirit and
   grace of Christ, of his life and death, for the mortification of sin,
   hath been another spring of this apostasy. How it is wrought by these
   means, and can be no otherwise accomplished, I have showed elsewhere at
   large, and must not here assume the same argument again; only, two
   things may be observed concerning this work and duty: as, --

   1. It is that wherein or whereunto the greatest wisdom and exercise of
   faith doth consist, or is required. It is a matter purely evangelical,
   to derive strength and ability from Christ for the mortification of
   sin, by virtue of his death, in a way of believing. Unenlightened
   reason can neither see nor understand any thing of this matter; yea, it
   is foolishness unto it, as are all other mysteries of the gospel. There
   is not any other way for the same end which it will not more willingly
   embrace.

   2. It is a work and duty whereunto there is a great reluctancy in the
   flesh, in corrupted nature. There is nothing it had rather be freed
   from, and that whether we respect the inward nature of it or the
   constant continuance in it that is required of us. Yet is it such as
   that without it we can never attain life and salvation; for "if we by
   the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh, we shall live," and not
   otherwise. Wherefore, when men once begin to be sensible of the
   powerful inward workings of sin, they will take one of these two ways,
   nor can they do otherwise: for either they will yield themselves up
   "servants unto sin," and make "provision for the flesh to fulfil the
   lusts thereof," according as they are able, and as far as consists with
   their secular interest, as do the most; or they will betake themselves
   to some way or other for its restraint and mortification, either in
   part or in whole. And here many things will present themselves unto
   such persons, some, it may be, of their own devising, and some of God's
   appointment, but for other ends than what they apply them unto. Hence
   multitudes faint in this work, and at length utterly give it over. They
   begin in the Spirit and end in the flesh; for, not striving lawfully
   nor in the right way, sin gets ground and strength against them, and
   they yield up themselves to the service of it. Hence have we so many
   who, having under their convictions contended against their lusts in
   their youth, do give up themselves unto them in their age. But so it is
   in this matter, that those who, through their unbelief, cannot rise or
   attain unto an experience of the power and efficacy of the grace of
   Christ for the mortification of sin will betake themselves to somewhat
   else for their relief; and this is that principally which hath brought
   forth that light within among some, which must do all this work for
   them, and much more. If any will betake themselves thereunto, they
   shall find that remedy against sin, and that perfection of holiness, in
   a few days, which they had been looking for from Christ a long season
   to no purpose. So would they have us to think who, it may be, never had
   experience what it is to derive spiritual strength from Christ, or to
   wait on him for it; only they have been wearied by the successlessness
   of their convictions, and the burdensomeness of lifeless duties. For
   some of them were for a season not only sober in their conversation
   (which I hope they yet continue to be), but diligent in duties of
   religion; but finding neither life, power, nor success in them, through
   their own uncured unbelief, they seem to have grown weary of them: for
   nothing is more grievous than the outward form of spiritual duties
   where there is no experience of inward power and sweetness. Wherefore,
   the corrupt minds of men will be ready to relinquish them for any thing
   that pretends a better relief.

   What was the reason that so many in the Papacy betook themselves to
   penances, severe disciplines, and self-macerations, for the relief of
   their consciences with respect unto the mortification of sin? It all
   sprang from this root, or ignorance of the power and efficacy of the
   Spirit and grace of Christ for that end. Somewhat must be done unto
   this purpose, and not knowing the right way and gospel method of it,
   they betook themselves unto what they could invent, or what was imposed
   on them by the superstition of others, that pretended to afford them a
   relief. Somewhat hereof those among us seemed for a while to make an
   appearance of, in an outward gravity and seeming austerity of life; but
   the things themselves they had no mind unto, as not compliant with
   other interests they had to pursue. But the light within shall do all
   of this kind for them; wherefore, in comparison thereof, and as unto
   this end at least, they reject the Lord Christ, and do what in them
   lies to "put him to an open shame;" for what do they less who declare
   that that is done in a few days for them by another means which could
   not be effected by the faith which for so long a season they professed
   in him? But the cause of the whole lies solely in their own ignorance
   and want of experience of the things which themselves professed.

   Fourthly, Ignorance of the righteousness of God hath been another
   spring of this apostasy. This the apostle expressly declares to be the
   reason why men go about to establish a righteousness of their own: Rom.
   x. 3, "Being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves
   unto the righteousness of God." And this he speaks of the Jews, and
   that the best of them, who "followed after the law of righteousness,
   but sought it as it were by the works of the law," Rom. ix. 31, 32. Of
   all men they thought themselves most knowing of the "righteousness of
   God;" for they "made their boast of God, and knew" (as they thought and
   professed) "his will, and approved the things that are more excellent,
   being instructed out of the law, and were confident that they
   themselves were guides of the blind, and the light of them which are in
   darkness, instructors of the foolish, and teachers of babes, having the
   form of knowledge and of the truth in the law," Rom. ii. 17-20. Yet
   these men submitted not unto the righteousness of God, but went about
   to establish their own righteousness, because they were ignorant of the
   righteousness of God. And wheresoever this ignorance is, men will do
   so.

   Take the "righteousness of God" in any sense wherein it is mentioned in
   the Scripture, and this event will follow upon the ignorance thereof;
   for it must be either the righteousness that is in him, or the
   righteousness he requires of us in the law, or the righteousness he
   hath provided for us in the gospel. Consider it any of these ways, and
   the ignorance of it is that which countenanceth men in betaking
   themselves unto a righteousness of their own, yea, unavoidably casteth
   them upon it; for, --

   1. A right understanding of the infinite purity, the glorious essential
   holiness, of the nature of God, of his absolute eternal righteousness
   as the Lord and judge of all, will teach men what apprehensions they
   ought to have of any thing done in them or by them. "Our God is a
   consuming fire," Heb. xii. 29; "a God of purer eyes than to behold
   evil," Hab. i. 13; "who will by no means clear the guilty," Exod.
   xxxiv. 7; "whose judgment it is, that they which commit sin are worthy
   of death," Rom. i. 32; "an holy God, a jealous God, who will not
   forgive transgressions and sins," Josh. xxiv. 19. Whilst the dread and
   terror of the excellency of his holiness and righteousness is before
   men, they will not easily betake themselves and their trust unto a
   righteousness of their own. There are two sorts of persons that the
   Scripture represents under an apprehension of this righteousness of
   God. The first are, convinced, guilty sinners; and the other, humble,
   holy believers. And what thoughts of themselves each sort is thereon
   filled withal it doth declare. For the former sort, we have an instance
   in Adam, Gen. iii. 10; in others, Isa. xxxiii. 14, as also Mic. vi. 6,
   7. The sum is, they can think of nothing, have no other conceptions in
   their minds, but how either they may flee from him and hide themselves,
   or feign to themselves impossible ways of atonement, or be swallowed up
   in horror and despair. Send them in this condition unto a righteousness
   of their own, and they will easily understand you do but reproach their
   misery. And for the other sort, or humble, holy believers, we may see
   also how on this occasion they express themselves in this matter, Job
   iv. 17-19, ix. 2; Ps. cxxx. 3, cxliii. 2. They all jointly acknowledge
   that, such is the glorious holiness and righteousness of God, such the
   imperfection of our righteousness and impurity of our works, there is
   no appearance or standing before him on their account. It is the want
   of a due meditation hereon that hath produced the many presumptuous
   opinions in the world concerning the justification of sinners. The
   Scripture, speaking of justification, directs us to conceive it "in
   God's sight," Ps. cxliii. 2, or "before him," Rom. iii. 20; teaching us
   that in this matter we should set ourselves as in the presence and
   under the eye of this holy God, and then consider on what ground we may
   stand before him. But when men are "ignorant of the righteousness of
   God," when they have secret thoughts that he is "altogether such an one
   as themselves," as the psalmist speaks, -- that is, one who is either
   not so holy in himself as is pretended, or one who doth not require a
   suitableness in us unto his holiness, but is little concerned in our
   duties, less in our sins, -- is it any wonder if men think they can of
   themselves do that which is satisfactory unto him, and so "go about to
   establish their own righteousness?" And this way even in teaching have
   some betaken themselves unto. They endeavour to satisfy their disciples
   that there is no such severity in God against sin as some pretend, no
   such holiness in his nature as necessarily to infer an indignation
   against every sin; that they are but vain frights and needless
   disquietments which either their own consciences or the preaching of
   some men do put them unto. And if they can prevail to be credited
   herein, there is no doubt but that those whom they so persuade will be
   pleased with their own righteousness: but whether God, in this matter
   of justification, will be pleased with it or no is not so easy to be
   determined.

   And hence it is that all opinions of a self-righteousness, or
   justification by works, have always produced licentiousness of life,
   though they who assert it clamorously pretend to the contrary. So when
   a righteousness of works was absolutely enthroned in the Papacy, before
   the Reformation, the lives of the generality of men were flagitiously
   wicked, and most of the good works that were performed amongst them
   were but barterings with God and conscience for horrible vices and
   impieties. According, also, unto the growth of the same opinion, in its
   various degrees, among us, is the progress of all sorts of impiety and
   licentiousness of life. And if the masters of these opinions would but
   open their eyes, they would see that whereas they assert their
   justification by works under a pretence of a necessity so to do, for
   the maintenance of holiness and righteousness among men, unholiness,
   unrighteousness, intemperance of life, and all abominations, do grow
   upon them, such as were not heard of in former days among them who made
   any profession of religion. And the reason hereof is, because the very
   same notions of God which will allow men to suppose that they may be
   justified in his sight by their own duties, will also accommodate their
   lusts with several apprehensions that he will not be so severe against
   their sins as is supposed. However, this is plain in matter of fact,
   that the opinion of self-righteousness and looseness of conversation in
   the practice of sin have gone together generally, from the days of the
   Pharisees to this present season. And as this proud conceit receives
   daily advancement in several degrees, under various pretences, it is to
   be feared the world will be more and more filled with the bitter fruits
   thereof. It is grace, and the doctrine of it, as well as its power,
   that must put a stop to sin. He that drives men into a righteousness of
   their own at one door opens another unto their sins. And all that we
   have got hitherto by fierce disputations about justification as it were
   by works, is only that the faith of some hath been weakened, the peace
   of multitudes disquieted, differences increased, without the least
   evidence of holiness improved or the vices of men reformed by them. And
   it will not be granted that the strictest professors in these days
   (whether they have imbibed these opinions or no) do in real holiness
   and fruitfulness of life exceed those of the foregoing age, who firmly,
   and without hesitation, trusted unto the Lord Christ alone for life,
   righteousness, and salvation.

   2. Suppose the righteousness God requires of us in the law to be
   intended; the ignorance thereof also is a great reason why men venture
   on a righteousness of their own, and go about to establish it. Were
   they indeed acquainted with the purity, spirituality, severity, and
   inexorableness of the law, they would never be possessed with
   imaginations that the perfection which they dream of in themselves
   would endure its trial. But when men shall suppose that the law
   respects only outward duties, and those also of the greatest notoriety,
   as to sin and obedience, and can relieve themselves in sundry things by
   pharisaical distinctions and expositions of it; when they consider not,
   or understand not, the extent of it, -- unto an exacting of the entire
   image of God in us, wherein we were created, unto the regulating of all
   the frames, figments, and first motions of the heart, and its
   application of the curse unto the least deviation from it, -- they may
   please or some way satisfy themselves by establishing a righteousness
   of their own, as it were by the works of the law.

   3. But the "righteousness of God" in this place is taken principally
   for that righteousness which he hath provided for us in the gospel; and
   what this is the apostle declares in the next verse: "For," says he,
   "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness unto every one that
   believeth," Rom. x. 4. And this he calls "The righteousness which is of
   faith," chap. ix. 30. Wherefore, the "righteousness of God" is Christ
   as fulfilling the law and answering the end of it, received by faith.
   This is that righteousness of God, which whosoever are ignorant of and
   submit not unto, they will go about to establish a righteousness of
   their own, and trust unto it. And thus hath it openly and visibly
   fallen out with them concerning whom we treat. They will not deny but
   that, under their convictions, they were solicitous after a
   righteousness with which God might be well pleased; -- and if they
   should deny it, they were not to be believed, because it is impossible
   it should be otherwise with any in that condition; for conviction is
   principally a sense of the want of a righteousness. In this state, the
   gospel which they had, and which it may be they heard preached,
   presented unto them "Christ as the end of the law for righteousness
   unto every one that believeth," as it is fully declared, Rom. iii.
   21-26, with chap. v. 18, 19. This divers of them for a season professed
   themselves to embrace and acquiesce in. But when things came to the
   trial, it generally appeared that they had all along been ignorant of
   this righteousness of God; for they have left it for a righteousness of
   their own, which, had they truly and really known it, they could not
   have done. He who hath ever truly and really made Christ the end of the
   law for righteousness unto himself, by believing, will not cast
   contempt and scorn upon his righteousness imputed unto us, as is the
   manner of some to do. But herein is the Son of God in some measure
   "crucified afresh, and put to an open shame." When men shall profess
   that they did look after righteousness by him, and would have received
   him as the end of the law for righteousness, but not finding that
   therein which they expected, they have betaken themselves to a
   righteousness wholly within them, and so wholly their own, they will
   not easily contrive a way whereby they may reflect more dishonour upon
   him. Whatever pretences may be made to the contrary, whatever maze of
   words any may lead men into and tire them withal, whatever reviling and
   reproaching of others they may compass them with, they cannot but know
   in their own consciences that it is thus with them. Notwithstanding any
   profession that they ever made, they never did come, nor ever could
   attain unto, a real knowledge of and acquaintance with this
   righteousness of God, so as to receive it by faith, and obtain thereby
   rest unto their souls. And hence it is that, as unto profession at
   least, they have betaken themselves unto an endeavour to establish
   their own righteousness; which, if it produce and effect a real holy
   conversation and righteousness in them of any long continuance, they
   are the first in whom it ever had that effect in this world, and will
   be the last in whom it shall find that success.

   Fifthly, Want of submission unto the sovereignty of God hath
   contributed unto the furtherance of this evil. The sovereignty of God
   acting itself in infinite wisdom and grace is the sole foundation of
   the covenant of grace, and runs through the whole mystery of the
   gospel. Thence proceedeth the incarnation of the Son of God, and his
   being filled with all grace to be a Saviour, John iii. 16; Col. i. 19;
   John i. 16. Other account thereof none can be given. Thence was his
   substitution as the surety of the covenant in our stead, to undergo the
   punishment due to our sins, Isa. liii. 6, 10; 2 Cor. v. 21. Eternal
   election flows from thence, and is regulated thereby, Rom. ix. 11, 18;
   so doth effectual vocation, Matt. xi. 25, 26, and justification by
   faith, Rom. iii. 30. The like may be said of all other mysteries of the
   gospel. Love, grace, goodness, dispensed in a way of sovereign,
   unaccountable pleasure, are in them all proposed as the objects of our
   faith. The carnal mind is pleased with nothing of all this, but riseth
   up in opposition unto every instance of it. It will not bear that the
   will, wisdom, and pleasure of God should be submitted unto and adored
   in the paths which it cannot trace. Hence the incarnation and cross of
   the Son of God are foolishness unto it, 1 Cor. i. 23-25; the decrees of
   God as to election and reprobation unjust and unequal, overthrowing all
   religion, Rom. ix. 17-21; justification through the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ that which everts the law, and renders all our
   own righteousness unnecessary. So in the whole mystery, in all the
   doctrines, precepts, or promises of the gospel, that spring from or are
   resolved into the sovereignty of God, -- the carnal mind riseth up in
   opposition unto them all; for whereas the formal nature of faith
   consisteth in giving glory to God by believing the things that are
   above reason as it is ours, and against it as it is carnal, Rom. iv.
   18-21, this sets up an enmity unto it in all things. It is therefore
   always tumultuating against the mysteries of the gospel; and if it once
   come to make itself the judge of them, taking aid from sensual
   affections and the vain imaginations of the mind, it will make havoc of
   all the articles of faith. And thus it seems to have fallen out in this
   matter. Those concerning whom we treat seem to have cast off a due
   regard unto the sovereignty of God, because themselves were never bowed
   by faith savingly thereto. Wherefore, in an opposition unto it, they
   have set up their light within, as the rule, measure, and judge, of the
   truths and doctrines of the gospel. Instead of becoming fools, by a
   resignation of their reason and wisdom to the sovereignty of God, that
   so they might in the issue be really wise, they have become wise in
   their own conceit, and have waxed vain in their foolish imaginations.
   Neither, indeed, is there any broader way of apostasy from the gospel
   than a rejection of God's sovereignty in all things concerning the
   revelation of himself and our obedience, with a refusal to "bring into
   captivity every thought unto the obedience of faith;" which first
   brought forth Pelagianism, and of late Socinianism, as hath been
   showed, from which two the whole of the present defection is derived.

   Sixthly, We may add hereunto, as another spring of this partial
   apostasy, want of an evidence in themselves of the divine authority of
   the Scriptures. It is not enough, to establish any man in the
   profession of the gospel, to own in general that the Scripture is the
   word of God, or a divine revelation of his will. He that hath not an
   experience of a divine authority in it upon his own soul and conscience
   will not be steadfast when his trial shall come. God looks with regard
   unto them alone who tremble at his word, as owning his present
   authority in it. Where this doth not abide upon them, "unlearned and
   unstable men," as the apostle speaks, will be bold to "wrest the
   Scriptures, to their destruction," or to prefer other things before
   them, or at least to equalize them with them. It is not, therefore,
   enough that we assent unto the truth of the word of God, unless also we
   are sensible of its power, and of that claim which it makes in the name
   of God to the absolute subjection of our whole souls and consciences
   unto it. Now, this evidence in themselves of this present; divine
   authority, differing it unconceivably from all other real or pretended
   conveyances of truth, these persons either never had or have insensibly
   lost, or cast off openly the yoke of God therein. Hereon every
   imagination of their own exalts itself into an equality of right and
   authority with it. The end of these things is, that God gives men up to
   "strong delusion, to believe a lie," because they "received not," or
   retained not, "the truth in the love thereof," 2 Thess. ii. 10, 11. And
   when once it comes unto this, it is the work of Satan (which, he easily
   accomplisheth) both to suggest unto them endless delusions, and to
   render them so obstinate therein as that they shall despise every thing
   that is tendered unto conviction.

   This is the first way whereby men fall away from the gospel, -- namely,
   from the mystery and doctrine of it as it is the object of our faith;
   wherein they do what in them lies "to crucify the Son of God afresh,
   and to put him to an open shame."

Chapter VIII.

   Apostasy from the holiness of the gospel; the occasion and cause of it
   -- Of that which is gradual, on the pretense of somewhat else in its
   room.

   There is, secondly, a falling away from the gospel with respect unto
   the holiness of its precepts, which are to be the matter, as they are
   the rule, of our obedience. And this also is of a nature no less
   perilous, and attended with consequents and effects no less dangerous,
   than the former, and doth no less than that expose the Son of God to
   open shame: yea, an apostasy from the holiness of the gospel is, on
   many accounts, more dreadful and dangerous than a partial apostasy from
   its truth; for as it is more spreading and catholic than that is, and
   of less observation or esteem, so it is usually more irrecoverable,
   most men under it being greatly hardened through the deceitfulness of
   sin. Besides, commonness hath taken off the sense of its evil and
   danger. If there be an error broached against the doctrine of the
   gospel, it is odds but some or other will take notice of it, confute
   it, and warn all men of the danger wherewith it is attended; but let
   the whole world, as it were, lie in evil, let the generality of mankind
   drown themselves in lusts and pleasures, let the lives and
   conversations of men be as contrary to the rule of the gospel as
   darkness is to light, so they make no disorder in this or that way of
   outward worship, and be either good Catholics or good Protestants, or
   any thing else of that kind, he shall scarcely escape the censure of
   peevishness and severity (it may be of self-conceitedness and
   hypocrisy) who shall reflect any great blame on these things. And yet,
   notwithstanding this partiality in judgment or practice with respect
   unto these evils, it is generally acknowledged that it is possible that
   men may please God and be accepted with him, notwithstanding many
   mistakes, errors, and misconceptions of their minds about spiritual
   things: but that any one should ever come unto the enjoyment of him who
   lives and dies impenitently in any sin, against the rule and tenor of
   that holiness which the gospel requireth, I know as yet none that
   pleadeth; for, once to pretend that men may live in, and habitually act
   any known sin, without striving against it, labouring for repentance,
   and endeavouring its mortification, is all one as avowedly to attempt
   the overthrow of Christian religion. Wherefore, on these and sundry
   other considerations, this latter sort of apostasy from the holiness of
   the gospel is at least as perilous, as much to be opposed and contended
   against, as that which is from the mystery and doctrine of it, and that
   whereof the generality of men are more earnestly to be warned, as the
   evil whereunto they are more obnoxious than to the other. And we do
   conjoin both these together, not only as those which are of the same
   tendency, and do alike both ruin the souls of men and put the Lord
   Christ to oven shame, but also as those concerning which we are
   forewarned that they shall enter and come into the world together in
   the "latter times." And whatever sense the "latter times" mentioned in
   the Scripture may be taken in, either those of the world and of
   religion in general, or of the particular churches whereunto men may
   belong, they are unquestionably come upon us; whose danger and duty,
   therefore, are declared in these pre-admonitions. Wherefore of the
   first our apostle speaketh, 1 Tim. iv. 1, "The Spirit speaketh
   expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
   giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils." I doubt not
   but this prediction had its signal accomplishment in the Papacy, and am
   well persuaded that the Holy Ghost had respect in particular unto those
   principles and practices which a learned person of this nation hath
   laid open, under the title of "The Apostasy of the Latter Times." [10]
   But we find also, by woful experience, and that renewed almost every
   day, that it hath respect unto us also and the times wherein we live.

   The entrance and coming of that kind of apostasy which we have now
   designed to treat of is in like manner foretold, 2 Tim. iii. 1-5. The
   sum of what the apostle there instructeth us is, That in these "latter
   times," under an outward profession of the gospel, men should give up
   themselves unto the pursuit of the vilest lusts and the practice of the
   most abominable sins. And we fear this prediction is in like manner
   fulfilled.

   Now, although these things are evil and dangerous, both in their own
   nature and tendency, especially as they come together and make their
   joint attempt against the honour of Christ and the salvation of the
   professors of the gospel, yet this prediction of them and
   pre-admonition concerning them may be of advantage unto them that are
   sincere and upright, if duly improved. For, --

   1. If this twofold ruinous apostasy will and doth press upon us, on
   whom the ends of the world are come, we ought surely to stand upon our
   guard, that we be not surprised with it nor overcome by it. How ought
   we to "pass the time of our sojourning here in fear!" It was the advice
   of him whose confidence had like to have been his ruin. It is assuredly
   no time for any to be careless and secure who design, or so much as
   desire, to be preserved from this fatal evil. However, we cannot any of
   us plead that we were not warned of our danger, nor called on for that
   circumspection and watchfulness, that care and diligence, that
   earnestness for divine help and assistance, which our condition
   requireth, and which will be a means of deliverance and safety. And, --

   2. Being found in the way of our own duty, we need not be greatly moved
   or "shaken in our minds" when we see these things come to pass. It may
   be a prospect of the state of religion at this day in the world is
   ready to terrify the minds of some, at least to fill them with
   amazement; for if things should always so proceed, they may be afraid
   lest Christian religion should at length lose all its beauty and glory.
   But these things are all of them punctually foretold, whereby the
   efficacy of the temptation from their coming to pass is prevented. Yea,
   considering that all our faith is resolved into the Scripture, and
   built on the infallibility of its prophecies and predictions, seeing
   they are foretold, the temptation would be accompanied with more vigour
   and efficacy if we saw them not come to pass than it is now we do,
   seeing it is evident from other circumstances that we are fallen into
   the "latter times," which the accomplishment of these predictions
   renders unquestionable. See Matt. xxiv. 9-13, 25; Acts xx. 29, 30; 2
   Thess. ii. 3; 1 Tim. iv. 1-3; 2 Tim. iii. 1-5. And the truth is, there
   was never any persuasion more pernicious befell the minds of men, than
   that churches, this or that church, or any church, are not, or is not
   liable or obnoxious unto these decays, declensions, and apostasies, or
   that any in them or of them can be preserved from them without the
   utmost care and diligence in attending unto the means appointed for
   their preservation. When the Jews fell into such a foolish confidence
   with respect unto their temple and worship, God was wont to bid them go
   to Shiloh and see what was become thereof, as assuring them that what
   fell out in one time and place might do so in another. And we know how
   it was in this matter with the first Christian churches, and how soon
   (as hath been declared), Rev. ii. 4, 5, iii. 1-3, 14-17. We may go to
   them and learn how vain are all the pretences of outward privileges and
   exemptions; for assuredly, "unless we repent, we shall all likewise
   perish."

   That, therefore, which we shall now inquire into is, the nature, the
   causes, and occasions, of that apostasy or falling off from the
   holiness of the gospel, in churches and by particular persons, which is
   thus foretold to fall out in the "latter times," and hath done so
   accordingly. And we shall have respect herein Both unto that general
   apostasy of this kind which fell out in former ages under the conduct
   of the Roman church principally, and that also which, by various ways
   and means, is at present prevailing in the world. And some things must
   be premised unto our consideration hereof:--

   1. The doctrine of the gospel is a doctrine of holiness. This it
   teacheth, requireth, and commandeth; this the mysteries and grace of it
   lead unto; this the precepts of it require; and this the great example
   of its Author, proposed in it unto us, doth enjoin. And it doth not
   this as that which is convenient for us, or some way or other necessary
   unto us, but as that without which we can have no interest in any of
   its promises. No unholy person hath any ground to expect the least
   advantage by the gospel, here or hereafter. When all things come to
   their issue, and shall fall under eternal judgment according to the
   gospel, all other pleas and pretences will utterly and for ever fail
   them who are "workers of iniquity," Matt. vii. 22, 23.

   2. The holiness which the gospel requireth is an obedience of another
   nature and kind than what is required by any other doctrine or way of
   instruction. The law of nature continueth to suggest unto us many
   important duties towards God, ourselves, and other men; the written law
   is an exact representation of all those moral duties which were
   required of us in the state wherein we were created; -- but there is a
   holiness required by the gospel, which, although it include these
   things within the compass of its law and order, yet (on sundry
   considerations) is of another kind than what is required by those laws,
   in the manner wherein it is required in them; for it proceedeth from
   other principles, on another formal reason and motives, hath other
   essential properties, acts, duties, and ends, than the obedience by
   them required hath. This hath been so fully evinced in our discourse of
   the nature and necessity of gospel holiness [11] that it need not be
   here again insisted on.

   3. Together with the light and doctrine of the gospel, or the preaching
   of it, there is an administration of the Spirit, to convince men of
   sin, righteousness, and judgment. This God hath promised, Isa. lix. 21,
   and this the Lord Christ doth effect wherever the word is orderly
   dispensed according unto his mind and will, John xvi. 7-11. Hereby are
   men wrought upon unto a profession of this holiness, and expression of
   it in outward duties; for all that religion which hath any thing of
   truth and reality in it in the world is an effect of the word and
   Spirit of Christ. Multitudes in all ages have hereby been made really
   holy, and many yet continue so to be. These (as we believe) shall never
   fall utterly from it, but shall be preserved by the power of God
   through faith unto salvation. But yet such as these also may decay as
   unto degrees in holiness and the fruitfulness of it; and in every such
   decay there is a partial apostasy and much dishonour unto Jesus Christ;
   nor doth any man know in that condition but that in the issue, as to
   his particular, it may be total, and destructive to his soul. Thus was
   it with those churches and persons whom our Lord Jesus Christ chargeth
   to have lost their first faith and love, whom he admonisheth to
   remember whence they are fallen, and to repent. And it is principally
   for the sake of these, that Christ and the gospel be not dishonoured by
   them nor their eternal concernments hazarded, and those who, in the use
   of means, are in a thriving progress towards the same condition, that
   the ensuing cautions and warnings are prepared. And others there are
   who are brought only unto a profession of this holiness in inward
   convictions and outward duties; and although they are not yet arrived
   unto a full possession of its power and conformity unto its rule, yet
   are they in the way of attaining thereunto. Such as these may, on
   various occasions, first decay in their profession and duties, and
   afterward utterly fall from them into the open service of sin and the
   world.

   Thus also it is with churches. At their first planting, they were set
   in a pure and holy state as to the doctrine, professed holiness, and
   worship of the gospel. They were all planted noble vines, wholly of a
   right seed, however they turn afterwards "into the degenerate plant of
   a strange vine." They may lose of this order and beauty, part with
   truth, decay in holiness, and the faithful city thereby become a
   harlot. How this hath come to pass; how thereby Christianity hath lost
   its glory, power, and efficacy in the world; how that blessing which it
   brought along with it unto the nations is lost and forfeited, and by
   what means, -- shall in some principal instances be declared.

   4. Where this holiness is professed, and the power of it evidenced in
   its fruits, there, and then alone, is Christ glorified and honoured in
   the world. It is true, there are other things that belong unto that
   revenue of glory which our Lord and King requireth of us, -- such are
   the profession of the truth and observance of the worship of the
   gospel, -- but if these things are disjoined and separated (as they may
   be) from holy obedience, they no way advance the glory of Christ. But
   where churches and persons professing the gospel are changed and
   renewed into the image of God; where their hearts are purified within,
   and their lives made fruitful without; where they are universally under
   the conduct of a spirit of peace, love, meekness, benignity,
   self-denial, heavenly-mindedness, and are fruitful in good works, -- in
   which things and others of an alike nature this holiness doth consist,
   -- there do they make a due representation of the gospel and its Author
   in the world; then do they evidence the power, purity, and efficacy of
   his doctrine and grace, whereby he is glorified. Herein doth he "see of
   the travail of his soul and is satisfied;" this is "his portion and the
   lot of his inheritance" in this world. But where it is otherwise, where
   men, where churches, are called by his name, and, under a profession of
   his authority and expectation of mercy and eternal blessedness from
   him, do come short of this holiness, and walk in paths contrary unto
   it, there is the holy Son of God "crucified afresh, and put to an open
   shame."

   These things being premised, way is made for the due consideration of
   what was before proposed; for whereas there is an open, shameful,
   manifest apostasy from the holiness of the gospel among the most who
   are called Christians at this day in the world, it is worth our while
   to inquire a little into the reasons or causes of it, and the means
   whereby a stop may be put unto it, or at least particular persons may
   be preserved from the guilt of it, and the judgments wherein it will
   issue. If any shall think that there is not such an apostasy in the
   world, but that the face of things in Europe and among ourselves doth
   make a due representation of the gospel, and that those things which we
   hear of and see continually amongst the generality of Christians are
   the true and genuine effects of the doctrine and principles of our
   religion, I shall no way contend with them, so as that they will but a
   little stand out of our way, and not hinder us in our progress.

   Now, the apostasy that is in the world from gospel holiness, or
   evangelical obedience, is of two kinds; for some fall from it as
   formally such, and others as to the matter of it. Of the first sort are
   they who would advance another kind of obedience, a course of another
   sort of duties, or the same as to the substance of them, but as
   proceeding from other principles and carried on by other motives than
   what it requireth, in the stead thereof. Thus it is with many in the
   world. They pretend unto a strictness in some duties, and a
   multiplication of others, at least unto a great appearance thereof; but
   it is hard for any one to discover how that which they do belongeth to
   evangelical holiness, if its nature depend on evangelical principles
   and ends. Others fall from it openly and visibly, into a sinful,
   worldly, flagitious course of life. This is that apostasy which the
   Christian world groans under at this day, and which, as it is to be
   feared, will bring the judgments of God upon it. The very profession of
   piety is much lost, yea, much derided, amongst many. Duties of
   holiness, strictness of conversation, communication unto edification,
   are not only neglected, but scorned. It is in many places a lost labour
   to seek for Christianity among Christians; and the degeneracy seems to
   be increasing every day. It is the latter of these which I principally
   intend, as that which is of most universal concernment. But the former
   also, though under many specious pretences, being of no less pernicious
   event unto many, must not be wholly passed by. I shall therefore first
   give some instances of men's declension from the holy ways of gospel
   obedience into paths of pretended duties of their own finding out, and
   add those reasons of their dislike of the good old way which give them
   occasion so to do.

   I. The first and most signal instance of this kind is given us by the
   Romanists. None boast more than they of holiness, -- that is, of their
   church, making its sanctity a note of its truth. But because the wicked
   and flagitious lives, not only of the body of the people among them,
   but of many of their chief rulers and guides, is openly manifest, in
   the defence of their confident claim, as that alone which will give
   countenance unto it, they betake themselves unto their votaries, or
   those who dedicate themselves by vow unto more strict exercises in
   religion than others attain or are obliged unto; and this sort of
   people have obtained alone the name and reputation of Religious among
   them. What is their way and manner of life, what the devotion wherein
   they spend their hours, what the duties they oblige themselves unto in
   great variety, and the manner wherein they perform them, I shall take
   for granted, and pass by as generally known. Many have already
   discovered the vanity, superstition, and hypocrisy, of the whole
   outward course wherein they are generally engaged; though they neither
   do nor ought to judge of the hearts, minds, and state of individuals,
   unless where by their deeds they manifest themselves. I shall only
   evince that what at best they pretend unto (though boasted of not only
   to be all, but more than God requireth of them) is not that holiness or
   obedience which is prescribed unto us in the gospel, but somewhat
   substituted in the room of it, and, consequently, in opposition unto
   it. And, --

   1. It hath not that evidence of spiritual freedom and liberty which
   gospel holiness, in all the duties of it, is accompanied withal. The
   first effect of the truth upon our minds is to "make us free," John
   viii. 32. It is the principle of all holiness, and enlargeth the mind
   and spirit unto it, whence it is called "The holiness of truth," Eph.
   iv. 24. So, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty," 2 Cor.
   iii. 17. Men are naturally the "servants of sin," willingly giving up
   themselves unto the fulfilling of its lusts and commands, and are only
   "free from righteousness." But where the Holy Spirit worketh with the
   word of truth, men are made "free from sin, and become servants to God,
   having their fruit unto holiness," Rom. vi. 20, 22. So it is said of
   all believers that they "have not received the spirit of bondage again
   to fear, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father,"
   Rom. viii. 15; not "the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and
   of a sound mind," 2 Tim. i. 7. The meaning of all these and the like
   testimonies is, that God by his grace enlargeth, makes free and ready,
   the hearts of believers unto all gospel obedience, so as that they
   shall walk in it, and perform all the duties of it, willingly,
   cheerfully, freely, without that fear and dread which is an effect of
   the power of the law. They are not in a scrupulous bondage unto outward
   duties and the manner of their performance, but do all things with
   delight and freedom. They have by the Spirit of adoption, as the
   reverential fear of children, so their gracious inclination unto
   obedience. But in that exercise of devotion, and multiplied outward
   duties of religion, which the Romanists boast of as their especial
   sanctity, there are great evidences of a servile bondage or slavish
   frame of spirit; for they are forced to bind themselves, and to be
   bound unto it, by especial vows, in whose observation they no more act
   as their own guardians, or as those who are "sui juris," but are under
   the coercive discipline of others, and outward punishment in case of
   failure. And those who are so servants of men in religious duties are
   not God's freemen, nor have they Christ for their Lord in that cage who
   have another. The foundation of all these duties, and which alone
   obligeth them unto their performance, are vows nowhere required by God
   or our Lord Christ in the gospel; and the principal regard which any
   have in their strict attendance unto them is the obedience which they
   owe unto the superintendents of those vows It is easy to apprehend how
   inconsistent this way is with that spiritual freedom and liberty of
   mind which inseparably accompanieth true gospel holiness. Besides, the
   opinion of merit, which not only goeth along with them, but also
   animates them in all these services, makes them servile in all they do;
   for they cannot but know that every thing in merit must not only be
   tried by the touchstone of sincerity, but weighed in the balance to the
   utmost scruple, to find out what it amounts or comes unto. And this is
   perfectly destructive of that liberty in obedience which the gospel
   requireth. So also is that tormenting persuasion which they are under
   the power of, -- namely, That they have no grounds of confidence or
   assurance that either they are accepted with God here, or shall come to
   the blessed enjoyment of him hereafter. Hence, in all duties, they must
   of necessity be acted with a "spirit of fear," and not "of power and of
   a sound mind."

   2. The rule of their duties and obedience, as to what is, in their own
   judgment, eminent therein, is not the gospel, but a system of peculiar
   laws and rules that they have framed for themselves. So some obey the
   rule of Benedict, some of Francis, some of Dominic, some of Ignatius,
   and the like. This utterly casts out their whole endeavour from any
   interest in gospel holiness; for the formal nature of that consists
   herein, that it is a conformity unto the rule of the gospel as such, or
   a compliance with the will of God as manifested therein. Hence do they
   multiply unrequited duties, yea, the principal parts of their devotion
   and sanctity consist in them which are of their own devising, for which
   they have no gospel precept or command; and such, in particular, are
   those vows which are the foundation of all that they do. In this case,
   our Saviour, reproving the Pharisees for their additional duties beyond
   the prescript of the word, shows them how they "made the commandment of
   God of none effect by their tradition," and that "in vain they
   worshipped God, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," Matt.
   xv. 6, 9. And when they were offended at his rejection of one of their
   new imposed duties, he replies that "every plant which his heavenly
   Father hath not planted should be rooted up," verse 13; so wholly
   rejecting all those religious duties which they had framed by rules of
   their own devising. Nor are these of the Roman devotionists of any
   better constitution; they are plants of men's own planting, and shall
   be rooted up accordingly and cast into the fire. Let the number of
   false invented duties of religion be never so great, let the manner of
   their performance be never so exact or severe, they serve to no other
   end but to divert the minds of men from the obedience which the gospel
   requireth.

   3. There is nothing in all that is prescribed by the masters of this
   devotion, or practised by the disciples, but it may all be done and
   observed without either faith in Christ or a sense of his love unto our
   souls. The obedience of the gospel is the "obedience of faith;" on that
   and no other root will it grow; -- and the principal motive unto it is
   the "love of Christ," which "constraineth" unto it. But what is there
   in all their prescriptions that these things are necessary unto? May
   not men rise at midnight to repeat a number of prayers, or go barefoot,
   or wear sackcloth, or abstain from flesh at certain times or always, or
   submit to discipline from themselves or others, and (if they have
   bodily strength to enable them) undergo all the horrid, and indeed
   ridiculous, hardships of standing on a pillar continually, or bearing
   great logs of wood on their shoulders all the day long, that are told
   or fabled of the Egyptian monks, without the least dram of saving faith
   or love? All false religions have ever had some amongst them who have
   had an ambition to amuse others with these self-inflictions and
   macerations, wherein the devotions among the Banians do exceed at this
   day whatever the Romanists pretend unto.

   4. The whole of what they do is so vitiated and corrupted with the
   proud opinion of merit and supererogation as renders it utterly foreign
   unto the gospel. It is not my present business to dispute against these
   opinions. It hath been already abundantly manifested (and may be yet so
   again where it is necessary) that they wholly enervate the covenant of
   grace, are injurious to the blood and mediation of Christ, and are
   utterly inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the gospel.
   Whereas, therefore, these proud imaginations do animate their whole
   course of duties, the gospel is not concerned in what they do.

   And we may add unto what hath been remarked already, the consideration
   of that gross superstition, yea, and idolatry, which they give up
   themselves unto almost in most of their devotions. This is not the
   least of their transgressions in these things, but is sufficient to
   violate all they do besides.

   Wherefore, notwithstanding their pretence unto sanctity and a more
   strict attendance unto duties of obedience than other men, yet it is
   manifest that the best of them are under a defection from the holiness
   of the gospel, substituting an obedience unto their own imaginations in
   the room thereof.

   II. Again; others confine the whole of their obedience unto morality,
   and deride whatever is pleaded as above it and beyond it, under the
   name of evangelical grace, as "enthusiastical folly." And the truth is,
   if those persons who plead for the necessity of gospel grace and
   holiness, which is more than so, do understand each other, and if
   somewhat of the same things are not intended by them under different
   expressions and diverse methods of their management, they are not of
   the same religion. But if they mistake the meaning of each other, and
   differ only in the manner of teaching the same truth, I suppose they
   steer the safest course, and are freest from just offence, who follow
   and comply with the manner wherein the things intended are taught in
   the Scripture, rather than those who accommodate their discourses unto
   the phraseology of heathen philosophers. But the truth is, the
   difference seems to be real, and the principles men proceed upon in
   these things are contradictory to each other; for some do plainly
   affirm that the whole of gospel obedience consists in the observance of
   moral virtue, which they so describe as to render it exclusive of
   evangelical grace. This others judge to contain an open declension from
   and waiving of gospel holiness. It is granted freely, that the
   performance of all moral duties evangelically, -- that is, in the power
   of the grace of Christ, unto the glory of God by him, -- is an
   essential part of gospel obedience. And whoever they are who (under the
   pretence of grace or any thing else) do neglect the improvement of
   moral virtues, or the observance of the duties of morality, they are so
   far disobedient unto the gospel and the law thereof. And some men do
   not understand how contemptible they render themselves in the
   management of their cause, when they charge others with an opposition
   unto morality or moral virtue, and setting up they know not what
   imaginary holiness in the room thereof; for those whom they so
   calumniate are not only immediately discharged from any sense of guilt
   herein by the testimony of their own consciences, but all other men, so
   far as the rule of ingenuity is extended, do, from the knowledge of
   their doctrine and observation of their practice, avouch their
   innocence.

   "But is it not so, then, that men do condemn morality, as that which is
   not to be trusted unto, but will deceive them that rest in or upon it?"
   I answer, They do so when it is made (as it is by some) the whole of
   religion, and as it is obtruded into the place of evangelical grace and
   holiness by others. They take moral virtue, as it always was taken
   until of late, for natural honesty, or such a conformity of life unto
   the light of nature as to be useful and approved among men. But this
   may be, -- men may do what is morally good, and yet never do any thing
   that is accepted with God; for they may do it, but not for the love of
   God above all, but for the love of self. And therefore they charge
   morality with an insufficiency unto the end of religion, or the saving
   of the souls of men, --

   1. Where nothing is intended by it but that whereof the rule and
   measure is the light of nature: for that doth direct unto every duty
   that is properly moral; and what it doth not direct unto, what is not
   naturally by the law of our creation obligatory unto all mankind,
   cannot be called moral. Now, to confine all religion, as to the
   preceptive and obediential part of it, unto the light of nature, is to
   evacuate one half of the gospel.

   2. Where it is in practice an effect of conviction only, and performed
   in the innate strength of the rational faculties of our souls, without
   the especial supernatural aid of the Spirit and grace of God, Whatever
   name any thing may be called by that is not wrought in us by the grace
   of God, as well as by us in a way of duty, is foreign unto evangelical
   obedience. And those who reject morality as insufficient unto
   acceptation with God and eternal salvation, intend only what is of that
   kind performed in the power of our natural faculties externally excited
   and directed, without any supernatural influence or operation of
   especial grace; and, indeed, so to place a confidence in such duties is
   open Pelagianism.

   3. Where it proceedeth not from the spiritual, supernatural renovation
   of our souls. The rule and method of the gospel is, that the tree be
   first made good, and then the fruit will be so also. Unless a person be
   first regenerate, and his nature therein renewed into the image and
   likeness of God, -- unless he be endued with a new principle of
   spiritual life from above, enabling him to live unto God, he can do
   nothing, of whatsoever sort it be, that is absolutely acceptable unto
   God. And it is especially under this consideration that any reject
   morality as not comprehensive of gospel obedience, yea, as that which
   is apt to draw off the mind from it, and which will deceive them that
   trust to it, -- namely, that it proceedeth not from the principle of
   grace in a renewed soul; for whatever doth so, though it may be
   originally of a moral nature in itself, yet from the manner of its
   performance it becomes gracious and evangelical And we need not fear to
   exclude the best works of unrenewed persons from being any part of
   gospel holiness or obedience.

   4. Where those in whom it is, or who pretend unto it, are really
   destitute of the internal light of saving grace, enabling them to
   discern spiritual things in a spiritual manner, and to know the
   mysteries of the kingdom of God. That there is such a saving light
   wrought in the minds of believers by the Holy Ghost, that without it
   men cannot discern spiritual things, so as to favour, like, and approve
   of them, hath been elsewhere at large demonstrated. But this belongs
   not unto the morality contended about. It is not only independent of
   it, but is indeed set up in competition with it and opposition unto it.
   No man need fear to judge and censure that morality, as unto its
   interest in gospel obedience and sufficiency unto the salvation of the
   souls of men, which may be obtained, practised, and lived up unto,
   where God doth not "shine in the hearts of men, to give them the light
   of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ;" where no
   work of spiritual illumination hath been in their minds, enabling them
   to discern and know the mind of God, which none knoweth originally but
   the Spirit of God, by Whom it is made [known] unto us, 1 Cor. ii. 11,
   12. Yet this is that which some men seem to take up withal and rest in,
   unto the rejection of evangelical obedience.

   Lastly, The same censure is to be passed on it wherever it is separable
   from those fundamental gospel graces which, both in their nature, acts,
   and objects, are purely supernatural, having no principle, rule, or
   measure, but truth supernaturally revealed. Such, in particular, is the
   whole regard we have unto the mediation of Christ, as also unto the
   dispensation of the Spirit, promised to abide with the church for ever
   as its comforter, with all the duties of obedience which depend
   thereon. He is ignorant of the gospel that knows not that in these
   things do lie the fundamental principles of its doctrine and precepts,
   and that in the exercise of those graces in a way of duty which
   immediately concern them, consist the principal parts of the life of
   God, or of that obedience unto him by Jesus Christ which is
   indispensably required of all that shall be saved. Whereas, therefore,
   these things cannot be esteemed merely moral virtues, nor do at all
   belong unto, but are considered as separate from, all that morality
   which is judged insufficient unto life and salvation, it is evident
   that it is not in the least dealt withal too severely, nor censured
   more harshly than it doth deserve. If, therefore, any betake themselves
   hereunto as to the whole of their duty, it comes under the account of
   that partial defection from the gospel which we inquire into.

   III. Some there are who, as unto themselves, pretend they have attained
   unto perfection already in this world; such a perfection in all degrees
   of holiness as the gospel is but an introduction towards. But this
   proud imagination, destructive of the covenant of grace, of all use of
   the mediation and blood of Christ, contrary to innumerable testimonies
   of Scripture and the experience of all that do believe, and concerning
   which their own consciences do reprove the pretenders unto it, needs
   not detain us in its examination. It is sufficient unto our present
   design to have given these instances how men may, in a pretended
   conscientious discharge of many duties of obedience, yet fall off and
   decline from that which the gospel requireth. The occasions and reasons
   hereof (supposing those more general before considered with respect
   unto the truth of the gospel, which all of them take place here, and
   have their influence upon their dislike of its holiness) may be briefly
   inquired into and represented; nor shall we confine ourselves unto the
   instances given, but take in the consideration of every declension from
   it which on any account befalls them who, having had a conviction of
   its necessity, yet refuse to come unto its universal practice. And to
   this end we may observe, --

   1. That the holiness which the gospel requireth will not be kept up or
   maintained, either in the hearts or lives of men, without a continual
   conflict, warring, contending; and that with all care, diligence,
   watchfulness, and perseverance therein. It is our warfare, and the
   Scripture abounds in the discovery of the adversaries we have to
   conflict withal, their power and subtlety, as also in directions and
   encouragements unto their resistance. To suppose that gospel obedience
   will be maintained in our hearts and lives without a continual
   management of a vigorous warfare against its enemies, is to deny the
   Scripture and the experience of all that do believe and obey God in
   sincerity. Satan, sin, and the world, are continually assault-hag of
   it, and seeking to ruin its interest in us. The devil will not be
   resisted (which it is our duty to do, 1 Pet. v. 8, 9) without a sharp
   contest and conflict; in the management whereof we are commanded to
   "take unto ourselves the whole armour of God," Eph. vi. 12, 13.
   "Fleshly lusts" do continually "war against our souls," 1 Pet. ii. 11;
   and if we maintain not a warfare unto the end against them, they will
   be our ruin. Nor will the power of the world be any otherwise avoided
   than by a victory over it, 1 John v. 4; which will not be carried
   without contending. But I suppose it needs no great confirmation unto
   any who know what it is to serve and obey God in temptations, that the
   life of faith and race of holiness will not be preserved nor continued
   in without a severe striving, labouring, contending, warring with
   diligence, watchfulness, and perseverance; so that I shall at present
   take it as a principle, notionally at least, agreed upon by the
   generality of Christians. If we like not to be holy on these terms, we
   must let it alone; for on any other we shall never be so. If we faint
   in this course, if we give it over, if we think what we aim at herein
   not to be worth the obtaining or preserving by such a severe contention
   all our days, we must be content to be without it. Nothing doth so
   promote the interest of hell and destruction in the world as a
   presumption that a lazy, slothful performance of some duties and
   abstinence from some sins, is that which God will accept of as our
   obedience. Crucifying of sin, mortifying our inordinate affections,
   contesting against the whole interest of the flesh, Satan, and the
   world, and that in inward actings of grace and all instances of outward
   duties, and that always while we live in this world, are required of us
   hereunto.

   Here lies the first spring of the apostasy of many in the world, of
   them especially who betake themselves unto and take up satisfaction in
   another way of duties than what the gospel requireth. They had, it is
   possible, by their light and convictions, made so near approaches unto
   it as to see what an incessant travail of soul is required unto its
   attainment and preservation.

   They are like the Israelites travelling in the wilderness towards the
   land of Canaan. When they came near unto the borders and entrance of
   it, they sent some to spy it out, that they might know the nature and
   state of the land and country whither they were going. These, for their
   encouragement, and to evince the fruitfulness of the earth, bring unto
   them "a branch with one cluster of grapes," so great and fair that
   "they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought also
   pomegranates and figs," Num. xiii. 23. But withal, they told them of
   the hideous difficulties they were to conflict withal, in that the
   people were strong, their cities walled, and the Anakims dwelling
   amongst them, verse 28. This utterly disheartens the carnal people,
   and, notwithstanding the prospect they had of the "land that flowed
   with milk and honey," back again they go into the wilderness, and there
   they perish.

   So it is with these persons. Notwithstanding the near approach they
   have made, by light and convictions, unto the kingdom of God (as our
   Saviour told the young man, who was as one of them, Mark xii. 34), and
   the prospect they have of the beauty of holiness, yet they turn off
   from it again, and perish in the wilderness: for upon the view they
   have of the difficulties which lie in the conflict mentioned, they fall
   under many disadvantages, which at length utterly divert them from its
   pursuit; as, --

   (1.) Weariness of the flesh, not enduring to comply with that constant
   course of duties continually returning upon it which is required
   thereunto. Various pleas will be made for an exemption from them, at
   least in some troublesome instances; and the carnal mind will not want
   pretences to countenance the flesh in its weariness. Hereon one duty
   after another is first omitted and then utterly foregone. Neglect of a
   vigorous constancy in subduing the body and bringing of it into
   subjection, commended by the apostle in his own example, 1 Cor. ix. 27,
   is with many the beginning of this kind of apostasy. These things, I
   say, will ofttimes fall out, that through the weariness and aversation
   of the flesh, countenanced by various pretences of the carnal mind,
   sundry duties will be omitted. But this is the faith and trial of the
   saints; here is the difference between sound believers and those who
   are acted only by convictions: Those of the first sort will, sooner or
   later (for the most part speedily), be humbled for such omissions, and
   recover their former diligence, according to the prayer of the
   psalmist, Ps. cxix. 176; but where this ground is won by the flesh, and
   men grow satisfied under the loss of any duty, it is an evidence of a
   hypocritical, backsliding heart.

   (2.) When men are come unto the height of their convictions, and
   proceed no farther, indwelling sin, with its lusts and corrupt
   affections (which have for a while been checked and mated by light),
   will insensibly prevail, and weary the mind with solicitations for the
   exercise of its old dominion; for the spring of it being not dried, the
   bitter root of it being not digged up nor withered, it will not cease
   until it hath broke down all the bounds that were fixed unto it, and
   bear down convictions with force and violence.

   (3.) Ignorance of the true way of making application unto the Lord
   Christ for grace and supplies of the Spirit, to bring them unto or
   preserve them in a state of gospel holiness, is of the same importance.
   Without this, to dream of being holy according unto the mind of God is
   to renounce the gospel. We need not look farther for men's apostasy
   than this, if they are satisfied with such a holiness, such an
   obedience, as is not derived unto us by the grace of Christ, nor
   wrought in us by the Spirit of Christ, nor preserved in us by the power
   of Christ. The way hereof such persons are always ignorant of, and at
   length do openly despise; yet may men as well see without the sun or
   light, or breathe without the air, or live without natural spirits, as
   engage into or abide in the practice of gospel holiness without
   continual applications unto Christ, the fountain of all grace, for
   spiritual strength enabling thereunto. The way and means hereof these
   persons being ignorant of and unacquainted withal, the holiness which
   the gospel requireth becomes unto them a thing strange and burdensome;
   which therefore they desert and refuse. If, therefore, it be true that
   without Christ we can do nothing, -- that in our life unto God he
   liveth in us, and efficiently is our life; if from him, as the head,
   nourishment is supplied unto every living member of the body; if the
   life which we lead be by the faith of the Son of God; and if the only
   way of deriving these things and all supplies of spiritual strength
   from him be by the exercise of faith in him, -- it follows unavoidably
   that all those who are unacquainted with this way, who know not how to
   make their application unto him for this end and purpose, can never
   persevere in a pursuit of gospel holiness. So hath it fallen out and no
   otherwise with them concerning whom we speak. As ignorance of the
   righteousness of God, or of Christ being the end of the law for
   righteousness unto them that do believe, is the reason why men go about
   to establish a righteousness of their own, and will not submit to the
   righteousness of God; so ignorance of the grace which is continually to
   be received from Christ in a way of believing, that we may be holy with
   gospel holiness, is the reason why so many turn off from it unto
   another kind of holiness of their own framing, which yet is not
   another, because it is none at all. But many are so far from
   endeavouring after or abiding in gospel holiness on this foundation of
   continual supplies of grace from Jesus Christ to that end, as that they
   avowedly despise all holiness and obedience springing from that
   fountain or growing on that root; in which case God will judge. In the
   meantime, I say (and the matter is evident) that one principal reason
   why men turn off from it upon the prospect of the difficulties that
   attend it, and the oppositions that are made unto it, is their unbelief
   and ignorance of the way of making application unto Christ by faith for
   supplies of spiritual strength and grace.

   (4.) Unacquaintedness with the true nature of evangelical repentance is
   another cause hereof. This is that grace which comfortably carrieth the
   souls of believers through all their failings, infirmities, and sins;
   nor are they able to live to God one day without the constant exercise
   of it. They find it as necessary unto the continuance of spiritual life
   as faith itself. It is not only a means of our entrance into, but it
   belongs essentially unto, our gospel state and our continuance therein.
   Hereunto belongs that continual humble self-abasement, from a sense of
   the majesty and holiness of God, with the disproportion of the best of
   our duties unto his will, which believers live and walk in continually;
   and he that is not sensible of a gracious sweetness and usefulness
   therein knows not what it is to walk with God. Hereby doth God
   administer several encouragements unto our souls to abide in our way of
   obedience, notwithstanding the many discouragements and despondencies
   we meet withal. In brief, take it away, and you overthrow faith, and
   hope, and all other graces. Those, therefore, who are unacquainted with
   the nature and use of this grace and duty, who can taste no spiritual
   refreshment in all its sorrows, who know nothing of it but legal
   troubles, anguish, fear, and distraction, will not endure the thought
   of living in the practice of it all their days; which yet is as
   necessary unto gospel holiness as faith itself. Men, I say, falling
   into this condition, finding all these difficulties to conflict withal,
   and lying under these disadvantages, if any thing will offer itself in
   the room of this costly holiness, will readily embrace it. Hence, as
   some betake themselves unto a pretence of morality (which as unto many
   is a mere pretence, and made use of only to countenance themselves in a
   neglect of the whole of that obedience which the gospel openly
   requireth), so others do, under other expressions, retreat unto the
   mere duties of their own light, and these as only required therein,
   with some peculiar reliefs unto the flesh in what is burdensome unto
   it. As, for instance: There is nothing that the flesh more riseth up in
   a dislike of and opposition unto than constancy in the duty of prayer,
   in private, in families, on all occasions, especially if attended unto
   in a spiritual manner, as the gospel doth require; but in itself, and
   as to the substance of it, it is a duty which the light of nature
   exacteth of us; -- but whereas this may prove burdensome to the flesh,
   a relief is borrowed from a pretence of gospel light and liberty, that
   men need not pray at any time unless their own spirits or light do
   previously require it of them: which is to turn the grace of God into
   an occasion of sinning. By this means some have gotten a holiness,
   wherein, for the most part, it seems indifferent to them whether they
   pray at any time or no. And other instances of the like kind might be
   given. Upon the whole matter, to free themselves from this state, so
   uneasy to flesh and blood, so contrary unto all the imaginations of the
   carnal mind, some men have betaken themselves unto another, wherein
   they have, or pretend to have, no conflict against sin, nor to need any
   application unto the Lord Christ for supplies of spiritual strength;
   which belongs not unto that holiness which the gospel requires and
   which God accepts.

   It may be said that in some of the instances before given, especially
   in that of the Papacy, there is an appearance of a greater conflict
   with and more hardships put on the flesh than in any other way of
   obedience that is pleaded for; and there is indeed such an appearance,
   but it is no more. The oppositions that arise against their austerities
   are from without, or from nature as it is weak, but not as it is carnal
   It is possible that sin may not be concerned in what they do, neither
   in its power nor reign; yea, so far as it is leavened by superstition,
   it acts itself therein no less than it doth in others by fleshly lusts.
   But it is an internal, spiritual, immediate opposition unto its being
   and all its actings, that it riseth up with such rage against as to
   weary those who have not that living principle of faith whereto the
   victory over it doth peculiarly appertain.

   2. This evangelical holiness will not allow of nor will consist with
   the constant, habitual omission of any one duty, or the satisfaction of
   any one lust of the mind or of the flesh. As we are, in all instances
   of duty, to be "perfecting holiness in the fear of God," 2 Cor. vii. 1,
   so "no provision is to be made for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
   thereof," Rom. xiii. 14. This is that which loseth it so many friends
   in the world. Would it barter with the flesh, would it give and take
   allowances in any kind, or grant indulgence unto any one sin,
   multitudes would have a kindness for it which now bid it defiance.
   Every one would have an exemption for that sin which he likes best, and
   which is most suited to his inclinations and carnal interests. And this
   would be virtually a dispensation for all unholiness whatever. But
   these are the terms of the gospel: No one duty is to be neglected, no
   one sin is to be indulged; and they are looked upon as intolerable.
   Naaman would not give himself up unto the worship of the God of Israel
   but with this reserve, that he might also bow in the house of Rimmon,
   whereon his power and preferment did depend. Many things the young man
   in the Gospel boasted himself to have done, and was doubtless willing
   to continue in the performance of them; but yet, through his whole
   course, the love of the world had the prevalency in him, and when he
   was tried in that instance, rather than relinquish it he gave up the
   whole. But this is the law of the gospel. Although it provide a
   merciful relief against those daily sins which we are overtaken withal
   by our frailty and weakness, or surprised into by the power of
   temptations, against the bent of our minds and habitual inclination of
   our wills, 1 Pet. iv. 1, 2, yet it alloweth not the cherishing or
   practice of any one sin whatever, internal or external. An habitual
   course in any sin is utterly inconsistent with evangelical obedience, 1
   John iii. 6-9, yea, it requireth indispensably that we be engaged, in
   our minds and wills, in an opposition unto all sin, and in a constant
   endeavour after its not-being in us, either in the root or in the fruit
   thereof. It will not connive at or comply with any inordinate
   affection, any habitual sinful distemper, nor the first motions of sin
   that are in the flesh. This is that perfection which is required in the
   new covenant, Gen. xvii. 1, that sincerity, integrity, freedom from
   guile, walking after the Spirit, and not after the flesh, and that
   newness of life, which the gospel everywhere prescribeth unto us. On no
   other terms but universality in obedience and opposition unto sin will
   it approve of us, 1 John iii. 7-10.

   And this occasioneth the turning aside of many from the pursuit of an
   endeavour to be holy, according unto the rule of the gospel. When by
   light and convictions they come to take a view of what is required
   thereunto, it disliketh them, they cannot bear it; and therefore they
   either at once or gradually give over all ways of pursuing their first
   design. And men break with the gospel on this account by the means
   ensuing:--

   (1.) They cannot make the same judgment of sin that the gospel doth,
   nor will judge all those things to be sin and evil which the gospel
   declares so to be; yea, we have some come unto that pharisaism, that
   they scarce think any thing to be sinful or worth taking notice of
   unless it be openly flagitious. Under this darkness and ignorance, all
   sorts of filthy, noisome lusts may be cherished in the hearts of men,
   keeping them at as great and real a distance from the holiness of truth
   as the most outrageous outward sins can do. And this neglect or refusal
   to comply with the rule of the gospel before laid down is grounded in
   and promoted by two occasions:--

   [1.] They have a willing insensibility of the guilt of some unmortified
   lust. This they will abide in and cherish; for their minds being
   habituated unto it, they find no great evil in it, nor do see any
   cogent reason why they should forego it. So was it with the young man
   with respect unto the love of the world. He was sorry that he could not
   be evangelically obedient whilst he retained it; but seeing that could
   not be, he did not discern any such evil in, nor was sensible of any
   such guilt from it, nor could apprehend any such equality in or
   necessity of gospel holiness, that he should renounce the one for the
   embracing the other. So will it be when any lust is made familiar unto
   the mind; it will not be terrified with it, nor can see any great
   danger in it. It is between such a soul and sin as it is between the
   devil and the witch, or one that hath a familiar spirit, as we render
   the Hebrew "ob" ['vv?] and "yideoni," [ydny?]. At the first appearance
   of the devil, be it in what shape it will, it cannot but bring a tremor
   and fear on human nature, but after a while he becomes a familiar; and
   when alone he is to be feared, he is not feared at all. The poor
   deceived wretch then thinks him in his power, so that he can use or
   command him as he sees good, whereas he himself is absolutely in the
   power of the devil. Men may be startled with sin in its first
   appearance, on their first convictions, or its first dangerous efforts;
   but when it is become their familiar, they suppose it a thing in their
   own power, which they can use or not use as they see occasion, though
   indeed themselves are the servants of corruption, being overcome
   thereby and brought into bondage. Hence it is inconceivable how little
   sense of guilt in some sins men find after they are habituated unto
   them. In some sins, I say, for with respect unto sins absolutely
   against the light of nature, conscience will not easily be bribed not
   to condemn them. It will not in such cases be speechless, until it be
   seared and made senseless. But there are sins not accompanied with so
   great an evidence, yet attended with no less guilt than those which
   directly militate against the light of nature. In this case, when the
   word of the gospel comes as it is "living and powerful, sharper than
   any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul
   and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, as a discoverer and judge of
   the thoughts and intents of the heart;" when it comes and discovers the
   secret frames, figments, imaginations, and inclinations of the mind,
   and condemneth what is in the least measure or manner irregular; when
   it will not be put off, nor accept of any composition or compensation
   by the most strict and rigid profession in other things, -- men are
   ready to withdraw themselves to the rule of their own light and reason,
   which they find more gentle and tractable.

   [2.] A dereliction of the gospel on this account, with respect unto the
   inwardness, spirituality, and extent of its commands, is much increased
   under the influence of corrupt opinions. And of this nature are all
   those which tend unto the extenuation of sin; for some there are who
   suppose that there is not such a provoking guilt, such a spiritual
   outrage in sin, as others pretend. Hence multitudes, as they judge, are
   needlessly troubled and perplexed about it. "A generous mind, free from
   superstitious fears and dark conceits imbibed in education, will
   deliver the mind of man from the trouble of such apprehensions; -- a
   great sense of the guilt of small sins is an engine to promote the
   interest of preachers, and those who pretend to the conduct of
   conscience; -- the filth and pollution of sin is a metaphor which few
   can understand, and none ought to be concerned in; -- that the power of
   the remainders of indwelling sin is a foolish notion; and that the
   disorderly frames of the heart and the mind, through darkness,
   deadness, spiritual indisposition, or other secret irregularities, are
   fancies, not sins, which we need not be troubled at ourselves, nor make
   any acknowledgment of unto God;" -- these and the like opinions are the
   pharisaical corban of our age, corrupting the whole law of our
   obedience. And it were easy to manifest how perilous and ruinous they
   are unto the souls of men; what powerful instruments in the hand of
   Satan to eclipse the glory of the grace of Christ on the one hand, and
   to promote apostasy from holiness in the hearts and lives of men on the
   other. I shall only say, set the corrupt heart of men by any means at
   liberty from an awe and reverence of the holiness of God and his law
   with respect unto the inward actings and frames of the soul, with a
   sense of guilt where they are irregular, and a necessity of constant
   humiliation before God thereon, and an equally constant application of
   itself unto the Lord Christ for grace and mercy, and it is wholly in
   vain to think of fixing any bounds unto the progress of sin. The
   ignorance hereof is that which hath produced in some the proud
   imagination of perfection, when they are far enough from bringing their
   consciences and lives to the rule of the gospel, but only aggravate
   their guilt by attempting to bend that inflexible rule unto their own
   perverse and crooked minds.

   (2.) In this case, carnal interest, which takes in and compriseth all
   the circumstances of men, calls for an indulgence unto some one sin or
   other, which the gospel will not admit of. Pride or ambition,
   covetousness or love of this present evil world and the perishing
   things of it, uncleanness or sensuality in eating and drinking,
   self-exaltation and boasting, vain-glory, idleness, one or other must
   be spared. One thing or other, I say, on the account of carnal
   interest, -- either because small, or useful, or general, or suited
   unto a natural temper, or, as is supposed, made necessary by the
   occasions of life, -- must be reserved. Where this resolution prevails,
   as men are absolutely excluded from any real interest in gospel
   holiness, which will admit of no such reserves, so it will not fail to
   lead them into open apostasy of one kind or other; for, --

   [1.] Such persons are unapproved of God in all that they do, and so
   have no ground for expectation of his blessing or assistance; for the
   allowance of the least sin is such an impeachment of sincerity as
   casteth a man out of covenant communion with God. This is that
   "offending in one point" which ruins a man's obedience, and renders him
   guilty against the whole law, James ii. 10. Any one actual sin makes a
   man guilty of the curse of the whole law as it contains the covenant of
   works; and the willing allowance of a man's self in any one sin
   habitually breaks the whole law as it contains the rule of our
   obedience in the covenant of grace. And if in this disapproved
   condition men meet with outward prosperity in the world, their danger
   will be increased as well as their guilt aggravated. And the utmost
   care of professors is required in this matter; for there seems to be
   among many an open indulgence unto habitual disorders, which hazards
   their whole covenant interest, and must fill them with uncertainty in
   their own minds. High time it is for all such persons to shake off
   "every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset them, and to run
   with redoubled diligence" the remainder of "the race that is set before
   them."

   [2.] This indulgence unto any one sin will make way in the minds,
   consciences, and affections of men, for the admission of other sins
   also. It will be like a thief that is hidden in a house, and only waits
   an opportunity to open the doors unto his other companions; to this end
   he watcheth for a season of sleep and darkness, when there is none to
   observe his actings. Let a person who thus alloweth himself to live in
   any sin fall into temptation whilst he is a little more than ordinary
   careless, his allowed corruption shall open his heart unto any other
   sin that offers for admission. "Look not," saith the wise man, "upon
   the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it
   moveth itself aright. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine
   heart shall utter perverse things," Prov. xxiii. 31, 33. One sin liked
   and loved will make way for every other. There is a kindred and
   alliance between sins of all sorts, and they agree in the same end and
   design. Where any one is willingly entertained, others will intrude
   themselves beyond all our power of resistance.

   [3.] It will divert the soul from the use of those means whereby all
   other sins should be resisted, and thereby apostasy prevented; for
   there is no means appointed or sanctified by God for the resistance or
   mortification of sin, but it opposeth sin as sin, and consequently
   every thing that is so, and that because it is so. Wherefore, whoever
   willingly reserves any one sin from the efficacy of the means God hath
   appointed for its mortification doth equally reserve all. And as those
   means do lose their power and efficacy towards such persons, so they
   will insensibly fall off from a conscientious attendance unto any of
   those ways and duties whereby sin should be opposed and ruined. 3. Many
   of the graces in whose exercise this evangelical holiness doth
   principally consist are such as are of no reputation in the world. The
   greatest moralists that ever were, whether Pharisees or philosophers,
   could never separate between their love and practice of virtue on the
   one hand, and their own honour, glory, and reputation on the other.
   There was in them, as the poet expresseth it in one instance, --


   "Amor patriæ, laudumque immensa cupido."

   Hence they always esteemed those virtues the most excellent which had
   the best acceptation and the greatest vogue of praise among men. And it
   seems to be ingrafted in the nature of man to have some kind of desire
   to be approved in what men judge themselves to do well and laudably.
   Neither is this desire so evil in itself but that it may be managed in
   subordination unto the glory of God; which nothing that is absolutely
   evil, or in its own nature or any considerations or circumstances, can
   be. But when at any time it swells into an excess, and the pharisaical
   leaven of being seen and praised of men puffeth it up, it is the worst
   poison that the mind can be infected withal. In what degree soever it
   be admitted, in the same it alienates the mind from gospel holiness;
   and it doth so effectually, -- I mean this self-love and love of the
   praise of others doth so, -- for the reason mentioned, namely, that the
   graces in whose exercise it doth principally consist are of no
   reputation in the world. Such are meekness, gentleness, self-denial,
   poverty of spirit, mourning for sin, hungering and thirsting after
   righteousness, mercy and compassion, purity of heart, openness and
   simplicity of spirit, readiness to undergo and forgive injuries, zeal
   for God, contempt of the world, fear of sin, dread of God's judgment
   for sin, and the like. These are those adornings of the inner man of
   the heart which with God are of great price. But as unto their
   reputation in the world, "weakness, softness of nature, superstitious
   folly, madness, hypocritical preciseness," is the best measure they
   meet withal. When men begin to discern that as unto this holiness of
   the gospel, its principal work lies within doors, in the heart and
   mind, in the things that no mortal eye seeth and few commend so much as
   in the notion of them, and which in their outward exercise meet with no
   good entertainment in the world, they betake themselves unto and rest
   in those duties which make a better appearance and meet with better
   acceptance; and many of them are such as, in their proper place, are
   diligently to be attended unto, provided they draw not off the mind
   from an attendance unto those despised graces and their exercise
   wherein the life of true holiness doth consist. And it is well if we
   are all sufficiently aware of the deceits of Satan in this matter. In
   the beginnings of the general apostasy from the power and purity of
   Christian religion, to countenance all sorts of persons in a neglect of
   the principal graces of the gospel, the necessity of regeneration, and
   a heavenly principle of spiritual life, they were put wholly on outward
   splendid works of piety and charity, as they were esteemed. Let their
   minds be defiled, their lusts unmortified, their hearts unhumbled,
   their whole souls unfurnished of spiritual and heavenly graces, yet (as
   they would have it) these outward works should assuredly bring them all
   unto a blessed immortality and glory! But this face of the covering,
   this veil that was spread over many nations, being now in many places
   (particularly among us) rent and destroyed, both wisdom and much
   circumspection are required, that, either under a pretence or under a
   real endeavour after the inward spiritual graces of Christ and their
   due exercise, we do not countenance ourselves in the neglect of those
   outward duties which are any way useful unto the glory of God and the
   good of mankind.

   These are some of the causes, and others there are of an alike nature,
   from the powerful influence whereof upon their minds men have changed
   gospel holiness for other ways of obedience, which also they give other
   names unto.

Chapter IX.

   Apostasy into profaneness and sensuality of life -- The causes and
   occasions of it -- Defects in public teachers and guides in religion.

   That which yet remaineth to be considered under this head of
   backsliding from the commands of the gospel and the obedience required
   of them is of a worse kind and of a more pernicious consequence; and
   this is that open apostasy into profaneness and sensuality of life
   which the generality of them who are called Christians are in most
   places of the world visibly fallen into. If any be otherwise minded, if
   they suppose and judge that the ways and walkings of the generality of
   churches and individual Christians, of whole nations that profess
   themselves to be so, are such as the gospel requireth and approveth of,
   they seem either to be ignorant of the true state of these things in
   the world, or to be highly injurious unto the grace and truth which
   came by Jesus Christ. To suppose that he by his gospel giveth
   countenance unto or conniveth at that darkness, profaneness,
   sensuality, those bloody contentions and oppressions, in a word, all
   those filthy and noxious lusts, which at this day have overwhelmed the
   Christian world, is to do what we can to render and represent it not
   only useless, but extremely pernicious unto mankind; for we do say
   therein that by him and his doctrine countenance is given unto that
   degeneracy in wickedness which heathenism would not allow, whereby the
   world is filled with confusion, and in danger to be precipitated into
   ruin. I shall therefore at present take it for granted (with the
   highest readiness to give up that concession when any tolerable
   evidence shall be given to the contrary) that there is, among and in
   the churches whereunto the generality of Christians do reckon
   themselves to belong, a visible apostasy from that piety, holiness, and
   righteousness, which the gospel indispensably requireth in all the
   disciples of Christ, and which the primitive Christians did earnestly
   follow and eminently abound in. An inquiry into the means and causes
   hereof is that which now lies before us. And that especial instance
   which I shall always regard is the church of Rome; which, as it hath
   given the most eminent example of apostasy in this kind of any church
   in the world, so whatever of the same nature befalleth others, it is
   sufficiently represented therein.

   The immediate internal causes (which are, as the rise and original of
   all sins, so of those wherein this apostasy doth consist, because they
   are not peculiar hereunto, but equally respect all sins at all times)
   belong not unto our present inquiry. By these causes I intend, in
   general, the depravation of nature; the power and deceitfulness of sin;
   love of the world, the profits, honours, and pleasures of it; the rage
   of the flesh after the satisfaction of its sensual lusts; with the
   aversation of the minds of men from things spiritual and heavenly, as
   being "alienated from the life of God" through the darkness and
   ignorance that is in them: for these and the like depraved affections,
   being excited and acted by the crafty influences of Satan, and inflamed
   with temptations, do incline, induce, and carry men into all manner of
   wickedness with delight and greediness, James i. 14, 15. But whereas
   all these things in general respect equally all times, occasions, and
   sins; and whereas it is the constant work of the ministers of the
   gospel (those, I mean, who understand their employment, with the
   account they must give of the souls committed unto their charge) to
   discover the nature, detect the deceit, and warn men of the danger, of
   these principles and occasions of sin within them and without them, --
   I shall not need particularly here to insist upon them. It is the more
   public external means and causes which have produced, furthered, and
   promoted the apostasy complained of, that we shall take under
   consideration.

   I. The first occasion hereof, in all ages, hath been given by or taken
   from the public readers, guides, or leaders of the people in the matter
   of religion. I intend them of all sorts, however called, styled, or
   distinguished, into what forms or orders soever they are cast by
   themselves or others; and I name them so at large, because it is known
   how variously they are multiplied, especially in the church of Rome,
   where, as to these parts of the world, this apostasy began, and by
   which it is principally promoted, and that by all sorts of them. These
   at all times have, and must have, an especial influence into the
   holiness or unholiness of the people; yea, the purity or apostasy of
   the church, as to outward means, doth principally depend upon them,
   with the discharge of their office and duty. In many things they
   succeed into the room of the priests of old, and frequently fall under
   the command and rebuke given unto them, Mal. ii. 1-9, "O ye priests,
   this commandment is for you. If ye will not hear, and if ye will not
   lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I
   will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea,
   I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. Behold,
   I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the
   dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it. And ye
   shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant
   might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. My covenant was with him
   of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he
   feared me, and was afraid before my name. The law of truth was in his
   mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in
   peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. For the
   priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at
   his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. But ye are
   departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye
   have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore
   have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people,
   according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the
   law."

   That holy, humble, laborious ministry, which Christ first instituted in
   the church, was the great means of converting men unto evangelical
   obedience and the preserving of them therein. This their doctrine,
   their spirit, their example, their manner and course of life, their
   prayers: preaching, and entire endeavours, tended unto, and were
   blessed and prospered of God unto that purpose. Then were the lives of
   Christians a transcript of the truth of the gospel. But through the
   degeneracy of the following ages, those who succeeded them became
   troubled fountains, polluting and corrupting all the streams of
   Christian religion It is no uneasy thing to observe, in the course of
   ecclesiastical records and stories, how, by various degrees, the
   leaders of the church became corrupt, and did corrupt the people,
   giving them in themselves an example of strifes, divisions, ambition,
   worldly-mindedness; and, by their negligence in discharge of their
   duty, depriving them of the means of being made better by the power of
   the doctrine and commands of the gospel. Under the old testament, the
   priests and prophets led the people into a double apostasy:-- First,
   Into that of superstition and idolatry, Jer. xxiii. 9-15; and this
   continued prevailing among them until their sin issued in a desolating
   calamity. This was the Babylonish captivity, wherein all their idols
   were buried in the land of Shinar, Zech. v. 11. Secondly, After the
   return of the people from thence, when they would no more be inveigled
   into idolatry, whereof God designed that captivity for an effectual
   cure, the same sort of persons, by negligence, ignorance, and their
   evil example in profaneness, turned them off from God and his law. This
   was begun in the days of Malachi, the last of the prophets, and ended
   in the total apostasy and destruction of that church and people. And
   when the whole came unto its last issue in the rejection of the Lord
   Christ, the Son of God, the same sort of persons, even the guides and
   teachers, led, and even forced, the body of the people into that great
   rebellion and impenitency therein, as is evidently declared in the
   gospel. And it is to be feared that something of the like nature hath
   fallen out among Christians also. The first apostasy the Christian
   world fell into was by superstition and idolatry, principally under the
   conduct of the church of Rome; and this, as it will always be, was
   accompanied with wickedness of life in all sorts of persons. Many
   churches and nations being delivered from this abomination, it is well
   if, by the same means, they are not falling into that of a worldly,
   sensual, profane conversation.

   The Scripture is so full on this subject, and the nature of the thing
   itself is such, as seems to require a deep and thorough consideration
   of it; but the nature of my design will not admit of enlargement on any
   particular head, for I intend only to point at the chief springs and
   occasions of this evil, and accordingly this part of our subject must
   be only briefly (as that preceding) treated on.

   What was before asserted in general, namely, that the well-being of the
   church depends on the right discharge of the office of the ministry,
   will, I suppose, be acknowledged by all; and it is plainly declared by
   the apostle, Eph. iv. 11-15. In proportion thereunto it will thrive or
   decay. The nature of this office, the ends of its institution, the
   works and duties of it, with the universal experience of all ages and
   places, do evince this observation beyond all contradiction. If,
   therefore, those who undertake the exercise of this office do eminently
   and notoriously fail in the performance and discharge of the duties
   thereof, especially if they do so generally, and in any long succession
   of time, it cannot be but that the people will be corrupt, and
   degenerate from the rule of the gospel. The flocks will not be
   preserved where the shepherds are negligent; and fields will be overrun
   with weeds, thorns, and briers, if they be not duly tilled. I shall
   therefore, in the first place, call over some of those things which are
   indispensably required in and of the ministers and teachers of the
   church, that it may be preserved in its purity, and kept up unto its
   duty in evangelical obedience; and I shall insist only on those which
   all men will acknowledge to be such duties, or which none who own the
   gospel can or dare deny so to be:--

   First, It is required of them that they keep pure and uncorrupted the
   doctrine of the gospel, especially that concerning the holiness
   enjoined in it, both as to its nature, causes, motives, and ends. So of
   old, the "priest's lips were to keep knowledge," and "the people were
   to seek the law at his mouth." This was one main end for which the Lord
   Christ gave unto, and instituted the office of the ministry in the
   church: Eph. iv. 11-15, "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
   and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
   perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
   edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the
   faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
   the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth
   be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
   wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,
   whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love,
   may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ."
   The preservation of the truth, the declaration, vindication, and
   defence of it, so as the members of the church, the disciples of
   Christ, committed to their charge, be neither through weakness or
   ignorance as children, nor through the delusions of seducers, turned
   off from it or unsettled in it, was one great end why the Lord Christ
   instituted this office therein. And upon their discharge of this duty
   depend the growth, the obedience, the edification, and salvation, of
   the whole body. And therefore doth the apostle give this principally in
   charge unto the elders of the church of Ephesus, in his solemn giving
   of it up unto their care and inspection, when he himself was no more to
   come among them: Acts xx. 28-30, "Take heed therefore unto yourselves,
   and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you
   overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his
   own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous
   wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own
   selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away
   disciples after them." As he hath a regard unto other things, so in an
   especial manner to the introduction of perverse and corrupt opinions,
   contrary to the truth wherein they had been instructed by him, which
   comprised "all the counsel of God" concerning their faith and
   obedience, with his own worship, verse 27. This they were to do by
   their careful, faithful, diligent declaration, vindication, and
   defence, of the doctrine which they had received. Especially doth he
   press this upon his beloved Timothy. He being for a season fixed in the
   ministry of the church, he was chosen out by the wisdom of the Holy
   Ghost to be a pattern and example, in the instructions given unto him,
   unto all ministers of the gospel in succeeding generations. This charge
   is expressly committed unto him, 1 Tim. vi. 13, 14, "I give thee charge
   in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ
   Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; that thou
   keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of
   our Lord Jesus Christ." Verse 20, "O Timothy, keep that which is
   committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and
   oppositions of science falsely so called." 2 Tim. ii. 13, 14, "If we
   believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. Of these
   things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they
   strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the
   hearers." And what he was enjoined in his own person, that also he was
   directed to commit unto others with the same charge, that the truth of
   the gospel might be preserved incorrupt in succeeding generations, 2
   Tim. ii. 1, 2, "Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is
   in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
   witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to
   teach others also." The vehemency of the apostle in this charge, and
   his pathetical exhortations, do sufficiently evince the moment and
   necessity of this duty, as that without which the church would not be
   continued to be "the pillar and ground of the truth."

   There are three repositories of sacred truth, or of the truths of the
   mystery of the gospel, -- the Scripture, the minds and hearts of
   believers, and the ministry of the present age. In the first, God
   preserveth them by his providence; in the second, by his Spirit and
   grace; in the last, by way of an ordinance or especial institution for
   that end.

   In the first way they have been kept, and shall be kept, safe against
   all oppositions of hell and the world, unto the consummation of all
   things. And if this way might fail, we acknowledge that the others
   would do so also, whatever some pretend of their traditions, and others
   of their present inspirations. And whilst this doth abide (as it shall
   always do), the loss that may befall in the other ways may be
   retrieved; and so it hath been several times, when the faith of the
   church hath been recovered and its profession reformed by the light and
   knowledge derived afresh from the Scripture. This fountain, therefore,
   of truth shall never be dry, but men may always draw sufficiently, yea,
   abundantly from it, whilst they use the means appointed thereunto. But
   yet this alone will not secure the public interest of truth and
   holiness. There must be other means also of communicating what is
   contained therein unto the minds and consciences of men; and the
   Scripture itself doth both appoint and require a ministry unto this
   end. Secondly, There may be a preservation of the truth derived from
   the Scripture for a season in the minds of men and hearts of private
   believers. So was it in the days of Elijah, when, in a destitution of
   all outward ministry, seven thousand were preserved in faith and the
   fear of God, "not bowing the knee unto Baal," 1 Kings xix. 18. This the
   Holy Ghost is in an especial manner promised and given unto them to
   effect, John xiv. 16, 17, 26, xvi. 13, 1 John ii. 20, 21: for herein is
   the promise accomplished, that "they shall be all taught of God," John
   vi. 45; which though it be not wholly without means, yet it is such as
   doth not always and in all things indispensably depend thereon, Heb.
   viii. 11 And unto this work of the Spirit preserving the truth in the
   minds and hearts of true believers, the continuance of it in the world,
   as to its power and profession, under great and general apostasies, is
   to be ascribed. So I no way doubt but that during and under the papal
   defection, there were great numbers in whose hearts and minds the
   principal truths of the gospel were preserved inviolate, so as that by
   virtue of them they lived unto God and were accepted with him. But this
   way of the preservation of the truth is confined unto individual
   persons, and as such only are they concerned therein. [Thirdly], As
   unto public profession and the benefits thereof, all sacred truth is
   committed unto the ministry of the present age; and on the due
   discharge of their office and work it doth depend. The imagination of
   the church of Rome about keeping sacred truths in the hidden cells of
   tradition or invisible, fantastical treasures, which requires neither
   care, nor wisdom, nor honesty unto its custody, but a mere pretence of
   key to open it, was one engine whereby both truth and holiness were
   driven out of the world.

   These things are inseparable. Gospel truth is the only root whereon
   gospel holiness will grow. If any worm corrode, or any other corrupting
   accident befall it, the fruit will quickly fade and decay. It is
   impossible to maintain the power of godliness where the doctrine from
   whence it springs is unknown, corrupted, or despised. And, on the other
   side, where men are weary of holiness, they will not long give
   entertainment to the truth; for as to their desires and affections,
   they will find it not only useless but troublesome. Hence the great
   opposition which is made at this day against many important truths of
   the gospel ariseth principally from the dislike men have of the
   holiness which they guide unto and require.

   Secondly, It is required of the same persons that they diligently
   instruct the people in the knowledge of the whole counsel of God, in
   the mystery of the gospel, the doctrine of truth, that they may know
   and do the will of God; and this are they to do by all the means and
   ways that God hath appointed, pressing it instantly, together with
   instructions on their souls and consciences for its practice. The end
   why evangelical truth is committed unto their care is, not that they
   may keep it to themselves, so locking up the key of knowledge, but that
   they may communicate it unto others and instruct them therein. And he
   who doth not desire and endeavour to communicate unto his flock all
   things that are profitable for them can have no evidence in his own
   mind that God hath called him to the office of the ministry. The
   apostle, proposing his own example unto the elders of the church of
   Ephesus, affirms that he had "not shunned to declare unto them all the
   counsel of God," Acts xx. 27, and that he had "kept back nothing that
   was profitable unto them," verse 20. Men begin to talk or write about
   preaching on this or that subject: some, they say, preach all about
   Christ and grace, and justification by the imputation of Christ's
   righteousness, and the like; but they preach about God's attributes,
   moral duties, obedience to superiors, and things of that nature. But
   whether this fancy have more folly or malice in it is not easy to
   determine. It is like those who make this plea do speak truly as to
   their own concernment. They preach of the things they express,
   exclusively unto the others, which they meddle not with at all; for if
   they do teach them, then is the opposition they fancy between those
   ways of preaching altogether vain. But that others do preach the things
   ascribed unto them, with a neglect of those other doctrines, which such
   persons pretend to appropriate to themselves as their province, is a
   fond imagination. And, to increase the vanity of it, the distribution
   is made by some with a total silence on all hands, -- both on their
   own, which they extol, and on that of others, which they condemn, -- of
   that which certainly ought to be the principal subject of all
   preaching, namely, Jesus Christ and him crucified. But the truth is, he
   who knows not that it is his duty to declare unto the people, not this
   or that part of it, but the whole counsel of God, and who is not
   endowed with some measure of wisdom, so as to discern what is useful,
   profitable, and seasonable unto his hearers, according as their
   spiritual states and occasions do require, knows not what it is to be a
   minister of Christ or his gospel, a faithful steward of the mysteries
   of God, nor is meet to take that office upon him. And there are three
   things which ministers, teachers, leaders of the people, are to attend
   unto in the discharge of this principal part of their office, in the
   communication of the knowledge of the truth committed to them unto
   others:--

   1. That they are to do it with all care, diligence, and sedulity. How
   vehement is our apostle in his charge to this purpose! 2 Tim. iv. 1, 2,
   "I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
   shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
   preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
   exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine." How ought these words to
   sound continually in the ears of all ministers who design to be
   faithful in the discharge of their duty! How ought the power of them to
   abide on their hearts! Are they spoken alone unto Timothy? or will the
   souls of men be preserved, edified, saved, now with less pains and at
   an easier rate than formerly? It will appear at the last day that
   others also have an eternal concernment herein.

   2. That they labour with the utmost of their strength, even to
   fatigation and weariness. All the names whereby their office and their
   work are expressed in the New Testament do include this kind of labour.
   As they are to "give themselves continually to the ministry of the
   word," Acts vi. 4, -- that is, wholly and entirely, in their utmost
   endeavours, continually unto this work, -- so are they enjoined kopian,
   "to labour to the utmost of the strength" they have therein, 1 Tim. v.
   17; 1 Cor. xvi. 16; 1 Thess. v. 12. It is not bodily labour alone in
   the dispensation of the word (wherein there may be much variety,
   according unto the various natural dispositions or tempers of men, and
   of acquired gifts), but that earnestness and intension of spirit which
   will carry along with them the laborious pains of the whole person,
   that I intend. The cold, formal pronunciation or reading (as is the
   manner of some) of a well-composed oration doth not well express this
   labouring in the word and doctrine.

   3. That their whole work and all their endeavours therein be
   accompanied with constant prayer, that the gospel in their ministry may
   run and be glorified, that the word may prosper in the hearts and lives
   of the people. So the apostles affirm that they would "give themselves
   continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word," Acts vi. 4.
   That ministration of the word which is not accompanied with continual
   prayer for its success is not like to have any great blessing go along
   with it. As our apostle calls God to witness of his frequent mention of
   them in his prayers unto whom the word was preached, Rom. i. 9, 10, so
   he desireth the prayers of others also, that his work and labour in the
   ministry might be prosperous and successful, Eph. vi. 18, 19. For a
   minister to preach the word without constant prayer for its success is
   a likely means to cherish and strengthen secret atheism in his own
   heart, and very unlikely to work holiness in the lives of others.

   Thirdly, It is in like manner required of them (so far as human frailty
   will permit) that they do, in their persons, ways, and walkings or
   conversations, especially in the discharge of all their ministerial
   duties, give a true representation both of the doctrine which they
   preach and of Him in whose name they dispense it. What meekness,
   humility, and zeal for the glory of God; what moderation, self-denial,
   and readiness for the cross; what mortification of corrupt affections
   and inordinate desires of earthly things; what contempt of the world;
   what benignity, condescension, and patience towards all men; what
   evidences of heavenly-mindedness, -- are required hereunto, both the
   Scripture declares and the nature of the thing itself makes apparent
   What can any men rationally believe, but that they who preach Christ
   and the gospel unto them do declare that they have no other effect or
   tendency but what in themselves they express and represent unto them?
   There is a secret language in the ministry of men, that what they are
   and do is that which the doctrine they preach doth require, which their
   hearers do understand and are apt to believe. The very philosophers saw
   that so it would be with respect unto them who publicly taught
   philosophy; to which purpose the words of Themistius are remarkable:
   Orat. 1, Aneleutherous te de oun houtos heuriskontes kai
   philochrematous te kai harpages, loidorous te kai philapechthemonas kai
   alazonas, dolerous te kai epiboulous, ouk hoiesontai ek phuseos e tes
   proteras banausias echein tas keras, all' aitiasontai ek philosophias
   prosginesthai. Whatever vices most men observe in such persons, they
   will not attribute them unto their depraved natures or inward
   corruptions, but unto the philosophy they profess Hence it is enjoined
   them that in "all things they show themselves patterns of good works,"
   Tit. ii. 7; 2 Thess. iii. 9. "Be thou," saith our apostle unto his
   Timothy, "an example unto believers, in word, in conversation, in
   charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity," 1 Tim. iv. 12. This is the
   dignity, honour, and preferment, that the Lord Christ calls his
   ministers unto, namely, that they should in their own persons represent
   his graces and the holiness of his doctrine unto others. Those who are
   otherwise minded, whose designs and affections look another way, will
   find themselves to fall under the effects of a great mistake. I do not
   reflect any thing upon what outward, secular, circumstantial advantages
   men may have in this world, but I do say, whatever they have of that
   kind which doth not enable them the more effectually in their course
   and work to express the meekness, humility, self-denial, and zeal of
   Christ, with the holiness of the doctrine they teach, or should so do,
   it will not redound unto any great account in the kingdom of God.

   Fourthly, It is also incumbent on them to attend with diligence unto
   that rule and holy discipline which the Lord Christ hath appointed for
   the edification of the church, and the preservation of it in purity,
   holiness, and obedience. This, indeed, most pretend a readiness to
   comply withal, as that which is condited unto their appetite by an
   appearance of authority and power, which seldom are unaccompanied with
   other desirable advantages, I shall only say, it will be well for them
   by whom they are administered according to the mind of Christ; but that
   more belongeth thereunto than is usually apprehended so to do, I
   suppose few sober and intelligent persons will deny.

   That these things, yea, and many others of the like kind, with all
   those duties which are subservient or any way necessary unto them, are
   required of all ministers of the gospel, teachers, guides, rulers of
   the church, and that constantly to be attended unto with zeal for the
   glory of God and compassion for the souls of men, none, I suppose, who
   profess themselves Christians will in general deny. And if in these
   things the life and power of the ministry (whereon the purity and
   holiness of the church depend) do consist, where they are wanting, it
   is morally impossible but that the generality of the people will
   gradually degenerate into ignorance, profaneness, immorality, and
   unholiness of every kind.

   There is nothing I could more desire than that the present defection
   from evangelical holiness, which is so visible in the world, might
   neither in whole nor in part be charged on a defect in these thing
   among this sort of men, yea, that it might not be so unto
   qualifications, principles, and actings directly contrary unto what is
   thus required; for if it be not so, there will be yet hopes of a stay
   to be put unto its progress, yea, of a healing and recovery from it.
   But I shall a little inquire into that which offers itself unto the
   view of all, premising these two things:-- 1. That I do not intend the
   ministry of any one place or nation, or age or time, more than another,
   but shall speak indefinitely unto what hath been and is in the
   Christian world. 2. That if indeed, upon trial, none be found
   blameworthy, none defective in these things, there is no harm done in
   that any are warned what to avoid. And, --

   1. Have they all kept the truth, and doctrine, and mysteries of the
   gospel, committed to the ministers thereof? Are there not many of this
   sort who are themselves woefully ignorant of the counsel of God
   revealed therein? nay, are there not many who have neither will nor
   ability to search into the mysteries of the doctrine of Christ, and do
   therefore despise them? Can men keep in a way of duty what they never
   had, nor ever used those means for the attaining of it without which it
   will not be so done? And is it not manifest what must needs be, and
   what really are, the effects and fruits hereof? Do not hereon
   multitudes perish for want of knowledge and continue in the ways of sin
   because they have none to teach them better, at least none to teach
   them on such principles as are alone effectual unto their conversion
   and holiness? They must die, they shall die in their sins, but the
   blood of their souls will be required at other hands; for all the
   causes of gospel holiness, all proper motives unto it, all effectual
   ways and means of attaining it, are hid from them.

   It is known how brutishly ignorant the generality of their priests are
   in the Papacy; neither, for the most part, do the rulers of that church
   require any more of them than that they have skill enough to read and
   manage their public offices of devotion. Neither is it much otherwise
   in the Greek church, in any of the branches of it, whereby whole
   nations, under a public profession of Christianity, are through stupid
   ignorance degenerated into a profane course of life, no less vile than
   that of the heathens. It is well if it be not so in some measure in
   other places also. But the truth is, the ignorance of many who take
   upon them the office of the ministry, and their unconscionable idleness
   when they have so done, is the great occasion of the continuance of
   profaneness and ungodliness among the people. And if the preaching of
   the gospel be the only sovereign, effectual means appointed by God for
   the change of men's natures and the reformation of their lives (a
   denial whereof includes a renunciation of Christianity), it is a vain
   expectation that either of them will be wrought in such a way as to
   restore the beauty and glory of religion in the world, unless provision
   be made for an able ministry to instruct the body of the people,
   through all their distributions, in knowledge and understanding.

   2. It is the duty of this sort of persons, unto the same end, to
   preserve the truth pure and uncorrupted. Unless this be done carefully
   and effectually, holiness will not be maintained or preserved in the
   world. And it is evident how many of them have acquitted themselves
   herein, as hath been in part declared in the foregoing account of
   apostasy from the doctrine and truth of the gospel By them principally
   it hath been debased, corrupted, perverted, and continueth yet so to
   be; neither is there at this day scarce any one doctrine that should
   really promote evangelical obedience which is free from being despised
   or depraved by some of them. But this is not that which we now speak
   unto; it hath been done already. Our present inquiry is after that love
   and care of, that zeal for the truth, which are eminently required of
   them. Do they pray, and labour, and plead with God and man for its
   preservation, as that wherein their principal interest doth lie? or do
   many esteem of it any farther but as their outward advantages are
   secured by it? A fault there is in this matter, and it is not without
   the especial guilt of some that the world is come to such an
   indifferency about the principal truths of the gospel that from thence
   men slip into atheism every day.

   3. Neither are these defects supplied by diligence in their work; yea,
   the want thereof is of all other evils in this kind most evident. No
   words are sufficient to express the sloth and negligence, the coldness
   and carelessness, that are found amongst many in the discharge of their
   duty, as to the instruction of others, and the application of the word
   of God to the hearts and consciences of men. I shall not mention
   particular instances, that none may be offended. The matter itself is
   evident, and the effects of it manifest. It may seem to some desirable
   that such things should be concealed, but whilst by reason hereof the
   souls of multitudes are in danger of eternal ruin every day, those who
   are sensible of their misery may be allowed to complain. How few,
   therefore, do diligently and industriously lay out themselves and their
   strength in the ministry, with zeal for the glory of God and compassion
   unto the souls of men! How few do take heed to themselves and to the
   flocks, do watch and pray, and press their message on the consciences
   of their hearers! Alas! it is but little of saving truth that many know
   in the notions of it, less they care to communicate unto others,
   because they know it not in its power. Will the souls of men be brought
   into the obedience of faith, will the power and interest of sin and the
   world in them be cast down and destroyed, will gospel obedience be
   preserved in the lives of men, by such weak and languid endeavours as
   many satisfy themselves withal! If it be so, conversion unto God and
   the fruits of holiness must be looked on as most easy things, and the
   ministry itself to be of little use in the world. Certainly, there is
   another representation of these things in the Scripture; and
   notwithstanding the growth of some opinions that would render the whole
   work of Christianity so easy and facile as to be accommodated unto a
   negligent ministry, yet the event thereof is openly pernicious.
   Wherefore we need not fear to say, that coldness, lukewarmness, sloth,
   and negligence, especially when accompanied with ignorance and
   spiritual darkness about the principal mysteries of the gospel, with an
   unconcernment of mind and affections in the importance, end, and design
   of their work, among them who are looked on as the public teachers of
   the church, at any time or in any place, keeps open a wide door for the
   lusts of men to pour forth themselves into that deluge of apostasy from
   the power of godliness which the world is even overwhelmed withal.

   So was it with the church under the old testament, as God by the
   prophets complains in a hundred places. Can any man be so stupid as to
   imagine that the ordinary discharge of the priestly office in the
   church of Rome, in saying their offices at canonical hours, hearing of
   confessions and giving absolutions, without the least dram of labouring
   in word and doctrine, is a means to keep up the power of Christian
   religion, or is not an effectual means to drench mankind in sin and
   security? Neither doth the calling of things by other names change
   their natures. Wherever there is the same neglect of the true work of
   the ministry, in the matter of it or manner of its performance, the
   same event will ensue thereon. And it will be nowhere more fatal than
   where men love to have it so, and despise whatever is spoken to the
   contrary, so as that it shall be esteemed a crime for any one to be
   dissatisfied with the soul-ruining sloth and negligence of this sort of
   men.

   4. Moreover, whereas great relief in all these cases might be taken
   from a holy, exemplary conversation and walking among them in whom it
   is required as an ordinance of God for the direction and encouragement
   of the people, it is manifest in the world, and sufficiently taken
   notice of, that many of them in their own persons are openly ambitious,
   insatiably covetous, proud, sensual, haters of them that are good,
   companions of the worst of men, evidencing the depraved habits of their
   minds in all signal instances of vice and folly. He that shall consider
   what was the state, what were the lives, of the apostles and first
   preachers of the gospel, with those who succeeded them for some ages
   following, not merely as to their outward condition of straits and
   poverty (which, as it will be pleaded, was occasioned by the state of
   things then in the world), but as to that humility, lowliness of mind,
   self-denial, contempt of the world, zeal for God, purity of life, which
   they prescribed unto others and gave an exemplification of in
   themselves; and then take a view of that universal contradiction unto
   them and their ways which the lives and course of very many in the
   world do at this day openly express; he must conclude that either all
   those things were needless in them, as to the public interests of
   Christianity, or that they are unspeakably endamaged by those of some
   at present.

   Wherefore, it cannot with any modesty be denied but that by reason of
   these and the like miscarriages in the spiritual guides of the people,
   the generality of Christians have been either led or suffered
   insensibly to fall into the present apostasy. When God shall be pleased
   to give unto the people who are called by his name, in a more abundant
   manner, "pastors after his own heart, to feed them with knowledge and
   understanding;" when he shall revive and increase a holy, humble,
   zealous, self-denying, powerful ministry, by a more plentiful effusion
   of his Spirit from above; then, and not until then, may we hope to see
   the pristine glory and beauty of our religion restored unto its
   primitive state and condition.

   Those who do yet judge that matters among the common professors of
   Christianity, as to the obedience of faith, are in as good a posture as
   they were at any time formerly, or as they need to be, who have no
   other desire or interest in them but only that they should not be
   better, may abide in their security without troubling themselves with
   these things. But for such as cannot but see that a revolt or defection
   from gospel obedience is not only begun in the world, but carried unto
   that height that it is ready to issue in idolatry or atheism, it is
   time for them to consider under whose hand this hath fallen out, and be
   stirred up to put a stop unto its progress before it be too late. Nor
   is it to be expected or fancied that there will be a recovery of the
   people from ungodliness and profaneness, or unto the holy obedience the
   gospel requireth, until there be such a change wrought in the ministry
   that the word may be so dispensed and such examples given as may be
   effectual unto that end. It is to cast the highest contempt on the
   office itself to imagine that this breach can be otherwise healed; for
   whereas this declension is fallen out under the conduct of the present
   ministry and that of the foregoing ages, it is not to be thought that
   it will be retrieved under the same conduct. And to suppose that it can
   be done any other way, that the world of professed Christians shall be
   recovered unto holy obedience by any other means but the ministerial
   dispensation of the word, is to render it a thing altogether useless.
   Here, then, must begin the cure of that lethargy in sin that the world
   is fallen into, -- namely, in the renovation of a powerful evangelical
   ministry, or the due discharge of that office by them that are called
   thereunto or possess the place of it, if ever it be effected unto any
   purpose in this world.

Chapter X.

   Other causes and occasions of the decay of holiness.

   II. Multitudes are led into and countenanced in the ways of sin and
   profaneness, freely indulging unto their lusts and corrupt affections,
   by a false appropriation of justifying names and titles unto them, in
   ways of sin and wickedness. This was one principal means of old whereby
   the Jews were hardened in their impieties and flagitious lives; for
   when the prophets told them of their sins, and warned them of God's
   approaching judgments, they opposed that outcry unto their whole
   ministry, "The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple
   of the Lord, are these;" -- "Say what you please, we are the only
   posterity of Abraham, the only church of God in the world." This
   contest they managed with the prophet Jeremiah in an especial manner.
   Chap. vii., he saith unto them in the name of the Lord, "Amend your
   ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place,"
   verse 3. Their reply and defence is, "The temple of the Lord," etc.,
   verse 4. Whereunto the prophet makes that severe return, verses 9, 10,
   "Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
   burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not, and
   come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name?" --
   "Will ye give up yourselves unto all manner of wickedness, and
   countenance yourselves therein by being a people unto whom the temple
   and the worship of it are appropriated?" And this, in like manner, was
   the great prejudice which the Baptist had to contend withal when he
   came to call them to repentance. Abraham's children they were, and by
   virtue of that relation had right unto all the privileges of the
   covenant made with him, whatever they were in themselves, Matt. iii. 9.
   And it is evident in these examples that the nearer churches or persons
   are unto an utter forfeiture of all their privileges, and to
   destruction itself, for their sins, the more ready they are to boast of
   and support themselves with their outward state, as having nothing else
   to trust unto. But if men were able to countenance themselves in their
   sins on this pretence against that extraordinary prophetical ministry
   which endeavoured to discard them of it, and called them unto the
   necessity of personal holiness, how much more will they be able to
   shelter themselves under its shades when they shall be taught so to do!

   When men who have given up themselves unto a vicious, sensual, worldly
   course of life, having either fallen into it by the power of their
   lusts and temptations, or were never brought into a better course by
   any means of correcting the vices of nature, shall find that
   notwithstanding what they are, what they know themselves to be, and
   what judgment others must needs pass of them, yet they are esteemed to
   belong to the church of Christ, and are made partakers of all the
   outward privileges of it, it cannot but greatly heighten their security
   in sin, and weaken the efficacy of all means of their reformation. And
   when others, not so engaged in the ways of sin and profaneness, shall
   see that they may have all the external pledges of divine love and
   favour communicated unto them, although they should run into the same
   compass of riot and excess with others, it cannot but insensibly weaken
   their diligence in duty, and render them more pliable subjects of
   temptations unto sin; for they are but few who care to be better than
   they judge they must be of necessity. When the church of Sardis was
   really dead, the principal means of keeping it in that condition was
   the name it had to be alive.

   Let us, therefore, consider how it hath been in the world in this
   matter. Whilst these things have been communicated promiscuously unto
   all sorts of men, yea, to the worst that live on the earth, is it not
   evident that the name of the church and the administration of its
   ordinances would be made use of to countenance men in a neglect of
   holiness, yea, a contempt and hatred of it? Whilst these sacred names,
   titles, and privileges, these pledges of the love of God, and of all
   the benefits of the mediation of Christ, are forced to lackey after men
   into the most provoking courses of flagitious sins, what can put a stay
   to the lusts of men? If the church be that society in the world which
   is alone the object of God's especial love and grace, if the principal
   end of the administration of its ordinances be to confirm unto men
   their interest in the benefits of the mediation of Christ, how can the
   lusts of men be more accommodated than by the application of these
   things unto them, whilst they are flagrant in their pursuit? It may,
   indeed, be supposed that the Lord Jesus Christ hath made evangelical
   obedience to be the immovable rule of an interest in his church;
   indeed, whether obedience unto the precepts of the gospel be not the
   only and indispensable condition of a participation of the privileges
   of the gospel, ought to be out of dispute with them that own the truth
   of its doctrine. And whereas all that is required of us that we may be
   eternally saved is contained in the precepts of the gospel, men can
   have no other outward security of their souls' welfare than what doth
   accompany the church and its rights. When, therefore, they do find on
   what easy terms they may hold an indefeasible interest in them, so as
   that, by a compliance with some outward forms or constitutions, they
   may secure their right from any impeachment or forfeiture by the most
   profligate course of life which, for the satisfaction of their lusts,
   they can betake themselves unto, what remains of outward means that can
   put a restraint upon them.

   This was the engine whereby Satan promoted that general apostasy from
   evangelical obedience which befell the church of Rome, in all its
   branches, members and adherents. For after that innumerable multitudes
   were brought unto the profession of Christianity, not through a
   conviction and experience of its truth, power, holiness, and necessity
   unto the present peace and eternal welfare of the souls of men, but in
   compliance with the rulers of the nations and their own secular
   interest, being once safely lodged (on most easy and gentle terms) in
   the church, they were quickly secured from all apprehensions of the
   necessity of that holiness which the gospel doth require: for being
   assured that although their lives were worse than those of the heathen;
   were they never so lewd, filthy, and wicked; did all manner of sins
   that may be named, or ought [not] to be named, abound among them; yet
   that they, and they alone, were the church of Christ, and could not be
   otherwise, -- to what purpose should they trouble themselves with
   mortification, self-denial, purity of heart and hands, and such other
   ungrateful duties? What ground is there to expect the same course of
   obedience from them who engage into a profession of Christianity on
   these terms, with those who in the primitive times embraced the truth
   in the love of it, for its own sake, with a deliberate resolution to
   forego all things rather than forsake its profession or decline from
   its commands?

   Especially were men confirmed in their security when they saw others
   condemned body and soul unto hell, and consumed with fire and sword in
   this world, for not being what they were, -- that is, the church! They
   could not choose but applaud their own happiness, who on such easy
   terms were certainly freed from present and eternal flames. When
   hereunto, for the necessary satisfaction of some convictions, the
   reliefs of confession, penances, commutation, and redemption of sins by
   outward works of supposed piety or charity, were found out, with the
   great reserve of purgatory in all dubious cases, the generality of men
   bade an open farewell unto the holiness of the gospel, as that wherein
   they were not concerned and wherewith they would not be troubled.

   In these things consisted the mystery of iniquity, the springs and
   occasions of that great apostasy which was in the world under the
   Papacy.

   1. The doctrine of the gospel (as to its peculiar nature, the causes,
   motives, and ends of it) was generally lost, partly through the
   horrible ignorance of some, and partly through the pernicious errors of
   others, whose duty it was to have preserved it. And how impossible it
   is to maintain the life and power of obedience when this spring of it
   is dried up or corrupted, when this root is withered and decayed, is
   not hard to apprehend. Sometimes truth is lost first in a church, and
   then holiness, and sometimes the decay or hatred of holiness is the
   cause of the loss of truth; but where either is rejected, the other win
   not abide, as we have declared. And so it fell out in that fatal
   apostasy; these evils promoted and furthered each other.

   2. The ground got by the loss of truth was secured by the application
   of the name, title, privileges, and promises of the church unto all
   sorts of men, though living impenitently in their sins; for there was
   and is virtually contained therein an assurance given unto them that
   they are in that condition wherein the Lord Christ requires they should
   be, which he accepts, approves, and hath annexed the promises of the
   gospel unto. When men are declared to be in this estate, what need they
   be at any pains or charge to have it changed or bettered? Certainly, in
   general, they are too much in love with their lusts, sins, and
   pleasures, to part with them, unless they see a greater necessity for
   it than such a condition would admit. And for their farther security
   herein, they were informed that the sacraments of the church did, by
   virtue of their administration alone, confer unto them all the grace
   which they do signify. Particularly, they were taught to believe that
   every one who had a mouth, whatever villainies his heart and life were
   filled withal, might eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus Christ
   (at least by concomitancy); which himself hath assured us that "whoso
   doeth hath eternal life," John vi. 53, 54. And other ways almost
   innumerable there were whereby, through their pretended interest in the
   church and its privileges, even flagitious sinners were secured of
   immortality and glory.

   3. For the increase of their satisfaction, for the confirming of their
   security, they found that hell and destruction were denounced only
   against them who were not of the church. For besides one great maxim of
   truth which passed current amongst them, but [was] falsely applied unto
   their advantage, namely, that out of the church there was no salvation,
   which church they were; and one also of no less use to them, though of
   less truth in itself, that the church was like Noah's ark, all were
   saved that were in it, and all drowned that were out of it, with others
   of an alike encouraging nature; they saw the truth of them exemplified
   before their eyes: for if it so fell out that there were any who did
   not belong unto the church as they did, nor would comply with it,
   although they were evidently in their ways and lives more righteous
   than themselves, they saw them, by the authority of the church, cursed,
   condemned unto hell, cast into dungeons, and consumed with flames. And
   herewith they could not but be fully satisfied that there was no fear
   of danger and trouble, in this world or another, but only in not being
   of the church; which sin they were resolved not to be guilty of, seeing
   they could avoid it on so easy terms. And it will be found always true,
   that as persecutions, with the sufferings of the saints of God, do tend
   to the brightening of the grace of some, and the confirmation of the
   faith of others who really believe, so they do greatly unto the
   obdurateness and impenitency of wicked men in their sins. Never was
   there a more pernicious engine against the glory of the gospel
   invented, than for professed Christians to persecute, hurt; and destroy
   others, in like manner professing Christian religion with themselves,
   who visibly excel them in a holy, fruitful conversation, because in
   some things they dissent from them; for what can more secure men in
   their impieties than to persuade them that they are justified in them
   by the rule of the gospel, above those who in all duties of morality do
   really excel them? Certainly, for swearers and drunkards, profane
   persons and unclean, to persecute such for religion as are visibly
   pious, sober, temperate, given unto prayer and good works, is no useful
   representation of Christianity. But, --

   4. These privileges and these attestations were not absolutely and
   always such armour of proof unto sinners, but that some arrows of
   conviction would ever and anon pierce into their minds and consciences,
   giving them no small disquietment and trouble. One thing or other,
   either in some beam of truth from the gospel or from conscience itself,
   on the occasions of new surprisals into actual sin, or from fear, or an
   apprehension of some public judgments, would ever and anon befall them,
   and that unto an inward disturbance beyond what the advantages
   mentioned could reduce them from; and this was the most likely way of
   awaking them out of their security, and causing them to inquire what
   God yet required of them. In this case were the other helps and
   supplies mentioned found out and proposed unto them. "If it be so that
   you are not absolutely satisfied with your interest in the advantages
   of the church in general, if sin will yet give you any disquietment,
   then you must to confession, and penances, and works of redemption,
   with the like approved medicines and remedies for troubled minds. But
   if the conscience of any prove so stubborn or inflexible after all
   these mollifying and suppling medicines, that the wound will not be
   skinned over, all that is yet wanting shall be well issued and secured
   in purgatory, wherein it is most certain that never any soul did
   miscarry."

   By these and the like means, the generality of mankind were brought
   into an utter unconcernment with gospel holiness. They neither
   understood it, nor found any need of it, nor did like what by any means
   they might hear of it, until at length a blind devotion, deformed with
   various superstitions, obtained the reputation of it, the world in the
   meantime being drenched in ignorance, profaneness, and all manner of
   wicked conversation. So, under the name of the church and its
   privileges, were Christ and the gospel almost utterly lost amongst men.

   It will not be otherwise where the same principles are entertained,
   according unto the degrees of their prevalency. And were it not that
   the minds of men are powerfully influenced with reserves from these
   things, it were impossible that so many called Christians should in
   their lives and conversations exceed heathens and Mohammedans in
   wickedness. The commands of the gospel are most holy, its promises
   great, and its threatenings most severe; and yet, under a profession of
   owning them all, men lead lives worse than the heathens, who know
   nothing of that holy rule, or of those promises and threats of eternal
   things wherein the highest blessedness and utmost misery of our nature
   do consist, which these profess to be regulated by.

   To suppose really the least countenance to be given hereunto by any
   thing that belongs unto the gospel, is to exercise against it the
   highest despite imaginable. This event, therefore, must and doth
   principally follow on the undue application of the outward tokens of
   God's favour and pledges of eternal blessedness unto men in their sins,
   by those unto whom the administration of them is supposed to be
   committed by Jesus Christ. And let none expect a return of a
   conversation becoming the gospel among Christians until things are so
   ordered in the church as that none may flatter themselves with a
   supposed interest in the promises and privileges of the gospel, who
   live not in a visible subjection unto and compliance with all the
   precepts of it. But whilst all things are huddled together
   promiscuously, and there is no more required to make a Christian than
   for him to be born in such a place or nation, and not to oppose the
   customs and usages in religion which are there established, we must be
   content to bear the evils of that defection which the world groans
   under.

   III. Great examples of persons exalted in places of eminency giving up
   themselves unto boldness in a course of sinning, -- which have fallen
   out in all the latter ages of the church, -- have had a signal
   influence into the increase and furtherance of this apostasy;
   especially they have had so where the persons giving such examples have
   been such as pretended unto the conduct of religion. See Jer. xxiii.
   15. It cannot with any modesty be denied but that the flagitious,
   scandalous lives of many popes and other great prelates of the court of
   Rome have hurried many into the very depths of atheism, and
   countenanced multitudes in a careless, voluptuous, sensual course of
   life. And if at any time a man whose ways are made conspicuous by the
   eminency of his employment, -- being, as it were, at the head of all
   the religion that is publicly professed, and having the chief conduct
   of it in his hand, as it is in the Papacy in many places, -- be vain in
   his communication, profane in his principles, sensual in his course of
   life, negligent in the duties of his office, no way rebuking open sins,
   but taking pleasure in them that do them, it is incredible how soon a
   whole age or generation of professed Christians will be influenced,
   corrupted, and debauched thereby; for what is the family like to be,
   when the stewards are such as the evil servant described Matt. xxiv.
   48-51? As men are warned every day not to be wiser than their teachers,
   but duly to obey their guides; so they either cannot or will not, for
   the most part, see any reason why they should be better than they, or
   walk in any other paths than what they tread before them. When the sons
   of Eli, the sons and successors of the high priest, actually exercising
   the priests' office in their own persons, gave the people an open
   example of profaneness and lewdness of life, the body of the nation was
   quickly so far corrupted as that the judgments of God in the first
   captivity of the land ensued thereon. The world at present is so
   precipitate and headstrong in a course of sin, that the best examples
   are not able in any measure to stem the torrents of it. But if in any
   place, at any time, encouragements are given unto men by any eminent
   examples in sinning, helping to remove the remaining curbs of fear,
   shame, and reputation, impudence in sinning will rise unto an
   exorbitant and uncontrollable outrage. Hereby, then, hath the defection
   from holiness complained of been greatly promoted in all ages, for few
   or none of them have wanted plenty of these examples. Indeed, the first
   visible degeneracies of Christianity, as they accompanied, so they were
   occasioned by the open pride, ambition, strife, contentions, and
   conformity unto the world, that possessed the minds and stained the
   lives of far the greatest part of the prelates and principal leaders of
   the church, after it came under the protection of the Roman empire, and
   men thought to purchase an interest in the good things of religion, or
   at least a representation of them, by giving power, wealth, and honour,
   unto persons no way better than themselves, who had got the name and
   title of the "clergy," or "guides of the church;" for about these
   things they contended endlessly, to the shame of Christian religion,
   and the utter loss in the most of the true real power and virtue of it.
   And in following ages, as things grew worse and worse, the lewd and
   wicked lives of popes, prelates, and others, signalized unto the world
   by their power and dignity, did by their examples insensibly bring
   about a public conformity unto their vices, according as the
   concurrence of opportunity and ability did enable men thereunto.
   Wherever, therefore, persons fall within the compass of the ministry of
   the church, or, as guides thereof, are on that account (on what
   principles soever) exalted into places of eminence or dignity, whereby
   they are made conspicuous and observable, if they do not proportionably
   excel others in visible exemplary holiness, at least if they be not
   unblamable in such a godly conversation as truly expresseth the grace
   of the gospel, in humility, meekness, contempt of the world, of sensual
   pleasures, and of the pride of life, zeal and diligence in the
   dispensation of the word, it cannot be but that apostasy from the
   gospel, as to its power and holiness, will be kept up and promoted.

   IV. This apostasy hath been very much promoted by persecution. I mean
   not that persecution which hath befallen the sincere, constant
   professors of Christianity from the avowed enemies thereof, upon the
   account of their profession of it. This is so far from being any cause
   or occasion of a defection from the holiness of the gospel as that it
   hath been the peculiar glory of our religion, and a notable outward
   means of the increase of it. So hath it been with respect unto the
   whole doctrine of the gospel in general, and so it is with respect unto
   any especial branch or part of it. It was the primitive glory of
   Christian religion that it set out in the face of a universal
   opposition from the whole world, and not only made good its station,
   but increased under the fiercest persecutions, until it had finished
   that glorious conquest which it was designed unto. And not only did it
   preserve its being and enlarge its extent under them, but they were
   means also to preserve its purity, and to exert its power in the hearts
   and lives of its professors. The church never lost finally either truth
   or holiness by the violent persecutions of its avowed enemies. But I
   speak not of the outrages committed on the flock of Christ by wolves in
   their own skins, but by such as have got on sheep's clothing; for these
   things, in whomsoever they are, proceed from the uncured, wolfish
   nature in persons on whom the gospel hath not obtained its promised
   efficacy, Isa. xi. 6-9. It is professing Christians persecuting one
   another, about some differences among themselves concerning their
   apprehensions of spiritual things and practice of divine worship, that
   I intend. And this hath been so great, especially in the latter ages of
   the church, that it is questionable whether there hath not greater
   effusion of the blood of Christians, ruin of families, and devastation
   of nations, been made by them who have professed the same religion in
   general, than by all the Pagans in the world since the first
   promulgation of it. He that shall impartially read the Gospel will not
   be able to discern how it was possible that any such things should ever
   fall out among those who pretend to avow it as their rule and guide in
   any measure; for the whole design and all the rules of it are so
   expressly contradictory unto any such practice, as that no man who had
   not learned the contrary from the event could possibly conjecture that
   any persons could ever fall into it without an antecedent renunciation
   of the gospel itself. But thus in process of time it did fall out, unto
   the irreparable scandal and detriment of Christian religion. And that
   so it would do was foretold; for the principal design of the book of
   the Revelation is, to foretell and delineate such an apostate state of
   the church as wherein the external power prevailing in it should
   persecute, destroy, and kill those who would not comply in the
   apostasy; for which reason, together with idolatry, that state is
   called Babylon. And we all know how it came to pass under the power and
   prevalency of the Roman church. And we may observe, that upon the
   destruction of Babylon, it is said that "in her was found the blood of
   prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth,"
   Rev. xviii. 24, -- that is, for the gospel and the profession thereof.
   Whoever, therefore, offereth violence unto the life of any on the
   account of their profession of the gospel and religion of Christ, be it
   under what pretence it will, he doth therein and so far join himself
   unto that apostate state which shall be destroyed. Our Lord Jesus
   Christ came to restore that love of God which was departed from our
   nature, and thereon that love unto and among mankind which the law of
   creation originally required, and that advanced unto a higher degree of
   worth and excellency by an addition of new motives, duties, and ends,
   unto it. He came to save the lives of men, and not to destroy them, --
   to deliver them out of a state of enmity and mutual hatred into that of
   peace and love; and can any sober man imagine that the hurting,
   imprisoning, fining, banishing, killing, and destroying of men, for no
   other reason or cause in the world but for believing in Christ, and
   worshipping of him according, as they are invincibly convinced they
   ought to do, is a good and due representation of this design of Christ?
   nay, is it not evident that this practice draws a veil over the glory
   of it, obscuring the principal attractive beauties of the gospel, and
   teaching the world a Christian religion, fierce, cruel, oppressive,
   vindictive, bloody, to the utter exclusion of that which is so indeed?
   There is therefore no more expedient course to draw off the minds of
   men from the due consideration of one principal end of the mediation of
   Christ (which is to turn them from the gospel, and to substitute
   another gospel in the room thereof, which yet is not another, because
   it is none, whatever it pretends), than for those who profess Christian
   religion to persecute others of the same profession for their
   profession, pleading this to be a duty of that religion. Wherefore,
   when the generality of mankind, by what they heard and saw, were
   persuaded that this was the true religion, -- namely, variously to
   persecute, and at length to destroy others, who professing it did yet
   in some things dissent from them in power, -- they had lost the true
   gospel and the benefits of it.

   Besides, that religion is alien from the gospel, at least includes a
   notable defection from it, whose avowed profession doth not represent
   the spirit, graces, and virtues of Him who was its author; yea,
   conformity unto him in all things is the sum and substance of that
   obedience which it doth require. But in this way of external force and
   persecution, there seems to be an appearance of the spirit of Mohammed
   and Antichrist rather than of our Lord Jesus Christ. And hereby are the
   minds of men infected with false notions and apprehensions of the
   nature of Christian religion; which whilst they conform themselves
   unto, they depart from the glory and power of it. It hath been
   sufficiently elsewhere evinced how contrary also this practice is to
   the most plain rules and principal ends of the gospel. And when at any
   time there is this kind of persecution prevailing among Christians,
   there is not so much as the form, face, or appearance, of Christianity
   left amongst men. All that love, charity, peace, meekness, quietness,
   condescension, mercy, compassion, benignity, towards mankind, which
   belong essentially unto Christian religion, are forced to give way to
   wrath, strife, revenge, evil surmises, false accusations, tumults,
   disorder, force, rapine, and every thing that is evil. Whereas,
   therefore, this course hath been steered in many places of the world,
   and yet continueth so to be, the generality of men must needs be much
   untaught the truth of religion thereby; for that kind of profession
   thereof which is consistent with such practices is not directed in the
   least by the gospel. And when the minds of men are hereby unframed,
   they are unsuited unto all other evangelical duties Whatever advantages
   may shall pretend to have by this means accrued unto the truth (as they
   suppose) in some few instances, yet as none can be so immodest as to
   deny but that it hath been a thousand times more subservient unto the
   interests of error, so no pretended advantage of truth can countervail
   that corruption of Christian morality which hath been introduced and
   countenanced by it.

   V. Want of watchfulness against the insinuation of national vices and
   the prevailing sins of any present age, hath effectually promoted an
   apostasy from evangelical holiness among the generality of Christians.
   There are some vices, crimes, or sins, that particular nations (on what
   grounds I shall not now inquire) are peculiarly inclined unto, which
   therefore abound in them; for it is evident what great advantages those
   vices must have on the minds of men, and how easy it is to have their
   practice imposed on them. All men are continually encompassed with them
   in their occasions, and commonness takes off the sense of their guilt,
   That which would be looked on in one nation as the greatest debauchery
   of human nature, is, through custom, in another passed by without any
   animadversion. Hence the prevalency of the gospel in any nation may be
   measured by the success it hath against known national sins. If these
   are not in some good measure subdued by it, if the minds of men be not
   alienated from them and made watchful against them, if their guilt
   appear not naked, without the varnish or veil put upon it by commonness
   or custom, whatever profession is made of the gospel, it is vain and
   useless. Thus the apostle allows that there were national sins
   prevalent among the Cretians, Tit. i. 12, 13, "One of themselves, a
   prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts,
   slow bellies. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that
   they may be sound in the faith." Whatever their profession were, if
   they were not delivered by the gospel from the power and practice of
   these national sins which they were so prone unto, they would not long
   be sound in the faith nor fruitful in obedience. So among the Jews
   there was a peculiar kind of stubbornness and obstinacy, above any
   other nation under heaven, which God complaineth of in their successive
   generations from first to last, and which continueth to be their
   characteristical evil unto this day. Hence Josiah was eminently
   commended, "because his heart was tender," 2 Chron. xxxiv. 27. He was
   not under the power of the common sin of that people, which indeed
   includes all other evils whatever. It was a rare thing to find one of a
   tender heart among them.

   And we may observe (it being easily demonstrable), that the great
   apostasy which is at this day among the nations which have received the
   Christian religion consists in a degeneracy into those customs,
   manners, humours, and courses of conversation, which were common among
   them and national before the entrance of Christianity. Set aside an
   outward profession and formality of worship, and the generality of men
   in most nations live as they did formerly, and are given up greatly
   unto those vices which were prevalent among them in their heathenism. A
   full evidence this is that the power of evangelical truth is lost among
   them, the efficacy thereof consisting in curing the vices of nature and
   those evils which men have been most habituated unto, as the prophet at
   large declares, Isa. xi. 6-9.

   Thus the sin of this nation hath been always esteemed sensuality of
   life, in an excess of eating and drinking, with the consequents
   thereof. Hereunto of late have been added vanity in apparel, with
   foolish, light, lascivious modes and dressings therein, and an immodest
   boldness in conversation among men and women. These are corruptions,
   which, being borrowed from the neighbour nation, and grafted on
   crab-stocks of our own, have brought forth the fruit of vanity and
   pride in abundance. And it is the most manifest evidence of a
   degenerate people, when they are prone to naturalize the vices of other
   nations among them, but care not to imitate their virtues, if in any
   kind they do excel. But thus the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
   are joined unto the lust of the flesh, to give the world, as opposite
   unto God, a complete interest among us. It may be these things are
   restrained in some by contrary vices, as covetousness, and an earnest
   desire or ambition to enrich a family, and leave a name amongst men; --
   a vanity infused amongst mankind from the great design of the builders
   of Babel; which was, to "make unto themselves a name," Gen. xi. 4. This
   is but another way of the exercise of the same sin.

   Now, where sins are thus national and common, it is easier for men to
   preserve themselves from the most raging epidemical disease than from
   being, in one degree or other, tainted with the infection of them. It
   is almost inexpressible how efficaciously they will insinuate
   themselves into the minds and lives of men. They are so beset on every
   side with the occasions of them and temptations unto them, they offer
   themselves continually with so many specious pretences, as that there
   is no security against them but by being encompassed with "the whole
   armour of God;" a matter that few understand or apply themselves unto.
   But it is not [possible] on any other grounds or by any other means for
   single persons to hold out and prevail against a national confederacy
   in sin; for they who will not say "A confederacy" to them, or in those
   things wherein a whole people shall say "A confederacy," must be
   content to be for "signs and wonders," to be despised, and even hooted
   at, Isa. viii. 11, 12, 18. However, it is apparent that by them the
   general apostasy we treat of is visibly and openly promoted. Some are
   engaged in them by a corrupt course of education, and some are betrayed
   into the entrances of them by sloth, negligence, and security; some
   lose a sense of their guilt by their commonness; some yield to the
   arguments that are pleaded, if not in their justification, yet in their
   excuse or for their extenuation. One way or other, multitudes of all
   sorts are by them turned away from gospel obedience. Hence it is come
   to pass that Christianity is, as unto customs, manners, vanities,
   vices, and way of conversation, sunk down into heathenism; or prevalent
   national sins have drowned the power and left little but the outward
   form of it in the world. And where it is so, the life, substance, and
   all the real benefits of the gospel, are renounced; for it doth not
   design only to turn men in their outward profession from "dumb idols to
   serve the living God," to change the form and outward state of
   religion, -- as the Roman missionaries have made conversions of the
   Indians, giving them new images instead of their old idols, and new
   saints for their former Zemes, -- but to turn men also from "all
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, to live soberly, righteously, and godly,
   in this present world." Where this is not effected, either the gospel
   never really prevailed among men, or they are fallen away from it. And
   where men do engage into a profession of religion, disallowing and
   condemning such national vanities, vices, and customs, if they are
   publicly countenanced they occasion particular apostasies every day.
   This is that which, on the one side and the other, hath almost lost the
   protestant religion in some neighbour nations; for, not being able to
   hold out against those national vanities and vices which are publicly
   countenanced, they find no relief unto their minds but in a
   renunciation of that religion by which they are condemned. And this I
   look upon as the principal means of that general defection from
   evangelical holiness which prevails in most nations The gospel comes
   upon a nation as on a wilderness or forest that is full of such wood,
   thorns and briers, as the soil of itself is peculiarly disposed to
   produce. These it cuts down to the ground, planting good and noble
   plants in their room, whereby the barren wilderness becomes for a
   season a fruitful field. But in process of time, if continual care and
   culture be not used about it, the earth pours out of its own accord the
   weeds and briers which are natural unto it. These springing up
   abundantly choke the other plants and useful herbs, whereby the
   fruitful field is turned again into a wilderness There needs no more
   unto this apostasy but that national vices, for a time suppressed by
   the power of the word, should overgrow the generality of any people,
   whereby the graces of the gospel will be certainly stifled and choked.

   VI. Mistakes about the beauty and glory of Christian religion have been
   no small cause of apostasy from its power and holiness. That it should
   have a glory, somewhat that might render it honourable in the eyes and
   esteem of men, was always thought unquestionable; and it is certainly
   true, provided that we suppose those with whom we have to do have eyes
   to see that glory, and minds enlightened to make a true judgment of it.
   In compliance here-withal was religion outwardly figured and
   represented among the Jews. And as the apostle declares that the
   worship of God in the administration of the gospel is truly glorious,
   and eminently so above what was to be found in the administration of
   the law; so Christian religion is in itself truly honourable, and
   contains in it every thing that is so, in the judgment of God and the
   rectified reason of mankind. But about the true notion and apprehension
   of that glory and honour which is proper unto religion and suited unto
   its nature, men have fallen into many woful mistakes; for whereas it
   principally consists in the glorious internal operations of the Holy
   Spirit, renewing our nature, transforming us into the image and
   likeness of God, with the fruits of his grace in righteousness and,
   true holiness, in a meek, humble, gracious conversation, and the
   performance of all duties according to the rule, few are able to
   discern beauty or glory or honour in these things. But yet where there
   is not an eye to discern them, the gospel must of necessity be despised
   and abandoned, and somewhat else substituted in the room thereof. This
   therefore also proved a great furtherance of the general apostasy, and
   continues an efficacious means of keeping multitudes under the power of
   it unto this day; for, --

   1. Through the loss of spiritual light and neglect of the grace of God,
   things were come to that pass in the world, that those who had the
   conduct of religion saw no real glory themselves in the things wherein
   all the glory of the religion taught and appointed in the gospel doth
   consist. And they are but few that do so at this day. Therefore the
   profession that is made of them by any is generally looked on as
   hypocrisy, mixed with a certain kind of superstition, and is
   accordingly despised; yea, nothing is more contemptible in the world
   than the possession and profession of those ways which are truly, if
   not only, noble. Their view, therefore, being lost in the eyes of the
   leaders of the church, it could not be expected that they should be
   instrumental to open the eyes of others, or careful to instruct them
   how to look after what themselves did not discern.

   2. They were fully satisfied that there was in these things no evidence
   of glory unto the eyes of the generality of mankind, whereunto they
   thought it wisdom to accommodate themselves and the notions of
   religion. Men naturally can see no more beauty in the spiritual power
   of Christianity than the Jews could see in the person of Christ when
   they rejected him, because unto them he made no appearance thereof,
   Isa. liii. 2. That religion should be set off and represented as truly
   glorious and honourable in the eyes of men, they thought it incumbent
   on them to take care; but leaving herein the judgment of God, of Jesus
   Christ, and the Holy Spirit, as declared in the Scripture, they
   accommodated themselves unto the carnal apprehensions of them with whom
   they had to do, which were also suited unto their own. Wherefore, that
   this glory of religion consisted in a ministry in the church humble,
   holy, laborious, eminent in the graces and gifts of the Spirit, looking
   for no honour or respect but for their work's sake; in a worship plain,
   unadorned, spiritual, whose life and excellency consist in the
   invisible, effectual administrations of the Spirit of God; in meekness,
   self-denial, mortification of sin, and the fruits of righteousness,
   proceeding from the grace of the Holy Ghost, -- they neither did
   apprehend themselves nor could imagine that others would be of that
   mind: for the world generally supposeth the direct contrary unto all
   these to be honourable and glorious. Things which have a pretence of
   height and gallantry of spirit, a religions worship set off with such
   ornaments and modes as to affect the outward senses, with somewhat that
   may give satisfaction unto lust and conscience at the same time, are
   the things which unto the most are alone desirable. Wherefore, all
   pretence unto the power of religion dwindling away into an empty,
   jejune form and appearance of it in monkery, the supposed glory of
   Christianity in the world issued in these three things:--

   (1.) The secular pomp and grandeur of the rulers of the church, This
   was designed to beget a reverence unto their persons and offices,
   without which religion itself would be despised. And it is easily
   conceivable how by this means their minds were drawn off from a due
   consideration of all those things which are truly honourable in them,
   and the neglect whereof will be the loss of the power of religion in
   the most at any time; for when they had secured unto themselves that
   honour, respect, and reverence which they esteemed needful unto the
   glory of religion, and found very suitable unto their own desires and
   ends, to what purpose should they trouble or perplex themselves with
   those hard duties of exemplary mortification, self-denial, and painful
   labour in the work of the ministry, when the whole of what they aimed
   at or needed was prepared for them? And how corrupt a spring of
   apostasy brake forth hereon hath been before declared.

   (2.) A pompous, ceremonious worship, which began to be introduced by a
   pretence of outward solemnity, and ended in plain superstition and
   idolatry. And hereby were the minds of men diverted and taken off from
   inquiring after that spiritual exercise of the graces and gifts of the
   Spirit, wherein alone the beauty of evangelical holiness doth consist.

   (3.) In works of magnificence and bounty, wherewith the clergy were
   enriched, and the consciences of men pacified in a course of sin or an
   unholy lithe. When the world was once persuaded that in these things
   consisted the glory and beauty of religion, and found them all readily
   compliant with their lusts and darkness, that real holiness and
   obedience which is required in the gospel was every day more and more
   neglected and despised. Besides, it is not expressible what wicked,
   scandalous practices, in pride, ambition, divisions, and contentions
   among the leaders of the church, did spring from and ensue on these
   principles. Henceforward no small part of ecclesiastical story is taken
   up with fierce contentions and quarrels about the pre-eminence,
   dignities, privileges, and jurisdiction of the prelates. Those who were
   wise and sober among the heathen observed this evil among Christians,
   reporting it as that whereby their religion was debased and corrupted.
   Such is the account given by Ammianus Marcellinus of that bloody and
   scandalous conflict between Damasus and Ursicinus whether of them
   should be bishop of Rome, lib. xxvii. cap. 6.

   VII. During these seasons, Satan (as he will never be) was not wanting
   unto his own occasions and advantages; and they are altogether ignorant
   of his devices who discern him not at work even at present unto the
   same end and purpose. Nor is it possible that in any age, time, or
   place, the glory of the gospel should be abated, and the principal
   endeavour therein not belong to him. He is the head and leader of every
   apostasy from God. Therein he began his work in this world, and in the
   promotion of it he will finish it. And as he engaged all his power and
   art against the Head of the church, so by his total defeat in that
   attempt, wherein he made the clearest discovery of his pride and malice
   against God that it is possible for him to do, he is not discouraged
   from pursuing the same design against the whole church itself. And the
   way now insisted on hath been the chiefest path that he hath beaten in
   his course; for from the very entrance of Christianity, he Began to
   immix himself with all those lusts of men whereby a defection from its
   power and purity might be set on foot and effected. And he engaged
   against it in both his capacities, as a lion and as a serpent. As a
   lion he stirred up, acted, and animated all those bloody persecutions
   whereby the Jews and Pagan world attempted for three hundred years to
   exterminate the Christian profession. But herein his success was
   answerable to that of his attempt against the Head of the church, and
   ever will be so, by virtue of the victory the Lord Christ had over him
   in the same kind of conflict. The force of the devil and the world
   having been once fully broken and subdued by Christ, it shall never
   prevail in the issue against his followers. Satan, in a confederacy
   with the world, may as a lion, through rage and blood, make a great
   bluster, and scatter the churches of Christ for a season, but prevail
   unto the ruin of the church in this way he never did, nor shall. And if
   at any time, by national devastations, he do so far succeed as to expel
   the gospel from any place or country for a season, it shall be evident
   unto all that it shall turn greatly unto its advantage in general and
   in other places. Let not, then, any fear his bloody fury as to the
   interest of Christ and the gospel in the world. As sure as he was
   conquered and triumphed over in the cross of Christ, he shall finally
   be so in all such attempts. Happy and blessed are they, and shall they
   be, by whose blood and temporal ruin his power at any time is or shall
   be broken. So I say it fell out in his first attempt in this way
   against Christian religion; for through the efficacy of the grace of
   Christ, and by virtue of the victory obtained against him in his own
   person, he was overcome by the blood and constancy of innumerable holy
   souls, until he was cast out of the havens of the world, and an end was
   put unto his rage. But, in the meantime, whilst this sworn enemy of the
   church made all this bluster as a lion, and raised all these storms of
   persecution, which the minds of all the professors of Christianity were
   intent upon, and generally much fortified against, he was secretly at
   work as a serpent also. Herein he secretly and gradually infected the
   minds of many with ambition, worldliness, superstition, and a neglect
   of the power and simplicity of the gospel That this is his work as a
   serpent our apostle declares, 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3. And herein sometimes "he
   transformed himself into an angel of light," as he speaks in that
   place, verses 14, 15; for he not only poisoned and inflamed the lusts
   of men, but drew them aside from the gospel by suggestions and
   pretences of more piety and devotion, or at least of other outward
   modes and means of their expression, than it did require. So did the
   "mystery of iniquity" work in the days of the apostles themselves, 2
   Thess. ii. 7. He was at work secretly, by ways and means not easy to be
   discovered, to draw off the minds of men from evangelical truth and
   holiness, by sowing the seeds of that ambition and superstition which
   afterward spread themselves over the face of the whole visible church.
   So was he the spirit which animated the apostasy which by various and
   insensible degrees prevailed in the following ages. Those who acted in
   it and promoted it never knew any thing of the design, but added one
   thing unto another, as occasion was offered, which gave it increase;
   but in him the projection was designed, and regularly carried on from
   the beginning. Hence had it the name of "The mystery of iniquity," as
   being insinuated and promoted by such unsearchable methods or depths of
   Satan, that those, for the most part, who were subservient to his
   design, knew not what they did, though sufficiently warned in the
   Scripture of what he would do and what should come to pass. Wherefore,
   being disappointed, as was said, in his endeavours by outward force and
   persecution (as he will ever be), leaving the name, power, and
   advantage of the church unto them that professed Christianity, he made
   use of all the darkness, ignorance, errors, ambition, and lusts of men,
   gradually to draw them from the truth and holiness of the gospel. And
   he ceased not until he had brought Christian religion to be looked on
   as made up principally, if not only, of those things which by his craft
   and the lusts of men were introduced into it. So did he pursue his
   work, almost undiscovered, until the generality of those who professed
   Christian religion were given up to the power of sensual lusts on the
   one hand, or brought under the power of superstition on the other. All
   this he attempted, and in a great measure effected, of his own accord.
   But after that men had voluntarily given up themselves unto his
   delusions, rejecting the truth and holiness of the gospel, as unto
   their love to them and delight in them, God in his righteous judgment
   gave them up unto his power, to be infatuated by him, and hardened to
   their eternal ruin. So the apostle expresseth it, 2 Thess. ii. 11, 12,
   "For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." Thus was the apostasy
   completed under the Papacy; and by the same artifices is Satan still at
   work among us unto the same ends and purposes.

   VIII. Moreover, among the occasions of the present decay of holiness
   and the power of Christianity in the world, we may reckon the scandal
   that hath been given by or is justly taken at those who have professed
   the most strict obedience unto the rules of the gospel. There is
   nothing difficult herein but only to choose out the most pregnant
   instances in the multitudes which offer themselves to evidence this
   occasion. Nor do I intend such offences as some men will enviously seek
   after, and sometimes causelessly create, but such as are really given,
   and offer themselves unto the consideration of all sorts of men. Of
   these I shall mention two only, which are the most obvious and
   extensive; and, --

   1. Offence hath been taken at the divisions that have been among them,
   and continue so to be, with the management of them in an evil,
   contentious frame of spirit. The Lord Christ hath declared and
   appointed that the mutual love of his disciples should be the great
   testimony of the truth of his doctrine and the sincerity of their
   obedience. He hath also commanded them to be one in heart, mind, and
   affection, praying for them also that so they might be. His commands
   and directions unto this purpose are known unto all who know the
   gospel, and so need not here to be repeated or insisted on. The blessed
   effects and fruits of them were eminent for a season among the
   professors of the gospel, and their mutual love was a convincing
   argument of the truth, efficacy, and holiness, of the doctrine which
   they did profess: for where there is oneness and love thereon, there is
   peace, order, usefulness to mankind, and every good work; whereas the
   want of them is attended with strife, envy, confusion, disorder, and
   every evil work whatever. Some divisions, indeed, happened among the
   primitive Christians, but were quickly healed by the spirit of
   apostolical authority, and that love which was yet prevalent among
   them. But afterward all things grew worse, and the first visible
   degeneracy of Christianity consisted in the strifes, divisions, and
   contentions of its professors, especially of their leaders. And these
   in no long process of time proceeded unto that excess, and were acted
   with such an evil spirit of pride, ambition, envy, and malice, that the
   very heathens made themselves sport with their contentions, and
   observed that there were no sort of men in the world so ready for them
   and implacable in them as the Christians of those days were. But when
   once one or other party of them got into power, and, snatching that
   sword of force and violence out of the hands of Pagans which had been
   imbrued in the blood of the holy martyrs, began, in the pursuit of
   their divisions, to persecute one another (which way carnal men having
   tasted the sweetness and advantage of, as that which, gratifying their
   envy, malice, and ambition, doth also, as they suppose, secure all
   their earthly concerns, they would not forego, nor have so done until
   it is become the top-stone of many men's religion), it was merely from
   the unspeakable care and mercy of God that they made not the gospel an
   abhorrence unto all flesh; for who, not yet endued with that light and
   grace which might secure him from the power of such temptation, could
   look on the fierce, devouring, bloody contentions of its professors,
   and that solely on its own account, and not suppose that itself
   proceeded from a spirit of malice, strife, and disorder? But the truth
   and faithfulness of God preserved it against all the oppositions of its
   adversaries, and in the midst of the treacheries of its avowed friends.
   Thus was it in the primitive times; which as it was the first
   considerable stop unto the progress of the gospel, so it was one
   principal cause of corrupting the conversation of many, filling them
   with a frame of spirit in all things directly opposite unto that of the
   gospel. The differences, with their untoward management, which fell out
   among the first reformers, was the chief means that hindered their work
   from a universal success.

   Is it much otherwise among the strictest sorts of professors at this
   day? Do not some seem to aim at nothing more than to multiply and
   increase divisions, and to delight in nothing more than to live and
   dispute in the flames of them? There is not the least different
   apprehension of men's minds about any thing in religion, but such
   persons suppose it a sufficient ground to quarrel and contend about it
   forever. By such ways and means scandals are given unto the world in
   its proneness unto apostasy, and seeking occasions for it or
   countenance unto it, which is its present posture; for these things are
   not done in a corner. Men who know nothing of the inward power and
   virtue of that religion which is in such professors, as it is hoped,
   seeing and observing those other distempers among them, are really
   alienated from all the good they do profess; and not only so, but do
   from thence justify and approve themselves in their immorality and
   profaneness, as those which allow them a better condition than such
   wranglers can afford them. By this means hath religion lost much of
   that awful authority in the world whereby it ofttimes put a restraint
   on the minds and consciences of men who were never acted by its power.
   What are the rules whereby we ought to walk under the continuance of
   these differences, and what are the best means to put an issue unto
   them, I have inquired in a treatise unto that purpose. [12] But it must
   be acknowledged that for the most part attempts for the rebuking of
   these distempers, the reconciliation of dissenters, and the uniting of
   professors, have been managed from such principles and in such a frame
   of spirit as have heightened and increased rather than allayed or
   diminished them.

   2. Great offence is given to the world by the uselessness of
   professors, and in that they are not, what they ought to be, the common
   good and blessing of mankind. There is a selfish spirit on many of
   them, whence, contenting themselves with abstinence from known sins,
   and the performance of the religious duties of divine worship, they are
   of little or no use unto others. Some will be kind, benign, helpful,
   good, in some measure unto other men, but yet will and do give undue
   bounds and limits unto their actings in this kind. Their own household,
   and the household of faith, according unto that measure which from
   opinion or prejudice they take of it, they will alone regard. As for
   love, condescension, benignity, kindness, readiness to help, assist,
   and relieve all mankind, yea, the worst of men, as they have
   opportunity, they understand them not, yea, have many pretences that
   they are not required of them. But if we are Christians, it is required
   of us to "abound in love toward all men," 1 Thess. iii. 12; and our
   doing good unto all, being useful unto all, exercising loving-kindness
   in the earth towards all, is the principal way whereby we may express
   our sincere obedience unto the gospel. One professor that is kind,
   benign, condescending, charitable, useful, ready to become all things
   unto all men for their good, brings more glory to the gospel than a
   hundred who are looked on as those who live too much unto themselves.
   When the old saying was, "Bonus vir Caius Sejus, sed malus quia
   Christianus," -- "Such an one is a good man, evil only in this, that he
   is a Christian," religion did by such convictions insensibly get ground
   amongst men. If the world cannot see that it hath any advantage by
   professors, but hath trouble on the other hand by the hatred which it
   cannot but have of their profession, it is no wonder if it desire to
   have no more to do with them. Did men find that so soon as any gave
   themselves unto the strictest ways of profession, therewithal they
   became benign, kind, merciful, charitable, useful, and helpful unto all
   men, it could not but give an honourable reputation in their minds unto
   that religion which they do profess; but an observation of a contrary
   frame and temper in such persons, and of how little use they are in the
   world, must needs produce contrary effects. By reason of such
   miscarriages as these, and others of an alike nature, whereby some
   professors are so far from adorning the gospel of our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ as that they cast, what lies in them, a blemish and
   reproach upon it, others are every day hardened in their alienation
   from all its concerns.

   These few instances have I given of the means and ways whereby a
   general apostasy from the holy precepts of the gospel, as the rule of
   our obedience, hath been begun and carried on. Many others of an alike
   nature might be added unto them; but it is to no purpose to insist long
   on the nature of a disease when we find it to despise all possible
   remedies. Sovereign grace yet remaineth, whereunto this state of things
   is referred.

   And this apostasy, in its measure and proportion, partakes of the guilt
   of that described in the text, which we made the foundation of this
   discourse: for therein also is Christ "crucified afresh, and put to an
   open shame;" for, --

   1. All persons who profess the Christian religion, and yet are thus
   fallen off or alienated from its holiness, do really renounce and
   forego the commands of Christ, and those as enlivened by his promises,
   for the pleasure and wages of sin. And herein do they openly declare
   and avow, as the judgment and resolution of their minds, that there is
   not that excellency in his precepts, nor that goodness, beauty,
   desirableness, or satisfaction in obedience unto them, or not that
   assurance in his promises, or worth in the things promised, as that
   they ought to be preferred before the course of the world and the
   pleasures of sin. Hence some commands of the gospel (and those of no
   small importance unto the furtherance of holy obedience) are neglected
   and cast from among the generality of Christians. Such are the commands
   for mutual love, whereof there is scarce any shadow left in the world:
   for that pretence of it which some seem to rest in and plead for as
   satisfactory, in the peaceable, and, as they say, loving converse of
   persons in their civil and ecclesiastical distributions, is no other
   than what is found among Mohammedans and Pagans on the like occasion;
   which, as it is good and commendable so far as it proceeds from and is
   suited unto the light of nature, so it no way answers, either in the
   kind of it or in its acts and fruits, unto that evangelical love which
   the Lord Christ requires among his disciples. That watchfulness over
   one another with love, care, and tenderness, those mutual admonitions,
   exhortations, and consolations, which the gospel so frequently and
   diligently prescribes unto us, are not only neglected, but so far
   despised that the very naming of such duties is made a matter of scorn,
   as a pretence of hypocritical preciseness; and no better entertainment
   have many other of the commands of Christ among the generality of them
   that are called Christians. So do many, on all accounts, openly profess
   in their walkings and conversation that they see no cogent reason why
   they should comply with him in his commands; and it is not easily to be
   conceived how they can cast a greater dishonour or contempt upon him.

   2. By continuing in the outward profession of Christianity, they do
   most falsely represent Christ and the gospel unto the world, and
   thereby, what lies in them, "put him to an open shame;" for, pretending
   to yield obedience unto him, and to place their hope for life and
   blessedness in him by the gospel, they profess withal that he is a
   person that will approve of such ways as they walk in, and his gospel a
   doctrine that gives countenance unto all manner of licentiousness in
   sin. Who would judge otherwise who had no knowledge of him or it but by
   the representation that is made of them in the profligate conversation
   of such apostates? But this argument I have elsewhere insisted on.

Chapter XI.

   Apostasy from evangelical worship.

   Thirdly, That which was proposed to be considered in the last place is
   that apostasy which is in the world from the purity of the worship of
   the gospel as appointed by Jesus Christ; and herein principally did
   consist that great defection foretold by our apostle, 2 Thess. ii.
   3-12, which is also prophesied of in the Revelation, and did
   accordingly come to pass. But because I have insisted on this subject
   on many other occasions, and some things relating thereunto are under
   difference and debate among such as are capable of the warning given
   concerning the apostasy that is in the world, I shall wholly waive the
   consideration of particulars about which any such differences may be,
   and only mention such things as the generality of Christians, at least
   of Protestants, cannot but acknowledge.

   I shall take it for granted at present, that our Lord Jesus Christ did
   institute and appoint a solemn worship of God, to be continued
   inviolably and unalterably unto the end of the world. And the principal
   end of his appointing, continuing, or preserving any church on the
   earth, is the celebration of this worship; for herein alone consisteth
   that public revenue of glory which God requires from believers in this
   world. All other duties of the gospel may be performed by men in their
   single capacities, if there were no such thing as a church on the
   earth. And those churches do exceedingly mistake their duty, and every
   end of their being, which make it not their principal business to take
   care of the due celebration of that worship which the Lord Christ hath
   appointed. He was faithful in the whole house of God, as was Moses,
   Heb. iii. 5, 6; and if the life, being, happiness, and welfare, of the
   church of Israel, consisted in and depended on their remembrance of the
   law of Moses, which "God commanded unto him in Horeb, with the statutes
   and judgments," Mal. iv. 4, because he was faithful in the house of God
   as a servant, certainly the being and well-being of the Christian
   church consist in and depend upon that observing and doing of all
   whatsoever He hath commanded in the worship of God (as Matt. xxviii.
   20) who is faithful as a son in and over the whole house of God.

   Besides, it is acknowledged by all, -- and we shall, God willing, show
   the manner of it in our exposition of the seventh chapter of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, -- that the Lord Christ, in and by the gospel,
   hath altered and abolished all that solemn worship, all those
   ordinances and institutions, which God himself had set up under the old
   testament, to continue unto the time of reformation; and hereby he
   rendered it absolutely unlawful for any one to serve God according unto
   those institutions. Hereunto God signally set his public seal of
   approbation in the sight of the world; for no sooner had the Lord
   Christ, by the promulgation of the gospel, taken away all their
   authority and obligatory power, so as that his disciples ought not to
   make use of them any longer, but God immediately, by severe and
   unparalleled judgments, destroyed the seat and place of them, so that
   those who would yet never could regularly make use of them unto this
   day. And shall we think that the Lord Jesus Christ thus took away and
   abolished the old solemn worship of the church, and substituted none in
   the room of it? or that he took away that which was erected by the
   wisdom of God, though but for a season, and left the church, as to its
   main duty and principal end in this world, unto the inventions and
   imaginations of men? One of these must be supposed, if it be denied
   that he hath established a solemn worship of God, to continue
   unalterably unto the end of the world; and both of them are highly
   blasphemous. Again, let any, in faith and obedience unto him, practice
   and attend unto all those parts of divine worship which he hath
   appointed, and I am persuaded no man will have the confidence to say
   that there is this or that wanting to render it a solemn and acceptable
   service, however they may contend for the conveniency of some
   circumstantial additionals. Wherefore I take it for granted at present,
   that the Lord Jesus Christ hath appointed such a solemn worship under
   the gospel, which all his disciples are obliged constantly and
   invariably to observe, as he declares, Matt. xxviii. 20. And with
   respect hereunto men may fall away and apostatize from the gospel, no
   less sinfully and fatally than they may fall from the mystery of its
   doctrine or the holiness of its precepts. And there are two ways
   whereby this may be done:-- 1. By neglecting and refusing to observe
   and do what he hath appointed; 2. By adding appointments of our own
   thereunto, inconsistent with and destructive of that which he hath
   ordained:--

   I. In the first way we have some among ourselves who are fallen off
   from the worship of the gospel It is true, they will do some things
   which have an appearance of being what Christ hath commanded; such are
   their first-day's meeting, and their prayers, with speaking in them; --
   but they neither observe the Lord's day, nor pray or speak in obedience
   unto any institution of his. Conveniency and the light within are all
   the reason and guide which they plead for them. And for the sacraments,
   or baptism and the supper of the Lord, which are so great a part of the
   mystical worship of the church, on I know not what fond pretences, they
   utterly reject them. In like manner they deal with a stated ministry as
   of Christ's appointment, although they have found out means to set up
   one of their own.

   And because herein also Christ is "put to an open shame," we shall
   briefly inquire into the grounds and reasons of this defection from the
   obedience due to his commands:--

   1. Now the principal reason, and which compriseth all others, why some
   men have forsaken the gospel, as unto the administration of its
   ordinances, is because they are no way suited unto, nor indeed
   consistent with, that faith and obedience which they have betaken
   themselves unto; for the ordinances of the gospel are representations
   of the things which we believe, and means of the conveyance of their
   efficacy unto us. Unto the confirmation of that faith and our
   edification therein are they suited, and to nothing else. Now, these
   persons having fallen, as we have showed, from the faith of the gospel
   in the mystery of it and the spiritual obedience which it doth require,
   of what use can the ordinances of worship be unto them? For instance,
   the ordinance of the Lord's supper is instituted in the remembrance of
   the death of Christ, of his suffering in our stead, of the sacrifice he
   made of himself therein, of the atonement or reconciliation with God
   that he wrought, and of the sealing of the new covenant with his blood.
   To what end should, any man solemnly worship God in and by this
   ordinance who upon the matter believeth none of these things, at least
   doth not believe them as proposed in the gospel, namely, as the
   principal causes and springs of life, righteousness, and salvation?
   Those who believe in God through these things, who find the effects of
   them upon their souls in righteousness and peace, cannot but delight to
   be found in the exercise of faith through this ordinance, as they know
   it to be their duty so to do. But it is apparent that neither this nor
   the other ordinance of baptism doth contribute any thing to the
   furtherance, increase, or establishment, of that light within men which
   upon the matter they resolve their faith and obedience into; yea, they
   are, in their true and proper notion, as both directing unto the
   sanctifying and justifying blood of Christ, diametrically opposite
   thereunto and unto what is ascribed unto it. It is, therefore, so far
   from being strange that these men should forsake these ordinances of
   gospel worship, that the admission of them in their true and proper use
   and signification is destructive of the whole scheme of religion which
   they have formed unto themselves. Where the faith of the gospel is
   forsaken, the ordinances of worship must be so too, and so all
   instituted divine service be neglected, or other things found out that
   may suit unto the imaginations whereunto men are turned aside.

   2. Another reason hereof hath been want of spiritual light to see
   through the veils of outward institutions, and of the wisdom of faith,
   to obtain communion with God in Christ by them. Our worship under the
   gospel is either absolutely spiritual, or that which comes immediately
   unto what is so. But in these institutions there is somewhat that is
   outward and sensible, and it is to be feared that many do rest in these
   outward things, and proceed no farther in the worship of God by them
   than the actions and words that are used will carry them; but they are,
   as appointed by Christ, "animæ vehicula," means of leading and
   conveying the soul unto an intimate communion with God. That they may
   be so unto us, three things are required:--

   (1.) That we submit our souls and consciences unto the authority of
   Christ in these institutions. Unless this be the foundation which we
   build upon, the whole service will be lost unto us.

   (2.) That we rest on the veracity of Christ for the working of the
   grace and accomplishment of the mercy represented in them and
   sacramentally exhibited by them; for they will not profit them by whom
   the promises of Christ, virtually contained in them and accompanying of
   them, are not mixed with faith, and we cannot believe the promise
   unless we submit to the authority of Christ in the appointment of that
   whereunto it is annexed.

   (3.) That we understand in some measure the mystical relation that is
   between the outward symbols of the ordinance and the Lord Christ
   himself, with his grace represented thereby, wherein the nature, use,
   and end of the institutions are contained.

   And all these are necessary to keep up any delight in them, or a
   conscientious use of them. Where, therefore, all these are wanting, --
   as apparently they are in those concerning whom we treat, being none of
   them either understood, owned, or acknowledged by them, -- whereas they
   have neither spiritual light into the internal nature of these things,
   nor spiritual gifts for their administration unto edification,
   following the conduct of their own principles, they could do no
   otherwise but reject them, and therein fell off from the worship of the
   gospel, and thereby do reflect dishonour upon the Son of God, the
   author and Lord of all these institutions.

   II. There is another way whereby men may, and many men do fall away,
   and have for many ages fallen away, from the gospel with respect unto
   its worship, and that is, by rejecting its simplicity and pure
   institutions, substituting a superstitious, yea, idolatrous worship of
   their own in the room thereof, 2 Cor. xi. 3: for whereas there are
   various degrees of declension from the purity of gospel worship,
   according as men forsake any part of it, or make any additions of their
   own unto it, yet at present I shall mention them only by whom it is
   wholly perverted, -- that is, those of the church of Rome; for as they
   have added unto it rites and institutions of their own in great number,
   partly superstitious and partly idolatrous, so there is no one
   ordinance or institution of Christ which they have not corrupted, the
   most of them so far as utterly to destroy their nature and use.
   Whereas, therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ doth in the ordinances of
   gospel worship and the due celebration of them represent his own
   religion and authority unto the church, to remove them out of the way,
   and to introduce another fabric of them of another constitution, is to
   represent Antichrist unto the church, and not Christ, and thereby to
   "put Christ to an open shame." The ways and means whereby this apostasy
   was effected, by the craft of Satan and the carnal interest of men, in
   a long tract of time, I shall not here declare; it shall suffice at
   present to observe, that as men grew carnal, having lost the spirit,
   life, and power of the gospel, and so far as they did so, they found it
   necessary to introduce a carnal, visible, pompous worship, suited unto
   that inward principle and light whereby they were acted. And as the
   people in the wilderness, being carnal in their hearts, and accustomed
   unto carnal ways of worship, upon the absence of Moses in the mount,
   cried out unto Aaron, "Make us gods, which shall go before us" (that
   is, gods visibly present), "for as for this Moses, we wot not what is
   become of him," whereupon they made a calf; so these men, finding the
   whole fabric of Mosaical institutions, consisting in outward images and
   representations of things, taken away, and themselves left as it were
   without any present gods to guide them, -- that is, such visible
   representations of the presence of God as their carnal hearts and minds
   might delight in, -- they provided all those calves whereof their
   present worship doth consist. And because there were many in those days
   when this design was first set on foot who were truly spiritual and
   holy, worshipping God in spirit and in truth, this idolatrous worship
   could not be introduced and preserved but by insensible degrees and in
   a long tract of time, throughout the whole whereof the "mystery of
   iniquity" wrought effectually unto the same certain end. Those, in the
   meantime, who worshipped God in truth, were either imposed on by a show
   of humility and devotion in the degrees of apostasy which were added in
   their days, or else complained of what they could not remedy.

   And if these brief considerations of the nature of the present apostasy
   that is in the world from the power of Christian religion, in all the
   principal concerns of it, with the causes and occasions thereof, do
   excite or provoke any one who hath more leisure and ability for this
   work unto a more diligent and useful inquiry into them, it will be an
   ample reward unto my endeavours.

Chapter XII.

   Inferences from the foregoing discourses -- The present danger of all
   sorts of persons, in the prevalency of apostasy from the truth and
   decays in the practice of evangelical holiness.

   The last part of this discourse is designed for cautions unto those who
   yet stand, or think they stand, with respect unto that general
   defection from the gospel whose causes and occasions we have thus far
   inquired into. And thereunto some directions may be added, to be used
   as preventives of its contagion.

   This method are we guided unto by the apostle, who, having declared the
   apostasy and ruin which ensued thereon of the generality of the church
   of the Jews, improves the consideration of it unto the caution of
   others, under a present profession of the truth. "Thou wilt say then,"
   saith he to the Gentile believers, "The branches were broken off, that
   I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off,
   and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: for if God
   spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
   Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,
   severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:
   otherwise thou also shalt be cut off," Rom. xi. 19-22. And in another
   place, on an alike occasion, he speaks unto the same purpose: "Let him
   that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall," 1 Cor. x. 12.

   Most men are apt to suppose that the continuance of the true religion
   in any place depends solely on the prudence and industry of those unto
   whom the conduct of its outward concerns are committed. The interest of
   some and the duty of others, in the management of human laws and
   constitutions, are generally looked on as a sufficient and the only
   means of its preservation. And those of this persuasion think they have
   personally no concernment herein, but only to herd themselves in the
   multitude, and to take their fate, whatever it be. Such as these will
   despise our cautions, as those from which the reasons of their
   confidences and fears are most remote. But whereas the profession of
   religion in the community of Christians will not be preserved but by
   the power of it in individuals, the only root whereon it will long
   thrive or grow, we shall not at all concern ourselves in them by whom
   the directions of their duty are thought needless or useless; for after
   the utmost exercise of human policy, it is the wisdom that is from
   above which must be our stability. And if the power of truth and
   holiness be not preserved in the hearts and lives of particular
   persons, the profession of them in churches, or the pretence of them in
   nations (which are all that will remain), are neither acceptable unto
   God nor useful unto the souls of men.

   Some think themselves, as for their own part, little concerned in these
   things. That there is such a defection from the gospel as hath been
   complained of they cannot deny, and they will also grant that it is
   desperately pernicious unto them that are overtaken thereby; therefore
   they suppose it not amiss that men should be warned of its danger and
   directed to avoid it. But this they think necessary for others, not for
   themselves; for as for their part, they have not the like occasions,
   nor are exposed unto the same temptations, with them who formerly
   apostatized from the gospel or are in danger now so to do. Besides,
   they know well enough what are their own resolutions, and that though
   all men should forsake either the doctrine taught in or the obedience
   required by the gospel, yet should their constancy be immovable! But I
   do not think these apprehensions sufficient to render our warnings
   needless. Occasions and temptations are not in our power; our greatest
   present freedom from them will not secure us from the assaults of the
   next hour. Peter foresaw not his dangers and fears when he so
   confidently engaged unto constancy in the profession of his Master,
   which yet within a few hours came upon him. And such is the subtlety of
   our spiritual adversaries, that sometimes we are under the power of
   temptation when we think ourselves most remote from it. It is beyond
   the compass of human reason to take at once a prospect of all the
   causes and means thereof, with the ways of its efficacy and prevalency.
   And if at any time we judge ourselves free from an hour of temptation,
   which comes upon the world to try them that dwell therein, which most
   are exercised with and many are prevailed on by, so as to be secure and
   regardless of the means of our preservation, of all men we are in the
   most danger to be ruined by it. Neither will the best of our
   resolutions be of any avail without the utmost of our endeavours. The
   great apostle thought and resolved with respect unto the person of
   Christ that he would neither deny him nor forsake him, and it this
   confidence did not betray him into his fall, yet to be sure it did not
   preserve him from it; and it was upon his own experience that he gave
   afterward that holy advice, that we should "give a reason of the hope
   that is in us with meekness and fear," 1 Pet. iii. 14, 15, and "pass
   the time of our sojourning here in fear," chap. i. 17. The highest
   present confidences have ever proved the most deceiving presages of
   future stability. Wherefore, the utmost I design in the ensuing
   cautions is but to excite men unto a due apprehension of their danger,
   that they be not surprised into that pernicious security which is the
   mire wherein this rush doth grow.

   1. The consideration of the extent and almost universality of this
   apostasy may be of use unto this purpose. Ignorance, profaneness,
   worldly-mindedness, with sensuality of life, have obtained the most
   eminent catholicism in Christendom. The complaint of the prophet is not
   unsuited to the present state thereof: Isa. i. 4-6, "Ah sinful nation,
   a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are
   corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy
   One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. The whole head
   is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto
   the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and
   putrifying sores." Do we hear but of this or that individual person who
   hath apostatized from a profession of holiness, into a sensual, wicked,
   worldly course of life, or is turned from the faith into pernicious
   errors? there is no man that is wise and careful of his eternal
   concerns, but he will take it as a warning to examine, try, and be
   careful of himself; and this counsel is laid before us by the apostle,
   2 Tim. ii. 17-19. What, then, is required of us when we see nations,
   churches, multitudes of people, by one means or other, degenerated from
   that power of godliness which once they professed? If we hear that one
   or other in a city is visited with the plague, we are not altogether
   insensible of our own concern and danger, because we know how usual it
   is for the infection of that disease to spread and diffuse itself; but
   if the whole city be infected, and thousands fall under it every week,
   there is none so sottish as to need much warning of their danger. And
   shall we be less concerned for our immortal souls and their eternal
   condition than we are for these frail carcasses and their continuance
   for a few days in the world, which, if they escape one distemper, may
   yet in a few moments fall under the power of another? This spiritual
   "pestilence," that hath formerly "walked in darkness," is now a
   "destruction wasting at noonday." Nations are depopulated by it and
   cities left desolate, as unto their interest in God and the gospel; and
   is it not high time to "look diligently" lest the infection reach unto
   us also, lest we also should "fail" and come short "of the grace of
   God," and be "hardened through the deceitfulness of sin?" As, then, our
   bodies are of the same natural frame and constitution, as they have in
   them the same burnouts, the same kind of animal spirits, as are in
   those who are infected with the plague, whereby we are obnoxious unto
   the same infection with them; so there are in our souls and minds the
   same principles of sin and love of the world as are infected, drawn
   away, enticed, excited, and enraged, by outward occasions and
   temptations, until they have issued in apostasy. Do we think that we
   shall be always easily preserved, and that whilst we are careless and
   secure, from that torrent which hath carried away such multitudes
   before it? Are we in ourselves better than they, or any of them? Have
   we a patent for our preservation, whilst we neglect any ways, means, or
   diligence that the rule requireth thereunto? Doth not God show unto us,
   not one, but many churches and nations, saying, "Go unto those Shilohs
   where I some time placed my name, and see what is become of them, and
   what I have done unto them? Will ye go after them? have yea mind to be
   made like unto them? Think not to say within yourselves, We have
   Abraham to our father; we have those outward privileges and advantages
   which they had not:' for they also enjoyed the same until they had
   forfeited them by their apostasy." Certainly the general prevalency of
   this evil proclaims such a danger as no wise man, no man that takes
   care of his own salvation, ought or indeed can neglect. Wherefore, as
   it is always with Christians, if ever it be, a time to watch, to stand
   on our guard, to take unto ourselves the whole armour of God, to be
   jealous of ourselves, to be constant and diligent in the use of all
   means, both private and public, for our preservation, it is now a time
   so to be. And if professors will not be awakened; if they will not stir
   up themselves with the gifts and graces which they have received; if
   they will please themselves that all is well with them, and is likely
   so to be; if they will yet immix themselves with boldness and
   confidence in the ways of the world; -- oh that my head were a fountain
   of tears! oh that my soul could mourn in secret for them! seeing
   assuredly they will not be able to stand in that day of temptation
   which is come upon the face of the earth, to try them that dwell
   therein. The outward court is long since given to be trodden down by
   the Gentiles, and how soon the enemies may roar in the very
   sanctuaries, and set up their banners for tokens, we know not; for, --

   2. The present state of this defection hath a dangerous aspect.
   Physicians say, "Nemo moritur in declinatione morbi," -- "No man dies
   in the declension of his disease;" and when a public pestilential
   distemper is in its wane or decay, the danger is esteemed in a great
   measure over. But whilst a disease is yet growing and daily spreading
   its contagion, whilst the bills of mortality are every week increased,
   they are only hardened and profligate persons whom the commonness of
   the judgment renders regardless and senseless of it. And it is no
   otherwise with the evil complained of at this day. There is almost
   nothing in the world that all sober men do generally agree in but this
   alone, that the whole world doth daily wax worse and worse. Who can
   give an instance of the decrease or abatement of any one sin in its
   love or practice? but that some are advanced to higher degrees of
   confidence in their perpetration than former days or ages afford us any
   precedent of, every one can declare. What instances have we of a
   spiritual recovery from any of our decays? What attempts unto that
   purpose are made by any, unless by such as are not of consideration, as
   have not advantages to enable them to effect any thing therein? The
   world is highly at variance about religion, managing its differences
   with great animosities and industry, how one way, party, and
   profession, may draw persons from other ways and professions. The sole
   business of the church of Rome is, by all manner of artifices to win
   over men unto their communion; that is, a subjection of their souls,
   consciences, and entire interests here and for eternity, to the
   authority of the pope. Others bestir themselves as well as they are
   able to keep what they have, and to rescue men from their seductions;
   -- and although they have the advantage of the truth on their side, and
   for the most part the advantage of abilities in the management of their
   cause, yet they visibly lose ground every day; and where one is
   recovered from the Roman interest, many are added unto it. And there
   can be no reason assigned hereof, but only that the apostasy is upon
   its increase, this being one way of it. Half that pains would have
   formerly turned a whole city from Popery which will not now succeed
   unto the preservation of one person. But, in the meantime, both in one
   profession and another, all sorts of men continue regardless of gospel
   holiness and obedience; and whilst they quarrel about the outward form,
   the inward power of godliness lies neglected. Do we see things anywhere
   in the world upon a recovery, or any thriving design for the retrieval
   of holiness? The name and thing are growing more and more into
   contempt. What instance can be given wherein this apostasy from the
   gospel doth or may exert itself, -- be it in atheism, be it in Popery,
   in hatred of and scoffing at the mysteries of evangelical truth, in
   worldliness, profaneness, vanity, and sensuality of life, in the
   coldness of love and barrenness among professors, -- that is not openly
   in its progress? And is this a time to be secure, careless, or
   negligent? Are we sure that this epidemical infection shall not enter
   our habitations? Do we not find how it hath, one way or other,
   attempted us already? Can we find no decay in zeal or love among
   ourselves, no adherence unto the world unsuited unto our present state
   and condition in it, no neglect of duties, no rareness in divine
   visitations, no want of life and delight in spiritual communion with
   Christ, no hurtful growth of carnal wisdom, with all its attendants? or
   have we not found ourselves, one way or other, sensibly attacked by
   these evils? It is to be feared that those who can make no observation
   of any thing of this nature among themselves are somewhat sick of the
   Laodicean distemper. And if we will not be awakened and stilted up to a
   more than ordinary diligence, care, and watchfulness, at such a season
   as this is, it is to be feared that ere long the generality of
   professors will come to be in the condition of the church of Sardis, --
   to have a name to live, but indeed and in the sight of Christ to be
   dead.

   3. As this apostasy is yet in its progress, so what will be its event,
   what it will rise unto, is altogether uncertain. God can put a stop
   unto it when he pleaseth, as he hath in his holy purposes fixed bounds
   unto it which it shall not pass; but in the meantime, being greatly
   provoked by the ingratitude of a wicked world, no man knows how long he
   may suspend those more powerful influences and more extraordinary
   effects of his word and Spirit which are needful unto the healing of
   the nations, and without which they will not be cured. I hope for
   better things and pray for better things; but I have no certain ground
   of assurance that this apostasy shall not grow until, in one instance
   or other of it, it swallow up all visible profession. The whole world,
   so far as I know (I mean these parts of it), may become papal again, or
   be so corrupted in their principles and profane in their lives as that
   it is no great matter what their profession in religion be. Two things
   I do know or believe, -- namely, (1.) That "the foundation of God
   standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his."
   His elect, that truly fear him and diligently serve him, shall be
   preserved from perishing eternally, and from every thing that
   necessarily leads thereunto. (2.) That God hath appointed a time and
   season wherein he will not only put a stop unto this defection from the
   gospel, but an end also. He will one day execute the vengeance that he
   hath written and recorded on the throne, power, and kingdom of the
   antichristian apostasy, and in one day shall the plagues of Babylon
   come upon her; and he will again "turn to the people a pure language,
   that they may all call on the name of the Lord, to serve him with one
   consent," Zeph. iii. 9. He will again revive the beauty of his worship,
   and the glory of holiness in the earth; but, in the meantime, what
   things may come unto I know not. Those who pretend to a clearer
   inspection into future things may not do amiss strictly to examine the
   grounds whereon they proceed; for many have been made ashamed of their
   predictions, that within such or such a time the yoke of Babylon should
   be broken. This is all I say (and I say it only for myself), I know no
   assurance that can be given on infallible grounds that the apostasy
   which we are treating of shall not one way or other, in one instance or
   other, become again to be catholic, and prevail against all open,
   visible profession of the purity and power of gospel worship and
   holiness. Now, if this be not so unto others, yet unto myself it ought
   to be a warning how I may be thought worthy to escape, and to stand
   before the Son of man. And I am sure there is so much danger of it at
   least as to deserve the consideration of all who take care of their
   eternal salvation; for if things should come to such a pass, they are
   not many, they are but very few, who will be entirely preserved. The
   most will, one way or other, suffer loss; and it is not an easy thing
   to be found among the number of the few in such a season. Can we think
   that men careless in holy duties, cold in zeal, lukewarm in love,
   barren in good works, cleaving to the world and conformable unto it,
   low in their light, dubious in their state, useless in the world,
   fearful of trials, will be of this number? They are woefully deceived
   who are pleased with such apprehensions Other principles, other ways,
   courses, and practices, will be required in them who shall be hidden
   and safeguarded in that day.

   4. The various ways whereby this defection prevails in the world should
   also warn us to stand upon our guard. Were it of one sort only, did it
   work only one way, or make use of one engine alone for its progress,
   the evil and danger of it might be the more easily either withstood or
   avoided; but as we have before referred it unto three general heads, --
   with respect unto the doctrine, the holiness, and the worship of the
   gospel, -- so under each of them there are various ways and means
   whereby it is promoted. The infection from this plague is taken
   innumerable ways, Heb. xii. 1. Some take it in their shops or especial
   vocations; some in their societies, civil and ecclesiastical; some from
   the vanities and pleasures, some from the profits and advantages, of
   the world. Unbelief, the deceitfulness of sin, corrupt lusts and
   affections, spiritual sloth, cares about and love of riches, lie all in
   a readiness to give entertainment to and to embrace any opportunity,
   advantage, or means, whatever it be, whereby this apostasy may be
   admitted and take place in them. See Heb. iii. 12, 13, xii. 15-17.
   Satan, in the meantime, labours by his insinuations to corrupt our
   minds, to poison our lusts, and to supply them with all inveigling or
   provoking objects, 2 Cor. xi. 3; 1 Pet. v. 8. In this state of things,
   look how many public temptations there are in the world, so many
   general ways and means are there whereby this apostasy doth prevail;
   and who can reckon up these temptations? Hence it is that men fall
   under this evil in such various ways, and unto such various degrees.
   Some do so by errors and "damnable heresies, denying the Lord that
   bought them;" some by superstition and idolatry; some by a contempt of
   gospel mysteries, and preferring another way of duty before evangelical
   obedience; some by ambition and pride of life; some by love of the
   world, and a neglect of duties spiritual and moral, under a deceiving
   profession; some by suffering carnal wisdom and some sensual lusts to
   devour their convictions and their efficacy; some by the uncertainty of
   their minds, brought to an indifferency in all things supernatural and
   divine; some by vain-glory and shame to be found among the scorned
   society of those who are truly religious; and multitudes are initiated
   into an irrecoverable profaneness by the vain pomps and spectacles of
   the age. And other ways there are, more than can be recounted, whereby
   this evil is propagated, and men fall under the power of it. By this
   means the very common air we breathe in is infected, 1 Cor. xv. 33.
   Snakes are in all grass whereon we tread, and scorpions under every
   stone. Snares are laid for us on every hand, and those (some of them)
   so gilded and set off, that multitudes of loose professors have taken
   them up and wear them as their ornaments. Those who escape one evil do
   every day fall into others. And how shall they escape who are
   encompassed with so many dangers, if they live in the neglect of any
   one duty or means of their preservation that God hath appointed and
   made useful thereunto?

   5. Consider that there is an apostasy which is irrecoverable, and it
   will end in eternal ruin. This is that which we are taught in this
   context, according unto the exposition before given of it. No man in
   this world can be, by the rule of the gospel, in an unsalvable
   condition, -- that is, be concluded under an unavoidable destruction by
   any known rule of the revealed will of God, -- unless it be an
   apostate. There are also several sorts and degrees of apostasy that may
   have several causes and effects, and so various events. Great
   surprisals, strong temptations, negligence in watching against the
   deceitfulness of sin, may produce temporary abnegations of Christ and
   the gospel, woful declensions from the due observation of his commands,
   with wandering into foolish opinions, and yet persons may be recovered
   from them all, and brought by repentance unto salvation. Signal
   instances of this grace and patience in God might be given. And this is
   sufficient to render the despair of them causeless who are ever
   awakened in this world [in] time enough to endeavour a deliverance from
   any sin, or course of sinning, provoking and destructive; for when any
   man is by any means called to have any thing to do with God about his
   eternal concernments, God doth not allow him to be the absolutely
   sovereign judge of himself, which would usurp his prerogative and put
   the sinner in the place of God. He that despairs says, "I am in the
   stead of God to myself in this matter. There is neither goodness, nor
   grace, nor mercy in him, but what I can comprehend." And this evil God
   hath obviated in signal instances of the recovery of great apostates.
   But yet withal there is, as we have showed, an apostasy that is
   irrecoverable; and hereof God permits many examples in this world, to
   put an awe not only on bold and presumptuous, but also on careless and
   negligent sinners: for whereas our apostle cloth expressly twice mind
   the Hebrews of this severity of God against apostates, in this place
   and in chap. x. 26, 27, in the one he doth it with respect unto
   unprofitableness under the means of grace, and in the other with
   respect unto a negligence in attending unto the administration of
   gospel ordinances. Now, whereas any men may be overtaken with the
   beginning of decays and declensions from the holiness and worship of
   the gospel, all which have a tendency in their own nature unto this
   irrecoverable apostasy, ought they not to be continually jealous over
   themselves, lest they should pass the bounds God hath fixed unto his
   patience and grace? Ought we not to be careful about every sin or
   omission of duty that hath a tendency unto this doleful issue? For this
   very end, that we may be warned to take heed of the beginning of
   apostasy, doth the apostle in this place declare the end of it. The
   reader may, if he please (to help him herein), consult our discourses
   on chap. iv. 3. [13] It is not an easy task to stop a course in
   backsliding when once it is entered into. And I shall close this
   warning with naming two directions unto this purpose:-- (1.) Take heed
   of a course in any sin. Though every sin cloth not immediately tend
   unto final apostasy, yet a course in any sin continued doth so. (2.)
   Take heed of touching on such especial sins as have a peculiar tendency
   thereunto; and of what nature they are hath been declared.

   6. Our last consideration of this kind shall be taken from the nature
   and guilt of this sin, wherever it be found, with the severity of God
   against it; and we may look upon it as it is total, such as that
   supposed by the apostle, Heb. vi. 4-6. The exposition we have given of
   the words will warrant us to conclude that total apostasy from the
   gospel once professed is a greater sin, and of a more heinous nature,
   than that of the Jews in crucifying the Lord Christ in the days of his
   flesh. This was sufficiently proved in the exposition of the words. It
   remains only that we do briefly inquire what doth concur unto such a
   total apostasy, whereby the truth of the exposition and the necessity
   of the warnings given will be made yet more evident. And though I shall
   speak with especial respect unto total apostasy from all profession,
   yet are the things that shall be spoken to be found, in their degree
   and measure, in all those who are guilty of that partial defection
   which we have described. There are, therefore, always found in this
   great offence the things ensuing:--

   (1.) The loss of all taste of any goodness or excellency in the gospel,
   in the truth or state of its profession and worship. There is no man
   who hath ever made a profession of the gospel in earnest, beyond
   pretence and custom, but he hath found some kind of taste, relish, or
   sweetness, in the things of it. They "taste of the good word of God,
   and the powers of the world to come." Either in the things themselves,
   or in the manner of their dispensation, or of the duties of worship
   enjoined therein, they have found somewhat that hath given their minds
   and consciences some satisfaction. A man cannot go into a pleasant
   garden in the spring but he will smell some savour from the flowers,
   though he gather not one of them. A man cannot take meat savoury and
   well condited into his mouth but he will taste the relish of it, though
   he have no mind nor appetite to eat it; nor can any man walk in the sun
   but he will have some impressions from its heat. It is so, it can be no
   otherwise, with them who live under the preaching of the gospel and
   make profession of its doctrine. More or less it will insinuate itself
   into their minds with a taste of its excellency and goodness. This in
   the case considered is lost in the first place; and generally it comes
   to pass by a love of sin and the pleasures of the world. When this hath
   filled and possessed the soul, all its senses grow dead unto spiritual
   things, it hath no faculty or ability to taste any relish in them, yea,
   it loathes and abhors them as contrary to what it hath immersed itself
   in or given up itself unto. This usually is lost in the first place.
   Such persons find nothing any longer in Christ or the gospel for which
   they should either delight in them or desire them. And it seems to be
   thus with so many in the world who once gave hopes of better things,
   that the consideration of it is dreadful.

   (2.) This is quickly followed with a loss of all prevailing evidence
   and conviction of the truth of the very doctrine of the gospel. This
   conviction all are supposed to have who profess it, and all really have
   it who profess it in any sincerity. Why else do they make profession of
   it, if they assent not unto its truth upon its conviction and evidence?
   for we speak not at all of them whose profession hath no other
   principle or foundation but custom or education. Others build their
   persuasion upon grounds and evidences prevalent to obtain their assent
   unto the truth against temptations and objections. This apostates lose
   in the next place. The truth remains what it was, and so do the
   arguments and evidences of it; but they have no longer any force upon
   or authority in their minds. It may be they do not presently renounce
   the gospel as a lie or "a cunningly-devised fable;" they may let the
   notions of it lie loose in their minds for a season neglected and
   unregarded, but give them no part of that entertainment which is due
   unto acknowledged truths of that nature, nor do they receive any
   impressions from its authority. And when men have lost these, they have
   lost their assent to the truth of the gospel upon its proper evidence,
   and are directly unbelievers; and this on every occasion will issue in
   a formal renunciation of the truth of the whole. And when men arrive
   unto this posture in their minds, they will discover themselves, as by
   a conversation wholly regardless of the precepts of Christ, so also by
   light, irreverent expressions concerning the Scripture; which, where
   they have freedom, will be poured out from the abundance of their
   hearts. This step towards total apostasy will follow that foregoing.
   When once men have lost all taste and relish of the goodness and
   excellency of the word of God on their hearts and affections, they will
   not long retain any prevalent evidence of its truth in their minds.
   Hence, --

   (3.) A contempt of the things promised in the gospel doth ensue. The
   promises of the gospel do indeed contain those things wherein the
   evident blessedness and happiness of our nature doth consist. Such are
   serenity of mind in this world, and eternal felicity in the enjoyment
   of God. These, for the substance of them, mankind cannot despise until
   they grow atheistically brutish; but they may, and many do so, in the
   manner and on the terms of their proposal and declaration by the
   promises of the gospel. That this enjoyment of God, wherein everlasting
   happiness consisteth, must be in and through Jesus Christ alone; that
   the way of attaining thereunto, and the only means of present peace and
   serenity of mind, is by faith and obedience in and unto him, -- this
   they despise and contemn. This naturally follows on the former; for all
   expectation of good by and from the promises of the gospel depends on
   the evidence that we have of the truth thereof, and when that is lost,
   these will be despised. Now, herein consisteth one of the greatest
   aggravations of this sin; for whereas men cannot but desire the things
   (for the substance of them) which are promised in the gospel, as those
   wherein their blessedness doth consist, they will, out of hatred to
   Jesus Christ, reject and despise them, and eternally deprive their
   souls of them, rather than accept of them in and through him. They will
   rather never have any interest in God than have it by Christ. This
   rejection, therefore, of the promises of the gospel, as those which
   either as to the matter of them are not to be desired, or as to the
   truth of them not to be trusted, is the most provoking sin. No greater
   reproach can possibly be cast on Jesus Christ, as that which leaveth
   him the honour neither of his truth nor power, neither of which the
   Jews could in the least impeach when they took away his life. And, --

   (4.) They choose some other way or means in the place and stead of
   Christ and the gospel, for the ends which they once sought after by
   them. So did those persons who fell off to Judaism. They looked for
   that in the law and ceremonies which they could not find in the gospel.
   And of these there are two sorts:-- [1.] Such as retain their first end
   in general, but reject the gospel from being a sufficient means for
   attaining it; [2.] Some that renounce the whole end itself, and seek
   for satisfaction other ways. The former are such as preserve an aim in
   general to worship God, to do that in religion which may be accepted by
   him, and to believe that of him which is right; but they reject the
   gospel as an insufficient and deceitful guide in and about these
   things. And this is done either totally, by such as apostatize to
   Judaism or Mohammedanism; or partially, by such as turn off from the
   purity, truth, spirituality, and mystery of the gospel unto Popery, or
   the like. I say not this with an intention to charge the guilt of this
   whole sin on this latter sort; only I say, they share in a very
   considerable part of it, and without repentance will do so in the
   punishment due unto it. And this casts the scorn of folly on Christ and
   the gospel; both absolutely, as having neither truth nor efficacy
   sufficient for the end proposed by them; and comparatively, that a
   falsehood or lie, a diabolical invention or delusion, is to be
   preferred before them; -- which is the highest provocation unto the
   eyes of God's glory. The latter sort quite cast off the general end of
   pleasing God and living unto him. For a while they thought that this
   would have brought them in some considerable satisfaction, and used the
   gospel to that end and purpose; but now being fallen under the power of
   the former degrees of apostasy, in contempt of the gospel, as that
   which will not afford any tolerable answer unto their expectations,
   they take up in the lusts and pleasures of the world, preferring them
   before all the promises of Christ, and despising all the threatenings
   denounced against those that pursue them. And of this sort of apostates
   we have numberless examples in the world.

   (5.) Hereunto is added a perfect hatred and contempt of such as abide
   constant in, their adherence unto and profession of the gospel.
   Constant observation hath approved the saying, "Apostata est osor sui
   ordinis;" great apostates have been always great persecutors, in word
   or deed, according to their power. As those who love Christ do love all
   that are his, because they are his, so they that hate him do hate all
   that are his, because they are his; and their hatred, because it is
   against the whole kind, acts itself every way possible. They despise
   them as weak and foolish for adhering and trusting to the things which
   they have relinquished, trusting to themselves, their reason, and
   gallantry of spirit. They are filled with revenge against them, as
   those who censure, judge, and condemn them as guilty of the highest
   villainy and most desperate wickedness. They know in their hearts that
   they have reserves against them, as persons whom their Lord will one
   day judge and destroy; which makes them design, if it were possible,
   their utter extirpation from the face of the earth. Those who crucified
   Christ in his own person did it but once, and could do so no more.
   These do so every day; for what is done unto any of his, for his sake,
   he esteemeth as done unto himself: "Why persecutest thou me?"

   (6.) Those persons who proceed thus far do always fall into a peculiar
   contempt of the Spirit of God, and his whole work in the dispensation
   of the gospel. The promise of the dispensation of the Spirit is the
   especial privilege and glory of the gospel. He is sent and given in an
   especial manner by Jesus Christ as exalted. His whole work is to
   glorify and exalt Jesus Christ, and to make his mediation effectual
   unto the souls of men; and in the things which concern him and his work
   lies the life and soul of the gospel. Hence those who apostatize from
   it have a peculiar enmity against him and his work; and this usually is
   one of the first things wherein the fatal backslidings of men do
   manifest themselves. When once men "tread under foot the Son of God,
   and count the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
   unholy thing," as they do in the former instances, they will assuredly
   "do despite unto the Spirit of grace," Heb. x. 29. How this is done in
   particular shall be considered on that place, if God will, and we live
   thereunto. Under this head and degree the sin of apostasy becomes
   formally irremissible.

   (7.) An open profession of a detestation of the gospel, so far as it is
   consistent with their worldly interests and advantages, completes the
   soul-ruining sin we treat of. It may be they may live in such times and
   places as that it would be to their secular disadvantage openly to avow
   their renunciation of Christ; but when that is the only curb from the
   declaration of themselves, the frame of their minds is esteemed for a
   full profession of their apostasy.

   Now, whereas all these things, and it may be sundry others, do concur
   unto this sin of apostasy, I shall conclude two things concerning it:--
   1. That it is a far greater sin than that of the generality of the Jews
   who crucified Jesus Christ in the days of his flesh, as was before
   asserted. 2. That it is inconsistent with the holiness, righteousness,
   honour, and faithfulness of God, to renew such persons as are fully and
   openly guilty hereof unto repentance. Repentance may be given unto them
   in hell with as much advantage unto the glory of God; for when men,
   after trial and experiment, with some convictions of its truth and
   excellency, do obstinately reject the only remedy and relief that God
   hath provided for sinners, and therein do despite unto the whole
   blessed Trinity, and each person thereof in his peculiar interest in
   the dispensation and application of grace, God neither in his
   faithfulness will, nor in his holiness can, have any thing more to do
   with such presumptuous sinners in a way of mercy. He may and doth
   endure them for a while in this world, and that without any visible
   tokens of his indignation, satisfying his justice in the spiritual
   judgments that are upon them; but it is only as "vessels of wrath
   fitted to destruction," and such "whose damnation slumbereth not." And
   these things may suffice to warn men of the danger of this evil; and
   they will be warnings unto all who shall consider them, who are not
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin; and all the judgments of
   God, which are either impendent over or already inflicted on a wicked,
   apostatizing world, are calls from heaven unto a consideration of them.

   Now, although the generality of men seem to be secure enough from any
   trouble or discomposure in their minds from the consideration of things
   of this nature, yet some there are who may by their own
   misapprehensions fall under such discouragements as may hinder them in
   that course of obedience which they would pursue. I shall therefore
   divert a little, to prevent or remove the objections which such persons
   make against themselves, and from whence their discouragement doth
   arise, adding some directions suited unto their state or condition;
   for, --

   First, Some may suppose themselves so far interested in the backsliding
   and apostasy described, as that the threatening denounced in the text
   doth belong unto them also, and that they are now judicially shut up
   under impenitency; for they say that they had attained unto a greater
   measure or degree of holiness, unto more readiness, evenness, and
   constancy in the duties of obedience, than they do now retain. They
   have fearfully and woefully fallen off from a better frame, into
   deadness, barrenness, neglect of duties, and it may be in some instance
   into a sinful course, and that for many days. Hence now they fear, lest
   as they are sensible that they have forsaken God and gone off from him,
   so he should forsake them utterly, and they should be sealed up under
   impenitency.

   Ans. As this case too often falls out, so it is often answered, and I
   shall not therefore much insist upon it, nor any otherwise but as our
   present design and discourse is concerned therein. And I say, --

   1. It is to be granted that all such backslidings are not only evil and
   sinful, but dangerous also, as to the issue and event. Whoever,
   therefore, find themselves under the power of them, or any way
   overtaken by them, ought not only to consider the guilt of all the
   particular sins and omissions of duties which they contract, but
   principally the whole state of their souls, and the danger they are in
   of being "hardened through the deceitfulness of sin:" for no man in
   such a state can have the least spiritual assurance or security that he
   shall not fall totally and finally from God; and whatever persuasion he
   hath of that nature, it is but a deceiving presumption that will
   effectually promote his apostasy and ruin, for there is no word of
   truth, no promise of God, to assure any of his love and favour whilst
   they are in such a state. It is therefore unquestionably the duty of
   every one who is sensible of any evil of this nature, in the frame of
   his heart or course of his life, to give himself no rest therein,
   seeing the eternal welfare of his soul is highly in question. But, --

   2. There is a decay, a falling away from the degrees of holiness and
   obedience that men may have attained, and that, it may be, for a long
   season, and possibly with respect unto some especial sin, which is
   recoverable, and which doth not cast persons under the power of it
   absolutely into the threatening here recorded. What circumstances are
   required hereunto and what aggravations of sin have been showed in the
   opening of the words. Now, there may be a falling away, and that great
   and dangerous, which yet riseth not up unto the provocation of the evil
   here in an especial manner intended. And I judge it may be given as a
   safe rule in general, that he who is spiritually sensible of the evil
   of his backsliding is unquestionably in a recoverable condition; and
   some may be so who are not yet sensible thereof, so long as they are
   capable of being made so by convictions. No man is past hopes of
   salvation until he is past all possibility of repentance; and no man is
   past all possibility of repentance until he be absolutely hardened
   against all gospel convictions. Wherefore there is a recoverable
   backsliding: for, -- (1.) Christ calleth men unto such a recovery,
   which, therefore, he approves of, and will assist them therein who
   conscientiously apply themselves unto their duty, Rev. ii. 5, iii. 1-3;
   which latter instance is great in this kind. (2.) God hath promised to
   recover and heal such backslidings in believers, Hos. xiv. 4. And unto
   whom this is not encouragement sufficient to endeavour a recovery of
   themselves, it is to be feared they will wax worse and worse through
   the power of sin, until it hath full dominion over them; yea, what
   pretences soever they make to keep themselves off from such endeavours,
   it is either unbelief or the love of sin that is the sole proper cause
   thereof. Wherefore, --

   (3.) If the backsliding whereof men complain from the ways of holiness
   and obedience have not proceeded out of dislike unto Christ and the
   gospel; if they have not, by the power and deceit wherewith they are
   accompanied, chosen any other way of duty or sin in his stead, -- as
   there is all necessity imaginable that they should, so there is all
   encouragement necessary to put them upon the diligent use of all means
   of a blessed recovery. Suppose their decays have befallen them, or that
   they have fallen into them, through the power of temptations, the
   deceitfulness of sin joining with their own sloth and negligence, --
   which is the highest supposition that can be made in this kind, -- yet
   if they shall say in their hearts that they "will return to their
   former husband, for then it was better with them than now," they had
   peace and much refreshment in their first ways of faith and obedience,
   which they will therefore return unto; as the Lord Christ calls upon
   them so to do, so he is ready in all the promises of the gospel to
   receive them upon their so doing. Only let such persons remember that
   the command is urgent on them, as on Lot when he was to flee out of
   Sodom, and the angel said unto him, "Escape for thy life; look not
   behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the
   mountain, lest thou be consumed." There is no time of deliberation,
   much less of delay in this matter. It is for their souls, and the
   present moment wherein they are warned is the only season for their
   escape; and if any shall yet linger as Lot did, the Lord lay hold upon
   them, and bring them forth by the power of his grace, that they may be
   delivered! What are the ways whereby this may be done, what duties such
   persons are with diligence to attend unto, what means they are to use,
   are not things which at present fall under our consideration. All that
   I design is, to show that those who thus complain are not cast under
   any discouragement by this context and its exposition from an endeavour
   of a recovery, wherein they will find acceptance with God.

   Secondly, It may be alleged that, as to the issue of things, it will be
   all one whether we fall from gospel holiness or can never attain unto
   it; -- "And this," say some, "is our condition; for whatever we have
   thought of ourselves, or whatever others have thought of us upon our
   profession, yet we now find by experience that we have not attained the
   holiness which the gospel requires." For their corruptions (they say,
   this or that, it may be, in particular) are too strong for their
   convictions; and after they thought themselves above them, they have
   again been prevailed on and overcome. They find the power of one or
   other lust grown so habitual unto them that they fall again and again
   under the power of it, until, it may be, they have lost much of the
   sense of its guilt and more of their power to resist it. And it must be
   acknowledged, also, that this condition is spiritually dangerous, and
   such as, if deliverance be not obtained from [it], will probably end in
   total apostasy. To state things aright in this case, we may observe:--

   1. That there are three degrees in the power and prevalency of sin, and
   it must be inquired under which of them they are supposed to be
   concerning whom this complaint is made. The first is that mentioned
   Rom. vii. 23, "I see a law in my members warring against the law of my
   mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin." Where this is
   only, or the captivating power of sin, there are two things to be
   considered:-- (1.) That the will, in its dispositions and inclinations,
   is constantly fixed against the power and interest of sin, so that in
   all its prevalency it suffers hardship, and is sensible of its
   captivity. (2.) That this captivity unto the law of sin doth not reach
   unto the outward perpetration of sin, but only the conflict that is in
   the mind and affections about it. And this is a condition which no man
   in this world is absolutely freed from, but is in some measure or other
   exercised with it, even as the apostle himself was, and thereon groaned
   for deliverance, verse 24. Another degree of the prevalence of sin is
   expressed chap. vi. 16, 19, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
   yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
   whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" There
   is a state and prevalence of sin wherein men, being wholly under its
   dominion, do give up themselves unto its service willingly,
   notwithstanding any checks from light or conscience they meet withal.
   And such as these, the willing servants of sin, that yield up
   themselves in their affections and members of their bodies unto the
   obedience and service of it, we do not at present consider. Between
   these there is a degree of the prevalence of sin, beyond the first, yet
   falling short of the latter, expressed 2 Pet. ii. 19. Men are therein
   in some sense "servants of corruption," in that they are "overcome" by
   it and "brought into bondage." They are not such as willingly, without
   any contest or conflict, give up themselves unto the service of sin,
   but they are overcome by it, which manifests that they do in some
   measure strive against it. And, on the other hand, they go beyond them
   who complain they are led captives to the law of sin; for they are said
   to become "servants of corruption," which the others are not in any
   sense. These, therefore, seem to be such (and such I do intend) who,
   notwithstanding all their light and convictions, with all the
   endeavours that they use, are so far under the power of some prevalent
   habitual lust as to serve it in a frequent reiteration of actual sins.

   2. If this be the case complained of, it is acknowledged to be a
   condition of no small hazard and danger. And he who is not deeply
   sensible hereof is "as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or
   as he that lieth upon the top of a mast;" as this state is at large
   described with respect unto them who are given to wine, Prov. xxiii.
   29-35. Wherefore, unless some remedy be found out in this case, it must
   be acknowledged that it will deprive men of or keep them from any
   assured interest in gospel holiness.

   I must not here divert to consider in general the nature and means of
   the mortification of sin; I have done it already in other discourses,
   with the best directions for that end which I am able to propose. Unto
   them I do refer the persons concerned for guidance and counsel, where
   better is not at hand. Unto what hath been so treated already I shall
   only add, that those who would secure an interest in gospel holiness,
   by a deliverance from the power of inveterate habitual corruptions, may
   take the ensuing directions:--

   First, If they have in vain attempted their own deliverance, let them
   not delay to acquaint some able spiritual guide with their state and
   condition. This sometimes hath broken, defeated, and scattered at once
   the forces of sin in the soul, where in its own wisdom and strength it
   was no way able to conflict with it. And it is the ordinance of God to
   this purpose: James v. 16, "Confess your faults one to another," etc.
   It was no small effect of the craft of Satan so to abuse this ordinance
   of God by turning it into a necessary confession of all sin unto a
   priest, invested with power of absolution, which was attended with
   innumerable evils, and proved an effectual engine for the ruin of the
   souls of men, to keep them off from that benefit which the due use of
   it was designed to administer unto sinners. If, therefore, any have
   found that sin hath been and yet is too strong for them, and that that
   is come upon them which the wise man mentions, "Woe to him that is
   alone," let them address themselves for advice unto such as have "the
   tongue of the learned," to speak a word in season unto them that are
   weary and ready to faint, and they will find relief. God will discover
   that evil of this kind which men will hide to their own disadvantage,
   tie will lay open those festered wounds which men would cover until
   rottenness enter into their bones.

   Secondly, The effect aimed at will never be accomplished without
   violence offered unto ourselves as unto all occasions of sin, --
   namely, as to the particular corruption supposed prevalent. In this
   case, when known occasions of the excitation or acting of the evil
   complained of do occur, no deliberations, or inclinations, or civil
   compliances are once to be admitted. Violence and sudden execution of
   foretaken resolves, without any parley or debate, are to be pursued.
   This is the condition wherein our Saviour's advice must take place, if
   we intend to escape, namely, of "plucking out a right eye, and cutting
   off a right hand," Matt. v. 29, 30; which cannot be done without
   offering violence unto our affections and inclinations. This is the
   meaning of the counsel given, Prov. iv. 14, 15, "Enter not into the
   path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass
   not by it, turn from it, and pass away." The multiplication of the
   expressions wherein the duty charged doth consist doth intimate that,
   in the obedience required in this particular, a resolution acted with a
   holy violence is required. And there are three things in this holy
   violence with respect unto the occasions of a prevalent corruption:--

   1. The mind's rejection of their first solicitations. When such seasons
   do befall or are befalling any man as wherein his lust or sin hath
   wonted to act itself, they smile on one another and are ready to shake
   hands in folly, Ps. l. 18; Prov. xxiii. 31; and sundry things will
   present themselves unto the mind to render the occasion necessary, or
   at least not dangerous. But if all insinuations of that kind be not
   immediately rejected without parley or delay, the soul probably will be
   again entangled and overcome.

   2. A stated satisfaction concerning the folly of reserves, although the
   occasion should be complied withal or embraced, so as that the mind
   will hear no more of them, under any pretence whatever. Such reserves
   will offer themselves, as that although a man proceed so far or so far
   in the gratification of his present inclinations, yet he will put a
   stop unto or avoid what they may lead unto. When the mind is fully
   possessed [aware] of the deceitfulness of the heart in this matter, it
   will see its own folly in listening after such false promises or
   reserves, and reject the first thought of them with indignation.

   3. Local mutation, or avoiding the place itself, or society and
   company, with a holy force put upon the affections, where such
   occasions are offered. This is that which is so expressed and pressed
   on us in the place before mentioned, Prov. iv. 14, 15.

   These things belong unto that holy violence which men are to use unto
   themselves, and must use, if ever they intend to be freed from the
   power of an habitually prevalent corruption; and those who judge their
   deliverance not to be worth this watchfulness and care will live and
   die under the power of sin.

   Thirdly, Constancy in private prayer against the power of such a
   corruption. This is all the way a man hath to deal with God about such
   an evil; for such things are to be thought and spoken, such
   circumstances to be insisted on, and such pleas to be used, as are not
   meet to be communicated to or with others. And, for the most part, it
   will be found that constant, earnest, faithful, private prayer, and any
   strong corruption, will be like Moses and Amalek. When Moses' hands
   were down Amalek prevailed, but when they were lifted up Israel had the
   upper hand. And if a man engage into especial prayer in opposition unto
   any sin or corruption, whatever he thinks of his own resolutions,
   whatever confidence he hath in his purposes, as he begins to fail or
   faint in the constancy or fervency of that duty, so his sin gets
   strength in him, and will not fail to attempt him successfully on the
   next occasion; nor will the utmost effect of any man's wisdom, or care,
   or ability, work out his deliverance in this case, without a
   conscientious attendance unto and discharge of this duty.

   Sundry other things of an alike nature unto these might be insisted on,
   but that I must not too far digress from my principal design. This I
   thought meet to interpose for the direction of such as may be kept off
   from a successful endeavour to "perfect holiness in the fear of God."

Chapter XIII.

   Directions to avoid the power of a prevailing apostasy.

   Unto the warnings given in the precedent chapter some directions may be
   added, perhaps not unuseful unto them who would be preserved from the
   occasions, causes, and danger, of the apostasy thus far inquired into;
   for although, as hath been declared, a watchful attendance unto all
   gospel duties, and a vigorous exercise of all gospel graces in general,
   are required unto our preservation, yet there are some things which
   have an especial respect unto the present state of the causes and
   circumstances of the evil insisted on, which ought in an especial
   manner to be remembered. And that things of this nature are by many
   despised is no argument why we should not be diligent in our attendance
   unto them; for if they are such things as the Scripture prescribeth in
   the like cases, the contempt of them proceeds only from that pride and
   security which are no small part of the apostasy complained of.

   Our first direction of this kind is, that we should all labour for a
   true, real sense of the concernment of the glory of God in this matter,
   and what is our duty with respect thereunto. Where this is not, men are
   under the power of that security which is the broad way and wide gate
   leading unto apostasy; yea, where this is not the first and principal
   thing wherewith we are affected in any evil that falls out in the
   world, our hearts are not upright in what we profess.

   When God threatened to disinherit the Israelites and destroy the whole
   congregation as one man, in the wilderness, because of their provoking
   rebellion, that wherewith Moses, in all the circumstances of his
   relation unto them and interest in them, was affected withal, was the
   concernment of the glory and name of God therein, Num. xiv. 11-19. And
   it was so with Joshua in the sin and punishment of the same people.
   "What wilt thou do," saith he, "unto thy great name?" chap. vii. 8, 9;
   words which have been made a public derision in the days wherein we
   live.

   We cannot but have thoughts about these things, for they are the common
   subject of many men's discourse: but if our thoughts about them are
   confined unto a narrow compass, and, so that it be well with us and
   some few others in whom we are peculiarly concerned, the evil that is
   come on the world in other places is lightly set by; if we are sensible
   of no interest of the glory of God, of the honour of Christ and the
   gospel therein, or are regardless of them, -- we are scarce likely to
   be delivered from that fatal issue whereunto all these things are in an
   open tendency.

   Is it nothing unto us that so many nations in the world, where the
   profession of the gospel and an avowed subjection of soul and
   conscience unto Jesus Christ did flourish for some ages, are now
   utterly overrun with Mohammedanism, paganism, and atheism? Do we
   suppose these things are fallen out by chance, or come to pass by a
   fatal revolution of affairs, such as all things in this world are
   obnoxious unto? Did ever any nation or people under heaven lose the
   gospel as unto its profession, who did not first reject it as unto its
   power, purity, and obedience? And is not the glory of God, is not the
   honour of Christ, peculiarly concerned herein?

   Is it nothing unto us that innumerable souls, who yet continue to make
   an outward profession of the name of Christ, have so degenerated from
   the mystery, holiness, and worship of the gospel, as to provoke the
   holy God to give them up for so many generations unto the most woful
   bondage and slavery that ever any of the children of men were cast
   under from the foundation of the world, without the least hopes or
   appearance of relief? And is it not to be bewailed that, such is the
   power of that apostasy which brought all this evil upon them, as that
   they have not to this day accepted of the punishment of their sins, nor
   been bettered by all that they have undergone! And doth not that holy
   name whereby we are called suffer in these things? Is it not on their
   account evil spoken of? for do not the miseries, the long-continued,
   woful calamities and oppressions of innumerable multitudes of great
   nations, outwardly professing the Christian religion, become a snare to
   the world and a temptation against the truth of the gospel and the
   power of Jesus Christ The Jews themselves are not left unto more
   distresses, nor are more destitute of any pledges of divine protection,
   nor are more unreformed under their miseries, than many who are called
   Christians, upon the account of their apostasy from the gospel. It is
   true, great distresses and sore persecutions may befall the church in
   its best state and condition, but then God doth so dispose of all
   things as that their trials shall evidently tend both unto his own
   glory and their spiritual advantage who are exercised with them; and in
   the issue the gospel itself shall never be a loser by the suffering of
   its sincere professors. But in those horrible judgments which have
   befallen many parts of the apostatized Christian world, nothing
   offereth itself unto our minds but what is matter of lamentation and
   temptation.

   Is it nothing to us that the greatest number of those who are called
   Christians, and enjoy prosperity in the world, do live in open
   idolatry, to the unspeakable scandal of Christian religion and imminent
   danger unto themselves of eternal ruin? -- nothing that so many do
   openly renounce the humble, meek spirit of Christ and the gospel,
   endeavouring to persecute, ruin, and destroy other Christians, perhaps
   better than themselves, because they cannot captivate their souls and
   consciences in obedience unto their impositions? -- nothing to see and
   hear of all those dreadful effects of this apostasy in all manner of
   outrageous sins that the world is filled withal?

   Certainly, if we are not greatly affected with these things, if our
   souls mourn not in secret about them, if we are not solicitous about
   the small remainders of the interest of truth and holiness in the
   world, we are in no small danger ourselves of being, one time or other,
   carried away with the deluge.

   If we are sensible of the concernment of the glory of God in these
   things, it may not be amiss to consider what is our duty with respect
   thereunto.

   1. And the first thing required of us is, that we mourn in secret for
   that sad issue which the profession of Christianity is come unto in the
   world. God puts an especial mark on them who mourn for the prevalency
   of sin and the apostasy of the church in any season, Ezek. ix. 4;
   neither will he have regard unto any others when he comes to execute
   judgments on ungodly apostates. Men may suffer with them with whom they
   will not sin; for where we are unconcerned for the sins of men we shall
   not be so in their sufferings. It is therefore those alone who, out of
   a sense of the dishonour of God, and compassion towards the souls of
   perishing sinners, do sigh and cry over these abominations, that shall
   be either preserved from those public calamities wherein they may
   issue, or be comfortably supported under them. And there is nothing of
   a more ominous presage that things are yet waxing worse, than that
   general regardlessness about them that is among the best of us. Whose
   "eyes run clown with waters because men keep not the law?" Who doth
   sufficiently bewail the decays of faith, truth, and holiness, that are
   in the earth? Most men, like Gallio, either "care for none of these
   things," or at best design to save their own houses in the general
   conflagration. Many measure all things by their own advantage, and can
   see nothing amiss in the profession of religion but only in the
   complaints that any things are so. And although the degeneracy of
   Christianity, in the present professors of it, be grown a common theme
   in the mouths of most, yet very few are affected with it in a due
   manner in their hearts.

   2. It is in this state of things required of us to pray continually,
   pleading those promises which are recorded in the word of God for the
   restoration of the pristine glory, power, and purity of Christian
   religion. This was the way and means whereby the church was recovered
   of old, and the same duty is still enjoined unto us, Isa. lxii. 6, 7;
   and hereunto are all our present hopes reduced. There is nothing too
   hard for God. If he will work herein, none shall let him. Things are
   not gone beyond his cure. He can send peace, and truth, and
   righteousness from above, and cause them to prevail on the earth. Were
   all things left absolutely unto the wills of men, in that depraved
   state whereunto they are arrived in the world, nothing but an increase
   of overspreading abominations might be expected. Sovereign and
   effectual grace can yet give relief, and nothing else can so do. Truly
   in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and the multitude of
   mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel; -- but
   for all these will God be sought unto. And constancy in this duty for
   others, out of a deep sense of the concernment of the glory of God and
   zeal for the honour of the gospel, is the most effectual means of our
   own deliverance and preservation.

   3. Constancy in our testimony against the prevalency of this apostasy
   is required of us. And hereof there are two parts:-- (1.) An open,
   avowed profession of and contending for the faith and troth of the
   gospel. The public contempt and scorn that is by a prevalent vogue cast
   on some important evangelical truths is ready to discourage many from
   the owning and profession of them. Men, for the most part, have so many
   things to take into consideration before they will undertake the
   defence of the truth that they can find no season for it, whilst
   noisome errors are vented every day with confidence and diligence. It
   is therefore now, if ever, a time for all those in whose hearts are the
   ways of God to "contend earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the
   saints." And if either sloth, or self-love, or carnal fears, or
   earthly, ambitious designs, do betray any into a neglect of their duty
   in this matter, it will at one time or other give them disquietment and
   trouble. But, (2.) Exemplary holiness, righteousness, and fruitfulness
   in good works, belong unto this testimony against the prevalent
   apostasy which is required of us. As this is our constant duty at all
   times, so the progress of the fatal evil complained of renders the
   doubling of our diligence herein at present necessary, and puts a
   lustre on it.

   Secondly, Those who would be preserved in such a season must keep a due
   and careful watch over their own hearts with respect unto their duty
   and danger: for although temptations do abound, and those attended with
   all sorts of circumstances increasing their efficacy, and the outward
   means and causes of this evil are multiplied, yet the beginnings of all
   men's spiritual declensions are in their own hearts and spirits; for
   the different effects that these things have upon the minds and lives
   of men is principally from themselves. As they are careful, diligent,
   and watchful over themselves in a way of duty on the one hand, or
   slothful, careless, negligent on the other, so are they preserved or
   prevailed against. The advice, therefore, I intend is that given by the
   Holy Ghost in this case: Prov. iv. 23, "Keep thy heart with all
   diligence, for out of it are the issues of life;" or, as it is
   emphatically expressed in the original, "Above all keeping, keep thy
   heart." The greatest exercise of men in the world is about keeping what
   they have, what they esteem their own; wherewith the desire of adding
   unto it is of the same nature. What belongeth hereunto, what care, what
   watchfulness, what diligence, what exercise of their utmost wisdom and
   industry, all men know, unless it be such as by the power of their
   lusts are given up unto prodigality and profuseness. But the care and
   diligence in keeping of our hearts (the Holy Ghost being judge) ought
   to exceed whatever of that kind is employed about other things; and it
   is too evident that there is much want of this wisdom amongst us in the
   world. Of all things, the least diligence is used by many in keeping of
   their hearts. So they can safeguard their other concerns, the heart may
   be left to take its own course: yea, the heart is never so much
   neglected usually, nor more lost, than in the use it is put unto in
   keeping other things; for whilst it is employed to keep our lives, to
   keep the world and the things of it, it is lost itself in worldliness,
   covetousness, carnal wisdom, negligence of holy duties, and barrenness
   in the fruits of righteousness. That this is no good bargain, that
   nothing is got hereby, yea, that all will be lost by it at last, heart
   and world, and every thing wherein we are concerned, the Holy Ghost
   plainly intimates in this direction, wherein we are commanded above all
   things to keep our hearts. And we are not only laid under this command,
   but a cogent reason is added to enforce our obedience: "For out of it
   are the issues of life." Hereon do all events depend. The heart being
   kept, the whole course of our life here will be according unto the mind
   of God, and the end of it will be the enjoyment of him hereafter. This
   being neglected, life will be lost, beth here as unto obedience, and
   hereafter as unto glory. This, therefore, is that which in the first
   place is to be applied unto the present case. Would any not be
   overtaken with the power and prevalency of any of the causes of
   apostasy mentioned before, let them look well unto their own hearts,
   seeing that from thence are the issues of life.

   By the "heart" the Scripture understandeth all the faculties of our
   souls, as they are an entire rational principle of all moral and
   spiritual operations; and so do we also. The preservation of them in
   their due order, acting in all things according unto their distinct
   powers, and the duty of the whole soul with respect unto God, is that
   which is intended by this keeping of the heart. And hereunto, with
   reference unto the present duty, sundry things do belong in an especial
   manner; as, --

   1. That the heart be kept awake and attentive unto its own
   deceitfulness. The wise man tells us that "he that trusteth in his own
   heart is a fool," Prov. xxviii. 26. The beginning of all security, --
   which is an assured entrance into all evil, -- lies in men's leaving
   their hearts unto themselves and trusting in them. He is no wise man
   (the Holy Ghost being judge) who, after so many instructions and
   warnings given us in the Scripture of the deceitfulness of our hearts,
   or the deceitfulness of that sin which is bound up in them (which is
   all one), will carelessly trust it with his eternal concernments. The
   apostle Peter did so once, upon a strong confidence that his heart
   would not fail him; but we know what was the issue of it. It is apt to
   be so with most men in this matter. They think, and do really judge,
   that if all men should fall off and forsake the gospel, either wholly
   or as unto the degrees in obedience which they have attained, yet they
   would not so do; but all things are filled with visible examples of
   their disappointment. There are no apostates but once thought they
   would not be so; for we speak only of them who had light into and
   conviction of their duty, and who had therefore necessarily resolutions
   to continue therein. Wherefore, a constant, watchful jealousy over our
   own hearts, as to their deceitfulness, their readiness to be imposed
   on, and secret pretences to countenance themselves in compliance with
   temptations, is the foundation of all other duties necessary unto our
   preservation.

   Even this also is by some despised. They know of no deceitfulness in
   their own hearts, nor think there is any such thing in the hearts of
   others. They cannot but acknowledge that there is mutual deceit enough
   amongst mankind in the world; but that there should be deceit and
   treachery in men's hearts with respect unto themselves, their own
   actions, duties, and ways, with respect unto God and their own eternal
   condition, that they cannot apprehend: for what or whom should a man
   trust unto, if he may not safely repose his confidence in his own heart
   that it will be always true unto its spiritual and eternal interest?
   Happy men, were such apprehensions as these to be the rule of their
   present duty or future judgment! But is it not possible there may be in
   the hearts of men a blind self-love, so far predominant as practically
   to impose false apprehensions and notions of things upon the mind and
   affections with respect unto sin and duty? Is there no disorder in the
   faculties of our souls, nor confusion in their operations thereon? Are
   there no remainders of sin inseparable from them in this life,
   accompanied with all mariner of spiritual deceitfulness? no corrupt
   reasonings for the procrastination of the most important duties? no
   inclinations unto undue precedences and presumptions? no vanity or
   uncertainty in the mind? Or can these things, with the like
   innumerable, be supposed without any deceit in them or accompanying of
   them? What one said of old to the Druids, --


   "Solis nosse Deos et coeli Numina vobis

   Aut solis nescire datum," --

   may be applied unto the men of this persuasion: either they alone know
   the state of the heart of man with respect unto God, evangelical
   obedience, and their own eternal interest, or they alone are ignorant
   thereof. Until, therefore, we have more satisfaction in this novel
   pretended discovery, we dare not cease the pressing of men to be
   diligently attentive unto the deceits of their own hearts. If this be
   neglected, we shall labour in vain, whatever else we do. Blessed is he
   who thus feareth always! This will make men carefully and
   conscientiously avoid all occasions of all things, whether in their
   inward frames or outward practice, that may on any account have a
   tendency unto a declension from the gospel. A bold, hazardous, careless
   frame of spirit, venturing on all companies and temptations, complying
   with vanities and profane communications, offering itself with a
   fearless confidence unto ways of seduction, through "the cunning
   sleights of men that lie in wait to deceive," is that which hath ruined
   innumerable professors. Self-distrust, humility, fear of offending,
   with the like soul-preserving graces, will be kept up unto exercise
   only where men are awake unto the consideration of the deceitfulness of
   their own hearts.

   2. We must keep our heart awake and attentive unto its help and relief;
   and this lies only in Christ Jesus, the captain of our salvation. After
   all Peter's confidence, it was the interposition of Christ alone that
   preserved him from utter ruin: "I have prayed for thee that thy faith
   fail not." And if any can once prevail so far as to deter men from
   looking for all spiritual help and relief from Christ, for daily
   supplies of grace and strength from him alone; from a continual
   application unto him for directing, assisting, preserving, establishing
   grace (which they variously attempt), -- there is no need to fear but
   they will easily follow them into whatever else either they, or Satan,
   or the world shall have a mind to draw them. But in all our discourses
   we proceed on other principles. We look on Jesus Christ as the spring
   and fountain of all grace, as him who alone is able to preserve us in
   faith and obedience, and doth communicate supplies of effectual grace
   unto believers for that purpose. Unto him, therefore, are we to make
   our applications continually, by faith and prayer, for our
   preservation, as we are directed, Heb. iv. 15, 16. It is he alone who
   can "keep us from the hour of temptation, which is come upon all the
   world, to try them that dwell upon the earth," Rev. iii. 10. Whosoever,
   therefore, would be kept from the power of the temptations unto
   apostasy which every way encompass us, and threaten to bear down all
   before them, let them keep their hearts continually attentive unto
   their only help and relief. Those who have not taken in a sense of
   their danger will see little reason to concern themselves in these
   directions. But as for such as are affected with the visible ruin of
   multitudes and their own apparent hazard, from prevailing causes and
   innumerable occasions thereof, -- whose eyes are in any measure opened
   to see the general inclination that is in the world unto a
   relinquishment of all the principal concerns of the gospel, and by what
   various ways that inclination is furthered, followed, and pursued, --
   they will not think it unneedful to be minded of a help and refuge
   whereunto they may betake themselves and be preserved.

   3. Let the heart be kept attentive unto its own frames, its progress or
   decay in holiness. How secret, and even ofttimes imperceptible, the
   beginnings of spiritual declension are in many, with the reasons and
   causes thereof, hath been declared in our exposition of Heb. iv. 12,
   13, whither the reader is referred. I shall here only offer, that he
   who, in such a season as that which is passing over us, cloth not often
   call himself unto an account how things stand with him as to the inner
   man, -- what is the state of his spiritual life, whether his faith and
   love do thrive or decay, whether God or the world gets ground in his
   affections, -- will be exposed unto more dangers than it may be he is
   readily able to deliver himself from. These things are all of them
   useful, yea, needful unto the course of our obedience at all times.
   That which is here intended is, their exercise and discharge with
   respect unto the evil and danger under consideration. When we have done
   the utmost of our duty, we shall have cause to rejoice in the grace of
   God if we are preserved and delivered. But if we be found slothful,
   negligent, and secure, what hopes can we have that we shall withstand
   the evil that doth on every side beset us? There is not any way of
   fraud or force wherein we either are not or may not be assaulted. The
   secret ways whereby this apostasy puts forth its efficacy are so
   various as not to be enumerated. The current, furthered by the winds of
   all sorts of temptations, lies strongly against us. New accessions are
   made unto it every day. New pretences against the truths and holiness
   of the gospel are sought out and made use of. By some they are secretly
   undermined, by others openly despised; and the hand of Satan is in all
   these thing. If we should now neglect a watchful care over our own
   hearts, and a diligent attendance unto all means of their preservation
   in soundness of doctrine and holiness of life, what assurance can we
   have that we shall finally escape?

   Having premised these directions in general, those which ensue must
   have a particular respect unto some of the especial ways and means
   whereby this declension hath been carried on and promoted, peculiarly
   such as the present age and season are most obnoxious unto. And because
   this discourse is drawn forth to a length beyond my first design, I
   shall name a few things only, to intimate of what sort those directions
   are which might be more largely insisted on; and two only shall be
   named. Wherefore, --

   Thirdly, Take heed of resting in or trusting unto the outward
   privileges of the church, and a participation of the dispensation of
   the ordinances of the gospel therein. It is known what various
   apprehensions as to the especial ways of outward solemn worship and the
   state of the church there are among all sorts of men. But whereas all
   men do approve of and adhere unto one church-state or other, one way of
   worship or other, I intend no one more than another in particular, but
   would speak unto all with respect unto that way which themselves do
   approve and practice. And it was before declared how greatly the world
   was deluded by a pretence of them. And we may not think to excuse the
   necessity of watchfulness in this matter, because all the good things
   of the church and all the ordinances of the gospel were then abused,
   corrupted, and defiled, whereas we now all of us, in our own
   apprehensions, enjoy their administration in purity, according unto the
   institution of Christ; for they are all of them no less liable to be
   abused in this kind when duly administered than when most corrupted:
   yea, in some cases they are more apt so to be, seeing there is a
   greater appearance of reason why we should place our confidence in
   them.

   It is indeed an especial mercy for any to be intrusted with the
   privileges of the church and institutions of the gospel; yea, it is the
   greatest outward dignity and pre-eminence that any can be advanced unto
   in this world, however by the most it be lightly set by Theodosius, one
   of the greatest emperors that ever were in the world, affirmed that he
   esteemed his being a member of the church a greater dignity than his
   imperial crown. And although the ruin of the Jews arose principally
   from their carnal confidence in their spiritual or church privileges,
   yet the apostle doth acknowledge that they had great pre-eminence and
   advantage, and might have had great profit thereby, Rom. iii. 1, 2, ix.
   4, 5. And theirs must be granted more excellent in every kind who enjoy
   that administration of holy things in comparison wherewith that
   committed unto the Jews had neither beauty nor glory, 2 Cor. iii. 10.
   By whomsoever, therefore, these things are despised or neglected, under
   whatever pretences they countenance themselves, they are utter
   strangers unto gospel holiness; for what holiness can there be where
   men live in an open disobedience unto the commands of Christ, and in a
   neglect of the use of those means which he hath appointed to beget and
   preserve it in our souls? Nothing, therefore, must be spoken to take
   off from the excellency, dignity, and necessity, of the privileges and
   ordinances of the church, when we would call off men from placing that
   confidence in them which may tend unto their disadvantage. And if
   persons can find no medium between rejecting all the ordinances of the
   gospel and trusting unto the outward performance or celebration of
   them, they have nothing but their own darkness, pride, and unbelief, to
   ascribe the ruin of their souls unto.

   Again; there is not any thing in the whole course of our obedience
   wherein the continual exercise of faith and spiritual wisdom, with
   diligence and watchfulness, is more indispensably required than it is
   unto the due use and improvement of gospel privileges and ordinances;
   for there is no other part of our duty whereon our giving glory to God
   and the eternal concern of our own souls do more eminently depend. And
   he is a spiritually thriving Christian who knows how duly to improve
   gospel institutions of worship, and doth so accordingly; for they are
   the only ordinary outward means whereby the Lord Christ communicates of
   his grace unto us, and whereby we immediately return love, praise,
   thanks, and obedience unto him; in which spiritual intercourse the
   actings of our spiritual life principally do consist, and whereon, by
   consequence, its growth doth depend. It is therefore certain that our
   growth or decay in holiness, our steadfastness in or apostasy from
   profession, are greatly influenced by the use or abuse of these
   privileges.

   That, therefore, which, in compliance with my present design, I intend,
   is only a warning that we do not rest in these things, the name, title,
   privilege, and outward observance of them, seeing so many have thereby
   been deluded into security and apostasy. Some there are (and of them
   not a few) all whose religion consists in going to church, and abiding
   there during the celebration of that sort of worship which they approve
   of. Herewith they satisfy their consciences as unto all that they have
   to do with God, especially if they are admitted unto a participation of
   the sacraments in the appointed seasons. And many others, it is to be
   feared, content themselves with a bare hearing of the word, and do
   treat their consciences into a quietness and security thereby. It were
   otherwise impossible that, among so great multitudes as crowd after the
   preaching of the word, so few should be brought over unto sincere and
   universal obedience. But I intend those in particular who make a
   profession of giving themselves up unto gospel obedience, and are
   thereon made partakers of all gospel privileges according to the rule.
   Let them take heed that they do not too much rest in nor too much trust
   unto these outward things, for so they may do sundry ways unto their
   disadvantage.

   1. Men may herein deceive themselves by spiritual gifts, which may be
   reckoned in the first place among the privileges of the church. Some
   rest in the gifts of others, and the satisfaction they receive thereby;
   for by the use and exercise of them men's affections may be greatly
   moved, as also temporary faith and evanid joy be greatly excited. These
   things, it is to be feared, some live upon, without farther care after
   a spring of living water in themselves. Others may rest in their own
   gifts, their light, knowledge, ability to pray or speak of the things
   of God. But it is the design of the apostle, in the context before
   insisted on, to declare that the most eminent spiritual gifts, with all
   their effects, either in the souls or lives of them who are made
   partakers of them, or in the church for edification, will not secure
   any persons from total apostasy. So also some shall be utterly rejected
   at the last day, who were able to plead their prophesying and casting
   out of devils in the name of Christ, and that in his name they had done
   "many wonderful works," Matt. vii. 22, 23. And therefore, when his
   disciples (who were true but as yet weak believers) were greatly
   affected, and it may be lifted up, with the success they had had in
   casting out of devils in his name, he recalls them from any confidence
   therein, as unto their eternal concernment, unto a trust in God's free
   electing grace, with the fruits thereof, Luke x. 20; and the reason
   hereof is, because these gifts have no inseparable relation unto any of
   the especial and peculiar causes of salvation. That which seemeth to be
   of any difficulty is, that they are an especial fruit of the mediation
   of Christ, purchased by his death, given into his power upon his
   resurrection, and first communicated on his ascension. But all that
   followeth from hence is, that they are good and holy in themselves, and
   designed unto good and holy ends or uses, -- namely, the confirmation
   of the gospel and edification of the church. But it doth not thence
   follow that they are saving unto them that do receive them, unless they
   are accompanied with especial grace towards them and holy obedience in
   them; from both which they are separable. It is therefore greatly
   incumbent on all those who have received of these spiritual gifts to
   take care they be enlivened and acted by especial grace; for if they
   are not careful, they will give them a pretence and apprehension of
   what they have not, and set a greater lustre upon what they have than
   it doth deserve; -- for in their actings, because the objects of them
   are spiritual and heavenly things, the same with that of especial
   grace, men are apt to suppose that grace is exercised when it may be
   far from them; and as to the profession that men make, these gifts will
   set it off with such beauty as shall render it very acceptable unto
   others and very well-pleasing unto themselves. Both these tend
   evidently unto the ruin of the souls of men, if not wisely managed and
   improved. Wherefore, by the way, to help us unto a right judgment in
   this matter, we may observe one certain difference between the
   operations of spiritual gifts which are solitarily so on the one hand,
   and saving grace on the other. Gifts have their especial works, which
   they are confined unto, according as their especial nature is. In them
   they act vigorously; out of them they influence not the soul at all.
   But the work of saving grace is universal, equally respecting all
   times, occasions, seasons, and duties; and although it may be acted
   more eminently at one time than another, in one instance of duty than
   another, yet it enliveneth and disposeth the heart alike unto all
   obedience. But of the difference that is between spiritual gifts and
   saving grace, as also concerning their whole nature and use, I shall,
   God assisting, treat at large in another discourse. [14] At present I
   intend only this caution, that men countenance not themselves by them,
   nor resolve a peace (or rather security) into their exercise, under
   real spiritual decays of grace and obedience.

   2. Too high an estimation of any peculiar way of worship is apt to
   entice the minds of some into a hurtful confidence in these things.
   Having an apprehension that they alone have attained unto the right way
   of gospel worship and the administration of its ordinances, and that,
   perhaps, on such accounts as wherein they are eminently deceived, they
   begin first greatly to value themselves, and then to despise all
   others, and, if they can, to persecute them. This insensibly works them
   into a trust in that which they esteem so excellent, and that unto an
   open neglect of things of a greater weight and moment. Thus is it not
   unusual to see persons who are under the power of some singular opinion
   and practice in religion to make one thing almost their whole business,
   the measure of other things and persons, the rule of communion and of
   all sincere love; -- to value and esteem themselves and others
   according unto their embracing or not embracing of that opinion. There
   is here something of that which God complains of in the prophet, Isa.
   lxv. 5. And it were to be wished that such principles and practices
   were not visibly accompanied with a decay of love, humility, meekness,
   self-diffidence, condescension, and zeal in other things, seeing where
   it is so, let men's outward profession be what it will, the plague of
   apostasy is begun. Wherefore, although we ought greatly to prize and to
   endeavour after the true order of the church of Christ, the purity of
   worship, and regular administration of ordinances, yet let us take heed
   that we prize not ourselves too much on what we have attained; for if
   we do so, we shall be very apt to countenance ourselves in other
   neglects thereby, which will certainly bring us into a spiritual
   sickness and declension. And, one way or other, there is an undue
   confidence placed in these outward privileges, when either any or all
   of the things ensuing are found among us:--

   (1.) A neglect of private duties. This ruinous event never falls out
   among professors, but it proceeds either from an over-fulness of the
   world and its occasions, or the prevalency of some predominant lust, or
   a sinful resting in or trusting unto the duties of public worship. When
   all these concur (unless God effectually awaken the soul), it is in a
   perishing condition. In particular, when men are satisfied, as unto
   religious worship, with that which is public or in communion with
   others, so as to countenance themselves in a neglect of the duties of
   their private retirements, they are in a high road unto apostasy.

   (2.) The indulgence of any private lust, unto the satisfaction of the
   flesh. This great defect in the power of godliness is frequently
   countenanced by strictness in the form thereof. And a great effect it
   is of the deceitfulness of sin when it can delude the minds of men to
   justify themselves in any one sin, with the names, titles, reputation,
   and privileges of the church, or the ordinances whereof they are made
   partakers; and the secret efficacy of this deceit is not easy to be
   detected.

   (3.) It is so, also, when a loose and careless frame in our walking is
   indulged unto on the same account. It is hard, indeed, to know directly
   whence this is come to pass, that so many professors of the gospel
   should give up themselves unto a negligent and careless walk, but that
   it is so come to pass is certain. There is no truth more acknowledged
   than that a strict and close walk with God, an attendance thereunto on
   all occasions with diligence and circumspection, with a continual
   conscientious fear of sin, is indispensably required unto acceptable,
   evangelical obedience or holiness; yet so it is, that many professors
   walk with that looseness and carelessness, that venturous boldness,
   with respect unto the occasions of sinning, that liberty or rather
   licentiousness of conversation, as are utterly inconsistent
   therewithal. As there are many causes hereof, so I fear this may be one
   among them, that they too much satisfy themselves with their interest
   in the church and its privileges, and with their observance of public
   worship and the ordinances thereof, according to their respective
   stations and capacities.

   Wherefore, the sum of this direction is, that if we would be preserved
   from the prevalency of the present apostasy, we must have a strict
   regard unto our principles and practice with respect unto the
   privileges of the church and ordinances of gospel worship. If we
   neglect or despise them, we cast off the yoke of Christ, and have no
   ground to look for his acceptance of us or concernment in us. It is but
   folly for them to pretend a hope in his mercy who defy his authority.
   And if, on the other hand, we so rest in them as to countenance
   ourselves in any of the evils mentioned, we shall succeed into their
   room who, under the name and pretence of the church and its privileges,
   fell into an open apostasy from Christ and the gospel; for the same
   causes will produce the same effect in us as they did in them. There is
   a middle way between these extremes, which whoso are guided into will
   find rest and peace unto their souls; and this is no other but an
   humble, careful, conscientious improvement of them all unto their
   proper ends. And it may not be amiss to name some of those things
   whereby we may know whether our hearts are upright and rightly disposed
   in the use of gospel ordinances. And we may judge of ourselves
   herein:--

   1. If our hearts are bettered by them, or humbled for it if they are
   not. Their end, with respect unto us, is to excite and put forth all
   grace into exercise. When, therefore, we find faith and love, delight
   in God, longing after an increase of grace and holiness, with a
   detestation of sin, fruitfulness in good works and all duties of
   obedience, joy in spiritual things, self-abasement, and admiration of
   grace, stirred up in us by them, our hearts need not condemn us as to
   want of sincerity in these duties, though we are sensible of many
   weaknesses and imperfections. And whereas, through the power of
   corruptions and temptations, through the weakness of the flesh and
   prevalency of unbelief, we come sometimes short of a sensible
   experience of this effect on our souls by and under them, there may yet
   remain a relieving evidence of some sincerity in what we do; and this
   is, if, rejecting all other pretences and prejudices, we charge
   ourselves alone with our unprofitableness, and be humbled in a sense
   thereof. Want hereof hath been the reason why some have rejected the
   ordinances of the gospel as dead and useless, and others have grown
   formal, careless, and barren, under the enjoyment of them. When all
   veils and coverings shall be taken away and destroyed, these things
   will appear to be the fruits of pride and of the deceitfulness of sin.

   2. It is so when, in the dispensation of the ordinances, spiritual
   things are realized and made nigh unto us. When in the preaching of the
   word we find Jesus Christ "evidently set forth, crucified before our
   eyes," Gal. iii. 1; when the form of the things delivered is brought
   upon our minds, Rom. vi. 17; when we do, as it were, feel and handle
   the word of life, and the things hoped for have some kind of
   subsistence given them in our souls, as Heb. xi. 1, -- then are we
   exercised in a due manner in this part of our obedience. To this
   purpose our apostle discourseth, Rom. x. 6-9. The word as preached and
   other ordinances do not direct us unto things afar off, but bring the
   Lord Christ with all the benefits of his mediation into our hearts. But
   if we content ourselves with empty light, with unaffecting notions of
   spiritual things, if we rest satisfied with the outward performance of
   our own duty and that of other men, we have just cause to fear that our
   hearts are not right in the sight of God in this matter.

   3. When we find that a conscientious attendance on all the ordinances
   of instituted worship doth quicken our diligence and watchfulness unto
   all other duties of obedience that are required of us, we are
   conversant in them in a due manner. When under a pretence of them, and
   a mistaken satisfaction in them, men countenance themselves in the
   neglect of other duties, how way is made for farther apostasy from
   holiness hath been declared. Wherefore there can be no greater evidence
   of our due attendance unto them than when we axe excited, quickened,
   enlarged, and confirmed by them unto and in all the ways of universal
   obedience. Those, therefore, who most conscientiously make use of
   church privileges and gospel ordinances are they whose hearts are most
   engaged unto all other duties by them.

   Lastly, It is an evidence of the same importance when we have that
   experience of Christ and his grace in the administration of gospel
   ordinances according unto his will, as that we are strengthened thereby
   to suffer for him and them when we are called thereunto. The time will
   come when neither mere light and conviction of truth nor the gifts of
   the ministry will secure men unto their profession. But he who hath
   tasted how gracious Christ is in the ways of his appointment will not
   easily be removed from his resolution of following him whithersoever he
   goeth.

   Fourthly, Take heed of the infection of national vices. What I intend
   hereby hath been before declared. And this caution is most necessary
   when they are most prevalent among any people; for commonness will take
   off a sense of their guilt, and countenance will insensibly take away
   shame. Besides, when some go out unto an open excess, others are apt to
   justify themselves in vain practices and sinful miscarriages, because
   they rise not up unto the same height of provocation with them. This
   makes lesser vanities, in habits, attires, pleasures, misspense of time
   in talking-houses, [15] excess in eating and drinking, corrupt
   communication, and careless boldness in common converses, whereby
   persons tread in the steps, and sometimes on the very heels, of the
   predominant sins of the place and age, so to abound among us. Some
   openly show what they have a mind to be at, if they durst, and that it
   is more reputation and the power of convictions than the love of gospel
   holiness that restrain them from running forth into the same excess of
   riot with others. Israel of old "dwelt alone, and was not reckoned
   among the nations," Num. xxiii. 9; and "the remnant of Jacob is to be
   so in the midst," in the bowels "of many people," as to be a blessing
   unto them, Mic. v. 7, not to be corrupted by them. If professors will
   so immerse themselves into the body of the people as insensibly to
   learn their manners, they will be carried down the stream with them
   into perdition; and the danger hereof is beyond what most men conceive.
   Grace was but sparingly administered unto the community of the people
   under the old testament, and therefore, after the giving of the law,
   God would not trust them to live among other people, nor other people
   to live among them, as knowing how unable they were to withstand the
   temptations of conformity unto them. Hereon he appointed that all the
   nations should be utterly extirpated where they were to inhabit, that
   they should not learn their customs, Lev. xviii. 30. The neglect of
   this wisdom of God, the transgression of his will herein, by mixing
   themselves with other nations and learning their manners, was that
   which proved their ruin. Under the gospel there is a more plentiful
   effusion of the Spirit. God now intrusts all that are called unto the
   obedience of it to live in the midst of all nations under heaven; yet
   he so cloth it as to warn them of their danger thereby, and to require
   them to stand upon their guard herein continually. This is that part of
   true religion which the apostle James calls the "keeping of ourselves
   unspotted from the world," chap. i. 27. Most men think it enough that
   no more can be required of them nor expected from them than that they
   wallow not in the mire and pollutions of it. If their practice be free
   from actual open sins, they care not what spots of a worldly
   conversation are upon them; but they know not what will be the end
   thereof.

   It may be it will be said, that unless we do conform ourselves in some
   things unto the customs that are prevalent among us, as in habit, and
   fashion, and way of converse, we shall be despised in the world, and
   neither we nor ours be of any regard.

   I answer, -- 1. That I am not contending about small things, nor
   prescribing modes of attire or manner of deportment unto any. There is
   none who doth more despise the placing of religion in clothes, in
   gestures, in the refusal of civil and just respects, than I do; nor
   have I any severity in my thoughts against a distinction in these
   things among persons, according to their degrees and conditions in the
   world, though apparently there be an excess in all sorts herein. But
   that which I intend is, a compliance with the world in those things
   which border on and make some kind of representation of the predominant
   vices of the place and age wherein we live; and if you think you shall
   be despised if you come behind the rest of your rank and quality in the
   world in these things, still you will be so unless you come up unto
   them in all abominations, 1 Pet. iv. 3, 4; -- and whether it be fit to
   relinquish God, and Christ, and the gospel, all holiness and morality,
   to have the friendship of the world, judge ye. And, -- 2. Be sure to
   outgo them in fixed honesty, kindness, benignity, usefulness, meekness,
   moderation of spirit, charity, bowels of compassion, readiness to help
   and relieve all men according unto your power, and you will quickly
   find, even in this world, how little you are concerned in that contempt
   of the vilest part of mankind whereof you seem to be afraid.

   Fifthly, Carefully avoid all those miscarriages of professors which
   alienate the minds of men from the gospel, and countenance them in the
   contempt of the profession of it. Some of them we have mentioned
   before, and many of the like nature might be added unto them. As the
   scandalous, profligate lives of those in general who are called
   Christians give that offence unto Jews, Mohammedans, and Gentiles, all
   the world over, that hardens them unto a contempt and detestation of
   Christianity, and bath brought the whole matter of religion in the
   world unto force and the sword, so the miscarriages of the strictest
   sort of professors do greatly countenance others in their dislike of
   and enmity against the power of godliness which they profess; and so
   far as we continue in them, we have a share in the guilt of the present
   defection. Not to insist on particulars, the things of this nature that
   are charged on them may be reduced unto three heads:-- 1. Want of love
   and unity among themselves; 2. Want of usefulness and kindness towards
   all; 3. Spiritual pride and censoriousness, or rash judging of other
   men.

   These are the things which are commonly charged on some professors; and
   although, it may be, they are but few who are guilty of all or any of
   these things, at least not as they are charged and reproached by
   others, yet they may all learn what in an especial manner to avoid,
   that they give no advantage unto those who seek for it and would be
   glad of it. It is our duty, by a watchful, holy conversation in all
   things, to "put to silence the ignorance of foolish men," and so
   universally to approve our sincerity unto God and men, that whereas we
   are, or may be at any time, "evil spoken of, as evil-doers, they may be
   ashamed, beholding our good conversation in Christ, and glorify God in
   the day of visitation." This is the law that we have brought ourselves
   under, not to fret and fume, and in our minds seek for revenge, when we
   are traduced and evil spoken of, but by a "patient continuance in
   well-doing," to overcome all the evil that the malice of hell or the
   world can cast upon us; and if we like not this law and rule, we had
   best relinquish our profession, for it is indispensably required of all
   the disciples of Jesus Christ, And he whose heart is confirmed by grace
   to do well whilst he is evil spoken of will find such present
   satisfaction, in a sense of his acceptation with Christ, as to make him
   say, "This yoke is easy, and this burden is light," Especially ought we
   carefully to avoid the things mentioned and appearances of them,
   whereby public offence is taken, and advantage made by evil men to
   countenance themselves in their sins. You are but few unto whom these
   things are communicated, and so may judge that all your care in and
   about them will be of little significancy to put any stop unto the
   general declension from gospel holiness; but it is hoped that all
   others are warned in the same manner, yea, and more effectually than
   you are. However, every vessel must stand on its own bottom; "the just
   shall live by his" own "faith;" "every one of us shall give account of
   himself to God;" and no more is required of you but your own personal
   duty.

   It is true, you cannot put an end unto those differences and divisions,
   that want of love and agreement, that is among professors; but you may
   take care that the guilt of none of these things may be justly charged
   on you. Love unto the saints without dissimulation; readiness to bear
   in meekness with different apprehensions and palpable misapprehensions,
   not intrenching on the foundation; freedom from imposing your
   sentiments on those who cannot receive them, and from judging rashly on
   supposed failures; readiness for universal communion in all religious
   duties with all that "love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity," -- as
   they are our duties, as they are some of the principal ways whereby we
   may truly represent the Lord Christ and the doctrine of the gospel unto
   others, so they will disarm Satan and the world of a great engine
   whereby they work no small mischief unto the whole interest of
   religion.

   Again: were all professors meek, quiet, peaceable, in their societies
   and among their neighbours; sober, temperate, humble in their personal
   conversation in the world; useful, kind, benign, condescending towards
   all; cheerful in trials and afflictions, always "rejoicing in the
   Lord," -- men not given up to a reprobate sense ([men] who are [so,
   are] not to be regarded) would at length be so far from taking offence
   at them as to judge that they should not know what to do without them,
   and be won to endeavour a conformity unto them. In like manner, were
   those rules more diligently attended unto which are prescribed unto all
   believers as unto their conversation in this world, it would be of no
   small advantage unto religion. See Phil. iv. 8; 1 Pet. ii. 12; 2 Cor.
   xiii. 7; Rom. xiii. 12, 13; 1 Thess. iv. 11, 12; Heb. xiii. 18. Did
   honesty, sincerity, uprightness in all the occasions of life, in the
   whole converse of professors in the world, shine more brightly and give
   more evidences of themselves than at present among many they seem to
   do, it would undoubtedly turn unto the unspeakable advantage of
   religion.

   And, lastly, for that judging or condemning of others wherewith they
   are so provoked, there is but one way whereby it may be done so as to
   give no just offence, and this is in our lives. The practice of
   holiness judgeth all unholy persons in their own breasts; and if they
   are provoked thereby, there is nothing in it but a new aggravation of
   their own sin and impiety.

   published till 1693, ten years after the death of the author. -- Ed.

   [15] The author seems to allude to the coffee-houses, which,
   established in the time of the commonwealth, soon became a distinctive
   feature of London life. When no public meetings were allowed, and no
   public journals existed, the only method by which the news of the day
   could be learned was by a visit to a coffee-house; in which, besides
   the information reciprocated in private talk, there were leading
   orators who harangued the crowd on the current topics of public
   interest. So powerful was the expression of public opinion through the
   imperfect channel of these coffee-houses, that the government at one
   time attempted to suppress them; but the system had become so popular
   and so interwoven with the habits of the Londoners, that no enactment
   against it could be enforced. Much time, doubtless, would be wasted in
   these "talking-houses," and it is against this sin that the remarks of
   Owen are directed. -- Ed.
