NOTE ON THE TEXT

   IN preparing the text of the Consolatio I have used the apparatus in
   Peiper's edition (Teubner, 1871), since his reports, as I know in the
   case of the Tegernseensis, are generally accurate and complete; I have
   depended also on my own collations or excerpts from various of the
   important manuscripts, nearly all of which I have at least examined,
   and I have also followed, not always but usually, the opinions of
   Engelbrecht in his admirable article, Die Consolatio Philosophiae des
   Boethius in the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy, cxliv. (1902)
   1-60. The present text, then, has been constructed from only part of
   the material with which an editor should reckon, though the reader may
   at least assume that every reading in the text has, unless otherwise
   stated, the authority of some manuscript of the ninth or tenth century;
   in certain orthographical details, evidence from the text of the
   Opuscula Sacra has been used without special mention of this fact. We
   look to August Engelbrecht for the first critical edition of the
   Consolatio at, we hope, no distant date.

   The text of the Opuscula Sacra is based on my own collations of all the
   important manuscripts of these works. An edition with complete
   apparatus criticis will be ready before long for the Vienna corpis
   Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum. The history of the text of the
   Opuscula Sacra, as I shall attempt to show elsewhere, is intimately
   connected with that of the Consolatio.

INTRODUCTION

   ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERINUS BOETHIUS, of the famous Praenestine family of
   the Anicii, was born about 480 A.D. in Rome. His father was an
   ex-consul; he himself was consul under Theodoric the Ostrogoth in 510,
   and his two sons, children of a great granddaughter of the renowned Q.
   Aurelius Symmachus, were joint consuls in 522. His public career was
   splendid and honourable, as befitted a man of his race, attainments,
   and character. But he fell under the displeasure of Theodoric, and was
   charged with conspiring to deliver Rome from his rule, and with
   corresponding treasonably to this end with Justin, Emperor of the East.
   He was thrown into prison at Pavia, where he wrote the Consolation of
   Philosophy, and he was as brutally put to death in 524. His brief and
   busy life was marked by great literary achievement. His learning was
   vast, his industry untiring, his object unattainable--nothing less than
   the transmission to his countrymen of all the works of Plato and
   Aristotle, and the reconciliation of their apparently divergent views.
   To form the idea was a silent judgment on the learning of his day; to
   realize it was more than one man could accomplish; but Boethius
   accomplished much. He translated the E of Porphyry, and the whole of
   Aristotle's Organon. He wrote a double commentary on the E, and
   commentaries on the Categories and the De Interpretatione of Aristotle,
   and on the Topica of Cicero. He also composed original treatises on the
   categorical and hypothetical syllogism, on Division and on Topical
   Differences. He adapted the arithmetic of Nicomachus, and his textbook
   on music, founded on various Greek authorities, was in use at Oxford
   and Cambridge until modern times. His five theological Tractates are
   here, together with the Consolation of Philosophy to speak for
   themselves.

   Boethius was the last of the Roman philosophers and the first of the
   scholastic theologians. The present volume serves to prove the truth of
   both these assertions.

   The Consolation of Philosophy is indeed, as Gibbon called it, "a golden
   volume, not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or of Tully." To belittle
   its originality and sincerity, as is sometimes done, with view to
   saving the Christianity of the writer, is to misunderstand his mind and
   his method. The Consolatio is not, as has been maintained, a mere
   patchwork of translations from Aristotle and the Neoplatonists. Rather
   it is the supreme essay of one who throughout his life had found his
   highest solace in the dry light of reason. His chief source of
   refreshment, in the dungeon to which his beloved library had not
   accompanied him, was a memory well stocked with the poetry and thought
   of former days. The development of the argument is anything but
   Neoplatonic; it is all his own.

   And if the Consolation of Philosophy admits Boethius to the company of
   Cicero or even of Plato, the theological Tractates mark him as the
   forerunner of St. Thomas. It was the habit of a former generation to
   regard Boethius as an eclectic, the transmitter of a distorted
   Aristotelianism, a pagan, or at best a luke-warm Christian, who at the
   end cast off the faith which he had worn in times of peace, and wrapped
   himself in the philosophic cloak which properly belonged to him. The
   authenticity of the Tractates was freely denied. We know better now.
   The discovery by Alfred Holder, and the illuminating discussion by
   Hermann Usener, [1] of a fragment of Cassiodorus are sufficient
   confirmation of the manuscript tradition, apart from the work of
   scholars who have sought to justify that tradition from internal
   evidence. In that fragment Cassiodorus definitely ascribes to his
   friend Boethius "a book on the Trinity, some dogmatic chapters, and a
   book against Nestorius." [2] Boethius was without doubt a Christian, a
   Doctor and perhaps a martyr. Nor is it necessary to think that, when in
   prison, he put away his faith. If it is asked why the Consolation of
   Philosophy contains no conscious or direct reference to the doctrines
   which are traced in the Tractates with so sure a hand, and is, at most,
   not out of harmony with Christianity, the answer is simple. In the
   Consolation he is writing philosophy; in the Tractates he is writing
   theology. He observes what Pascal calls the orders of things.
   Philosophy belongs to one order, theology to another. They have
   different objects. The object of philosophy is to understand and
   explain the nature of the world around us; the object of theology is to
   understand and explain doctrines delivered by divine revelation. The
   scholastics recognized the distinction, [3] and the corresponding
   difference in the function of Faith and Reason. Their final aim was to
   co-ordinate the two but this was not possible before the thirteenth
   century. Meanwhile Boethius helps to prepare the way. In the
   Consolation he gives Reason her range and suffers her, unaided, to
   vindicate the ways of Providence. In the Tractates Reason is called in
   to give to the claims of Faith the support which it does not really
   lack. [4] Reason, however, has still a right to be heard. The
   distinction between fides and ratio is proclaimed in the first two
   Tractates . In the second especially it is drawn with a clearness
   worthy of St. Thomas himself; and there is, of course the implication
   that the higher authority resides with fides. But the treatment is
   philosophical and extremely bold. Boethius comes back to the question
   of the substantiality of the divine Persons which he has discussed in
   Tr. I. from a fresh point of view. Once more he decides that the
   Persons are predicated relatively; even Trinity, he concludes, is not
   predicated substantially of deity. Does this square with catholic
   doctrine? It is possible to hear a note of challenge in his words to
   John the Deacon, fidem si poterit rationemque coniunge. Philosophy
   states the problem in unequivocal terms. Theology is required to say
   whether they commend themselves.

   One object of the scholastics, anterior to the final con-ordination of
   the two sciences, was to harmonize and codify all the answers to all
   the questions that philosophy raises. The ambition of Boethius was not
   so soaring, but it was sufficiently bold. He set out, first to
   translate, and then to reconcile, Plato and Aristotle; to go behind all
   the other systems, even the latest and the most in vogue, back to the
   two great masters, and to show that they have the truth, and are in
   substantial accord. So St. Thomas himself, if he cannot reconcile the
   teaching of Plato and Aristotle, at least desires to correct the one by
   the other, to discover what truth is common to both, and to show its
   correspondence with Christian doctrine. It is reasonable to conjecture
   that Boethius, if he had lived, might have attempted something of the
   kind. Were he alive today, he might feel more in tune with the best of
   the pagans than with most contemporary philosophic thought.

   In yet one more respect Boethius belongs to the company of the
   schoolmen. He not only put into circulation many precious philosophical
   notions, served as channel through which various works of Aristotle
   passed into the schools, and handed down to them a definite
   Aristotelian method for approaching the problem of faith; he also
   supplied material for that classification of the various sciences which
   is an essential accompaniment of every philosophical movement, and of
   which the Middle Ages felt the value. [5] The uniform distribution into
   natural sciences, mathematics and theology which he recommends may be
   traced in the work of various teachers up to the thirteenth century,
   when it is finally accepted and defended by St. Thomas in his
   commentary on the De Trinitate.

   A seventeenth-century translation of the consolatio Philosophiae is
   here presented with such alterations as are demanded by a better text,
   and the requirements of modern scholarship. There was, indeed not much
   to do, for the rendering is most exact. This in a translation of that
   date is not a little remarkable. We look for fine English and poetry in
   an Elizabethan; but we do not often get from him such loyalty to the
   original as is here displayed. Of the author "I. T." nothing is known.
   He may have been John Thorie, a Fleming born in London in 1568, and a
   B.A. of Christ Church, 1586. Thorie "was a person well skilled in
   certain tongues, and a noted poet of his times " (Wood, Athenae Oxon
   ed. Bliss, i. 624), but his known translations are apparently all from
   the Spanish.

   Our translator dedicates his "Five books on Philosophical Comfort" to
   the Dowager Countes of Dorset, widow of Thomas Sackville, who was part
   author of A Mirror for Magistrates and Gorboduc and who, we learn from
   I. T.'s preface, meditated similar work. I. T. does not unduly flatter
   h patroness, and he tells her plainly that she will not understand the
   philosophy of the book, though the theological and practical parts may
   be within her scope.

   The Opuscucla Sacra have never before, to our knowledge, been
   translated. In reading and rendering them we have been greatly helped
   by two mediaeval commentaries: one by John the Scot (edited by E. K.
   Rand in Traube's Quellen und Untersuchungen, vol. i. Pt. 2, Munich,
   1906); the other by Gilbert de la Porree (printed in Migne, P.L. lxiv.
   We also desire to record our indebtedness in many points of scholarship
   and philosophy to Mr. E. Thomas of Emmanuel College.

   I HAVE long pondered this problem with such mind as I have and all the
   light that God has lent me. Now, having set it forth in logical order
   and cast it into literary form, I venture to submit it to your
   judgment, for which I care as much as for the results of my own
   research. You will readily understand what I feel whenever I try to
   write down what I think if you consider the difficulty of the topic and
   the fact that I discuss it only with the few--I may say with no one but
   yourself. It is indeed no desire for fame or empty popular applause
   that prompts my pen; if there be any external reward, we may not look
   for more warmth in the Verdict than the subject itself arouses. For, a
   part from yourself, wherever I turn my eyes, they fall on either the
   apathy of the dullard or the jealousy of the shrewd, and a man who
   casts his thoughts before the common herd--I will not say to consider
   but to trample under foot, would seem to bring discredit on the study
   of divinity. So I purposely use brevity and wrap up the ideas I draw
   from the deep questionings of philosophy in new and unaccustomed words
   which speak only to you and to myself, that is, if you deign to look at
   them. The rest of the world I simply disregard: they cannot understand,
   and therefore do not deserve to read. We should not of course press our
   inquiry further than man's wit and reason are allowed to climb the
   height of heavenly knowledge. [6] In all the liberal arts some limit is
   set beyond which reason may not reach. Medicine, for instance, does not
   always bring health to the sick, though the doctor will not be to blame
   if he has left nothing undone which he ought to do. So with the other
   arts. In the present case the very difficulty of the quest claims a
   lenient judgment. You must however examine whether the seeds sown in my
   mind by St. Augustine's writings [7] have borne fruit. And now let us
   begin our inquiry.
     __________________________________________________________________

I.

   There are many who claim as theirs the dignity of the Christian
   religion; but that form of faith is valid and only valid which, both on
   account of the universal character of the rules and doctrines affirming
   its authority, and because the worship in which they are expressed has
   spread throughout the world, is called catholic or universal. The
   belief of this religion concerning the Unity of the Trinity is as
   follows: the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God.
   Therefore Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, not three Gods. The
   cause of this union is absence of difference: [8] difference cannot be
   avoided by those who add to or take from the Unity, as for instance the
   Arians, who, by graduating the Trinity according to merit, break it up
   and convert it to Plurality. For the essence of plurality is otherness;
   apart from otherness plurality is unintelligible. In fact, the
   difference between three or more things lies in genus or species or
   number. Difference is the necessary correlative of sameness. Sameness
   is predicated in three ways: By genus; e.g. a man and a horse, because
   of their common genus, animal. By species; e.g. Cato and Cicero,
   because of their common species, man. By number; e.g. Tully and Cicero,
   because they are one and the same man. Similarly, difference is
   expressed by genus, species, and number. Now numerical difference is
   caused by variety of accidents; three men differ neither by genus nor
   species but by their accidents, for if we mentally remove from them all
   other accidents, [9] still each one occupies a different place which
   cannot possibly be regarded as the same for each, since two bodies
   cannot occupy the same place, and place is an accident. Wherefore it is
   because men are plural by their accidents that they are plural in
   number.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] The terms differentia, numerus, species, are used expertly, as
   would be expected of the author of the In Isag. Porph. Commenta. See S.
   Brandt's edition of that work (in the Vienna Corpus, 1906), s.v.
   differencia, etc.

   [9] This method of mental abstraction is employed more elaborately in
   Tr. iii. (vide infra, p. 44) and in Cons. v. pr. 4, where the notion of
   divine foreknowledge is abstracted in imagination.
     __________________________________________________________________

II.

   We will now begin a careful consideration of each several point, as far
   as they can be grasped and understood; for it has been wisely said,
   [10] in my opinion, that it is a scholar's duty to study the real
   nature of anything before he formulates his belief about it.

   Speculative Science may he divided into three kinds: [11] Physics,
   Mathematics, and Theology. Physics deals with motion and is not
   abstract or separable (i.e. ); for it is concerned with the forms of
   bodies together with their constituent matter, which forms cannot be
   separated in reality from their bodies. [12] As the bodies are in
   motion--the earth, for instance, tending downwards, and fire tending
   upwards, form takes on the movement of the particular thing to which it
   is annexed.

   Mathematics does not deal with motion and is not abstract, for it
   investigates forms of bodies apart from matter, and therefore apart
   from movement, which forms, however, being connected with matter cannot
   be really separated from bodies.

   Theology does not deal with motion and is abstract and separable, for
   time Divine Substance is without either matter or motion. In Physics,
   then, we are bound to use scientific, in Mathematics, systematical, in
   Theology, intellectual concepts; and in Theology we will not let
   ourselves be diverted to play with imaginations, but will simply
   apprehend that Form which is pure form and no image, which is very
   Being and the source of Being For everything owes its being to Form.
   Thus a statue is not a statue on account of the brass which is its
   matter, but on account of the form whereby the likeness of a living
   thing is impressed upon it: the brass itself is not brass because of
   the earth which is its matter, but because of its form. Likewise earth
   is not earth by reason of unqualified matter, [13] but by reason of
   dryness and weight, which are forms. So nothing is said to be because
   it has matter, but because it has a distinctive form. But the Divine
   Substance is Form without matter, and is therefore One, and is its own
   essence. But other things are not simply their own essences, for each
   thing has its being from the things of which it is composed, that is,
   from its parts. It is This and That, i.e. it is the totality of its
   parts in conjunction; it is not This or That taken apart. Earthly man,
   for instance, since he consists of soul and body, is soul and body, not
   soul or body, separately; therefore he is not his own essence. That on
   the other hand which does not consist of This and That, but only of
   This, is really its own essence, and is altogether beautiful and stable
   because it is not grounded in any alien element. Wherefore that is
   truly One in which is no number, in which nothing is present except its
   own essence. Nor can it become the substrate of anything, for it is
   pure Form, and pure Forms cannot be substrates. [14] For if humanity,
   like other forms, is a substrate for accidents, it does not receive
   accidents through the fact that it exists, but through the fact that
   matter is subjected to it. Humanity appears indeed to appropriate the
   accident which in reality belongs to the matter underlying the
   conception Humanity. But Form which, is without matter cannot be a
   substrate, and cannot have its essence in matter, else it would not be
   form but a reflexion. For from those forms which are outside matter
   come the forms which are in matter and produce bodies. We misname the
   entities that reside in bodies when we call them forms; they are mere
   images; they only resemble those forms which are not incorporate in
   matter. In Him, then, is no difference, no plurality arising out of
   difference, no multiplicity arising out of accidents, and accordingly
   no number.

   esse non dubites". Isag. In Porph. ed. pr. i. (M. P.L. lxiv. Col. 19,
   Brandt, pp. 26 ff.). The two passages show that Boethius is definitly
   commited to the Realistic position, although in his Comment. In
   Porphyr. A se translatum he holds the scales between Plato and
   Aristotle, "quorum diiudicare sententias aptum esse non duxi" (cp.
   Haureau, Hist. De la philosophie scolastique, i. 120). As a fact in the
   Comment. in Porph. he merely postpones the question, which in the De
   Trin. he settles, Boethius was ridiculed in the Middle Ages for his
   caution.
     __________________________________________________________________

III.

   Now God differs from God in no respect for there cannot lie divine
   essences distinguished either by accidents or by substantial
   differences belonging to a substrate. But where there is no difference,
   there is no sort of plurality and accordingly no number; here,
   therefore, is unity alone. For whereas we say God thrice when we name
   the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, these three unities do not produce a
   plurality of number in their own essences, if we think of what we count
   instead of what we count with. For in the case of abstract number a
   repetition of single items does produce plurality; but in the case of
   concrete number the repetition and plural use of single items does not
   by any means produce numerical difference in the objects counted. There
   are as a fact two kinds of number. There is the number with which we
   count (abstract) and the number inherent in the things counted
   (concrete). "One" is a thing--the thing counted. Unity is that by which
   oneness is denoted. Again " two "belongs to the class of things as men
   or stones; but not so duality; duality is merely that whereby two men
   or two stones are denoted; and so on. Therefore a repetition of unities
   [15] produces plurality when it is a question of abstract, but not when
   it is a question of concrete things, as, for example, if I say of one
   and the same thing, "one sword, one brand, one blade." [16] It is easy
   to see that each of these names denotes a sword; I am not numbering
   unities but simply repeating one thing, and in saying "sword, brand,
   blade," I reiterate the one thing and do not enumerate several
   different things any more than I produce three suns instead of merely
   mentioning one thing thrice when I say "Sun, Sun, Sun."

   So then if God be predicated thrice of Father, Sun, and Holy Spirit,
   the threefold predication does not result in plural number. The risk of
   that, as has been said, attends only on those who distinguish Them
   according to merit. But Catholic Christians, allowing no difference of
   merit in God, assuming Him to be Pure Form and believing Him to he
   nothing else than His own essence, rightly regard the statement "the
   Father is God, the Son is God the Holy Spirit is God, and this Trinity
   is one God," not as an enumeration of different things but as a
   reiteration of one and the same thing, like the statement, "blade and
   brand are one sword" or "sun, sun, and sun are one sun."

   Let this be enough for the present to establish my meaning and to show
   that not every repetition of units produces number and plurality. Still
   in saying "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," we are not using Synonymous
   terms. "Brand and blade " are the same and identical, but

   "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit'' though the same, are not identical.
   This point deserves a moment's consideration. When they ask, "Is the
   Father the same as the Son?" Catholics answer "No." "Is the One the
   same as the Other?" The answer is in the negative. There is not,
   therefore, complete indifference between Them; and so number does come
   in--number which we explained was the result of diversity of
   substrates. We will briefly debate this point when, we have done
   examining how particular predicates can be applied to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] e.g. if I say "one, one, one," I enounce three unities.

   [16] The same words are used to illustrate the same matter in the
   Comment. in Arist. 2nd ed. (Meiser) 56. 12.
     __________________________________________________________________

IV.

   There are in all ten categories which can be universally predicated of
   things, namely, Substance, Quality, Quantity, Relation, Place, Time,
   Condition, Situation, Activity, Passivity. Their meaning is determined
   by the contingent subject; for some of them denote real substantive
   attributes of created things, others belong to the class of accidental
   attributes. But when these categories are applied to God they change
   their meaning entirely. Relation, for instance, cannot be predicated at
   all of God; for substance in Him is not really substantial but
   super-substantial. So with quality and the other possible attributes,
   of which we must add examples for the sake of clearness.

   When we say God, we seem to denote a substance; but it is a substance
   that is supersubstantial. When we say of Him, "He is just," we mention
   a quality, not an accidental quality--rather a substantial and, in
   fact, a supersubstantial quality. [17] For God is not one thing because
   He is, and another thing because He is just; with Him to be just and to
   be God are one and the same. So when we say, "He is great or the
   greatest, we seem to predicate quantity, but it is a quantity similar
   to this substance which we have declared to be supersubstantial; for
   with Him to be great and to be God are all one. Again, concerning His
   Form, we have already shown that He is Form, and truly One without
   Plurality. The categories we have mentioned are such that they give to
   the thing to which they are applied the character which they express;
   in created things they express divided being, in God, conjoined and
   united being--in the following manner. When we name a substance, as man
   or God, it seems as though that of which the predication is made were
   itself substance, as man or God is substance. But there is a
   difference: since man is not simply and entirely man, and therefore is
   not substance after all. For what man is he owes to other things which
   are not man. But God is simply and entirely God, for He is nothing else
   than what He is, and therefore is, through simple existence, God. Again
   we apply just, a quality, as though it were that of which it is
   predicated; that is, if we say "a just man or just God," we assert that
   man or God is just. But there is a difference, for man is one thing,
   and a just man is another thing. But God is justice itself. So a man or
   God is said to be great, and it would appear that man is substantially
   great or that God is substantially great. But man is merely great; God
   is greatness.

   The remaining categories are not predicable of God nor yet of created
   things. [18] For place is predicated of man or of God--a man is in the
   market-place; God is everywhere--but in neither case is the predicate
   identical with the object of predication. To say "A man is in the
   market" is quite a different thing from saying "he is white or long,"
   or, so to speak, encompassed and determined by some property which
   enables him to be described in terms of his substance; this predicate
   of place simply declares how far his substance is given a particular
   setting amid other things.

   It is otherwise, of course, with God. "He is everywhere" does not mean
   that He is in every place, for He cannot be in any place at all--but
   that every place is present to Him for Him to occupy, although He
   Himself can be received by no place, and therefore He cannot anywhere
   be in a place, since He is everywhere but in no place. It is the same
   with the category of time, as, "A man came yesterday; God is ever."
   Here again the predicate of "coming yesterday" denotes not something
   substantial, but something happening in terms of time. But the
   expression "God is ever" denotes a single Present, summing up His
   continual presence in all the past, in all the present --however that
   term be used--and in all the future. Philosophers say that "ever" may
   be applied to the life of the heavens and other immortal bodies. But as
   applied to God it has a different meaning. He is ever, because "ever"
   is with Him a term of present time, and there is this great difference
   between "now," which is our present, and the divine present. Our
   present connotes changing time and sempiternity; God's present,
   unmoved, and immoveable, connotes eternity. Add semper to eternity and
   you get the constant, incessant and thereby perpetual course of our
   present time, that is to say, sempiternity. [19]

   It is just the same with the categories of condition and activity. For
   example, we say "A man runs, clothed," "God rules, possessing all
   things." Here again nothing substantial is asserted of either subject;
   in fact all the categories we have hitherto named arise from what lies
   outside substance, and all of them, so to speak, refer to something
   other than substance. The difference between the categories is easily
   seen by an example. Thus, the terms "man'' and "God" refer to the
   substance in virtue of which the subject is--man or God. The term "just
   " refers to the quality in virtue of which the subject is something,
   viz. just; the term "great" to the quantity in virtue of which He is
   something, viz, great. No other category save substance, quality, and
   quantity refer to the substance of the subject. If I say of one "he is
   in the market" or "everywhere," I am applying the category of place,
   which is not a category of the substance, like "just" in virtue of
   justice. So if I say, "he runs, He rules, he is now, He is ever,'' I
   make reference to activity or time--if indeed God's "ever" can be
   described as time--but not to a category of substance, like "great" in
   virtue of greatness.

   Finally, we must not look for the categories of situation and passivity
   in God, for they simply are not to be found in Him.

   Have I now made clear the difference between the categories? Some
   denote the reality of a thing; others its accidental circumstances; the
   former declare that a thing is something; the latter say nothing about
   its being anything, but simply attach to it, so to speak, something
   external. Those categories which describe a thing in terms of its
   substance may be called substantial categories; when they apply to
   things as subjects they are called accidents. In reference to God, who
   is not a subject at all, it is only possible to employ the category of
   substance.

   [17] Gilbert de la Porree in his commentary on the De Trin. Makes
   Boethius's meaning clear. "Quad igitur in illo substantiam nominamus,
   non est subiectionis ratione quod dicitur, sed ultra omnem quae
   accidentibus est subiecta substantiam est essentia, absque omnibus quae
   possunt accidere solitaria omnino" (Migne, P.L. lxiv. 1283). Cf. Aug.
   De Trin. vii. 10.

   [18] i.e. according to their substance.

   [19] The doctrine is Augustine's, cf. De Ciu. Dei, xi. 6, xii. 16; but
   Boethius's use of sempiternitas, as well as his word-building, seem to
   be peculiar to himself. Claudianus Mamertus, speaking of applying the
   categories to God, uses sempiternitas as Boethius uses aeternitas. Cf.
   De Statu Animae i. 19. Apuleius seems to use both terms
   interchangeably, e.g. Asclep. 29-31. On Boethius's distinction between
   time and eternity see Cons. v. pr. 6, and Rand, Der dem B. zugeschr.
   Trakt. De fide, pp. 425 ff, and Brandt in Theol. Littzg., 1902, p. 147.

   Let us now consider the category of relation, to which all the
   foregoing remarks have been preliminary; for qualities which obviously
   arise from the association of another term do not appear to predicate
   anything concerning the substance of a subject. For instance, master
   and slave [20] are relative terms; let us see whether either of them
   are predicates of substance. If you suppress the term slave, [21] you
   simultaneously suppress the term master. On the other hand, though you
   suppress the term whiteness, you do not suppress some white thing, [22]
   though, of course, if the particular whiteness inhere as an accident in
   the thing, the thing disappears as soon as you suppress the accidental
   quality whiteness. But in the case of master, if you suppress the term
   slave, the term master disappears. But slave is not an accidental
   quality of master, as whiteness is of a white thing; it denotes the
   power which the master has over the slave. Now since the power goes
   when the slave is removed, it is plain that power is no accident to the
   substance of master, but is an adventitious augmentation arising from
   the possession of slaves.

   It cannot therefore be affirmed that a category of relation increases,
   decreases, or alters in any way the substance of the thing to which it
   is applied. The category of relation, then, has nothing to do with the
   substance of the subject; it simply denotes a condition of relativity,
   and that not necessarily to something else, but sometimes to the
   subject itself. For suppose a man standing. If I go up to him on my
   right and stand beside him, he will be left, in relation to me, not
   because he is left in himself, but because I have come up to him on my
   right. Again, if I come up to him on my left, he becomes right in
   relation to me, not because he is right in himself, as he may be white
   or long, but because he is right in virtue of my approach. What he is
   depends entirely on me, and not in the least on the essence of his
   being.

   Accordingly those predicates which do not denote the essential property
   of a thing cannot alter, change or disturb its nature in any way.
   Wherefore if Father and Son are predicates of relation, and, as we have
   said, have no other difference but that of relation, and if relation is
   not asserted of its subject as though it were time subject itself and
   its substantial quality, it will effect no real difference in its
   subject, but, in a phrase which aims at interpreting what we can hardly
   understand, a difference of persons. For it is a canon of absolute
   truth that distinctions in incorporeal things are established by
   differences and not by spatial separation. It cannot be said that God
   became Father by the addition to His substance of some accident; for he
   never began to be Father, since the begetting of the Son belongs to His
   very substance; however, time predicate father, as such, is relative.
   And if we bear in mind all the propositions made God in the previous
   discussion, we shall admit that God the Son proceeded from God the
   Father, and the Holy Ghost from both, and that They cannot possibly be
   spatially different, since They are incorporeal. But since the Father
   is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and since there are
   in God no points of difference distinguishing Him from God, He differs
   from none of the Others. But where there are no differences there is no
   plurality; where is no plurality there is Unity. Again, nothing but God
   can be begotten of God, and lastly, in concrete enumerations the
   repetition of units does not produce plurality. Thus the Unity of the
   Three is suitably established.

  VI.

   But since no relation can be affirmed of one subject alone, inasmuch as
   a predicate wanting relation is a predicate of substance, the
   manifoldness of the category of relation, Trinity is secured through
   the category of relation, and the Unity is maintained through the fact
   that there is no difference of substance, or operation, or generally of
   any substantial predicate. So then, the divine substance preserves the
   Unity, the divine relations bring about the Trinity. Hence only terms
   belonging to relation may be applied singly to Each. For the Father is
   not the same as the Son, nor is either of Them the same as the Holy
   Spirit. Yet Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each the same God, the
   same in justice, in goodness, in greatness, and in everything that can
   he predicated of substance. One must not forget that predicates of
   relativity do not always involve relation to something other than the
   subject, as slave involves master, where the two terms are different.
   For equals are equal, like are like, identicals are identical, each
   with other, and the relation of Father to Son, and of both to Holy
   Spirit is a relation of identicals. A relation of this kind is not to
   be found in created things, but that is because of the difference which
   we know attaches to transient objects. We must not in speaking of God
   let imagination lead us astray; we must let the Faculty of pure
   Knowledge lift us up and teach us to know all things as far as they may
   be known. [23]

   I have now finished the investigation which I proposed. The exactness
   of my reasoning awaits the standard of your judgment; your authority
   will pronounce whether I have seen a straight path to the goal. If, God
   helping me, I have furnished some support in argument to an article
   which stands by itself on the firm foundation of Faith, I shall render
   joyous praise for the finished work to Him from whom the invitation
   comes. But if human nature has failed to reach beyond its limits,
   whatever is lost through my infirmity must be made good by my
   intention.
