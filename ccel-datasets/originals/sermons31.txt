Sermon for New Year's-Day

   (No. 1816)

   Delivered on Thursday Evening, January 1st, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [1]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new."
   Revelation 21:5.

   HOW PLEASED WE ARE with that which is new! Our children's eyes sparkle
   when we talk of giving them a toy or a book which is called new; for
   our short-lived human nature loves that which has lately come, and is
   therefore like our own fleeting selves. In this respect, we are all
   children, for we eagerly demand the news of the day, and are all too
   apt to rush after the "many inventions" of the hour. The Athenians, who
   spent their time in telling and hearing some new thing, were by no
   means singular persons: novelty still fascinates the crowd. As the
   world's poet says

   "All with one consent praise new-born gawds."

   I should not wonder, therefore, if the mere words of my text should
   sound like a pleasant song in your ears; but I am thankful that their
   deeper meaning is even more joyful. The newness which Jesus brings is
   bright, clear, heavenly, enduring. We are at this moment specially
   ready for a new year. The most of men have grown weary with the old cry
   of depression of trade and hard times; we are glad to escape from what
   has been to many a twelve-months of great trial. The last year had
   become wheezy, croaking, and decrepit, in its old age; and we lay it
   asleep with a psalm of judgment and mercy. We hope that this newborn
   year will not be worse than its predecessor, and we pray that it may be
   a great deal better. At any rate, it is new, and we are encouraged to
   couple with it the idea of happiness, as we say one to another, "I wish
   you a happy New Year."

   "Ring out the old, ring in the new;
   Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
   The year is going, let him go;
   Ring out the false, ring in the true."

   We ought not, as men in Christ Jesus, to be carried away by a childish
   love of novelty, for we worship a God who is ever the same, and of
   whose years there is no end. In some matters "the old is better." There
   are certain things which are already so truly new, that to change them
   for anything else would be to lose old gold for new dross. The old, old
   gospel is the newest thing in the world; in its very essence it is for
   ever good news. In the things of God the old is ever new, and if any
   man brings forward that which seems to be new doctrine and new truth,
   it is soon perceived that the new dogma is only worn-out heresy
   dexterously repaired, and the discovery in theology is the digging up
   of a carcase of error which had better have been left to rot in
   oblivion. In the great matter of truth and godliness, we may safely
   say, "There is nothing new under the sun."

   Yet, as I have already said, there has been so much evil about
   ourselves and our old nature, so much sin about our life and the old
   past, so much mischief about our surroundings and the old temptations,
   that we are not distressed by the belief that old things are passing
   away. Hope springs up at the first sound of such words as these from
   the lips of our risen and reigning Lord: "Behold, I make all things
   new." It is fit that things so outworn and defiled should be laid
   aside, and better things fill their places.

   This is the first day of a new year, and therefore a solemnly joyous
   day. Though there is no real difference between it and any other day,
   yet in our mind and thought it is a marked period, which we regard as
   one of the milestones set up on the highway of our life. It is only in
   imagination that there is any close of one year and beginning of
   another; and yet it has most fitly all the force of a great fact. When
   men "cross the line," they find no visible mark: the sea bears no trace
   of an equatorial belt; and yet mariners know whereabouts they are, and
   they take notice thereof, so that a man can hardly cross the line for
   the first time without remembering it to the day of his death. We are
   crossing the line now. We have sailed into the year of grace 1885;
   therefore, let us keep a feast unto the Lord. If Jesus has not made us
   new already, let the new year cause us to think about the great and
   needful change of conversion; and if our Lord has begun to make us new,
   and we have somewhat entered into the new world wherein dwelleth
   righteousness, let us be persuaded by the season to press forward into
   the center of his new creation, that we may feel to the full all the
   power of his grace.

   The words he speaks to us to-night are truly divine. Listen,"Behold, I
   make." Who is the great I? Who but the eternal Son of God? "Behold, I
   make." Who can make but God, the Maker of heaven and earth? It is his
   high prerogative to make and to destroy. "Behold, I make all things."
   What a range of creating power is here! Nothing stands outside of that
   all-surrounding circle. "Behold, I make all things new." What a
   splendor of almighty goodness shines out upon our souls! Lord, let us
   enter into this new universe of thine. Let us be new-created with the
   "all things." In us also may men behold the marvels of thy renewing
   love.

   Let us now, at the portal of the new year, sing a hymn to Jesus, as we
   hear these encouraging words which he speaks from his throne. O Lord,
   we would rejoice and be glad for ever in that which thou dost create.
   The former troubles are forgotten, and are hid from our eyes because of
   thine ancient promise,"Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:
   and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind." (Isaiah
   65:17).

   I am going to talk to-night for a little upon the great transformation
   spoken of in the text, "I make all things new;" and then upon the
   earnest call in the text to consider that transformation: "He that sat
   upon the throne said, 'Behold': attend, consider, look to it!" "Behold,
   I make all things new." Oh for a bedewing of the Holy Spirit while
   entering upon this theme! I would that our fleece might now be so wet
   as never to become dry throughout the whole year. Oh for a horn of oil
   to be poured on the head of the young year, anointing it for the
   constant service of the Lord!

   I. Briefly, then, here is one of the grandest truths that ever fell
   even from the lips of Jesus:"Behold, I make all things new." Let us
   gaze upon THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION.

   This renewing work has been in our Lord's hands from of old. We were
   under the old covenant, and our first father and federal head, Adam,
   had broken that covenant, and we were ruined by his fatal breach. The
   substance of the old covenant was on this wise,"If thou wilt keep my
   command thou shalt live, and thy posterity shall live; but if thou
   shalt eat of the tree which I have forbidden thee, dying, thou shalt
   die, and all thy posterity in thee." This is where we were found,
   broken in pieces, sore wounded, and even slain by the tremendous fall
   which destroyed both our Paradise and ourselves. We died in Adam as to
   spiritual life, and our death revealed itself in an inward tendency to
   evil which reigned in our members. We were like Ezekiel's deserted
   infant unswaddled and unwashed, left in our pollution to die; but the
   Son of God passed by and saw us in the greatness of our ruin. In his
   wondrous love our Lord Jesus put us under a new covenant, a covenant of
   which he became the second Adam, a covenant which ran on this wise,"If
   thou shalt render perfect obedience and vindicate my justice, then
   those who are in thee shall not perish, but they shall live because
   thou livest." Now, our Lord Jesus, our Surety and Covenant Head, has
   fulfilled his portion of the covenant engagement, and the compact
   stands as a bond of pure promise without condition or risk. Those who
   are participants in that covenant cannot invalidate it, for it never
   did depend upon them, but only upon him who was and is their federal
   head and representative before God. Of Jesus the demand was made and he
   met it. By him man's side of the covenant was undertaken and fulfilled,
   and now no condition remains; it is solely made up of promises which
   are unconditional and sure to all the seed. To-day believers are not
   under the covenant of "If thou doest this thou shalt live," but under
   that new covenant which says, "Their sins and their iniquities will I
   remember no more." It is not now "Do and live," but "Live and do;" we
   think not of merit and reward, but of free grace producing holy
   practice as the result of gratitude. What law could not do, grace has
   accomplished.

   We ought never to forget this bottom of everything, this making of all
   things new by the fashioning of a new covenant, so that we have come
   out from under the bondage of the law and the ruin of the fall, and we
   have entered upon the liberty of Christ, into acceptance with God, and
   into the boundless joy of being saved in the Lord with an everlasting
   salvation, so that we "shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
   without end." You young people, as soon as ever you know the Lord, I
   exhort you to study well that word "covenant." It is a key-word opening
   the treasures of revelation. He that rightly understands the difference
   between the two covenants has the foundation of sound theology laid in
   his mind. This is the clue of many a maze, the open sesame of many a
   mystery. "I make all things new," begins with the bringing in of a
   better hope by virtue of a better covenant.

   The foundation being made new, the Lord Jesus Christ has set before us
   a new way of life, which grows out of that covenant. The old way of
   life was, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." There
   they are, perfect, and holy, and just, and good; but, alas, dear
   friends, you and I have broken the commandments. We dare not say that
   we have kept the ten commands from our youth up; on the contrary, we
   are compelled by our consciences to confess that in spirit and in
   heart, if not in act, we have continually broken the law of God; and we
   are therefore under sin and condemnation, and there is no hope for us
   by the works of the law. For this reason the gospel sets before us
   another way, and says, "It is of faith, that it might be by grace."
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Hence we
   read of being "justified by faith," and being made acceptable to God by
   faith. To be "justified" means being made really just: though we were
   guilty in ourselves we are regarded as just by virtue of what the Lord
   Jesus Christ has done for us. Thus we fell into condemnation through
   another, and we rise into justification through another. It is written,
   "By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
   bear their iniquities"; and this scripture is fulfilled in all those
   who believe in the Lord Jesus unto eternal life. Our path to eternal
   glory is the road of faith,"The just shall live by faith." We are
   "accepted in the Beloved" when we believe in him whom God has set forth
   to be our righteousness. "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh
   be justified in his sight"; but we are "justified freely by his grace
   through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

   What a blessing it is for you and for me that Jesus has made all things
   new in that respect! I am glad that I have not to stand here and say,
   "My dear hearers, do this and do that, and you will be saved": because
   you would not do as you were commanded; for your nature is weak and
   wicked. But I have to bid you

   "Lay your deadly doing down, down at Jesus' feet;
   Stand in him, in him alone, gloriously complete."

   I trust you will accept this most gracious and suitable way of
   salvation. It is most glorious to God and safe to you: do not neglect
   so great salvation. After you have believed unto life you will go and
   do all manner of holy deeds as the result of your new life; but do not
   attempt them with the view of earning life. Prompted no longer by the
   servile and selfish motive of saving yourself, but by gratitude for the
   fact that you are saved, you will rise to virtue and true holiness.
   Faith has brought us into the possession of an indefeasible salvation;
   and now for the love we bear our Savior, we must obey him and become
   "zealous for good works."

   By grace every believer is brought into a new relationship with God.
   Let us rejoice in this: "Thou art no more a servant but a son, and if a
   son, then an heir of God through Christ." Oh you who are now children,
   you were servants a little while ago! Some of you, my hearers, are
   servants now, and as servants I would bid you expect your wages. Alas,
   your service has been no service, but a rebellion; and if you get no
   more wages than you deserve you will be cast away for ever. You ought
   to be thankful to God that he has not yet recompensed youthat he has
   not dealt with you after your sins, nor rewarded you according to your
   iniquities. Do you not also know, you servants, what is likely to
   happen to you as servants? What do you yourself do with a bad servant?
   You say to him, "There are your wages: go." "A servant abideth not in
   the house for ever." You, too, will be driven out of your religious
   profession and your period of probation, and where will you go? The
   wilderness of destruction lies before you. Oh that you may not be left
   to wander with Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman!

   "Behold, I make all things new," says Jesus, and then he makes his
   people into sons. When we are made sons do we work for wages? We have
   no desire for any present payment, for our Father says to us, "Son,
   thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine"; and, moreover, we
   have the inheritance in reversion, entailed by the covenant. We cannot
   demand the servile wage because we have already all that our Father
   possesses. He has given us himself and his all-sufficiency for our
   everlasting portion; what more can we desire? He will never drive us
   from his house. Never has our great Father disowned one of his sons. It
   cannot be; his loving heart is too much bound up in his own adopted
   ones. That near and dear relationship which is manifested in adoption
   and regeneration, binds the child of God to the great Father's heart in
   such a way that he will never cast him off, nor suffer him to perish. I
   rejoice in the fact that we are no longer bond-slaves but sons.
   "Behold," says Christ, "I make all things new."

   There has also been wrought in us by the work of the Holy Spirit a new
   life, with all the new feelings, and new desires, and new works which
   go therewith. The tree is made new, and the fruits are new in
   consequence. That same Spirit of God who taught us that we were ruined
   in our old estate, led us gently by the hand till we came to the New
   Covenant promise and looked to Jesus, and saw in him the full atonement
   for sin. Happy discovery for us; it was the kindling of new life in us.
   From the moment that we trusted in Jesus, a new life darted into our
   spirit. I am not going to say which is first, the new birth, or faith,
   or repentance. Nobody can tell which spoke of a wheel moves first; it
   moves as a whole. The moment the divine life comes into the heart we
   believe: the moment we believe the eternal life is there. We repent
   because we believe, and believe while we repent. The life that we live
   in the flesh is no longer according to the lusts of the world, but we
   live by faith in the Son of God, who loved us and gave himself for us.
   Our spiritual life is a new-born thing, the creation of the Spirit of
   life. We have, of course, that natural life which is sustained by food,
   and evidenced by our breath; but there is another life within which is
   not seen of men, nor fed by the provisions of earth. We are conscious
   of having been quickened, for we were dead once, and we know it; but
   now we have passed from death into life, and we know it quite as
   certainly. A new and higher motive sways us now; for we seek not self
   but God. Another hand grasps the tiller and steers our ship in a new
   course. New desires are felt to which we were strangers in our former
   state. New fears are mighty within us,holy fears which once we should
   have ridiculed. New hopes are in us, bright and sure, such as we did
   not even desire to know when we lived a mere carnal life. We are not
   what we were: we are new, and have begun a new career. We are not what
   we shall be, but assuredly we are not what we used to be. As for
   myself, my consciousness of being a new man in Christ Jesus is often as
   sharp and crisp as my consciousness of being in existence. I know I am
   not only and solely what I was by my first birth; I feel within myself
   another lifea second and a higher vitality which has often to contend
   with my lower self, and by that very contention makes me conscious of
   its existence. This new principle is, from day to day, gathering
   strength, and winning the victory. It has its hand upon the throat of
   the old sinful nature, and it shall eventually trample it like dust
   beneath its feet. I feel this within me: do not you? [A loud voice,
   "Ay! Ay!"] Since you feel this, I know you can say to-night that Jesus
   Christ, who sits on the throne, makes all things new. Blessed be his
   name. [Several voices, "Amen."] It needed the Lord himself to make such
   as we are new. None but a Savior on the throne could accomplish it; and
   therefore let him have the glory of it.

   I believe that Jesus Christ has in some of you not only made you new,
   but made everything new to you. "Ah," said one, when she was converted,
   "either the world is greatly altered, or else I am." Why, either you
   and I are turned upside down in nature, or the world is. We used to
   think it a wise world once, but how foolish we think it now! We used to
   think it a brave gay world that showed us real happiness, but we are no
   longer deceived, we have seen Madame Bubble's painted face in its true
   deformity. "The world is crucified unto me," said Paul; and many of you
   can say the same. It is like a gibbeted criminal hung up to die.
   Meanwhile, there is no love lost, for the world thinks much the same of
   us, and therein we can sympathize with Paul when he said, "I am
   crucified unto the world." What a transformation grace makes in all
   things within our little world! In our heart there is a new heaven and
   a new earth. What a change in our joys! Ah, we blush to think what our
   joys used to be; but they are heavenly now. We are equally ashamed of
   our hates and our prejudices: but these have vanished once for all.
   Why, now we love the very things we once despised, and our heart flies
   as with wings after that which once it detested. What a different Bible
   we have now! Blessed book; it is just the same, but oh, how differently
   do we read it. The mercy-seat, what a different place it is now! Our
   wretched, formal prayers, if we did offer themwhat a mockery they
   were! But now we draw near to God and speak with our Father with
   delight. We have access to him by the new and living way. The house of
   God, how different it is from what it used to be! We love to be found
   within its walls, and we feel delighted to join in the praises of the
   Lord. I do not know that I admire brethren for calling out in the
   service as our friends did just now; but I certainly do not blame them.
   A person shook hands with me one day this week who does not often hear
   me preach, and he expressed to me his unbounded delight in listening to
   the doctrine of the grace of God, and he added, "Surely your people
   must be made of stone." "Why?" said I. "Why!" he replied, "if they were
   not they would all get up and shout 'Hallelujah' when you are preaching
   such a glorious gospel. I wanted to shout badly on Sunday morning; but
   as everybody else was quiet, I held my tongue." For which I thought he
   was a wise man: but yet I do not wonder if men who have tasted of the
   grace of God, and feel that the Lord has done great things for them,
   whereof they are glad, do feel like crying out for joy. Let us have a
   little indulgence to-night. Now, you that feel that you must cry aloud
   for joy, join with me and cry "Hallelujah" [A great number of voices
   cried, "Hallelujah!"] Hallelujah, glory be to our Redeemer's name. Why
   should we not lift up our voices in his praise? We will. He has put a
   new song into our mouths, and we must sing it. The mountains and the
   hills break forth before us into singing, and we cannot be dumb. Praise
   is our ever new delight; let us baptize the new year into a sea of it.
   In praise we will vie with angels and archangels, for they are not so
   indebted to grace as we are.

   "Never did angels taste above
   Redeeming grace and dying love."

   But we have tasted these precious things, and unto God we will lift up
   our loudest song for ever and for ever.

   The process which we have roughly described as taking place in
   ourselves is in other forms going on in the world. The whole creation
   is travailing, all time is groaning, providence is working, grace is
   striving, and all for one end,the bringing forth of the new and better
   age. It is coming. It is coming. Not in vain did John write, "And I saw
   a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth
   were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy
   city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a
   bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven
   saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell
   with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
   them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their
   eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
   neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
   away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
   new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and
   faithful." What a prospect does all this open up to the believer! Our
   future is glorious; let not our present be gloomy.

   II. But now, in the text there is AN EARNEST CALL for us to consider
   this work of our Lord. He that sitteth on the throne saith, "Behold, I
   make all things new." Why should he call upon us to behold it? All his
   works deserve study: "The works of the Lord are great, sought out of
   all them that have pleasure therein." Whatsoever the Lord doeth is full
   of wisdom, and the wise will search into it. But when the Lord himself
   sets up a light, and calls us to pause, and look, we cannot help
   beholding.

   I think that the Lord Jesus Christ especially calls us to consider
   this, that we may, according to our condition, derive profit from it.

   First, if the Lord Jesus makes all things new, then a new birth is
   possible to you, dear friend, though you have come here to-night in a
   wrong state of heart, with your sins upon you, binding you fast. There
   is enough of light in your soul for you to know that you are in
   darkness; and you are saying to yourself, "Oh, that I could reach to
   better things! I hear how these people of God cry 'Hallelujah!' at what
   Christ has done for them. Can he do the same for me?" Listen! He that
   sitteth on the throne says in infinite condescension to you upon the
   dunghill, "Behold, I make all things new." There is nothing so old that
   he cannot make it newnothing so fixed and habitual that he cannot
   change it. Dost thou not know, dear heart, that the Spirit of God has
   regenerated men and women quite as far gone as thou art? They have been
   as deeply sunken in sin, and as hardened by habit as ever thou canst
   be, and they thought themselves given up to despair, as thou thinkest
   thyself to be; yet the Spirit of God carried out the will of the Lord
   Christ, and made them new. Why should he not make thee new? Let every
   thief know that the dying thief entered heaven by faith in Jesus. Let
   every one that has been a great transgressor remember how Manasseh
   received a new heart, and repented of his evil deeds. Let every one who
   has left the paths of purity remember how the woman that was a sinner
   loved much, because much had been forgiven her. I cannot doubt of the
   possibility of your salvation, my dear friend, whenever I think of my
   own. A more determined, obstinate rebel than I could scarce have been.
   Child as I was, and under holy restraint as I was, so as to be kept
   from gross outward sin, I had a powerful inner nature which would not
   brook control. I strove hard and kicked against the pricks. I labored
   to win heaven by self-righteousness, and this is as real a rebellion as
   open sin. But, oh, the grace of God, how it can tame us! How it can
   turn us! With no bit or bridle, but with a blessed suavity of
   tenderness, it turns us according to its pleasure. O anxious one, it
   can turn you! I want, then, to drop into your earand may the Spirit of
   God drop into your heartthis word, you may be born again. The Lord can
   work a radical change in you. He that sitteth on the throne can do for
   you what you cannot do for yourself; and, as he made you once, and you
   became marred by sin, he can new make you; for he saith. "Behold, I
   make all things new."

   Furthermore, you will say to me, "I desire to lead a new life." To do
   this you must be new yourself; for as the man is, so his life will be.
   If you leave the fountain foul the streams cannot be pure. Renewal must
   begin with the heart. Dear friend, the Lord Jesus Christ is able to
   make your life entirely new. We have seen many transformed into new
   parents and new children. Friends have said in wonder, "What a change
   in John! What an alteration in Ellen!" We have seen men become new
   husbands, and women become new wives. They are the same persons, and
   yet not the same. Grace works a very deep, striking, and lasting
   change. Ask those that have had to live with converted people whether
   the transformation has not been marvellous. Christ makes new servants,
   new masters, new friends, new brothers, new sisters. The Lord can so
   change us that we shall scarcely know ourselves: I mean he can thus
   change you who now despair of yourselves. O dear hearts, there is no
   absolute necessity that you should always go downward in evil till you
   descend to hell. There is a hand that can give you a gravitation in the
   opposite direction. It would be a wonderful thing if Niagara when it is
   in its full descent should be made to leap upwards, and the St.
   Lawrence and the sea should begin to climb backward to the lakes. Yet
   God could do even that; and so he can reverse the course of your fallen
   nature, and make you act as a new man. He can stay the tide of your
   raging passion; he can make you, who were like a devil, become as an
   angel of God; for thus he speaks from the throne of his eternal
   majesty, "Behold, I make all things new." Come and lay yourself down at
   his feet, and ask him to make you new; I beseech you, do this at once!

   "Well, I am going to mend myself," says one: "I have taken the pledge,
   and I am going to be honest, and chaste, and religious." This is
   commendable resolving, but what will come of it? You will break your
   resolutions, and be nothing bettered by your attempts at reform. I
   expect that if you go into the business of mending yourself, you will
   be like the man who had an old gun, and took it to the gunsmith, and
   the gunsmith said, "Well, this would make a very good gun if it had a
   new stock, and a new lock, and a new barrel." So you would make a very
   good man by mending, if you had a new heart, and new life, and were
   made new all over, so that there was not a bit of the old stuff left.
   It will be easier, a great deal, depend upon it, even for God to make
   you new, than to mend you; for the fact is that "the carnal mind is
   enmity against God," and is not reconciled to God, neither, indeed, can
   be; so that mending will not answer; you must be made anew. "Ye must be
   born again." What is wanted is that you should be made a new creature
   in Christ Jesus. You must be dead and buried with Christ, and risen
   again in him; and then all will be well, for he will have made all
   things new. I pray God to bless these feeble words of mine for the
   helping of some of his chosen out of the darkness of their fears.

   But now, beloved, farther than this. There are children of God who need
   this text, "Behold, I make all things new," whose sigh is that they so
   soon grow dull and weary in the ways of God, and therefore they need
   daily renewing. A brother said to me some time ago, "Dear sir, I
   frequently grow very sleepy in my walk with God. I seem to lose the
   freshness of it; and especially by about Saturday I get I hardly know
   where; but," he added, "as for you, whenever I hear you, you seem to be
   all alive and full of fresh energy." "Ah, my dear brother," I said,
   "that is because you do not know much about me." That was all I was
   able to say just then. I thank God for keeping me near himself; but I
   am as weak, and stale, and unprofitable as any of you. I say this with
   very great shameshame for myself, and shame for the brother who led me
   to make the confession. We are both wrong. With all our fresh springs
   in God, we ought to be always full of new life. Our love to Christ
   ought to be every minute as if it were new-born. Our zeal for God ought
   to be as fresh as if we had just begun to delight in him. "Ay, but it
   is not," says one; and I am sorry I cannot contradict him. After a few
   months a vigorous young Christian will begin to cool down; and those
   who have been long in the ways of God find that final perseverance must
   be a miracle if ever it is to be accomplished, for naturally they tire
   and faint.

   Well, now, dear friends, why do you and I ever get stale and flat? Why
   do we sing,

   "Dear Lord, and shall we ever live
   At this poor dying rate?"

   Why do we have to cry

   "In vain we tune our formal songs,
   In vain we strive to rise;
   Hosannas languish on our tongues,
   And our devotion dies"?

   Why, it is because we get away from him who says, "Behold, I make all
   things new." The straight way to a perpetual newness and freshness of
   holy youth is to go to Christ again, just as we did at the first.

   A better thing still is never to leave him, but to stand for ever at
   the cross-foot delighting yourself in his all-sufficient sacrifice.
   They that are full of the joy of the Lord never find life grow weary.
   They that walk in the light of his countenance can say of the Lord
   Jesus, "Thou hast the dew of thy youth"; and that dew falls upon those
   who dwell with him. Oh, I am sure that if we kept up perpetual
   communion with him, we should keep up a perpetual stream of delights.

   "Immortal joys come streaming down,
   Joys, like his griefs, immense, unknown;"

   but these joys only come from him. We shall be young if we keep with
   the ever young and fresh Beloved, whose locks are bushy and black as a
   raven. He saith, and he performs the saying, "Behold, I make all things
   new."

   He can make that next sermon of yours, my dear brother minister, quite
   new and interesting. He can make that prayer-meeting no longer a dreary
   affair, but quite a new thing to you and all the people. My dear
   sister, next time you go to your class, you may feel as if you had only
   just begun teaching. You will not be at all tired of your godly work,
   but love it better than ever. And you, my dear brother, at the corner
   of the street where you are often interrupted, perhaps, with foul
   language, you will feel that you are pleased with your position of
   self-denial. Getting near to Christ, you will partake in his joy, and
   that joy shall be your strength, your freshness, the newness of your
   life. God grant us to drink of the eternal founts, that we may for ever
   overflow.

   And, further, dear friends, there may be some dear child of God here
   who is conscious that he lives on a very low platform of spiritual
   life, and he knows that the Lord can raise him to a new condition.
   Numbers of Christians seem to live in the marshes always. If you go
   through the valleys of Switzerland, you will find yourself get feverish
   and heavy in spirit, and you will see many idiots, persons with the
   goitre, and people greatly afflicted. Climb the sides of the hills,
   ascend into the Alps, and you will not meet with that kind of thing in
   the pure fresh air. Many Christians are of the sickly-valley breed. Oh
   that they could get up to the high mountains, and be strong!

   I want to say to such, if you have been all your lifetime in bondage,
   you need not remain there any longer; for there is in Jesus the power
   to make all things new, and to lift you into new delights. It will seem
   to be a dead lift to you; but it is within the power of that pierced
   hand to lift you right out of doubt, and fear, and despondency, and
   spiritual lethargy, and weakness, and just to make you now, from this
   day forward, "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."

   Now breathe a silent prayer, dear brother, dear sister, to him who
   makes all things new. "Lord, make thy poor, spiritually sick child to
   be strong in spiritual health." Oh, what a blessing it would be for
   some workers if God would make them strong! All the church would be the
   better because of the way in which the Lord would help them to do their
   work. Why should some of you be living at a penny a day and starving
   yourselves, when your Father would give you to live like princes of the
   blood royal if you would but trust him? I am persuaded that the most of
   us are beggars when we might be millionaires in spiritual things. And
   here is our strength for rising to a nobler state of mind, "Behold I
   make all things new."

   Another application of this truth will be this: "Oh," says one, "I do
   not know what to make of myself. I have had a weary time of late.
   Everything seems to have gone wrong with me. My family cause me great
   anxiety. My business is a thorny maze. My own health is precarious. I
   dread this year. In fact, I dread everything." We will not go on with
   that lamentation, but we will hear the cheering word,"Behold, I make
   all things new." The Lord, in answer to believing prayer, and
   especially in answer to a full resignation to his will is able to make
   all providential surroundings new for you. I have known the Lord on a
   sudden to turn darkness into light, and take away the sackcloth and the
   ashes from his dear children, for "he doth not afflict willingly, nor
   grieve the children of men." Sometimes all this worry is mere
   discontent; and when the child of God gets right himself these
   imaginary troubles vanish like the mist of the morning; but when they
   are real troubles, God can as easily change your condition, dear child
   of God, as he can turn his hand. He can make your harsh and ungodly
   husband to become gentle and gracious. He can bring your children to
   bow at the family altar, and to rejoice with you in Christ. He can
   cause your business to prosper; or, if he does not do that, he can
   strengthen your back to bear the burden of your daily cross. Oh, it is
   wonderful how different a thing becomes when it is taken to God. But
   you want to make it all new yourself; and you fret and you worry, and
   you tease, and you trouble, and you make a burden of yourself. Why not
   leave that off, and in humble prayer take the matter to the Lord, and
   say, "Lord, appear for me, for thou hast said, 'I make all things new.'
   Make my circumstances new"? He is certainly able to turn your captivity
   as he turns the sun when it has reached the southern tropic.

   Come, there is one more application, and that is that the Lord can
   convert those dear friends about whose souls you have been so anxious.
   The Lord who makes all things new can hear your prayers. One of the
   first prayers that I heard to-night in the prayer-meeting was by a dear
   brother that God would save his relatives. Then another with great
   tenderness prayed for his children. I knew it came from an aching
   heart. Some of you have heart-breakers at home: the Lord break their
   hearts. You have grievous trouble because you hear the dearest that you
   have blaspheming the God you love. You know that they are
   Sabbath-breakers, and utterly godless, and you tremble for their
   eternal fate. Certain persons attend this TabernacleI do not see them
   to-nightbut I can say of them that I never enter this pulpit without
   looking to their pews to see whether they are there, and breathing my
   heart to God for them. I forget a great many of you who are saved; but
   I always pray for them. And they will be brought in, I feel assured;
   but, oh, that it may be this year! I liked what a brother said at the
   church-meeting on Monday night, when his brother was introduced to the
   church. (Ah, there he sits.) I asked about his brother's conversion,
   and I said, "I suppose you were surprised to see him converted." He
   said, "I should have been very much surprised if he had not been." "But
   why, my dear brother?" I said. "Because I asked the Lord to convert
   him, and I kept on praying that he might be converted; and I should
   have been very much surprised if he had not been." That is the right
   sort of faith. I should be very much surprised if some of you that come
   here, time after time, are not converted. You shall be: blessed be God.
   We will give him no rest until he hears us. But come! Are we to be
   praying for you, and you not praying for yourselves? Do you not agree
   with our prayers? Oh, I trust you may. But, even if you do not, we
   shall pray for you; and we were sure that you opposed our
   intercessions, and were even angry with them, we should pray all the
   more, for we mean to have you won for Jesus, by the grace of God, and
   you may as well come soon as late. We are bound to have you in the
   church confessing your faith in Jesus. We will never let you go,
   neither will we cease from our importunate prayers until we get an
   answer from the throne, and see you saved. Oh that you would yield on
   this first night of the year to him who can make new creatures of you.
   God grant you may!

   The Lord answer our prayer now, for Jesus' sake, for we seek the
   salvation of every hearer and every reader of this sermon. Amen.

The Ascension and the Second Advent Practically Considered

   (No. 1817)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, December 28th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [2]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold,
   two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of
   Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is
   taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have
   seen him go into heaven." Acts 1:10, 11.

   FOUR GREAT EVENTS shine out brightly in our Savior's story. All
   Christian minds delight to dwell upon his birth, his death, his
   resurrection, and his ascension. These make four rounds in that ladder
   of light, the foot of which is upon the earth, but the top whereof
   reacheth to heaven. We could not afford to dispense with any one of
   those four events, nor would it be profitable for us to forget, or to
   under-estimate the value of any one of them. That the Son of God was
   born of a woman creates in us the intense delight of a brotherhood
   springing out of a common humanity. That Jesus once suffered unto the
   death for our sins, and thereby made a full atonement for us, is the
   rest and life of our spirits. The manger and the cross together are
   divine seals of love. That the Lord Jesus rose again from the dead is
   the warrant of our justification, and also a transcendently delightful
   assurance of the resurrection of all his people, and of their eternal
   life in him. Hath he not said, "Because I live ye shall live also"? The
   resurrection of Christ is the morning star of our future glory. Equally
   delightful is the remembrance of his ascension. No song is sweeter than
   this"Thou hast ascended on high; thou hast led captivity captive, thou
   hast received gifts for men, yea, for the rebellious also, that the
   Lord God might dwell among them."

   Each one of those four events points to another, and they all lead up
   to it: the fifth link in the golden chain is our Lord's second and most
   glorious advent. Nothing is mentioned between his ascent and his
   descent. True, a rich history comes between; but it lies in a valley
   between two stupendous mountains: we step from alp to alp as we journey
   in meditation from the ascension to the second advent. I say that each
   of the previous four events points to it. Had he not come a first time
   in humiliation, born under the law, he could not have come a second
   time in amazing glory "without a sin-offering unto salvation." Because
   he died once we rejoice that he dieth no more, death hath no more
   dominion over him, and therefore he cometh to destroy that last enemy
   whom he hath already conquered. It is our joy, as we think of our
   Redeemer as risen, to feel that in consequence of his rising the trump
   of the archangel shall assuredly sound for the awaking of all his
   slumbering people, when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with
   a shout. As for his ascension, he could not a second time descend if he
   had not first ascended; but having perfumed heaven with his presence,
   and prepared a place for his people, we may fitly expect that he will
   come again and receive us unto himself, that where he is there we may
   be also. I want you, therefore, as in contemplation you pass with
   joyful footsteps over these four grand events, as your faith leaps from
   his birth to his death, and from his resurrection to his ascension, to
   be looking forward, and even hastening unto this crowning fact of our
   Lord's history; for ere long he shall so come in like manner as he was
   seen go up into heaven.

   This morning, in our meditation, we will start from the ascension; and
   if I had sufficient imagination I should like to picture our Lord and
   the eleven walking up the side of Olivet, communing as they went,a
   happy company, with a solemn awe upon them, but with an intense joy in
   having fellowship with each other. Each disciple was glad to think that
   his dear Lord and Master who had been crucified was now among them, not
   only alive but surrounded with a mysterious safety and glory which none
   could disturb. The enemy was as still as a stone: not a dog moved his
   tongue: his bitterest foes made no sign during the days of our Lord's
   after-life below. The company moved onward peacefully towards
   BethanyBethany which they all knew and loved. The Savior seemed drawn
   there at the time of his ascension, even as men's minds return to old
   and well-loved scenes when they are about to depart out of this world.
   His happiest moments on earth had been spent beneath the roof where
   lived Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus. Perhaps it was best
   for the disciples that he should leave them at that place where he had
   been most hospitably entertained, to show that he departed in peace and
   not in anger. There they had seen Lazarus raised from the dead by him
   who was now to be taken up from them: the memory of the triumphant past
   would help the tried faith of the present. There they had heard the
   voice saying, "Loose him, and let him go," and there they might fitly
   see their Lord loosed from all bonds of earthly gravitation that he
   might go to his Father and their Father. The memories of the place
   might help to calm their minds and arouse their spirits to that
   fullness of joy which ought to attend the glorifying of their Lord.

   But they have come to a standstill, having reached the brow of the
   hill. The Savior stands conspicuously in the center of the group, and,
   following upon most instructive discourse, he pronounces a blessing
   upon them. He lifts his pierced hands, and while he is lifting them and
   is pronouncing words of love, he begins to rise from the earth. He has
   risen above them all to their astonishment! In a moment he has passed
   beyond the olives, which seem with their silvery sheen to be lit up by
   his milder radiance. While the disciples are looking, the Lord has
   ascended into mid-air, and speedily he has risen to the regions of the
   clouds. They stand spell-bound with astonishment, and suddenly a bright
   cloud, like a chariot of God, bears him away. That cloud conceals him
   from mortal gaze. Though we have known Christ after the flesh, now
   after the flesh know we him no more. They are riveted to the spot, very
   naturally so: they linger long in the place, they stand with streaming
   eyes, wonder-struck, still looking upward.

   It is not the Lord's will that they should long remain inactive; their
   reverie is interrupted. They might have stood there till wonder
   saddened into fear. As it was, they remained long enough; for the
   angel's words may be accurately rendered, "Why have ye stood, gazing up
   into heaven?"

   Their lengthened gaze needed to be interrupted, and, therefore, two
   shining ones, such as aforetime met the women at the sepulcher, are
   sent to them. These messengers of God appear in human form that they
   may not alarm them, and in white raiment as if to remind them that all
   was bright and joyous; and these white-robed ministers stood with them
   as if they would willingly join their company. As no one of the eleven
   would break silence, the men in white raiment commenced the discourse.
   Addressing them in the usual celestial style, they asked a question
   which contained its own answer, and then went on to tell their message.
   As they had once said to the women, "Why seek ye the living among the
   dead? He is not here, but is risen;" so did they now say, "Ye men of
   Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is
   taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have
   seen him go into heaven." The angels showed their knowledge of them by
   calling them "men of Galilee," and reminded them that they were yet
   upon earth by recalling their place of birth. Brought back to their
   senses, their reverie over, the apostles at once gird up their loins
   for active service; they do not need twice telling, but hasten to
   Jerusalem. The vision of angels has singularly enough brought them back
   into the world of actual life again, and they obey the command, "Tarry
   ye at Jerusalem." They seem to say,the taking up of our Master is not
   a thing to weep about: he has gone to his throne and to his glory, and
   he said it was expedient for us that he should go away. He will now
   send us the promise of the Father; we scarcely know what it will be
   like, but let us, in obedience to his will, make the best of our way to
   the place where he bade us await the gift of power. Do you not see them
   going down the side of Olivet, taking that Sabbath-day's journey into
   the cruel and wicked city without a thought of fear; having no dread of
   the bloodthirsty crew who slew their Lord, but happy in the memory of
   their Lord's exaltation and in the expectation of a wonderful display
   of his power. They held fellowship of the most delightful kind with one
   another, and anon entered into the upper room, where in protracted
   prayer and communion they waited for the promise of the Father. You see
   I have no imagination: I have barely mentioned the incidents in the
   simplest language. Yet try and realize the scene, for it will be
   helpful so to do, since our Lord Jesus is to come in like manner as the
   disciples saw him go up into heaven.

   My first business this morning will be to consider the gentle chiding
   administered by the shining ones:"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
   gazing up unto heaven?" Secondly, the cheering description of our Lord
   which the white-robed messengers used,"This same Jesus"; and then,
   thirdly, the practical truth which they taught"This same Jesus, which
   is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye
   have seen him go into heaven."

   I. First, then, here is A GENTLE CHIDING. It is not sharply uttered by
   men dressed in black who use harsh speech, and upbraid the servants of
   God severely for what was rather a mistake than a fault. No; the
   language is strengthening, yet tender: the fashion of a question allows
   them rather to reprove themselves than to be reproved; and the tone is
   that of brotherly love, and affectionate concern.

   Notice, that what these saintly men were doing seems at first sight to
   be very right. Methinks, if Jesus were among us now we would fix our
   eyes upon him, and never withdraw them. He is altogether lovely, and it
   would seem wicked to yield our eyesight to any inferior object so long
   as he was to be seen. When he ascended up into heaven it was the duty
   of his friends to look upon him. It can never be wrong to look up; we
   are often bidden to do so, and it is even a holy saying of the
   Psalmist, "I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up"; and,
   again, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
   help." If it be right to look up into heaven, it must be still more
   right to look up while Jesus rises to the place of his glory. Surely it
   had been wrong if they had looked anywhere else,it was due to the Lamb
   of God that they should behold him as long as eyes could follow him. He
   is the Sun: where should eyes be turned but to his light? He is the
   King; and where should courtiers within the palace gate turn their eyes
   but to their King as he ascends to his throne? The truth is, there was
   nothing wrong in their looking up into heaven; but they went a little
   further than looking; they stood "gazing." A little excess in right may
   be faulty. It may be wise to look, but foolish to gaze. There is a very
   thin partition sometimes between that which is commendable and that
   which is censurable. There is a golden mean which it is not easy to
   keep. The exact path of right is often as narrow as a razor's edge, and
   he must be wise that doth not err either on the right hand or on the
   left. "Look" is ever the right word. Why, it is "Look unto me, and be
   saved." Look, aye, look steadfastly and intently: be your posture that
   of one "looking unto Jesus," always throughout life. But there is a
   gazing which is not commendable, when the look becomes not that of
   reverent worship, but of an overweening curiosity; when there mingles
   with the desire to know what should be known, a prying into that which
   it is for God's glory to conceal. Brethren, it is of little use to look
   up into an empty heaven. If Christ himself be not visible in heaven,
   then in vain do we gaze, since there is nothing for a saintly eye to
   see. When the person of Jesus was gone out of the azure vault above
   them, and the cloud had effectually concealed him, why should they
   continue to gaze when God himself had drawn the curtain? If infinite
   wisdom had withdrawn the object upon which they desired to gaze, what
   would their gazing be but a sort of reflection upon the wisdom which
   had removed their Lord? Yet it did seem very right. Thus certain things
   that you and I may do may appear right, and yet we may need to be
   chidden out of them into something better: they may be right in
   themselves, but not appropriate for the occasion, not seasonable, nor
   expedient. They may be right up to a point, and then may touch the
   boundary of excess. A steadfast gaze into heaven may be to a devout
   soul a high order of worship, but if this filled up much of our working
   time it might become the idlest form of folly.

   Yet I cannot help adding that it was very natural. I do not wonder that
   the whole eleven stood gazing up, for if I had been there I am sure I
   should have done the same. How struck they must have been with the
   ascent of the Master out of their midst! You would be amazed if some
   one from among our own number now began to ascend into heaven! Would
   you not? Our Lord did not gradually melt away from sight as a phantom,
   or dissolve into thin air as a mere apparition: the Savior did not
   disappear in that way at all, but he rose, and they saw that it was his
   very self that was so rising. His own body, the materialism in which he
   had veiled himself, actually, distinctly, and literally, rose to heaven
   before their eyes. I repeat, the Lord did not dissolve, and disappear
   like a vision of the night, but he evidently rose till the cloud
   intervened so that they could see him no more. I think I should have
   stood looking to the very place where his cloudy chariot had been. I
   know it would be idle to continue so to do, but our hearts often urge
   us on to acts which we could not justify logically. Hearts are not to
   be argued with. Sometimes you stand by a grave where one is buried whom
   you dearly loved: you go there often to weep. You cannot help it, the
   place is precious to you; yet you could not prove that you do any good
   by your visits, perhaps you even injure yourself thereby, and deserve
   to be gently chidden with the question, "why?" It may be the most
   natural thing in the world, and yet it may not be a wise thing. The
   Lord allows us to do that which is innocently natural, but he will not
   have us carry it too far; for then it might foster an evil nature.
   Hence he sends an interrupting messenger: not an angel with a sword, or
   even a rod; but he sends some man in white raiment,I mean one who is
   both cheerful and holy, and he, by his conduct or his words, suggests
   to us the question, "Why stand ye here gazing?" Cui bono? What will be
   the benefit? What will it avail? Thus our understanding being called
   into action, and we being men of thought, we answer to ourselves, "This
   will not do. We must not stand gazing here for ever," and therefore we
   arouse ourselves to get back to the Jerusalem of practical life, where
   in the power of God we hope to do service for our Master.

   Notice, then, that the disciples were doing that which seemed to be
   right and what was evidently very natural, but that it is very easy to
   carry the apparently right and the absolutely natural too far. Let us
   take heed to ourselves, and often ask our hearts, "Why?"

   For, thirdly, notice that what they did was not after all justifiable
   upon strict reason. While Christ was going up it was proper that they
   should adoringly look at him. He might almost have said, "If ye see me
   when I am taken up a double portion of my spirit shall rest upon you."
   They did well to look where he led the way. But when he was gone, still
   to remain gazing was an act which they could not exactly explain to
   themselves, and could not justify to others. Put the question
   thus:"What purpose will be fulfilled by your continuing to gaze into
   the sky? He is gone, it is absolutely certain that he is gone. He is
   taken up, and God himself has manifestly concealed all trace of him by
   bidding yonder cloud sail in between him and you. Why gaze ye still? He
   told you 'I go unto my Father.' Why stand and gaze?" We may under the
   influence of great love, act unwisely. I remember well seeing the
   action of a woman whose only son was emigrating to a distant colony. I
   stood in the station, and I noticed her many tears and her frequent
   embraces of her boy; but the train came up and he entered the carriage.
   After the train had passed beyond the station, she was foolish enough
   to break away from friends who sought to detain her; she ran along the
   platform, leaped down upon the railroad and pursued the flying train.
   It was natural, but it had been better left undone. What was the use of
   it? We had better abstain from acts which serve no practical purpose;
   for in this life we have neither time nor strength to waste in
   fruitless action. The disciples would be wise to cease gazing, for
   nobody would be benefitted by it, and they would not themselves be
   blessed. What is the use of gazing when there is nothing to see. Well,
   then, did the angels ask, "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?"

   Again, put another question,What precept were they obeying when they
   stood gazing up into heaven? If you have a command from God to do a
   certain thing, you need not inquire into the reason of the command, it
   is disobedient to begin to canvas God's will; but when there is no
   precept whatever, why persevere in an act which evidently does not
   promise to bring any blessing? Who bade them stand gazing up into
   heaven? If Christ had done so, then in Christ's name let them stand
   like statues and never turn their heads: but as he had not bidden them,
   why did they do what he had not commanded, and leave undone what he had
   commanded? For he had strictly charged them that they should tarry at
   Jerusalem till they were "endued with power from on high." So what they
   did was not justifiable.

   Here is the practical point for us:What they did we are very apt to
   imitate. "Oh," say you, "I shall never stand gazing up into heaven." I
   am not sure of that. Some Christians are very curious, but not
   obedient. Plain precepts are neglected, but difficult problems they
   seek to solve. I remember one who used always to be dwelling upon the
   vials and seals and trumpets. He was great at apocalyptic symbols; but
   he had seven children, and he had no family prayer. If he had left the
   vials and trumpets and minded his boys and girls, it would have been a
   deal better. I have known men marvellously great upon Daniel, and
   specially instructed in Ezekiel, but singularly forgetful of the
   twentieth of Exodus, and not very clear upon Romans the eighth. I do
   not speak with any blame of such folks for studying Daniel and Ezekiel,
   but quite the reverse; yet I wish they had been more zealous for the
   conversion of the sinners in their neighborhoods, and more careful to
   assist the poor saints. I admit the value of the study of the feet of
   the image in Nebuchadnezzar's vision, and the importance of knowing the
   kingdoms which make up the ten toes, but I do not see the propriety of
   allowing such studies to overlay the common-places of practical
   godliness. If the time spent over obscure theological propositions were
   given to a mission in the dim alley near the good man's house, more
   benefit would come to man and more glory to God. I would have you
   understand all mysteries, brethren, if you could; but do not forget
   that our chief business here below is to cry, "Behold the Lamb!" By all
   manner of means read and search till you know all that the Lord has
   revealed concerning things to come; but first of all see to it that
   your children are brought to the Savior's feet, and that you are
   workers together with God in the upbuilding of his church. The dense
   mass of misery and ignorance and sin which is round about us on every
   side demands all our powers; and if you do not respond to the call,
   though I am not a man in white apparel, I shall venture to say to you,
   "Ye men of Christendom, why stand ye gazing up into the mysteries when
   so much is to be done for Jesus, and you are leaving it undone?" O ye
   who are curious but not obedient, I fear I speak to you in vain, but I
   have spoken. May the Holy Spirit also speak.

   Others are contemplative but not active,much given to the study of
   Scripture and to meditation thereon, but not zealous for good works.
   Contemplation is so scarce in these days that I could wish there were a
   thousand times as much of it; but in the case to which I refer
   everything runs in the one channel of thought, all time is spent in
   reading, in enjoyment, in rapture, in pious leisure. Religion never
   ought to become the subject of selfishness, and yet I fear some treat
   it as if its chief end was spiritual gratification. When a man's
   religion all lies in his saving his own self, and in enjoying holy
   things for his own self; there is a disease upon him. When his judgment
   of a sermon is based upon the one question, "Did it feed me?" it is a
   swinish judgment. There is such a thing as getting a swinish religion
   in which you are yourself first, yourself second, yourself third,
   yourself to the utmost end. Did Jesus ever think or speak in that
   fashion? Contemplation of Christ himself may be so carried out as to
   lead you away from Christ: the recluse meditates on Jesus, but he is as
   unlike the busy self-denying Jesus as well can be. Meditation
   unattended with active service in the spreading of the gospel among
   men, well deserves the rebuke of the angel, "Ye men of Galilee, why
   stand ye gazing up into heaven?"

   Moreover, some are careful and anxious and deliriously impatient for
   some marvellous interposition. We get at times into a sad state of
   mind, because we do not see the kingdom of Christ advancing as we
   desire. I suppose it is with you as it is with me,I begin to fret, and
   I am deeply troubled, and I feel that there is good reason that I
   should be, for truth is fallen in the streets, and the days of
   blasphemy and rebuke are upon us. Then we pine; for the Master is away,
   and we cry, "When will he be back again? Oh, why are his chariots so
   long in coming? Why tarries he through the ages?" Our desires sour into
   impatience, and we commence gazing up into heaven, looking for his
   coming with a restlessness which does not allow us to discharge our
   duty as we should. Whenever anybody gets into that state, this is the
   word, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?"

   In certain cases this uneasiness has drawn to itself a wrong
   expectation of immediate wonders, and an intense desire for
   sign-seeing. Ah me, what fanaticisms come of this! In America years
   ago, one came forward who declared that on such a day the Lord would
   come, and he led a great company to believe his crazy predictions. Many
   took their horses and fodder for two or three days, and went out into
   the woods, expecting to be all the more likely to see all that was to
   be seen when once away from the crowded city. All over the States there
   were people who had made ascension-dresses in which to soar into the
   air in proper costume. They waited, and they waited, and I am sure that
   no text could have been more appropriate for them than this, "Ye men of
   America, why stand ye here gazing up into heaven?" Nothing came of it;
   and yet there are thousands in England and America who only need a
   fanatical leader, and they would run into the like folly. The desire to
   know the times and seasons is a craze with many poor bodies whose
   insanity runs in that particular groove. Every occurrence is a "sign of
   the times": a sign, I may add, which they do not understand. An
   earthquake is a special favourite with them. "Now," they cry, "the Lord
   is coming"; as if there had not been earthquakes of the sort we have
   heard of lately hundreds of times since our Lord went up into heaven.
   When the prophetic earthquakes occur in divers places, we shall know of
   it without the warnings of these brethren. What a number of persons
   have been infatuated by the number of the beast, and have been ready to
   leap for joy because they have found the number 666 in some great one's
   name. Why, everybody's name will yield that number if you treat it
   judiciously, and use the numerals of Greece, Rome, Egypt, China, or
   Timbuctoo. I feel weary with the silly way in which some people make
   toys out of Scripture, and play with texts as with a pack of cards.
   Whenever you meet with a man who sets up to be a prophet, keep out of
   his way in the future; and when you hear of signs and wonders, turn you
   to your Lord, and in patience possess your souls. "The just shall live
   by his faith." There is no other way of living among wild enthusiasts.
   Believe in God, and ask not for miracles and marvels, or the knowledge
   of times and seasons. To know when the Lord will restore the kingdom is
   not in your power. Remember that verse which I read just now in your
   hearing,"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons." If I
   were introduced into a room where a large number of parcels were stored
   up, and I was told that there was something good for me, I should begin
   to look for that which had my name upon it, and when I came upon a
   parcel and I saw in pretty big letters, "It is not for you," I should
   leave it alone. Here, then, is a casket of knowledge marked, "It is not
   for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in
   his own power." Cease to meddle with matters which are concealed, and
   be satisfied to know the things which are clearly revealed.

   II. Secondly, I want you to notice THE CHEERING DESCRIPTION which these
   bright spirits give concerning our Lord. They describe him thus,"This
   same Jesus."

   I appreciate the description the more because it came from those who
   knew him. "He was seen of angels"; they had watched him all his life
   long, and they knew him, and when they, having just seen him rise to
   his Father and his God, said of him, "This same Jesus," then I know by
   an infallible testimony that he was the same, and that he is the same.

   Jesus is gone but he still exists. He has left us, but he is not dead;
   he has not dissolved into nothing like the mist of the morning. "This
   same Jesus" is gone up unto his Father's throne, and he is there to-day
   as certainly as he once stood at Pilate's bar. As surely as he did hang
   upon the cross, so surely does he, the self-same man, sit upon the
   throne of God and reign over creation. I like to think of the positive
   identity of the Christ in the seventh heaven with the Christ in the
   lowest deeps of agony. The Christ they spat upon is now the Christ
   whose name the cherubim and seraphim are hymning day without night. The
   Christ they scourged is he before whom principalities and powers
   delight to cast their crowns. Think of it and be glad this morning; and
   do not stand gazing up into heaven after a myth or a dream. Jesus
   lives; mind that you live also. Do not loiter as if you had nothing at
   all to do, or as if the kingdom of God had come to an end because Jesus
   is gone from the earth, as to his bodily presence. It is not all over;
   he still lives, and he has given you a work to do till he comes.
   Therefore, go and do it.

   "This same Jesus"I love that word, for "Jesus" means a Savior. Oh, ye
   anxious sinners here present, the name of him who has gone up into his
   glory is full of invitation to you! Will you not come to "this same
   Jesus"? This is he who opened the eyes of the blind and brought forth
   the prisoners out of the prison-house. He is doing the same thing
   to-day. Oh that your eyes may see his light! He that touched the
   lepers, and that raised the dead, is the same Jesus still, able to save
   to the uttermost. Oh that you may look and live! You have only to come
   to him by faith, as she did who touched the hem of his garment; you
   have but to cry to him as the blind man did whose sight he restored;
   for he is the same Jesus, bearing about with him the same tender love
   for guilty men, and the same readiness to receive and cleanse all that
   come to him by faith.

   "This same Jesus." Why, that must have meant that he who is in heaven
   is the same Christ who was on earth, but it must also mean that he who
   is to come will be the same Jesus that went up into heaven. There is no
   change in our blessed Master's nature, nor will there ever be. There is
   a great change in his condition:

   "The Lord shall come, but not the same
   As once in lowliness he came,
   humble man before his foes,
   A weary man, and full of woes."

   He will be "the same Jesus" in nature though not in condition: he will
   possess the same tenderness when he comes to judge, the same gentleness
   of heart when all the glories of heaven and earth shall gird his brow.
   Our eye shall see him in that day, and we shall recognize him not only
   by the nail-prints, but by the very look of his countenance, by the
   character that gleams from that marvellous face; and we shall say,
   "'Tis he! 'tis he! the self-same Christ that went up from the top of
   Olivet from the midst of his disciples." Go to him with your troubles,
   as you would have done when he was here. Look forward to his second
   coming without dread. Look for him with that joyous expectancy with
   which you would welcome Jesus of Bethany, who loved Mary, and Martha,
   and Lazarus.

   On the back of that sweet title came this question, "Why stand ye here
   gazing into heaven?" They might have said, "We stay here because we do
   not know where to go. Our Master is gone." But oh, it is the same
   Jesus, and he is coming again, so go down to Jerusalem and get to work
   directly. Do not worry yourselves; no grave accident has occurred; it
   is not a disaster that Christ has gone, but an advance in his work.
   Despisers tell us nowadays, "Your cause is done for! Christianity is
   spun out! Your divine Christ is gone; we have not seen a trace of his
   miracle-working hand, nor of that voice which no man could rival." Here
   is our answer: We are not standing gazing up into heaven, we are not
   paralyzed because Jesus is away. He lives, the great Redeemer lives;
   and though it is our delight to lift up our eyes because we expect his
   coming, it is equally our delight to turn our heavenly gazing into an
   earthward watching, and to go down into the city, and there to tell
   that Jesus is risen, that men are to be saved by faith in him, and that
   whosoever believeth in him shall have everlasting life. We are not
   defeated, far from it: his ascension is not a retreat, but an advance.
   His tarrying is not for want of power, but because of the abundance of
   his long-suffering. The victory is not questionable. All things work
   for it; all the hosts of God are mustering for the final charge. This
   same Jesus is mounting his white horse to lead forth the armies of
   heaven, conquering and to conquer.

   III. Our third point is this, THE GREAT PRACTICAL TRUTH. This truth is
   not one that is to keep us gazing into heaven, but one that is to make
   each of us go to his house to render earnest service. What is it?

   Why, first, that Jesus in gone into heaven. Jesus is gone! Jesus is
   gone! It sounds like a knell. Jesus is taken up from you into
   heaven!that sounds like a marriage peal. He is gone, but he is gone up
   to the hills whence he can survey the battle; up to the throne, from
   which he can send us succour. The reserve forces of the omnipotent
   stood waiting till their Captain came, and now that he is come into the
   centre of the universe, he can send legions of angels, or he can raise
   up hosts of men for the help of his cause. I see every reason for going
   down into the world and getting to work, for he is gone up into heaven
   and "all power is given unto him in heaven and in earth." Is not that a
   good argument"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptising them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"?

   Jesus will come again. That is another reason for girding our loins,
   because it is clear that he has not quitted the fight, nor deserted the
   field of battle. Our great Captain is still heading the conflict; he
   has ridden into another part of the field, but he will be back again,
   perhaps in the twinkling of an eye. You do not say that a commander has
   given up the campaign because it is expedient that he should withdraw
   from your part of the field. Our Lord is doing the best thing for his
   kingdom in going away. It was in the highest degree expedient that he
   should go, and that we should each one receive the Spirit. There is a
   blessed unity between Christ the King and the commonest soldier in the
   ranks. He has not taken his heart from us, nor his care from us, nor
   his interest from us: he is bound up heart and soul with his people,
   and their holy warfare, and this is the evidence of it, "Behold, I come
   quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his
   work shall be."

   Then, moreover, we are told in the textand this in a reason why we
   should get to our workthat he is coming in like manner as he departed.
   Certain of the commentators do not seem to understand English at all.
   "He which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner
   as you have seen him go into heaven,"this, they say, relates to his
   spiritual coming at Pentecost. Give anybody a grain of sense, and do
   they not see that a spiritual coming is not a coming in the same manner
   in which he went up into heaven? There is an analogy, but certainly not
   a likeness between the two things. Our Lord was taken up; they could
   see him rise: he will come again, and "every eye shall see him." He
   went up not in spirit, but in person: he will come down in person.
   "This same Jesus shall so come in like manner." He went up as a matter
   of fact: not in poetic figure and spiritual symbol, but as a matter of
   fact,"This same Jesus" literally went up. "This same Jesus" will
   literally come again. He will descend in clouds even as he went up in
   clouds; and "he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth" even as
   he stood aforetime. He went up to heaven unopposed; no high priests,
   nor scribes, nor Pharisees, nor even one of the rabble opposed his
   ascension; it were ridiculous to suppose that they could; and when he
   comes a second time none will stand against him. His adversaries shall
   perish; as the fat of rams shall they melt away in his presence. When
   he cometh he shall break rebellious nations with a rod of iron, for his
   force shall be irresistible in that day.

   Brethren, do not let anybody spiritualize away all this from you. Jesus
   is coming as a matter of fact, therefore go down to your sphere of
   service as a matter of fact. Get to work and teach the ignorant, win
   the wayward, instruct the children, and everywhere tell out the sweet
   name of Jesus. As a matter of fact, give of your substance and don't
   talk about it. As a matter of fact, consecrate your daily life to the
   glory of God. As a matter of fact, live wholly for your Redeemer. Jesus
   is not coming in a sort of mythical, misty, hazy way, he is literally
   and actually coming, and he will literally and actually call upon you
   to give an account of your stewardship. Therefore, now, to-day,
   literally not symbolically, personally and not by deputy, go out
   through that portion of the world which you can reach, and preach the
   gospel to every creature according as you have opportunity.

   For this is what the men in white apparel meantbe ready to meet your
   coming Lord. What is the way to be ready to meet Jesus? If it is the
   same Jesus that went away from us who is coming, then let us be doing
   what he was doing before he went away. If it is the same Jesus that is
   coming we cannot possibly put ourselves into a posture of which he will
   better approve than by going about doing good. If you would meet him
   with joy, serve him with earnestness. If the Lord Jesus Christ were to
   come to-day I should like him to find me at my studying, praying, or
   preaching. Would you not like him to find you in your Sunday-school, in
   your class, or out there at the corner of the street preaching, or
   doing whatever you have the privilege of doing in his name? Would you
   meet your Lord in idleness? Do not think of it. I called one day on one
   of our members, and she was whitening the front steps. She got up all
   in confusion; she said, "Oh dear, sir, I did not know you were coming
   to-day, or I would have been ready." I replied, "Dear friend, you could
   not be in better trim than you are: you are doing your duty like a good
   housewife, and may God bless you." She had no money to spare for a
   servant, and she was doing her duty by keeping the home tidy: I thought
   she looked more beautiful with her pail beside her than if she had been
   dressed according to the latest fashion. I said to her, "When the Lord
   Jesus Christ comes suddenly, I hope he will find me doing as you were
   doing, namely, fulfilling the duty of the hour." I want you all to get
   to your pails without being ashamed of them. Serve the Lord in some way
   or other; serve him always; serve him intensely; serve him more and
   more. Go to-morrow and serve the Lord at the counter, or in the
   workshop, or in the field. Go and serve the Lord by helping the poor
   and the needy, the widow and the fatherless; serve him by teaching the
   children, especially by endeavoring to train your own children. Go and
   hold a temperance meeting, and show the drunkard that there is hope for
   him in Christ, or go to the midnight meeting and let the fallen woman
   know that Jesus can restore her. Do what Jesus has given you the power
   to do, and then, ye men of Britain, ye will not stand gazing up into
   heaven, but you will wait upon the Lord in prayer, and you will receive
   the Spirit of God, and you will publish to all around the doctrine of
   "Believe and live." Then when he comes he will say to you, "Well done,
   good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." So may
   his grace enable us to do. Amen.

                   The Song of a City, and the Pearl of Peace

   A Sermon

   (No. 1818)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, January 4th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [3]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
   because he trusteth in thee."--Isaiah 26:3

   This is no dry, didactic statement, but a verse from a song. We are
   among the poets of revelation, who did not compose ballads for the
   passing hour, but made sonnets for the people of God to sing in after
   days. I quote to you a stanza from the song of a city. Judah has not
   aforetime thus chanted before her God, but she has much to learn, and
   one day she shall learn this psalm also:--"We have a strong city;
   salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks." Into the open
   country the adversary easily advances, but walled cities are a check
   upon the invading foe. Those people who had been hurried to and from as
   captives, and had frequently been robbed of their property by invaders,
   were glad when they saw builded among them a city, a well-defended
   city, which should be the centre of their race, and the shield of their
   nation.

   This song of a city may, however, belong to us as much as to the men of
   Judah, and we may throw into it a deeper sense of which they were not
   aware. We were once unguarded from spiritual evil, and we spent our
   days in constant fear; but the Lord has found for us a city of defence,
   a castle of refuge. We have a burgess-ship in the new Jerusalem which
   is the mother of us all; and within that strong city we dwell securely.
   Let us sing this morning, "We have a strong city." The man that hath
   come into fellowship with God through the atoning sacrifice, hath
   gotten into a place of perfect safety, where he may dwell, ay, dwell
   for ever, without fear of assault. We are no longer hunted by hosts of
   fears, and trodden down by dark despairs; but "We have a strong city"
   which overawes the foe, and quiets ourselves. Our gospel hymns are the
   songs of men who, in the truest sense, have seen an end of alarm, by
   accepting God's provision against trouble of heart.

   Observe how the song goes on to dilate upon the city's strength.
   "Salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks." Our refuge will
   repay a close examination. We are doubly defended. Its lofty walls are
   the mainstay of a city's security; when they are strong, and high, they
   keep out the foe, whether he assail by scaling-ladder, or
   battering-engine. Outside the wall, on the other side of the moat, lies
   what is called the bulwark; the earthwork where, in times of peace, the
   citizens delight to take their walks. The bulwark of their confidence
   is the boulevard of their communion. The Lord our God has set ring upon
   ring, defence upon defence, around His people. All the powers of
   providence and grace protect the saints. Material and spiritual forces
   alike surround her. The Lord keeps His people doubly fenced by walls
   and bulwarks, and hence He speaks of a double peace. "Thou wilt keep
   him in peace, peace," saith the Hebrew. God does nothing by halves, but
   everything by doubles. His salvation is decreed and appointed, and this
   is made the basis for the unbroken serenity of all His chosen.

   The song, however, does not end with verses concerning the city, but it
   conducts us within its walls. "Open ye the gates, that the righteous
   nation which keepeth the truth may enter in." Entrance into this grace,
   wherein we stand, is a choice privilege. The greatest joy of true
   godliness lies in our being able to enter into it. If the City of God
   were shut against us, it were sad, indeed, for us. If, to-day, you and
   I were outside of her, of what value would her walls and bulwarks be to
   us? Whatever God has done to His people, it is just so much additional
   sorrow rather than increased joy to ourselves if we are not partakers
   therein. That there should be a Christ, and that I should be
   Christless; that there should be a cleansing, and I should remain foul;
   that there should be a Father's love, and I should be an alien; that
   there should be a heaven, and I should be cast into hell, is grief
   embittered, sorrow aggravated. Come, then, let us sing of personal
   entrance into the City of God. The music and the feasting are not
   outside the door: to enjoy them we must enter in. Our citizenship is
   now in heaven. Nothing is barred against us, for the Son of David has
   set before us an open door, and no man can shut it. Let us not neglect
   our opportunities. Let it not be said, "They could not enter in because
   of unbelief." No, let it be ours to sing of salvation because we enjoy
   it to the full. Let our music never cease.

   Now, when we get as far as this,--a strong city, and a city into which
   we have entered, we are still further glad to learn who the keeper and
   garrison of that city may be, for a city needs to be kept while there
   are so many foes abroad. To render all secure there needs to be some
   leader and commander for the people, who has strength with which to man
   the walls, and drive off besiegers. Our text tells us how securely this
   strong city will be held--so securely that none of her citizens shall
   ever be disturbed in heart,--"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
   whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee."

   Permit me to remind you again that my text is the verse of a song. I
   earnestly desire you to feel like singing all the time while I am
   preaching, and let the words of the text ring in your heart with deep
   mysterious chimes, as of a land beyond these clouds and
   tempests,--"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
   on thee: because he trusteth in thee." I do not want you to be
   thinking, "I wish that the Lord would keep me in peace;" I would have
   you now enter into rest before the Lord. Do not say, "I am fretting and
   worrying, because I cannot reach this peace;" but pray to enjoy it this
   morning. O Lord and Giver of peace, vouchsafe it to our faith at once!
   O ye trustful ones, enter at once into the opened gates of the city of
   peace, and then bless God that you cannot be driven out again, for the
   Lord promises to be your garrison and safeguard. May the Holy Spirit,
   who is the Comforter, and whose fruit is peace, now work peace in each
   of us!

   I. First, we are going to answer this question as best we can, WHAT IS
   THIS PERFECT PEACE? The text in the original, as I have told you,
   is--"Thou wilt keep him in peace, peace." It is the Hebrew way of
   expressing emphatic peace; true and real peace; double peace, peace of
   great depth and vast extent. Many of you know what it is; and you will
   probably think my answer a very poor one. I shall give the best I can,
   I can do no more; and if you try to make up for my deficiencies, our
   brethren will be gainers. I confess that I cannot to the full describe
   the peace that may be enjoyed if our faith is strong, and our
   confidence in God has reached its appropriate height. We are not
   limited as to quality or measure of this precious thing. Peace is a
   jewel of so rare a price that he only hath valued it aright who has
   sold all that he hath to buy it. Describe it? Nay, verily, there we
   fail.

   This "peace, peace" means, I think, an absence of all war, and of all
   alarm of war. You who can imagine the full meaning of siege, storm,
   sack, and pillage, can also guess the happier state of things when a
   city hears no longer the tramp of armies, when from her ramparts and
   towers no sign of adversary can be discovered; but all is peace. That
   is very much the condition of the people of God when the Lord keepeth
   them in peace. God Himself, at one time, seemed to be against us: the
   ten great cannon of His Law were turned against our walls; all heaven
   and earth mustered for battle; God Himself was against us, at least, so
   conscience reported from her look-out. But, now, at this moment, having
   believed in Jesus Christ, we have entered into rest, and we have
   perfect peace as to our former sins. Who is he that can harm you, O ye
   that are reconciled to God? "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
   "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" We have by faith
   arrived at a state of perfect reconciliation with God. The divine
   Fatherhood has covered us. We inherit the spirit of children, the
   spirit of love and of unquestioning confidence. Everything is quiet,
   for we dwell in our Father's house. Look upward, and you will perceive
   no seat of fiery wrath to shoot devouring flame. Look downward, and you
   discover no hell, for there is no condemnation to them that are in
   Christ Jesus. Look back, and sin is blotted out. Look around, and all
   things work together for good to them that love God. Look beyond, and
   glory shineth through the veil of the future, like the sun through a
   morning's mist. Look outward, and the stones of the field, and the
   beasts of the field, are at peace with us. Look inward, and the peace
   of God, which passeth all understanding, keeps our hearts and minds by
   Christ Jesus. The Lord leadeth us by still waters at such happy times,
   along that road of which we read, "No lion shall be there." If you who
   are believers in Jesus do not usually enjoy this peace, the blame must
   be laid to your own door: you make your own disquietude, for God saith
   to you, "Peace, peace," and He will keep you there if your mind is
   stayed on Him. Happy is he whose conflict is ended, and whose warfare
   is accomplished by faith in Christ Jesus.

   Further, this perfect peace reigns over all things within its circle.
   Not only is no enemy near, but the inhabitants of the city are all at
   rest, and all their affairs are happy. No man can be said to be at
   perfect peace who has any cause of disquietude at all. Yet the child of
   God has this perfect peace according to our Lord's own statement; and,
   therefore, it must be true that the believer is raised above all
   disquietude. "What," say you, "has he not an evil heart of unbelief?"
   Yes, and that demands his watchfulness, but should not create in him
   any kind of terror, for God is greater than our hearts, and where sin
   abounded, grace doth much more abound. The flesh has received its
   death-warrant, and unbelief is but a part of the flesh doomed to die.
   The holy life within us must triumph. "If we believe not, yet he
   abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself." Though we be as yet like the
   smoking flax, we shall soon shine forth, and He will bring forth
   judgment unto victory. "Ah," saith one, "but I have disquietude in my
   family: I have a wild, unruly son; or, I have a sick, pining child, who
   will soon be taken away from my by consumption!" Yes, friend, but if
   your mind is stayed on God, and you can trust God with such matters,
   you should not lose your perfect peace even through this. For, what if
   your heart be troubled? Will that make the consumptive child any the
   stronger? Or will your melancholy be likely to restrain your rebellious
   son? No, but "The just shall live by faith," and shall triumph by
   faith, too. It shall be your strength to bring your sick, and lay them
   at Jesus feet; it shall be your hope to bring your unruly one, and say,
   "Lord, cast out the devil from my child, and let him live unto Thee."
   Nothing ought to avail to break the peace of the believer; the shield
   of faith should quench every fiery dart. For, observe, that your sin is
   forgiven you for Christ's sake, and that is done once for all. Observe,
   that Christ has taken possession of you, and you are His; neither will
   He lose you, but He will hold you single-handed against the world, and
   death, and hell. Observe, too, that your heavenly Father rules in
   providence, giving you what you need, for He has said, "No good thing
   will I withhold from them that walk uprightly." He reigns in power,
   anticipating every danger, for He hath declared, "No weapon that is
   formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise
   against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn." God's peace covers the
   whole extent of the territory. Tell it out through every street of
   Mansoul that the Prince Emmanuel has come, and to every creature within
   the city walls the peace of God is granted, to be possessed with
   gladness and delight.

   We are getting some idea, I trust, of this peace, though words cannot
   fully convey it; we must know it ourselves. Yet it is pleasant to note
   that this peace is deeply real and true. No perfect peace can be
   enjoyed unless every secret cause of fear is met and removed. Whisper
   it at the gates, and in the hostelries, that the city might be taken by
   surprise, and that spies had been seen in the meadows, down by the East
   gate; and straightway the city would be in a ferment. No; peace cannot
   breathe while suspicion haunts the streets. Our peace may be a false
   peace, a fools peace; we may be lulled into a carnal security.
   Politically, nations have become self-confident, have dreamed of peace
   when the forges were ringing with the hammers of war; and so ill has
   happened unto them. Spiritually, there are multitudes of persons who
   think that all is right with their souls, when, indeed, all is wrong,
   for eternity. It is to be feared that some have received a "strong
   delusion, that they should believe a lie." Now, we cannot call that
   perfect peace which lies only on the surface, and will not bear to be
   looked into. We desire a peace which sits in open court, and neither
   blindfolds nor muzzles ambassadors. The peace which requires that there
   should be a hushing-up of this and that is an evil thing. Such is the
   direct opposite of the peace of God. If there be any charge against
   God's people, men are challenged to bring it,--"Who shall lay any thing
   to the charge of God's elect?" The pardon which God gives us is not a
   smothering-up of our sins, nor a blinding of justice. God is as just in
   His pardons as in His punishments. It shall be seen at the last, when
   believers enter into their glory, that they rise there by law, just as
   surely as the lost sink down to hell by law: that is to say, that the
   Lord Jesus Christ hath rendered to the law such recompense by His
   perfect obedience, and His matchless atonement, that it shall be as
   just on God's part to save His elect as to condemn the unbelieving
   world. We claim that our peace is just and right. It may be examined
   and tested; for here we have NO FICTION. If truth is to be found
   beneath the stars, it is in the peace which come through the precious
   blood of the Son of God. The peace which God gives goes through the
   very bottom of things, and brings us into the eternal harmonies.

   We may gaze upon this truth with the most attentive eye, but we shall
   see only the more clearly that he that believeth in the Lord Jesus
   Christ hath salvation for walls and bulwarks. Under any light believers
   in Jesus are secure. You may be put in circumstances of a very trying
   kind, especially you may be brought to the brink of death, and near to
   the bar of God; and yet, dear friend, the God in whom ye trust will not
   fail you. Your heart rests on His promises and faithfulness, and there
   is no reason why its peace should be broken.

   Is not this a perfect peace? If I stood here to preach up a sort of
   enthusiastic confidence, which would not bear the test, I would be
   ashamed of myself; but in preaching this peace of God, which passeth
   all understanding, which has no back-reckonings to disturb it, which
   has nothing behind that can come in ultimately to break it up, I preach
   something worth the having. I do desire and pray that every man and
   woman here may know it as I know it; for I have peace with God, and
   therefore my heart is glad. Oh that all of you here present might now
   believe God, and stay yourselves upon Him; then would you hear the Lord
   say "Peace! peace!"

   One thing more, peace in a city would not be consistent with the
   stoppage of commerce. During perfect peace intercourse goes on with all
   surrounding places, and the city by its trade is enriched. Where there
   is perfect peace with God, commerce prospers between the soul and
   heaven. Good men commune with the good, and thereby their sense of
   peace increases. If you have perfect peace, you have fellowship with
   all the saints: personal jealousies, sectarian bitternesses, and unholy
   emulations are all laid aside. Oh, it is a happy state of mind when we
   have no prejudices which can wall out the godly from fellowship with
   us! Oh, how blessed to say spontaneously, "If he is a child of God, I
   love him; if he is a member of the heavenly family, he is my brother,
   and I welcome him!" When we are at one with all the people of God, we
   are quit of a world of wars.

   Better still, there is a sweet peace between the heart and its God when
   from day to day, by prayer and praise, we commune with the Most High.
   Any peace that is linked with forgetfulness of God is a horrible thing:
   it is the peace of the miasma, which is brooding in quiet before it
   strikes with the arrow of death; it is that dead calm which precedes
   the cyclone or the earthquake. The perfect peace which God giveth
   sunneth itself in the presence of God; it is a tropical flower, which
   lives in the flaming sun-light; a bird with rainbow-wings, which is at
   home in the high-noon of heavens summertide. God gives us to know more
   and more of this perfect peace, by enabling us to plunge more and more
   completely into His own self! One with God in Christ Jesus, we have
   reached everlasting peace.

   Further let me speak upon this peace that God gives to us. It consists
   in rest of the soul. You know how the body casts all the limbs upon the
   bed, and they lie at ease; so does our spiritual nature stretch itself
   at ease. The heart reclines upon God's love, and the judgment leans on
   His wisdom; the desires recline, the hopes repose, the expectations
   rest, the soul throws all its weight and all its weariness upon the
   Lord, and then a perfect peace follows. To this absolute recumbency add
   a perfect resignation to the divine will. If you quarrel with God, your
   peace is at an end; but when you say, "It is the Lord; let him do what
   seemeth him good," you have obtained one of the main elements of
   perfect peace. When the Lord's will is owned and love, all ground for
   quarrel is over: the peace must be deep. It consists also in sweet
   confidence in God, when there is not the shadow of doubt about anything
   God does, for you are sure of this, if of nothing else, that He must be
   true, and He must be right and kind, and in all things better to you
   than you are to yourself. Then to leave everything with God, trusting
   in Him for ever, because in Him there is everlasting strength--this is
   peace. It means, in fact, the swallowing up of self in the great sea of
   God, the giving up of all we are, and all we have, so entirely to God
   that henceforth we cannot be troubled, or be disturbed, because that
   which could make trouble is already bound over to keep the peace. Then
   comes a blessed contentment; we want no more, we have enough. "The Lord
   is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him." Having
   Him, my desires all stay at home with Him. Let me but know Him better,
   and I shall grow even more satisfied with unutterable beauties, His
   indescribable perfections.

   I hope you know this peace; and if you do, I need not tell you it means
   freedom from everything like despondency. The mind cannot yield to
   mistrust, for the Lord's peace keeps it. The compass on board an iron
   steam-vessel is placed aloft, so that it may not be so much influenced
   by the metal of the ship: though surrounded by that which would put it
   out of place, the needle faithfully adheres to the pole because it is
   set above the misleading influence. So with the child of God, when the
   Lord has given him peace: he is lifted beyond the supremacy of his
   sorrowful surroundings, and his heart is delivered from its sad
   surroundings.

   Thus we are kept from everything like rashness: resting in God, we are
   not in sinful haste; we can wait God's time to deliver us, knowing that
   there is love in every second of the delay. We do not kick, as the
   untutored bullock kicks against the goad, but we push on the more
   eagerly with our furrow, toiling on to the end, till God shall appear
   for us. Thus we are saved from the temptations which come with our
   trials. We get the smelting of the furnace without its smut. We endure
   the sorrow, but escape the sin, and this is joy enough for a pilgrim in
   this vale of tears.

   O friends, he that hath this perfect peace is the richest man in the
   world! What are broad acres if you have a troubled spirit? What are
   millions of gold, laid by in the bank, if you have no God to go to in
   the hour of distress? What would it be to be a prince, a king, an
   emperor, if you had no hope for the hereafter, no treasure of eternal
   love? I, therefore, charge you to get and keep this "peace,"--this
   perfect peace.

   II. May the Lord strengthen me, in this time of painful weakness, while
   I speak upon another question. WHO ALONE CAN GIVE US THIS PEACE, AND
   PRESERVE IT IN US? The answer is in the words of the song, "Thou wilt
   keep him in perfect peace." See, it is God Himself that can give us
   this peace, and keep us in it. The answer is one and indivisible. I
   know that while I was speaking some of you were saying, "The pastor is
   setting forth a high style of living; how can we reach to it?" But if
   peace be God's gift, and if the Lord Himself is to keep us in it, how
   easily can we attain it by putting ourselves into His hands! To be
   striving after peace is hard work, for by our very anxiety to find it
   we miss its trail. How differently does the matter appear when we read,
   "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace!"

   How does the Lord keep His people in peace? I answer, first, by a
   special operation upon the mind in the time of its trial. We read in
   the 12th verse, "Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also
   hast wrought all our works in us." If this be so, we can understand how
   the Lord can work peace in us among all the other works. There is an
   operation of God upon the human mind, mysterious and inscrutable, of
   which the effects are manifest enough; and among those effects is this,
   a quiet of heart, a calm of spirit, which never comes in any other way.
   "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace." The Creator of our mind knows
   how to operate upon it by His Holy Spirit. Let the heart and will be
   allowed to be as free as you choose, yet is the Lord free to act upon
   them. As we can tune the strings of an harp, so can the Lord adjust the
   chords of our heart to joyous serenity. Not only by the Word of God,
   and by our meditation thereon, but by His own direct operation, the
   Lord can create peace within the land-locked sea of the human spirit.
   The Lord can get at men, and influence them for the highest ends, apart
   from the outward means. I have noticed that, altogether apart from the
   subjects of my reflections, I have, on a sudden, received a singular
   calm and peace of spirit directly from God. I can remember occasions
   when I had been hurried through broken water; the winds were wild, and
   my little vessel was at one instant lifted out of the water, and at the
   next beaten under the waves. Then, in a moment, everything was calm as
   a summer's evening, quiet as when the hush of Sabbath falls on a hamlet
   in the lone Highlands. My heart was royally glad, for it had entered
   into perfect peace. I think you must have noticed such matters in your
   own case. Generally, I grant you, we are led into this peace by the
   consideration of the promises of God; but sometimes, apart from that,
   without our knowing why or wherefore, we have upon a sudden glided from
   darkness into light, by the distinct operation of the Spirit of God
   upon the mind.

   But usually the Lord keeps His people in perfect peace by the operation
   of certain considerations, intended by His infinite wisdom to work in
   that manner. For instance, if sin be before the mind, it may well
   disquiet us, but when a man considereth that Christ died for our sins,
   according to the Scriptures, he hath that before him which allayeth the
   disquietude. When he considereth that, in dying, the Lord Jesus
   rendered unto God a full and satisfactory atonement for all the sin of
   all His believing people, then the man is at once, by that
   consideration, brought into perfect peace. Or suppose that a temporal
   trial ruffles the mind; the uneasy one turns to Scripture, and he finds
   that affliction is not sent as a legal punishment, but only as a
   fatherly chastisement of love: then is the bitterness of it passed
   away. Let a man know that all his trials work together for his good,
   and every sufficient reason for discontent is removed. The man noteth
   that there is good in the evil which surrounds him; indeed, he
   perceives the Lord to be at work everywhere, and henceforth he accepts
   the arrangements of providence without mistrust, and his heart is at
   peace. Depend upon it, dear friend, if you are tossed up and down, like
   the locust, you will only find peace by flying to the fields of
   Scripture. In this garden of the Lord, flowers are blooming which yield
   a balm for every wound of the heart. Never was there a lock of
   soul-trouble yet, but what there was a key to open it in the Word of
   God. For our pain, here is an anodyne; for our darkness, a lamp; for
   our loneliness, a friend. It is like the garden of Eden: a double river
   of peace glideth through it. Turn you then to the Lord's Word, to
   communion with His people, to prayer, to praise, or some form of holy
   service, and God will thus keep you in perfect peace.

   I believe, also, that the Lord keeps His people in perfect peace by the
   distinct operations of His providence. When a man's ways please the
   Lord, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. By secret
   workings he can quiet foes so that they are as still as a stone till
   Thy people pass over, O Lord. When one providence apparently fights
   against you, another will come in to deliver you. The Lord's thoughts
   towards His people are thoughts of good, and not of evil; and they
   shall see it to be so. Either the afflicted shall reach a place of
   rest, or else double strength shall be given for the double trial. God
   will allow no war in His providence against His own child, all must be
   for you there. If you are God's Jonah, and are thrown into the sea, a
   whale must wait upon you; and if you are God's servant, and are brought
   into the lowest dungeon in Egypt, Pharaohs own self must send and fetch
   you out of it to sit upon a throne. Lift up now your eyes, O you that
   crouch among the ashes because of your daily fret! Be no longer
   grovellers in the dust! The Lord is your King; nothing can break your
   peace. The Creator of yon stars and clouds, Lord of the universe,
   Monarch of all nature: thinkest thou that He cannot speedily send thee
   deliverance? All these ages has He loved thee; canst thou mistrust Him?
   Knowest thou not that He feeds the sparrows, ay, and the fish of the
   sea, and the myriads of living creatures which only His eye can see?
   There is no limit to His stores, nor bounds to His power. Canst thou
   not trust in Him, that He will help thee through, and give thee rest?
   Thus, you see, our peace comes from God in some way or other; and I
   therefore the more earnestly ask you never to seek peace elsewhere. Do
   not seek peace by praying for the absence of trial. You may be just as
   happy in affliction as out of it, if the Lord be with you. Do not seek
   peace by cultivating hardness of heart, and indifference of spirit. No,
   when you are afflicted, you ought to feel it: God means you should; and
   you must learn to feel it, and yet be fully at peace. Do not imagine
   you can get peace by philosophy, or by considerations derived from
   reason, or by knowledge fetched from experience. There is but one well
   from which you can draw the sweet waters of perfect peace, and it bears
   about its rim this dainty inscription--"Thou wilt keep him in perfect
   peace, O Jehovah." Such peace as God giveth makes us like to God, it
   fills us with His love, it sets us acting according to His holiness;
   and, meanwhile, it prepares us for His palace, where everlasting peace
   perfumes every chamber, and covers the whole fabric with glory.

   III. I have to answer another question this morning, and that is--WHO
   SHALL OBTAIN THIS PEACE? "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose
   mind is stayed on thee." The Hebrew is very involved and difficult to
   understand, but we shall not err if we permit it to teach us
   this,--that the whole of our being is stayed upon God in order to this
   peace. The word for "mind" is very vague, but it must include our
   thoughts. If your thoughts are stayed on God, you will have perfect
   peace: our misery comes from stray, vagabond, unsettled thoughts. If
   you will think of nothing except in connection with God, if you will
   only think of your sin in connection with a merciful God, if you will
   only think of tribulation in connection with a faithful God, if you
   will set the Lord always before you, so that he is at your right hand,
   you shall not be moved; but you certainly cannot be perfectly at peace
   till each thought, being held captive, learns to stay itself on Him.
   This includes the imagination. The imaginations are most untamable wild
   beasts, and cause a world of terror in timid minds. Oh for grace to
   fasten up imagination in the Lord's own cage! We must not imagine
   anything to be possible which would make the Lord appear to be unkind
   or untrue. Pray that your imagination may be stayed on God, that you
   may never again imagine anything contrary to the grace, goodness, and
   love of your heavenly Father. What peace would rule if this were the
   case! I think our text includes especially the desires. Desires are
   very grasping things. It is utterly impossible to satisfy a worldly
   mans heart: if he had all he now wishes for, he would be sure then to
   enlarge his desires as hell, and ask for more. But you, dear friend,
   must stay your desires at some bound or other, and what more fit than
   to stay them upon God? Say, "I want nothing but what God wills to give
   me; I desire to have nothing but what He thinks is for His glory, and
   for my profit." When you once come to this point, when your
   imaginations and desires all pitch their tents within the compass of
   God Himself, Who is your heavenly portion, then you will be kept in
   perfect peace.

   What else is meant by being stayed? Does it not mean rested? When your
   thoughts recline at their ease in God's revealed will, that is staying
   upon God. When your desires are filled, and no longer open their greedy
   mouths for more, because God has filled them, that is staying. Does it
   not mean stopping there? We speak of staying at a place. Well, when our
   minds are stayed upon God, we just stop at God; we do not propose any
   further journeying; we do not wish to push on in advance of where He
   leads the way. Our heart is rooted and grounded in the great Father's
   love, and so we stay our souls on Him.

   Staying means upholding. We speak of a stay, and of a mainstay; it is
   something upon which we are depending. Such a person is the stay of the
   house,--its chief upholder and support. See, then, what it is to stay
   your souls on God, and mind that you daily carry it out. Some are
   staying themselves upon a friend, others are staying themselves upon
   their own ability, but blessed is the man who stays himself upon God.
   We are to have no confidence except in the Almighty arm; our reliance
   must be place there only. When in our God we live, and move, and have
   our being, this is the crowning condition of a creature. Oh, to feel to
   the utmost that we are wholly the Lord's, and that, whether His will
   appoints us joy or woe, we shall be equally satisfied, for we have come
   to lie down on His will, and go no further. I like staid persons--you
   know what they are and where they are. They are not easily put about,
   neither do they readily forsake a cause which they have espoused. He
   that is stayed upon God is the most staid in the world; he is
   steadfast, grounded, settled, and he cannot be removed from the blessed
   hope of the gospel. He that is fully staid is the man that shall have
   perfect peace. Oh, whither away, ye undecided ones? Oh, whither away,
   poor hearts? Will ye wander over every mountain? Will ye never take up
   lodging with your God, and dwell at ease in Him? Of this be ye well
   assured, your souls are on the wing, and are bound to fly on and on for
   ever unless they make bold to settle down upon the Lord their God. In
   God is rest, but in none else. All earth and heaven, time and eternity,
   cannot make up a peace for a bruised spirit, and yet a word from the
   Lord bestows it beyond recall.

   Observe, it says, "stayed on thee." Dwell with emphasis upon that, for
   there are many ways of staying yourself, but you must mind that all
   your staying is on God; on your heavenly Father, who will withhold no
   good thing from you; on your divine Saviour, who pleads for you at the
   right hand of God; on the Holy Ghost, who dwells in you; on the triune
   God, who hath said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."

   Now, instead of saying more, I should like, if God the Holy Spirit
   would help us, for each one to go through the mental act of rolling our
   care upon the Lord. Let us commit ourselves, and all that we are, and
   all that we have, and all that we have to do, and all that we have to
   suffer, to the guardian care of our loving God, casting all our care
   upon Him, for He careth for us. Here we are in God, and here we mean to
   abide. We are not regretting the grace of yesterday, nor sighing for
   the grace of to-morrow. We stay where we are--at home with God. Our
   anchor is down, and we do not mean to draw it up again. "My heart is
   fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise." "Oh,"
   saith one, "you do not know my troubles!" No, but I remember the story
   of a poor Methodist at the battle of Fontenoy. He had both his legs
   shot away, and when the surgeon came to attend to him, he was evidently
   bleeding to death, but he cried, "I am as happy as I can be out of
   Paradise!" Well, if in the very article of death, and suffering as he
   was, he could overflow with happiness, surely you and I can rejoice in
   perfect peace. I want you all to be like Dr. Watts, who said that for
   many years he went to his bed without the slightest solicitude as to
   whether he should wake up in this world, or in the next. To rest in
   God's Word, to rejoice in God's covenant, to trust in the divine
   sacrifice, to be conformed to God's will, to delight in God's
   self--this is to stay yourself upon God, and the consequence of it is
   perfect peace.

   IV. WHY IS IT THAT THE LORD WILL KEEP THAT MAN IN PERFECT PEACE WHO
   STAYS HIMSELF ON HIM? The answer is, "because he trusteth in thee."
   Dear friends, that means surely this, that in faith there is the
   tendency to create and nourish peace. In all other ways of trying to
   live before God there is a tendency to produce uneasiness; but he that
   believes shall rest. Faith lays a cool hand upon a burning brow, and
   removes the fever of the fearful heart. Faith hath a voice of silver,
   wherewith she whispers, "Peace, be still." Nothing can conduce so much
   to a quiet life as a firm, unwavering confidence in the faithfulness of
   God's promise, and in the fact that what He has promised He is able
   also to perform.

   Further, the text means this, that when a man stays himself upon God it
   is not only his faith that brings him peace, but his faith is rewarded
   by peace, which the Lord gives him as a token of approval. A kind of
   discipline is going on in our heavenly Father's family, not rewards and
   punishments such as judges award to criminals, but such as fathers give
   to their children. By this we are being trained for the many mansions
   in the Father's house above. If we will stay ourselves on God, we shall
   have peace; if we will not do so, we shall have no rest, and shall be
   in sore disquietude. "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in
   God, believe also in me." The pressure of the trouble comes with the
   decline of faith. If thou believest more, it may not make thee richer,
   but thou wilt not feel thy poverty so keenly. If thou believest more,
   it may not make thee healthy in body, but thou shalt not fret because
   of thy sickness: if thou believest more, it will not give thee back thy
   buried ones, but it shall fill thy heart with a still higher love. "All
   things are possible to him that believeth," and peace, peace is among
   those possibilities; but if thou wilt not believe, neither shalt thou
   be established, thine unbelief shall be a rod for thine own back, a
   bitter for thine own cup. If thou wilt not trust thy God, thou shalt
   wander into a weary land, seeking rest and finding none. Come, brothers
   and sisters, let us fly from such a fate, and win perfect peace as the
   reward of perfect confidence.

   I think, lastly, this peace comes out of faith, because it is faiths
   way of proclaiming herself. If God gives you perfect peace, you will
   not need, when you go home, to shout to your friends, "I am a
   believer." They will soon see it. You have lost one that was very dear
   to you, and instead of fretting and repining, you kiss the hand of God,
   and go about your daily duties with patience. That is a very wonderful
   fruit of the Spirit, wrought by faith, and thus faith is seen. A man
   has had a fire, or some other form of loss, and his comforts are
   destroyed. If he is an unbeliever, we do not wonder that he tears his
   hair, and curses God, and rages and fumes. But if he has stayed himself
   on God, he will be at peace, and he will say, "The Lord hath done it.
   It is the Lord: let Him do what seemeth Him good." By this will you be
   known to be the disciples of Christ, when in patience ye possess your
   souls. Faith which only operates when all goes well, is the mockery of
   faith; the love that praises God when God gives thee according to thy
   desire is no more than the love of some dogs to their masters, who care
   just as much for them as the number of the scraps may be. Wilt thou
   have such a cupboard love as that? It were far better to get to this
   state, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." If thou hast this
   faith within thee, then shall thy peace be like a river. The peace of
   God which passeth all understanding shall keep thy heart and mind by
   Christ Jesus.

   I am very much concerned in leaving you, that you, dear friend, should
   aim much at the possession of this peace. It is a mode of propagating
   the gospel never to be despised. Multitudes of people have been
   converted by seeing the holy patience of God's people: they have been
   impressed by it, and have said, "There must be something in a religion
   that can give such a peace as this." When you are fretting and
   worrying, you are undoing your ministers work. When the people of God
   are over and above troubled, when they count life to be a burden to
   them because things are not as they would wish them to be, they are
   really slandering their heavenly Father, and they are preventing the
   wandering from coming back. The unconverted say, "Why should be go to
   God to be made miserable?" O ye banished seed, be glad! O ye troubled
   ones, rejoice! Though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness
   through manifold temptations, yet lift up your heads, for your
   redemption draweth nigh. Within a short time you shall put on the
   garments of your excellency and beauty, and the weeds of your mourning
   shall be laid aside. Wherefore play the man: better still, play the
   Christian; and let all men know where God is, and where the Lord rules
   the heart, there is, there must be, a deep and profound peace. May God
   bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

A Sweet Silver Bell Ringing in Each Believer's Heart

   (No. 1819)

   Intended for Reading on Lord's Day, Febrary 1st, 1885,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [4]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On December 18th, 1884.

   "My God will hear me." Micah 7:7.

   WHAT a charming sentence! Can you say it? Only five words, but what
   meaning! Huge volumes of poetry have appeared from Chaucer even to
   Tennyson; but it seems to me that the essence of poetry lies hid in a
   marvellously condensed form within these few words. It shall take you
   many an hour to suck out all their sweetness. There is an almost
   inconceivable depth of meaning in them: and of richness of assured
   experience and of sweet conclusions of a hallowed faith they are full
   to the brim.

   "My God will hear me." There is more eloquence in that sentence than in
   all the orations of Demosthenes. He that can speak thus can say more
   than if he were able to declare truthfully that all worlds were his
   own; for he grasps God himself, and holds the present and the future in
   the hollow of his hand.

   "My God will hear me." It is prophetic; but the prophet has taken upon
   himself no unusual power, neither does he intend his prophecy to be
   true of himself alone. He puts this divine sentence into the mouth of
   every believer; every child of God may dare to say that his God will
   hear him, for he may dare to say the truth. I feel as if I could not
   preach from the text, and did not want to do so. It needs no aid of wit
   or words; for myself I would be well content to exhibit this diamond
   with many facets by merely holding it up and letting the light fall on
   it, and flash back from it in variety of brilliance.

   "My God will hear me." It is a choice song for a lone harp, which is
   half afraid of the choir of musicians, and loves to have its strings
   touched in solitude. I feel as I repeat it that I want to sit down and
   quietly enjoy it. As I see the cows lie in the meadow quietly chewing
   the cud, so would I ruminate on these few but precious words. Let me
   hear the sounds again and again, till my tongue, learning their
   rhythmic melody, repeats as matter of habitual delight the assurance
   "My God will hear me."

   A charming sentence, as I have said; but in what a queer place we find
   it! Just as they find gold in the dark mine, and as we see stars in the
   black night, so do we find these rich words in the midst of floods of
   grief and woe. The man of God is pricked and torn by the briars of the
   age in which he travels; he is vexed and wearied with the bribery and
   corruption all around him; he cannot find peace either at home or
   abroad,nay, not even in the bosom of her whom he loves. He is
   everywhere disquieted and driven to and fro; and yet it is just at that
   time that he cries, "My God will hear me." From this I gatherand I
   gather it not from this alone, but from my own personal experiencethat
   it is generally when things are at the worst that we know most about
   the best. When we are disappointed of men, then become we most
   contented with our God. When earth-born springs are dry, then the
   eternal fountain-heads flow more freely than ever, and as we drink of
   them our soul is more satisfied than ever it had been before. God is
   good when goods are fewest. Heaven is warmest when earth is coldest. It
   is a great blessing for you, dear friend, that, you can say, "My God
   will hear me." I do not mind much about your surroundings; they may be
   grievous and trying; but if they have helped to bring you to this pass,
   that you have a solid confidence that God will hear you, I congratulate
   you upon the priceless consequences, even though I may condole with you
   for the sufferings that have brought them to you. We do not weep over
   the mud which bespatters the gold-digger when he finds his nugget,
   neither will we fret over the affliction which makes God to be more
   precious to our friend.

   Again, come back to the short and sweet sentence of the text, and may
   it be inexpressibly delightful to our hearts while we meditate upon it
   for a while. "My God will hear me."

   I. The first thing I shall note at this time is THE TITLE. This is the
   bottom of the whole text really, the true foundation of the confidence
   which is expressed in it. The title is "my God": it is not God alone,
   but God in covenant with me, to whom I look for help. I shall be heard
   by "my God."

   I am afraid that some of you will have to draw back a little from the
   text at the very commencement. As I remarked the other day, to say
   there is a God is not much. It is the same as to say, there is a bank;
   but there may be a bank, and you may be miserably poor. There certainly
   is a God, but that God may be no source of comfort to you. The joy of
   the whole thing lies in that word "my." "My God will hear me."

   Begin then with the enquiry, put to your own soul,Can I truly think of
   God, and call him "my God"? If so, that means election and selection.
   There were many gods in the day of the prophet Micah; at least, men
   spoke as if there were. Men talked of this god, and of that, and each
   nation had its own peculiar deity, and each man walked in the name of
   his god, and gloried in it. But the prophet in effect says of Jehovah,
   the one living and true God, the God that made heaven and earth"This
   God is my God. Others may worship gods of wood, or of stone, or of
   silver, or of gold; but as for me, my heart shall only worship the
   great Invisible, whom none hath seen, to whom none can approach. The
   eternal Creator alone will I adore."

   Now every man at this present time has a god. Alas, how many make their
   belly their god! The golden calf is never without its crowds of devoted
   worshippers. Gods to-day are as numerous in England as in any heathen
   country: let me then ask,have you taken the God who is your Maker,
   your Preserver, your Redeemer to be the great object of your life? That
   is your god which rules your naturethat which is your motive
   powerthat for which you live. Do you live for Jehovah as your God, or
   are you only living for yourself or for some temporary end and purpose?
   Will the object of your life die with your dying, and be buried in your
   grave? Or can you say unto the living God, "O God, thou art my God;
   early will I seek thee. Thou art my God for ever and ever: thou shalt
   be my guide even unto death!" If so, it supposes your election of this
   God beyond every other; and I put it to youis this election made? and
   made once for all? Can you cry with Joshua, "As for me and my house we
   will serve Jehovah"? Is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
   your God for all time? Be it so; you shall never regret the choice.

   "My God,"that supposes an appropriation by faith. Have you taken
   Jehovah to be your God? Have you made bold to take him for your very
   own? In the covenant of grace God gives over to his people himself, and
   all that he is, and all that he has, by a covenant of salt. As the
   believer becomes God's portion, so the Lord becomes the believer's
   portion. He declares himself to be ours and puts himself at our
   disposal, exercising a boundless condescension of love in so doing. Our
   part in it is, that we do accept this covenant gift, and by an act of
   faith say, "This which God gives me, I, unworthy though I be, do freely
   accept. Though I deserve it not, yet as he has given himself to me, I,
   with gladness, receive him, to be my God, my portion, world without
   end." Well do I remember the joyous day when first my heart took this
   possession to herself. It had appeared to be like a land of fire and
   terror, and I desired it not; but when the Spirit of God had instructed
   and renewed me, then I perceived that God was as the land of Goshenay,
   as the land of Canaan, that floweth with milk and honey; ay, as the
   land Beulah, where the sun goes no more down for ever, where all is
   joy, and peace, and love; yea, as heaven itself, for God is the very
   soul, and center, and source, and fullness of bliss. My heart annexed
   this blessed territory with trembling joy; yea, she seemed to have no
   other possession left except her God. From that hour she grew rich and
   remained so. What is there more for me but my God? How can I go an inch
   beyond "my God, my heaven, my all"? Now, beloved hearer, have you thus
   appropriated the Eternal God to be your own? Can you say to-day, "First
   and foremost among my possessions is my God. I will not say that I have
   this and that, and ever so many other things, but I will sing, 'My God,
   thou art mine!' Perhaps I could not say that I have much of this
   world's goods, but I have the highest Good. If I have not all, yet I
   have the All-in-All, who is more than all, and he is everything to my
   spirit "? I trust you can say "my God," first, by your choice of him;
   and, secondly, by your appropriation of him through faith. Wherever
   this is the case it is the work of the Spirit of God, and he must have
   our reverent love for thus enriching us.

   "My God,"this signifies knowledge and acquaintance. Does it not? For
   unless the words are meaningless, you know who it is that you are
   talking of, and you have had some acquaintance with him, and dealings
   with him. If I say, "So-and-so is my friend," I give you to understand
   that I know him; and if I say, "Jehovah is my God," I profess that I
   know him and have fellowship with him. You remember the inscription
   which Paul discovered upon an altar at Athens, "To the unknown God." I
   would not have you worship there, my brother; but I would have you
   understand that word of the apostle, "After that ye had known God, or
   rather were known of God." There is an intimate knowledge subsisting
   between God and his people. "The Lord knoweth them that are his," and
   all his people know him, so that among them no one has need to say to
   his brother, Know the Lord, for they all know him, from the least even
   to the greatest.

   Now, what knowest thou of God? Hast thou ever spoken with him? Has he
   spoken to thee? Hast thou told him thy secrets? Has he revealed himself
   to thee, as it is written, "The secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear him, and he will show them his covenant"? Now, I am not talking
   about fancies. If any of you deem this to be fanciful, it is because
   you are strangers to the covenant of promise; but I am speaking now to
   a people who know more than I can tell them of what this means. As for
   myself, I know something of nature, and of the works of God's hands,
   but my soul cares little for that knowledge compared with knowing HIM.
   Willingly and gladly I would forget all else I know if I might but know
   more of him; for well am I persuaded that when old age comes on, and
   memory fails me, that which my soul shall hold as with a death grip,
   will not be historical remembrance, classical love, or theological
   learning, but what she knows by inward experience of the Lord her God.
   When the veil shall drop upon all mortal shadows, to be uplifted upon
   eternal realities, then my heart shall care nothing for what she knew
   of things terrestrial; but she shall value beyond conception what she
   shall then know of the Immortal, the Invisible, the only wise God, her
   Savior. I am sure that I am speaking to many of you who can use the
   expression, "My God," and mean by it that the God in whom you live and
   move and have your being is your friend, and your Father; that he
   dwells in you by the Holy Ghost, and that in him you dwell as you hide
   yourselves in the wounds of Christ. Oh happy men and women that can
   with knowledge and affection say, "My God." Unhappy you who have
   neither part nor lot in this matter. Your sorrows shall be multiplied
   which hasten after another god, for your vanities will fail you: but as
   for you that know the Lord, to you shall joy increase even as the
   growing light of the rising sun.

   If you have come as far as this, I am sure that you can follow me
   farther by admitting that the title, "My God," implies an embrace of
   love. You know God as you know your child; but as you look at your boy,
   you cry, "My child, my child," and you mean a great deal by that,
   because your child is much more yours on account of the affection that
   you feel for him than any other possession that you have upon the face
   of the earth. You would lose everything else sooner than lose the
   darling of your bosom. The expression, "My God" has an inexpressible
   amount of sweet affection wrapped up in it. I delight in that line of
   our old Psalm:

   "Yea, mine own God is he."

   He is my very own. My God belongs to me as much as if he belonged to no
   other. My heart has twisted her tendrils round about him as fast and
   firm as if no other tiny plant had dared to grasp the same upholder.
   The divine Fatheroh, what joy lights up the soul when we think of that
   splendid fatherhood, that infinite relationship of the Divine One to
   us, whom he has "begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection
   of Jesus Christ from the dead." How have we sometimes sung with David,

   "Such pity as a father hath
   Unto his children dear,
   Like pity shows the Lord to such
   As worship him in fear."

   We love the Father, and call him "My God." And as for Jesus, the second
   person in the Divine Unity, Incarnate God, does not your very heart
   leap at the sound of his name? Is there not all music condensed into
   two syllables in that name "Jesus "? I know that it is so to you. He is
   your very own Christ, your Savior, for ever and ever. And the blessed
   Spiritdo we not with equal affection lay hold upon him, the Paraclete,
   the Comforter, the Quickener, the Illuminator, the best of friends,
   bearing with our ill behavior and still abiding in us, making us meet
   for the eternal kingdom? Yes, beloved, we do love our God. Do not our
   hearts say in our prayers, "O Lord, do not believe our actions, for,
   disobedient as we are, we do love thee. Do not believe our
   forgetfulness, do not believe the lukewarmness which occasionally
   creeps over us; for thou knowest all things, thou knowest that we love
   thee"? Such affection makes us cry, "My God." We cannot comprehend him,
   but we apprehend him with the grip of hallowed love. We feel that we
   can never give him up, even as he will never give us up. I am not what
   I ought to be, but I cannot give up my God. Hard as my heart feels, yet
   it melts with love to him who has loved me from before the foundations
   of the world. Who shall separate me from the love of God which is in
   Christ Jesus, my Lord?

   What a deal there is in the title! But we have not exhausted it by a
   long waylet us have another drink from the well. You feel that now the
   obedience of your life is rendered to him most cheerfully, for this is
   a sure outcome of the heart's crying, "He is my God." A man cannot call
   God his God in truth unless he desires to obey him; for God is a name
   to adore, to reverence, to worship. He who speaks of God but never
   obeys him is a practical atheist; he has no God. That man who talks
   about God in the synagogue, but who has no regard for him in the
   market, makes Jehovah to be no better a deity than the idols of the
   heathen, who are only gods in their own temples, even if there. The man
   upon whose heart and hand the Godhead has no kind of influencesuch a
   man is a liar and knows not God, but renders to him lip service, which
   is to God's dishonor, and not to his glory. Yes, beloved, if you are
   what you profess to be, you can declare, "With all my infirmities and
   imperfections, I desire that my whole life should be obedient to the
   divine precept. I wish in all things to do that which is right and
   good, and true and kind, according to the mind of Christ, in which I
   see the mind of God my Father." Concerning these things let there be
   great searchings of heart. Come and look in this glass and see if you
   bear the features of "imitators of God as dear children"; for it will
   go hard with you if you turn out to be pretenders.

   Let me only add that this expressive phrase "My God" hints at a joy and
   delight in him. As men would say"my love," "my choice," "my treasure,"
   "my delight," so doth the prophet say "My God." The very name wakes all
   the music of his soul. As when the sleeping flowers, being touched by
   the first beams of the rising sun, open their bright eyes to look on
   him who is the foster-father of all their beauty, and seem each one to
   say "My King," so do our hearts rejoice in the presence of the Lord,
   and our quickened spirits cry "My God."

   So much for the title. May it be written on your hearts by the Holy
   Ghost.

   II. The second point in our brief text is THE ARGUMENT, for I believe
   the title contains within itself a secret logical force. "My God will
   hear me." As surely as he is my God he will hear me. Why?

   Well, he will hear me first because he is God, because he is the living
   and true God. Those gods of stone cannot hear me, but my God will hear
   me. The gods that many men choose will not hear them in the day of
   trouble. To which of them will they call in the hour of their
   affliction? But my God will hear me. It is his memorial that he hears
   prayer. The oracles of the heathen were but liars. Those who sought
   unto the false gods did but dote upon falsehoods; they were deceivers
   and deceived. But my God will hear me. As surely as he is God he will
   answer prayer. If he does not answer prayer, then he is no more a God
   than Jupiter, or Saturn, or Venus. For us as Christian people and
   worshippers of the Most High, it is a truth never to be questioned,
   that Jehovah is the living and true God, whose memorial is that he
   heareth the prayers of his people. "My God will hear me."

   You see in what a tone of confidence this prophet speaks, and why
   should not every child of God speak with the same confidence? The joy
   of religion lies in a hearty faith in it. You begin handling it with
   dainty fingers, criticising it everlastingly, questioning this and
   questioning that with anxious debate of heart; and the consequence is
   that you miss its sweetness. It is nothing to your comfort till it is
   everything to your faith. You must believe it, and the more thoroughly
   you believe it the more will it prove itself true to you. The proof of
   the gospel lies in the testing of it, by which I mean in the practical
   proving and enjoying of it. Suppose you try to pray, and do not believe
   in prayer: well, you do not pray. You get nothing by such praying: you
   work a dry pump. You must have confidence in the mercy seat, if the
   mercy seat is to be a place of refuge for you. "He that wavereth is
   like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. Let not that
   man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord." "He that cometh
   to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him." To my mind it seems the right thing to believe in
   the living God right up to the hiltto believe in his promise without
   stint or limit. His word is either true or false. If it is false, I
   will never preach it: if it is true, I will never doubt it. There let
   it stand like a column of brass:though all things else should fail,
   God must hear prayer. He may do this and he may do that, but he must
   hear prayer. My God will hear me because he is a true God, and no liar;
   and he has himself declared, "Call upon me in the day of trouble: I
   will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." He has laid it down as
   unquestionable fact, "He that seeketh findeth, he that asketh
   receiveth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." How can he run
   back from this? Why should I imagine that he will lie or repent?

   But why am I so sure, as a matter of argument, that God will hear
   prayer? The answer is in the title again, "My God." Because he has made
   himself my God he will hear me. O you that are familiar with your God,
   who can therefore call him by the dear title of "My God," you will see
   the overwhelming conclusiveness of this reasoning. To hear a petitioner
   is a small thing compared to giving yourself over to him. "My God will
   hear me," for doubtless, if he has given himself to be my God, he will
   hear me. He has done the greater thing, he will surely do the less. If,
   in infinite condescension, he permits me to call him "my God," and I
   perceive all through his gospel that he invites me to do so, then,
   surely he will hear me. He that hath said, "They shall be my people,
   and I will be their God," will do the much smaller thing: he will,
   without doubt, hear them when they call upon him. "Ye, being evil, know
   how to give good gifts unto your children. How much more shall your
   heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" "He that
   spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
   not with him also freely give us all things?" Is not that clear enough?
   He has given us himself, and his Son; how can he shut out our cries?
   After what he has done for us in the past, we cannot doubt that he will
   hear us. What, give us cleansing by his blood, and then not hear us?
   What, give us the new birth, and then not hear us? Did he bless us when
   we did not seek him, and will he not hear us when we do seek him? What,
   look after us when we were like stray sheep, deaf to all his calls;
   seek after us till he restored us; and then not hear us when we become
   the sheep of his pasture? Impossible! The argument is irresistible: My
   God will certainly hear me.

   Moreover, my God has heard me so many times; therefore, be it far from
   me to doubt his present and future favor. A brother in prayer reminded
   us just now that we ought to have greater faith than the saints of the
   olden times, because we have many more centuries of the divine
   faithfulness to read of and to see. It is so; but I fear that
   observation seldom acts upon us so forcibly as actual personal
   experience. What shall I say to my beloved brothers and sisters here
   who are getting old? They have had such experience. God has heard your
   prayers many times, my aged brethren, and your faith is thereby
   confirmed. When we first began to pray, we were staggered if objectors
   questioned us. "You talk about God having heard your prayer." "Yes," we
   said, "he did hear us," and we stated our case. The sceptic sneered,
   and said "That was merely a coincidence." When we heard that remark for
   the first time, we were somewhat taken aback. We admitted that we could
   not draw an inference from two or three facts, for, perhaps, in after
   years there might be thirty facts which would tell the other way. But,
   my veteran brethren, we are not in that condition to-night, for some of
   us have had thirty or forty years' experience of God's hearing prayer,
   and our facts are as many as the hairs of our heads. Do opponents say
   that these are coincidences? We do not care to answer such perverse
   janglings. If they were in our position, they would not wish to answer
   such remarks. They would laugh; and that is all that they would find in
   their hearts to do. A man puts on warm clothing and is not pinched by
   the frost. His acquaintance tells him that he does not believe in
   flannel and broad-cloth; he shivers in his unbelief, and tells the
   well-clad man that his comfort is a mere coincidence. Humorous, is it
   not? But if the objector gets frozen to death, the wit grows rather
   grim! When we have not prayed, and have not received a blessing, and
   have been ready to perish, I suppose our failure has been a
   coincidence! And when we have betaken ourselves to our knees, and have
   cried mightily to God, and pleaded the promises, and God has answered
   us as visibly as if he had rent the blue heavens, and thrust out his
   almighty arm to help us, that has been a coincidence! I call such
   things plain answers to prayer, but those who have never experienced
   the like think me a fanatic. I will therefore let them use their own
   terms. We will not wrangle over words,"A rose by any other name would
   smell as sweet." As to the delivering mercy of Godyou shall call it a
   coincidence if you like, but to us it will always be a blessed proof
   that the Lord hears prayer.

   Using this sweet title, containing as it does within itself a whole
   century of logic, we say, joyfully, "My God will hear me." What bliss
   it is to have so sweet an assurance ever at hand! It is a versicle of
   heavenly music,"My God will hear me." The Lord has entered into
   covenant with us that he will not turn away from us from doing us good,
   and in that covenant his hearing prayer is included. He could not be
   our friend and be deaf to our appeals: he could not be in fellowship
   with us and shut out our cries. Listen, however, to some of his own
   covenant words: "Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
   thee, and thou shalt glorify me": Psalm 50:15. "He shall call upon me,
   and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver
   him, and honor him": Psalm 91:15. "The Lord is nigh unto all them that
   call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfill the
   desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
   save them": Psalm 145:18, 19. "And it shall come to pass, that before
   they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will
   hear": Isaiah 65:24. "Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show
   thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not": Jeremiah 33:3.
   Do you need more than this? The Lord hath said it, and he will make it
   good. He has never said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.

   Were not the Lord to hear prayer, and bear his people through their
   troubles, he would himself be a great loser. He would lose all that his
   wisdom has planned, all that his sovereignty has ordained, all that his
   love has begun, all that his power has wrought, and all that whereon
   his heart is set. Did not Jehovah hear prayer it were to him as though
   a father no more heard the voice of his child: he would lose that which
   charms his fatherly mind, and miss that which is a solace to his loving
   heart. If God doth not hear me, he will lose me; and this I feel he
   will not do, for he hath graven me upon the palms of his hands, that I
   may never be forgotten of him. O, yes, my God will hear me; his truth
   and honor cannot be imperilled by a refusal to hear the pleadings of
   his own child.

   III. Bear with me while I invite you, in the third place, to notice the
   FAVOR ITSELF. "My God will hear me." You notice that in Scripture we do
   not often find the expression, "My God will answer me." We do read that
   he answers prayer, but more frequently God is said to be the God that
   heareth prayer. It is better for us to have a promise that God will
   hear us than a promise that God will always answer us. In fact, if it
   were a matter of absolute fact that God would always answer the prayers
   of his people as they present them, it would be an awful truth. I
   should shrink from ever praying again if I were absolutely sure that
   the Lord would answer my prayer, whatever it might be. I might curse
   myself seven times deep by a prayer within the next seven minutes, if
   there were no safeguards and limits to the promise of prayer being
   answered. It is neither desirable nor possible that all things should
   be left to our choice: so much do I feel this, that if my Lord should
   say to me, "From this hour I will always answer your prayer just as you
   pray it," the first petition I would offer would be, "Lord, do nothing
   of the sort." Because that would be putting the responsibility of my
   life upon myself, instead of allowing it to remain upon God. It were,
   in fact, to make me the master of the house, and to make me my own
   shepherd: the very first thing I should wish would be to strip myself
   of such a power. I would cry, "Lord, do as thou wilt about answering
   me; I will be well content if thou wilt hear me." I like that kind of
   hearing prayer of which Ralph Erskine says:

   "I'm heard when answered, soon or late,
   Yea, heard when I no answer get:
   Most kindly answered when refused,
   And treated well when harshly used."

   It is enough for a praying heart that it has a hearing God.

   But notice, "My God will hear me." It means, first, literally that he
   will hear me as a listener. A good brother of my acquaintance, a
   minister of the gospel, going to preach from the text that God will
   hear prayer, called upon one of his poor people, who said when the
   visit was over that she had greatly enjoyed his call. He thought to
   himself, "I have scarcely said a word, and yet she says that I have
   done her good." Turning to her, he enquired, "Sister, how can I have
   done you good, for I have hardly spoken with you?" "Ah, sir," she
   replied, "you have listened so kindly; you have heard all I had to say,
   and there are very few who will do that." Just so. People in deep
   trouble like somebody to hear them all through: even little children
   are comforted by telling mother all about it. We are in such a hurry
   with poor troubled spirits that we hasten them on to the end of the
   sentence, and try to make them skip the dreary details. But to them
   this seems unkind, for their story is sacred; and, therefore, they go
   slowly on with it, till we are quite tired. I have often hurried on a
   poor despondent creature till I have seen the uselessness of it: it is
   always best to let them spin on. It does them good. To tell out the
   heart to a patient listener is a great relief to a burdened spirit, and
   the heart must do it in its own way. Here is a sweet assurance, "My God
   will hear me." I may be very bad, and what I say may be very broken,
   and I may groan a good deal, and I may say the same thing over and over
   again, and my whole ditty may be very stupid; but, "My God will hear
   me." He is in no hurry: he is the God of patience. He will listen to my
   dreary talk, and endure each gloomy particular. I need not hold him as
   the Ancient Mariner held the wedding guest who was unwilling to hear
   his weary rhyme of the sea: my God will willingly listen to me right
   through, from beginning to end, groans and all. "My God will hear me."

   And then the Lord will hearken as a friend full of sympathy. Some
   people listen but do not hear. You tell them your story, but it does
   not help you a bit, because their minds are no more moved by your case
   than if they were far away. They are just saying to themselves, "We
   will hear this poor old lady's story; it will please her." But it does
   not please her, because she perceives that they have no sympathy, no
   fellow-feeling. The kind of person you like to tell your story to is
   one who weeps with youwho is really afflicted with your affliction. It
   is greatly comforting to have a person with you who feels just as you
   feel, who when you are very stupid, seems to be stupid too, who frets
   as you fret, and groans in your groaning. "Mother," said a little girl
   once, "I cannot make it out; Mrs. Smith says I do her so much good.
   Poor Mrs. Smith has lost her husband, mother, and she is very sad. She
   sits and cries, and I get up and lay my cheek on her cheek, and I cry
   and say that I love her, and then she says that she loves me, and that
   I comfort her." Just so. That is the truest form of consolation: is it
   not? "Weep with them that weep." That is how God, my God, will hear me,
   feeling with me, sympathising with me." In all their affliction he was
   afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them." "I am with thee,
   saith the Lord."

   "I feel at my heart all thy sighs and thy groans,
   For thou art most near me, my flesh and my bones.
   In all thy afflictions thy head feels the pain,
   They all are most needful, not one is in vain,"

   "My God will hear me"; he will listen to me, and he will sympathise
   with me.

   "My God will hear me"; that is, he will turn it over and discriminate
   in his own mind, and he will not allow me to be condemned by the
   hurried judgment of men. He will hear me as a judge patiently hears a
   case. Others will come in and clamor against me, and refuse to listen
   to a word of explanation; but my God will hear me. That was a splendid
   utterance of the holy patriarch Job! He went a long way further than he
   knew he went when he said it,"I know that my Redeemer liveth." His
   unkind friends charged him very terribly and Job spoke up for himself,
   but he did not get on at it. He could not plead his own cause
   successfully, and therefore, in his desperation, he cried, "I have a
   God that will yet plead my cause, and if he does not do it while I am
   alive, yet I know that he liveth; and though after my skin worms devour
   my body, yet in my flesh shall I behold him, and I shall be cleared
   from this misrepresentation; I shall be delivered from this suspicion.
   I know I shall. My God will hear me. He will hear my suit right through
   and do me justice, and I shall behold him whom my eyes shall see for
   myself and not another." Job felt assured of being cleared at last.
   Dear child of God, you may do the same. Your character shall not be
   injured by malicious tongues. They lie against you; they refuse you a
   hearing; they wrest your words; they empty the buckets of their
   contempt upon you; but your God will hear you.

   Then, at the back of that, of course, comes the conclusion of every
   loving heart that, as God will hear the case right through, so he will
   certainly hear as a Helper. "My God will hear me."

   Now, child of God, go away with this promise in your hand, and in your
   heart"My God will hear me"; and then use it like a magic wand. Turn it
   whichever way you will and it will clear your path. You are going to
   preach the gospel in a distant country, perhaps; and your spirit sinks
   as you sigh, "Who is sufficient for these things?" Lift up your heart
   to God, and his grace shall be sufficient for you, and his strength
   shall be made perfect in your weakness, for your God will hear you. Or
   you have to go home to-night to a sick house, and to lose one that is
   dear to you. You shall be sustained, for in your ear is this word, "My
   God will hear me." Or, perhaps, you yourself have to sicken and die. Do
   you enquireWhat shall I do in the swellings of Jordan? Here is your
   happy answer, "My God will hear me." I shall cry to him, and he will
   answer me. He will have a desire to the work of his hands. Yea, though
   I go down into the valley of the shadow of death my God will hear me;
   and when I lie in the tomb my God will remember me, and he will call me
   up with sound of trumpet, and my body shall live again. My God shall
   hear me singing his praises before his throne. My God shall hear me,
   world without end, as my whole being shall lift up her joy-notes of
   "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah" unto him who loved me out of the
   pit, and lifted me up to his own right hand.

   IV. My only sorrow about this text is my fear that it could not
   honestly fall from some of your lips: you could not truthfully say, "My
   God will hear me." So I close by noting THE PERSON to whom it
   belongs,"My God will hear me." Will he hear you? Dear heart, are you
   cast down under a sense of sin? Do you seek forgiveness? He will hear
   you. Are you burdened because you cannot live without sin? Would you be
   free from all evil? He will hear you. Are you persecuted for
   righteousness' sake? Are the men of your household turned to be your
   foes? He will hear you, and cause you to rejoice in being counted
   worthy to suffer for Jesus' sake. Are you assured of the result of
   prayer? You shall not be disappointed; your God will hear you. Have you
   long been praying? Cease not from importunity, but solace yourself with
   this sure beliefMy God will hear me. Will you now come and cast
   yourselves into the arms of Jesus, the Crucified? Your God has heard
   you. Be of good cheer.

   O, my dear hearer, have you a God? Strange question, but I press it
   even with tears,have you a God? If you have no God, of course you have
   nobody to hear you when the great water-floods prevail. My dear hearer,
   if you make the world your God it cannot hear you in the day of your
   trouble. You may be a very rich man, and have large estates, but I
   would sooner occupy the place of the poorest believing pauper in the
   workhouse than take your position without a God and without a throne of
   grace. How do people live that have no God to go to? If a man were to
   say to me, "I never get a morsel of bread to eat at all," I should
   wonder how he lived. But when a man says, "I never pray, and God never
   hears me," I am in equal wonder. How can the poor creature exist? These
   are hard times with a great many of you. You have not many worldly
   comforts; indeed, some of you cannot even find work. What can you do
   without a God to fly to? I suppose your head aches sometimes, like
   mine; I suppose cares and troubles eat into your mind as they do into
   mine; I suppose you have your difficulties, and your knots that you
   cannot untie, just as I have mine. How do you keep your souls alive
   without a God? I pray God that I may never live a day without prayer,
   and without trusting my God. However do you bear up, some of you? I do
   not wonder that you go and get drunk to drown your thoughts. I do not
   wonder that you want frivolities and theatricals, and all sorts of
   childish toys to put your cares out of your minds, for you need
   something or other to help you to forget the miseries which are coming
   upon you thick and heavy. Yet is it not madness to drive away wise
   thoughts? What a wretched business it must be to be in dread of your
   own thoughts! You dare not sit alone in your chamber for half-an-hour
   and think, because if you did you would begin to think of dying, and
   you could not bear to think of that without a God. You might even be
   driven to think of hell and of a judgment to come; and that you could
   not endure. If you dare not think of them, how will you bear them? Oh
   poor souls, poor souls, you are in a sad state, indeed! But you need
   not remain so. If any man wills to have God to be his own God, grace
   has given him that will. If you desire Christ, you may have him. What
   is the price? Nothing at all. Receive him freely. Believe in Jesus
   Christ; that is, trust yourself with him; and God is your God; and you
   may go on your way full of joy and thankfulness. God bless you and
   comfort you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Fallen Angels a Lesson To Fallen Men

   (No. 1820)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [5]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
   delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."
   2 Peter 2:4.

   THESE ARE ANCIENT THINGS." Most men hunger after the latest news; let
   us on this occasion go back upon the earliest records, and think of the
   hoar past, before man was made. It does us good to look back upon the
   past of God's dealings with his creatures; herein lies the value of
   history. We should not confine our attention to God's dealings with
   men, but we should observe how he acts towards another order of
   beingshow he dealt with angels before man had become the second
   sinner. If angels transgress, what is his conduct towards them? This
   study will enlarge our minds, and show us great principles in their
   wider sweep. We shall inevitably make mistakes in our judgment as to
   God's conduct towards men if we do not remember sufficiently how he has
   dealt with beings who are in certain respects much superior to the
   human race. By seeing how God treated the rebellions angels, light may
   be cast upon his dealings with us, and thereby misapprehensions may be
   removed.

   We shall go to our subject at once, asking aid from the Spirit of all
   grace. We will first view the mysterious fact of the fall of the
   angels, and their casting away, for our warning. Then, secondly, we
   shall regard the fact of the hopeless doom of the angels that sinned as
   it stands in contrast to the amazing mercy of the Lord towards men.
   Thus our second head will lead us to view the text for our admiration:
   I hope for the increase of our grateful love and reverent wonder.

   I. First, then, let us consider our text FOR OUR WARNING. "God spared
   not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell." Behold here a
   wonder of wickedness, angels sin; a wonder of justice, God spared them
   not; a wonder of punishment, he cast them down to hell; a wonder of
   future vengeance, for they are reserved unto judgment! Here are deep
   themes, and terrible. Black as tempest are the facts, and flashes of
   terrible lightning flame forth therefrom.

   Let us receive a warning, first, against the deceivableness of sin, for
   whoever we may be, we may never reckon that, on account of our position
   or condition, we shall be free from the assaults of sin, or even
   certain of not being overcome by it. Notice that these who sinned were
   angels in heaven, so that there is no necessary security in the most
   holy position. We know that they were in heavenly places, for it was
   from that high abode that they were cast down to hell, by the terrible
   right hand of the Eternal King. These angels, that kept not their first
   estate, but sinned against God, dwelt with their brethren in the courts
   of the Most High; they seemed to be, as it were, walled round with fire
   to keep out all evil from them. Their communications were only with
   perfect spirits like themselves; but yet, as they were undergoing a
   probation, they were made capable of choosing evil if they willed so to
   do, or of cleaving to good if their hearts were steadfast with their
   God. There were none about them to tempt them to evil; they were, on
   the contrary, surrounded with every good and holy influence: they saw
   God, and abode in his courts, they conversed with seraphim and
   cherubim. Their daily engagements were all of a holy order; worship and
   service were their duty and delight. Their company was select; there
   were no lapsed classes among them to render the moral atmosphere
   impure. They were not only in a paradise, but in the central abode of
   God himself. Yet evil entered into the breasts of angelseven envy,
   ambition, pride, rebellion; and they fell, fell never to rise again,

   "High in the bright and happy throng,
   Satan, a tall archangel sat;
   Amongst the morning stars he sung,
   Till sin destroy'd his heavenly state.
   "'Twas sin that hurled him from his throne.
   Grovelling in fire the rebel lies:
   'How art thou sunk in darkness down,
   Son of the morning, from the skies!'"

   Beloved hearer, this should teach us not to presume upon anything
   connected with our position here below. You may be the child of godly
   parents who watch over you with sedulous care, and yet you may grow up
   to be a man of Belial. You may never enter a haunt of iniquity, your
   journeys may be only to and from the house of God, and yet you may be a
   bond-slave of iniquity. The house in which you live may be none other
   than the house of God and the very gate of heaven through your father's
   prayers, and yet you may yourself live to blaspheme. Your reading may
   be bound up with the Bible; your companions may be of the choicest;
   your talk may concern holy things; you may be as if you were in the
   garden of the Lord, shut in to everything that is good, and every evil
   shut out from you; and yet you may have no part nor lot with the people
   of God. As there were a Ham and an ungodly Canaan even in Noah's Ark,
   so may it turn out that you may be such in the very midst of all that
   should make you gracious and sanctified. It is unhappy indeed to read
   the annals of human life, and to meet with men that have gone from
   their mother's sidehave gone from where their father knelt in
   prayerhave gone out from brothers and sisters whose piety was not only
   unquestionable, but even remarkable,and they have gone to be leaders
   in every form of wickedness. Many of the enemies of the cross of Christ
   have been so trained in godliness that we find it hard to believe that
   they can indeed be so vile; an apostle must declare it with tears ere
   he is believed. The sons of God they seemed to be, but they turned out
   to be sons of perdition after all. Let no man, therefore, arise and
   shake himself, as though no sins could ever bind him, because he feels
   himself to be a very Samson through his connections and surroundings.
   Yes, sir, it may be that you shall fallfall foully, fall desperately,
   unless the grace of God be in youfall so as never to come to God, and
   Christ, and find eternal life. It was so with these angels. The best
   natural thing that creation can work is not sufficient to preserve the
   fickle creature from sin: regeneration must come inthe work of the
   Holy Ghost, a yet higher work than the material creating power of God,
   or else you may put the creature where you please, and that creature
   may be perfect, and yet sin will reach and destroy him. You and I are
   far from perfect. We are not angels unfallen: we are not angels at all;
   but we have evil hearts within us; therefore let us not imagine for a
   moment that the most select position can screen us from the worst of
   sin.

   The next thought is that the greatest possible ability, apparently
   consecrated, is still nothing to rely upon as a reason why we should
   not yet fall so low as to prostitute it all to the service of the worst
   of evils. Angels are beings of remarkable power. We know that they have
   amazing intelligence and beauty. We read of one whose face was like
   that of an angel of God. When a thing is spoken of as being exceedingly
   good, it is often connected with angels: "men did eat angels' food." It
   is supposed that everything with regard to them is of superior order
   and of refined quality. I suppose that a spirit that is not cumbered
   with flesh and blood, as we are, must be delivered from much that
   hampers and beclouds. Oftentimes a clear judgment is dimmed by a
   headache, or an attack of indigestion. Anything that affects the body
   drags down the mind; but these angelic beings are delivered from such
   weakness, and they are clothed with a glory of strength, and beauty,
   and power.

   Hear then and observe! However great Lucifer was, he degenerated into
   Satan: the Son of the Morning became Apollyon the Destroyer. However
   excellent the fallen angels may once have been, they have now become
   potent only for mischief; their wisdom has curdled into cunning, and
   their strength has soured into a vicious force; so that no man may say
   within himself, "I am a clear thinker, therefore I shall never become a
   blaspheming infidel;" or, "I am gifted in prayer, therefore I shall
   never become a blasphemer." You know not what you may become. There is
   a great difference between gift in prayer and grace in prayer: gift
   will breed pride, and pride will ensure destruction; it is only grace
   that can preserve unto eternal glory. There is also a great difference
   between office and person; therefore, a man may not say, "I am a
   minister: I shall be kept faithful in the church of God." Ah me! But we
   have seen leaders turn aside, and we need not marvel; for if angels
   fall, what man may think that he can stand? To trust our office as a
   security is to rest upon a broken reed. The grace of God can keep the
   least and weakest of us; but apart from that heavenly power how dare
   any man hope to be preserved to the end? Self-confidence is the
   beginning of declension. He that reckons that he is past temptation, is
   already entangled in its net. We must never presume. Angels fell: why
   should not men? An angel occupies a high position near the throne of
   God: "Are they not all ministering spirits?" We have evidence in
   Scripture that they are called on grand occasions to discharge high
   commissions for the King of kings. And yet these courtiers, these
   household messengers of the palace of heaven, these domestics of glory,
   even these went astray, and fell, and turned to devils. Let no man
   dream that because he occupies an office in the church his salvation is
   therefore secure: an apostle fell. The arrows of the prince of darkness
   can reach the highest seats of the synagogue. The high places of the
   field of service are not free from danger; nay, they are the more
   perilous as they are the more notable. The powers of darkness make
   their direst onset upon the foremost soldiers of the cross, hoping to
   overthrow the standard-bearers, and create confusion throughout the
   camp.

   Neither, dear friendsto continue my warningmust any of us suppose
   that we shall be kept by the mere fact that we are engaged in the
   sublimest possible office. Apart from the perpetual miracle of God's
   grace, nothing can keep us from declension, apostacy, and spiritual
   death. "Oh, but I spend my time," one may say"I spend my time wholly
   in the service of God! I go from door to door seeking the lost souls of
   men, as a city missionary"; or "I conduct a large class in the school,
   and I have brought many to the Savior." All this is good; but if thou
   trustest in it for thy standing before God it will certainly fail thee.
   If any one of us were to say, "But I am a minister, called to offer
   prayer, and to preach the precious word: my engagements are so
   sanctified, they bring me into such hallowed fellowship with holy
   things, that it is not possible that I should fall,"this would be the
   height of folly. We need not go beyond the pale of professed ministers
   of Christ to find specimens of every infamy of which man is capable.
   After having preached to others there is grave cause for trembling lest
   we be castaways ourselves. No, there is nothing in the most sacred
   office in the church to preserve us or our characters. Office, if we
   trust in it, may even become, as in the case of Judas, a Tarpeian rock,
   from which we may be cast down to our destruction; for the angelic
   office in heaven did not keep the angels from being hurled over the
   battlements of glory when once they dared to sin. Let not the angels of
   the churches hope to be kept from falling unless he that beareth the
   seven stars in his right hand shall keep them even to the end.

   I want you to notice, as a great warning, that this sin of the angels
   was not prevented! even by the fullest happiness. Oh, what a change,
   dear friends, from the joy they once knew, when they were the servants
   of God, to being cast down to hell in chains of darkness, as they now
   are! The devils go about the world tempting men, but they are never
   released from their darkness. They cannot escape from the prison which
   they make for themselvesthe blackness and horror of God's judgment
   which always shuts them in, be they where they may. What a difference
   between that and the throne of God, and the vision thereof, which was
   once their joy! The service of God was once theirs, but now the slavery
   of evil holds them in iron bonds. Once they took delight in the high
   praises of their Creator, and now they curse him in their heart of
   hearts. Once, on high days, when the servants of God came together,
   they sang for joy as they beheld new worlds created by their great Lord
   and King; now, everything he does is as gall and wormwood to them. They
   curse him and themselves, and they are busily occupied always in
   seeking to pull down his kingdom, and to quench his light among the
   sons of men. Oh, the misery of these old offenders! They once were
   supremely happybut this happiness of theirs did not suffice to
   preserve their fidelity. The most golden wages will not keep a servant
   loyal to the kindest of masters. The most blessed experience will not
   preserve a soul from sinning. You may come here and be greatly blessed
   under a sermon, and sweetly sing, and pray with intense fervor, and
   seem carried up to the gates of heaven by itbut do remember that no
   feelings of joy or happiness can be relied upon as sufficient holdfasts
   to keep us near the Lord. We have seen men drink of the cup of the Lord
   till they appeared to be full of love to him; and yet they have gone
   back to be drunken with the cup of devils. We have known men preach the
   gospel, and yet afterwards blaspheme every truth of revelation, and
   deny the inspiration of the Book of God. We have known them appear to
   be among the holiest and the best, and yet they have come at last to be
   common frequenters of the most evil haunts of the city, and to be
   ringleaders in folly. Is not this a dreadful thing, and should it not
   be a warning to every one of us? "Let him that thinketh he standeth
   take heed lest he fall." There is one who is able to keep us from
   falling, and to present us faultless before his presence with exceeding
   great joy; but if we do not trust in him, and abide in him, we shall
   perish. If we dare to confide in our position, our ability, our office,
   our service, or our experience, we shall, sooner or later, discover
   that we are prone to sin, and that when we sin God will not spare us
   any more than he spared the angels that sinned.

   This warning, be it noted, applies itself to the very foulest of sin.
   The angels did not merely sin and lose heaven, but they passed beyond
   all other beings in sin, and made themselves fit denizens for hell.
   When Christ was describing the most wicked of men, he said that he was
   a devil. "One of you is a devil," was his expression; for the devil is
   the wickedest form of existence. Now, is it not singular that after
   being in heaven it remained possible for an angel to become so dreadful
   a being as a devil in hell now is? If any of us come very near to the
   kingdom, and yet the life of God is not in us; if we are joined with
   the church of God, and perform holy duties, and yet we depend upon
   ourselves, and so fall into sin, we may fall into the foulest of sins.
   I do not think that Judas could have been what he was if he had not
   been an apostle. The best of that which looks like goodness must be
   used as the raw material with which to make a traitor who will sell his
   Master. The devils have gone into open war with God: the same beings
   that once bowed before his awful majesty are now openly and defiantly
   at war with the God that made them. They once could sing their chorales
   with delight, and day without night circle the throne of God
   rejoicingly, but now they blaspheme, and rage, and rave against all
   that is good in earth or heaven. They go about like roaring lions
   seeking whom they may devour,even they who once would have been
   ministering spirits, eager to save and bless. They were once loyal
   subjects, but now they are traitors, rebels, seducers. They try to lead
   the people of God astray; they do their utmost to stir up sin in every
   human bosom. So bad have they become that their leader actually met the
   Son of God himself, and tempted him to fall down and worship him. Was
   ever such infamous, such infernal impudence as for the devil himself to
   ask the eternal Son of God to do him homage? O base proposal, that the
   purity of the Most High should bow itself before the impiety of a
   fallen spirit! Yet, so far have devils proceeded that in them evil has
   reached its ripeness and maturity. Let this be a lesson to us. I must
   not for a moment think that apart from the keeping of God's Spirit I am
   incapable even of the foulest sin. Recall the story of Hazael. When the
   prophet told him what he would do, he exclaimed in amazement, "Is thy
   servant a dog that he should do this thing?" He was not only dog enough
   to seek the Syrian throne, but he was devil enough to suffocate his
   master with a wet cloth, and then to carry out with eagerness all those
   terrible deeds of barbarity which the prophet had foretold. We may yet
   do horrible deeds which we think ourselves incapable of doing. How much
   of devil there lies within the unregenerate heart no man can tell. O my
   unrenewed hearer, I would not slander thee, but I must warn thee: there
   are all the makings of a hell within thy heart! It only needs that the
   restraining hand of God should be removed, and thou wouldst come out in
   thy true colors, and those are the colors of iniquity. If it were not
   for the restraints of society and providence, there would be eruptions
   of evil, even in the most moral, sufficient to shake society to its
   foundations. An officer in India had tamed a leopard. From the time
   when it was quite a kitten he had brought it up, till it went about the
   house like a cat, and everybody played with it; but he was sitting in
   his chair one day asleep, and the leopard licked his handlicked it in
   all innocence; but as he licked, the skin was broken, and the taste of
   blood came to the leopard, and from that moment it was not content to
   dwell with men. It rushed forth to kill, and was no more at ease till
   it reached the jungle. That leopard, though tamed, was a leopard still.
   So a man, sobered by moral motives, but unchanged in heart, is a fallen
   man still, and the taste of blood, I mean the taste of sin, will soon
   reveal the tiger in him. Wash a Russian, and you find a Tartar; tempt a
   moralist, and you discover a sinner! The thin crust of goodness, which
   is formed by education, soon disappears under temptation. You may be
   everything that looks like good, but except you have been born again
   you are still capable of the direst evil. It does seem a horrible thing
   to me that there should stream from a man's lips the foulest blasphemy,
   and yet he that utters it was once accustomed to sing in the house of
   God, and bow his knee with the saints. O God, that ever a creature
   bidding fair to serve his Maker, should sink to such a depth! Yet such
   horrors abound! The vessel which adorned the lordly festival is broken
   and thrown on the dunghill, and even so the excellent and honorable are
   defiled and cast away. I know what some are whispering, "I never should
   become an open reprobate I" How know you that? You already question the
   warnings of Scripture, you may go further before long. He that is the
   most sure is the most insecure; but he that cries, "Hold thou me up,"
   shall be made to stand. Be this our confession, "O Lord, I know that I
   shall become utterly vile except thy sovereign grace prevent! "In
   humility let us cast ourselves upon the mighty grace of God, and we
   shall be kept. In fervent earnestness let us cry to the strong for
   strength, and we shall not be overcome of evil. He that presumes shall
   fall; he that confides shall stand.

   The text may lead us a little farther before we leave it, by giving us
   a warning against the punishment of sin as well as against the sin
   itself. Read this,"God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
   them down to hell." They were very great; they were very powerful; but
   God did not spare them for that. If sinners are kings, princes,
   magistrates, millionaires, God will cast them into hell. If they were
   commanders of all the forces of the world, he that is a just and
   righteous judge would not spare them because of their dignities and
   powers. "God spared not the angels," why should he spare you, ye great
   ones of the earth? They were very numerous, too. I do not know how many
   there were, but we read of legions of devils on one occasion. But God
   did not spare angelic sinners because there were so many of them: he
   made room in hell for them all; and set them in darkness and in bonds,
   every one of them. God will not spare sinful men because of their
   millions: "the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations
   that forget God." Be they few or many, sinners must be punished, and
   God will not turn away his wrath from those who do iniquity. God did
   not spare the rebel angels because of their unity. I never heard of
   devils quarrelling: it is very wonderful in Scripture to notice their
   unanimitytheir concord with one another; but "though hand join in
   hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished." You unbelievers may
   combine together to hate and oppose the gospel, but it matters not, God
   will deal with your confederacies and break up your unities, and make
   you companions in hell even as you have been comrades in sin. "God
   spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell."

   Neither did he spare them because of their craft. There were never such
   subtle creatures as these areso wise, so deep, so crafty; but these
   serpents and all the brood of them had to feel the power of God's
   vengeance, notwithstanding their cunning. Men often escape at the bar
   of their country because of their long-headed ways of evading the law;
   they keep within legal bounds, and yet are great villains; or if they
   go over the line they hire a clever tongue to plead for them, be they
   as guilty as they may, and through crafty pleading they escape from a
   righteous sentence. Thus is it with men, but no counsellors can pervert
   judgment with the Most High. He will deal out justice even to a hair's
   breadth, and he will by no means spare the guilty. "God spared not the
   angels that sinned:" why should he spare any guilty son of Adam? Be
   sure that he will not spare any one of us, if we live in sin. Unless we
   accept the way of salvation by Jesus Christ our sin will find us out,
   and God will find our sin out, and he will cast us also down to the
   place prepared for the devil and his angels. Let the flatterers of
   to-day preach what they may, the Lord will punish men who live and die
   in their sins. He spared not the angels that sinned; certainly he will
   not spare men if they sin. Let this stand as a warning to us.

   II. But now I want to carry you on and ask all your attention to this
   second point for OUR ADMIRATION.

   I want you to admire, dear friends, the fact that though angels fell
   the saints of God are made to stand. The angels sinned fatally; but the
   saints of God "cannot sin, for they are born of God." You know the
   sense in which the apostle means that; not that we do not all sin, but
   that we do not so sin as to depart from the living God, give up our
   allegiance to him, and cease to be his loving children. No. "He keepeth
   himself," says the Scripture, "and that wicked one toucheth him not."
   But what a wonder it is! I tell you, when the tales of God's people
   shall be written, and the records of the saints shall be read by the
   light of glory, we shall be miracles of grace to ourselves and to one
   another. "Oh," we shall say, "I had almost gone, but the hand of grace
   interposed, and snatched me from slipping over the awful precipice. My
   mind almost consented to that sin, and yet I was able to cry out, 'How
   can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?' There was great
   stress of weather, and my poor barque was almost on the rocks; but
   still, though I grazed the bottom, yet I did not make shipwreck." "Oh,
   if I had been left at that moment," one will say, "what would have
   become of me? Though I had tasted of the heavenly gift, and the powers
   of the world to come, yet, had I been left to myself at that hour, I
   should have so fallen that I could never again have been brought to
   repentance. But I was kept; preserved by as great a miracle as if a
   spark should fall into the sea and yet burn on, or a straw should be
   blown into a heated furnace and should not be consumed, or a moth
   should be trodden on by a giant and yet remain uncrushed.

   "Kept alive with death so near,
   I to God the glory give."

   To think that men should stand where angels fall! We are by sovereign
   grace called to be as near to God as the angels ever were, and in some
   respects we are nearer still. We are the body-guard of Christ, his
   chosen ones with whom he communes. We are the table companions of our
   Lordwe eat of his bread, and drink of his cup, and are made partakers
   with him. We are lifted up to be one with him, and are made to be
   "members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones;" yet God's eternal
   unbounded power keeps us in the day of temptation, and leads us so that
   if we go through the rivers we are not drowned, and when we pass
   through the fires we are not burned. O, the splendor of triumphant
   grace! Neither the glory of our calling, nor the unworthiness of our
   original, shall cause us to be traitors; we shall neither perish
   through pride nor lust; but the new nature within us shall overcome all
   sin, and abide faithful to the end.

   "Now, unto him that is able to keep us from falling, unto him be honor
   and glory, and dominion and power for ever and ever." I cannot look
   back on my past life without feeling the tears rush into my eyes at the
   remembrance of how I have been preserved in the trial-hour. We could
   not possibly tell, nor would we wish to tell in public, of those hours
   of weakness, those times of strong delusion, those moments of
   foot-slipping and of heart-fainting, which have happened to us. We
   grieve as we remember our worse than childish weaknesses. And yet we
   have not stained our garments; we have not dishonored the holy name by
   which we are named; we have not been suffered to turn aside from the
   straightness of our path so as to bring grief to the Holy Ghost and
   dishonor to the Church of God. Verily this is a wonder. Mr. Bunyan
   tells us that Christian by the light of day looked back on the Valley
   of the Shadow of Death which he had passed through in the nighttime,
   and saw what a narrow path he had kept, and what a quay there was on
   one side, and what a miry place on the other, and where the hobgoblins
   were, and all the fiends of hell. When he looked back on it he was lost
   in admiration and gratitude. So it must be, and will be with you if
   through a dangerous way you have yet held on in your plain course, and
   have not turned from your integrity. We shall be brim full of gratitude
   and love. Grace shall reign unto eternal life. Redeemed men shall stand
   where angels fall, for God shall keep them. He is able to hold them up,
   and he will do it even to the end.

   Now, let us learn another lesson full of admiration, and that is that
   God should deal in grace with men and not with angels.

   "From heaven the sinning angels fell,
   And wrath and darkness chained them down;
   But man, vile man, forsook his bliss,
   And mercy lifts him to a crown.
   "Amazing work of sovereign grace
   That could distinguish rebels so!
   Our guilty treasons called aloud
   For everlasting fetters too."

   Now, you that do not believe in the doctrine of election, but kick at
   it, and bite your lips at the mention of it, listen to this! God gave
   fallen angels no Savior, no gospel, no space for repentance, yet he
   gives these to men: why is this? What reason was there? Can you
   conceive one? Why did God pass the fallen angels by, and yet look in
   love upon the sons of men? "Oh," says one, "perhaps fallen angels were
   the greater offenders of the two." I do not think it; certainly many
   men go far to rival devils in rebellion.

   "Perhaps men were tempted and angels were not." Stop, let us be clear
   on this point. Very likely Satan, the first angel that fell, was not
   tempted; but just as likely all the others were. Their leader tempted
   them as much as Eve tempted Adam, or the serpent tempted Eve. The mass
   of fallen angelhood may have been seduced by the example of Satan, the
   Prince of devils. I do not therefore see any great difference as to
   that matter. This I do know, that some men are greater sinners than
   devils. "No," say you, "how is that?" I answer that the devil never yet
   rejected free grace and dying love; the devil never yet struggled
   against the Holy Spirit in his own conscience; the devil never yet
   refused the mercy of God. These supreme pinnacles of wickedness are
   only reached by you who are hearers of the gospel, and yet cast its
   precious message behind your backs. Singular it is that God should deal
   in mercy with men who act so wickedly, while yet he never discoursed of
   mercy to the fallen angels, nor set before them terms of peace. They
   were given over there and then to be bound in chains of darkness until
   the judgment of the last great day.

   Notice that God gave the angels no respite. He did not wait for them to
   continue in sin for years; but when they sinned, they fell. The
   punishment followed hard on the crime. They cast God out of their
   hearts, and he cast them out of heaven. How different is his conduct to
   some of you! You have sinned through a series of years. How old are
   you? Twenty years? Thirty? Forty? Fifty? Sixty? Seventy? Is it eighty
   years that you have lived in rebellion against God? And yet he has not
   cut you down! Wonderful patience! The angels he banished from his
   presence at once. He spared not the angels, but he has spared you. Why
   is this?

   The Lord never entered into any parley with the angelsnever invited
   them to repentance or to mercy. Oh, but what parleys God has had with
   some of you! I am not the only one who has entreated and persuaded you,
   but yet with some of you I have pleaded very earnestly that you would
   turn from the error of your ways and livethat you would believe in
   Christ and find eternal life. But why should the Lord treat concerning
   peace with men and not with fallen angels?

   For the angels God never made a covenant of grace, "ordered in all
   things and sure." They broke their covenant of works, and they fell
   never to rise again. For the angels there was never a sacrifice: no
   dying Son of God for them: no bloody sweat and wounded hands and feet
   for them! And yet a great atonement is prepared for men. What
   sovereignty of God's grace is here displayed! He opens the golden gates
   of love for us, and shuts the iron gate on beings nobler than we are.
   The Spirit of God strives with us, but he never strives with fallen
   angels. Devils are left to themselves; but concerning man the Lord
   cries "how can I give thee up?" How justly might God have left us
   alone, for we have been given unto idols, and yet he follows us with
   the admonitions of his mercy.

   For the devils there is no pardon, no hope, no gate of heaven; and yet
   there is all this for men. Oh, dear hearers, do not, I pray you, reject
   these choice gifts of Almighty love. If God is so specially gracious to
   the race of men, let not man become singularly ungrateful to his God,
   presumptuously wanton in his sin. Let us turn unto the Lord with full
   purpose of heart, seeing that he turns to us with such speciality of
   favor.

   I am sure that it is a great wonder and a thing for admiration that God
   should look upon us and not on fallen angels; because, as I have
   already said, angels certainly are not worse sinners than some men have
   been. Angels are not more wilful than we have been, for we have sinned
   against light and knowledge with deliberate intent and purpose.

   Angels are certainly more valuable: if God had wanted one of the two
   races to be employed as his servants, the best would have been chosen,
   and these are not men, but angels. Angels can do more for God than we
   can: yet he has chosen us. Angels must, surely, be more missed than
   men: their downfall made a great gap in heaven. We go there to fill the
   space, and to repair the breach which was made when they were cast down
   from glory. But, surely, it were easier to restore the angels who came
   from heaven than to take up inferior creatures who had never been
   there. If we make a distinction between men in the distribution of our
   charity, we very properly say, "Let us do good to those first who would
   be the most miserable without it." Now, men have never known heaven,
   and consequently cannot so much feel the loss of it as those who have
   been there and have fallen from it. We are like people that have always
   been poor; but the angels have been in heaven, and are therefore like
   wealthy persons who have come down to poverty. What a hell to them to
   be out of heaven! What misery to those spirits to miss the eternal
   glories which they once enjoyed! One would have thought, therefore,
   that God would have restored the angels before he upraised the human
   race. But he has not: he has redeemed us, and left the elder race of
   rebels unrestored. No man knoweth why, and in our amazement we cry,How
   is this? Whence this election of grace?

   Tell me, ye who would leave God no choice, but would deify the will of
   man, what all this means? Where is your proud theory that God is bound
   to treat all alike, as if we had a claim on God? I point you to the
   fallen angels, and what can you say?

   Sometimes princes, when they mean to give pardon according to their
   will, say to themselves, "We will pardon the man who will be most
   dangerous if we leave him to be our enemy." Now, bad as men are, and
   great enemies of God as they become, yet the devil has more power to
   harm God than a man can haveand yet God does not pardon the devil. He
   lets Satan go on with all his dreadful power and do his worst in
   reviling his Lord; and yet the Lord's mercy comes to us whose powers
   are within so narrow a range, compared with the fallen angels; he makes
   choice of puny man to receive his grace.

   One would think that to restore an angel was more easy and more
   agreeable to the plan of the universe than to exalt fallen man. There
   is nothing to do but to put an angel back in his place; but men must be
   taken into a new existence. Christ himself must come and be a man; and,
   to wash away the sin of man, Christ must die; nothing more could have
   been needed had devils been saved. I cannot conceive the salvation of
   angels to be more difficult than the salvation of men. I rather
   conceive it to have been the easier thing of the two if the Lord had so
   willed it. And yet, involving as it did the incarnation of the Son of
   God and his death to make atonement, the infinitely gracious Father
   condescended to ordain that he would take up men, and would not take up
   the fallen angels. It is a marvel: it is a mystery. I put it before you
   for your admiration. Oh, sirs, do not despise it! Let not such amazing
   sovereignty of grace be treated with contempt by any one of us. Talk no
   more about the injustice of the election of certain men, for if you do
   the devils will bear witness that you are cavilling at the royal
   prerogative of the great Lord who saith, "I will have mercy on whom I
   will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
   compassion."

   Now, I think that I see in this a great argument with God's people. Has
   the Lord given up angels and chosen you? It reminds me of that famous
   text, "Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable,
   and I have loved thee. Therefore will I give men for thee, and people
   for thy life. I gave Egypt for thy ransom; Ethiopia and Seba for thee."
   See, he has passed angels by, and he has made choice of us; what a
   height of grace! Behold how he loves us! What shall we do in return?
   Let us do angels' work. Come, brothers and sisters, let us glow with
   such a fire of devotion as might have burned in an auger's heart. Let
   us be as intensely zealous as a redeemed angel might have been. Let us
   glorify God as angels would have done had they been restored and made
   again to taste divine favor and infinite love. What manner of people
   ought we to be? What manner of lives ought we to live? What manner of
   consecration ought to be upon us? Should not our whole being live unto
   God?

   I have given you this somewhat in the rough, for time flies; but think
   it over, and profit by it. Think it over, you ungodly ones, and not
   cast away mercy like this. When you read, "He took not up angels, but
   he took up the seed of Abraham," be full of surprise, and fly at once
   to Jesus. And, O ye saints, as ye read it, say to yourselves

   "For more love than seraphs know
   We will like seraphs burn."

   God bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMONJohn 17.

   HYMNS FROM OUR OWN HYMN BOOK261, 668, 869.

   TO MY CONGREGATION OF HEARERS AND READERS.

   By the great mercy of God I was permitted to leave my house on Tuesday
   and commence my journey to the South of France. It seemed impossible
   for me to recover while in our trying climate, and so, in great
   weakness, I have ventured to make a move. I beg your prayers for my
   recovery, and especially for the sanctification of my grievous pains,
   so that they may turn out to be for God's glory. Week by week I shall
   carefully prepare these Sermons, and I hope they will be attended with
   the divine blessing. In them I hope to keep up my communion with
   thousands of dear friends, though we are divided by many a league.

   Friends at the Tabernacle, I have heard of one enthusiastic friend who
   so misses my ministry that he wished he could fall asleep till I
   return. That is exactly what I hope you will not do. Be doubly alive.
   Seek for a revival of religion: labor for it. Everything passes through
   the fire while the Builder is absent; let it be seen that our building
   is not wood, hay, and stubble, which will disappear, but precious metal
   that will remain to the glory of God. KEEP UP THE PRAYER-MEETINGS.
   Sustain every holy work. Live near to God. Continue in concord. Devote
   yourselves wholly unto the Lord.

   With Christian love to my dear hearers and readers,

   I am yours, for I am Christ's, C. H. SPURGEON.

Cords and Cart-Ropes

   (No. 1821)

   Intended for reading on Lord's-Day, February 8th, 1885,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [6]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On December 14th, 1884,

   "Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it
   were with a cart rope." Isaiah 5:18.

   THE text begins with "Woe;" but when we get a woe in this book of
   blessings it is sent as a warning, that we may escape from woe. God's
   woes are better than the devil's welcomes. God always means man's good,
   and only sets ill before him that he may turn from the dangers of a
   mistaken way, and so may escape the ill which lies at the end of it.
   Think me not unkind at this time because my message sounds harshly, and
   has a note in it of sorrow rather than of joy. It may be most for your
   pleasure for ages to come, dear friends, to be for a while displeased.
   It may make the bells ring in your ears for ever if to-night, instead
   of the dulcet sound of the harp, you hear the shrill clarion startling
   you to thoughtfulness. Mayhap "Woe, woe, woe," though it should sound
   with a dreadful din in your ear, may be the means of leading you to
   seek and find your Savior, and then throughout eternity no woe shall
   ever come near to you. May the good Spirit of all grace put power into
   my warning, that you may profit by it.

   This is a very singular text. It is not very easy to understand it at
   first sight. Here are some who are said to draw sin with cords of
   vanity, which are slender enough, and yet they also draw it as with a
   cart-rope, which is thick enough. They are harnessed to sin, and the
   traces appear to be fragile, insignificant, and soon broken. You can
   hardly touch them, for they are a mere sham, a fictionvanity. What can
   be thinner and weaker than cobweb-cords of vanity? Yet when you attempt
   to break or remove them they turn out to be cart-ropes or wagon-traces,
   fitted to bear the pull of horse or bullock. Motives which have no
   logical force, and would not bind a reasonable man for a moment, are,
   nevertheless, quite sufficient to hold the most of men in bondage. Such
   a slave is man to iniquity, that unworthy motives and indefensible
   reasons which appear no stronger than little cords nevertheless hold
   him as with bonds of steel, and he is fastened to the loaded wagon of
   his iniquity as a horse is fastened by a cart-rope. That is our subject
   at this time, and may God make it useful to many. Beyond all things I
   would have you saved, you who are tugging away in the harness of sin.
   God grant it. May the free Spirit set you free.

   I shall first of all explain the singular descriptionexplain it by
   enlarging upon it, and quoting instances from daily life. Secondly, I
   shall enlarge upon the woe that is certainly connected with being bound
   to sin; and then thirdly, as God shall help me, I will encourage you to
   get out of the traces. I pray that you may have these cart-ropes cut,
   that you may not be drawing iniquity and sin after you any longer. Oh
   that this might be salvation's hour to many of you, in which, like
   Samson, you may break the cords and ropes with which you have been
   bound!

   I. First, let us EXPLAIN THE SINGULAR DESCRIPTION. Here are persons
   harnessed to the wagon of sinharnessed to it by many cords, all light
   as vanity and yet strong as cart-ropes.

   Let me give you a picture. Here is a man, who, as a young man, heard
   the gospel and grew up under the influence of it. He is an intelligent
   man, a Bible reader, and somewhat of a theologian. He attended a Bible
   class, was an apt pupil, and could explain much of Scripture, but he
   took to lightness and frothiness. He made an amusement of religion and
   a sport of serious things. Sermons he frequented that he might talk of
   them and say that he had heard the preacher. After the sermon, when
   others were impressed, he was merry. He had discovered some mistake in
   the preacher, in his pronunciation, in the grammatical construction of
   a sentence, or in a misquotation from a poet, and this he mentioned
   with gusto, passing by all the good that was spoken. That was only his
   way: he did not mean any hurt by it; at least, he would have said so
   had any one seriously reproved him.

   He came under the bond of this religious trifling, but it was a cord of
   vanity small as a packthread. Years ago he began to be bound to his sin
   by this kind of trifling, and at the present moment I am not sure that
   he ever cares to go and hear the gospel or to read the word of God, for
   he has grown to despise that which he sported with. The wanton willing
   has degenerated into a malicious scoffer: his cord has become a
   cart-rope. His life is all trifling now. You could not make him
   serious. He spends his time in one perpetual giggle. Every holy thing
   is now the subject of comedy. Like Belshazzar, he drinks his wine out
   of the sacred vessels of the temple. Earnestness hath a pleasantry of
   its own, and a bold spirit yokes mirth and laughter to its own, and
   subdues all the faculties of the mind to God, not even excepting humor;
   but this man owns no Lord within his heart, but laughs at the most
   solemn truths and does not seem capable of anything higher or better.
   His life is a sneer. He would pull a feather out of an angel's wing and
   wear it in his cap. On the solemn day of Pentecost he would have drawn
   a picture of the cloven tongues upon his thumb nail that he might show
   it as a curiosity. There is nothing sacred to him now, nor will there
   be till he is in hell, and then he will have done with his jibes and
   flouts. The habit of being contemptuous has grown to be a cart-rope
   with him, and it holds him most securely. I say, young men, break those
   wretched cords of vanity before they strengthen into cart-ropes. While
   yet there is but a slender thread snap it, before thread gathers to
   thread, and that to another, and that to another, till it has come to
   be a cable, which even a giant could not pull asunder. There are many
   lamentable instances of triflers ripening into scoffers, and it were a
   great pity that you should furnish further illustrations. Avoid
   trifling with religion as you would avoid common swearing or profanity,
   for in its essence it is irreverent and mischievous.

   I have seen the same thing take another shape, and then it appeared as
   captious questioning. We are not afraid to be examined upon anything in
   the Word of God; but we dread a cavilling spirit. I, for one, believe
   that the more the Word of God has been sifted the more fully has it
   been confirmed. The result has been the better understanding of its
   teaching. The pure gold has shone the more brightly for being placed in
   the crucible. But there is a habit which begins thus"I do not see
   this; and I do not understand that; and I do not approve of this and I
   question that." It makes life into a tangle of thorns and briars where
   ten thousand sharp points of doubt are for ever tearing the mind. This
   doubting state reminds one of the old serpent's "Yea, hath God said?"
   If the statement made had been the opposite, the gentleman would have
   questioned it; for he is bound to doubt everything. He is one who could
   take either side and refute; but neither side and defend. He could do
   like the eminent barrister, who had made a mistake as to his side of
   the case, and he got up and gave all the arguments most tellingly, till
   his client's lawyer whispered to him, "You have done for us, you have
   used all the arguments against your own client." The barrister stopped
   and said, "My lord, I have thus told you all that can be urged against
   my client by those upon the other side, and I will now show you that
   there is nothing in the allegations;" and with equal cleverness he went
   on to disprove what he had proved before. There are minds constructed
   in such a way that they can act in every way except that of plain up
   and down. Their machinery is eccentric, it would puzzle the ablest
   tongue to describe it. I like the old-fashioned consciences that go up
   and down, yes and no, right and wrong, true and falsethe kind which
   are simple and need no great intellect to understand their methods. We
   are growing so cultured now that many have become like the old serpent,
   "more subtle than any beast of the field." The new-fashioned
   consciences act upon the principle of compromise and policy, which is
   no principle at all. To each enquiry they answer, "Yes and no. What is
   the time of day?" for it is yes or no according to the clock, or
   according to the climate, or more generally according to the breeches'
   pocket, for so much depends upon that. Practically many are saying,
   "Upon which side of the bread is the butter? Tell us this, and then we
   will tell you what we believe." People of that sort begin at first with
   an enquiring spirit, then go on to an objecting spirit, then to a
   conceited spirit, and then to a perpetually quibbling spirit. In the
   case to which I refer, there is nothing earnest; for when a man is a
   sincere questioner, and is willing to receive an answer, he is on the
   high road to truth; but when he merely questions and questions and
   questions, and never stops for an answer, and is nothing but a heap of
   cavils, he is not worth clearing away. The last thing he wants is an
   answer, and the thing he dreads beyond everything is that he should be
   compelled to believe anything at all. Such a man at last gets bound as
   with a cart-rope: he becomes an atheist or worse; for all capacity for
   faith departs from him. He is as frivolous as Voltaire, whose forte
   seemed to lie in ridiculing everything. You cannot save him. How can
   faith come to him? How can he believe who must have everything
   explained? How can he believe in Christ himself when he requires him,
   first of all, to be put through a catechism and to be made to answer
   cavils? Oh, take heed of tying up your soul with cart-ropes of
   scepticismtake heed of a truth-denying spirit. God help you to break
   the bonds. Enquire, but believe. Ask, but do accept the truth; and be
   in earnest in your resolve that if you prove all things you will also
   hold fast that which is good. To be always using the sieve but never to
   be using the mill is starving work: to be always searching after
   adulterations, but never to drink of the genuine milk, is a foolish
   habit. Cavilling is a curse, and carping is a crime. Escape from it
   while yet it is but as a cord of vanity, lest it come to be a cart-rope
   which shall bind you fast.

   I hear one say, "This does not touch me. I have not fallen either into
   trifling or into questioning." No, but perhaps you may be a prisoner
   bound with other cords. Some have a natural dislike to religious things
   and cannot be brought to attend to them. Let me qualify the statement
   and explain myself. They are quite prepared to attend a place of
   worship and to hear sermons, and occasionally to read the Scriptures,
   and to give their money to help on some benevolent cause; but this is
   the point at which they draw the linethey do not want to think, to
   pray, to repent, to believe, or to make heart-work of the matter.
   Thinking, you know, is awkward work, and to them it is uncomfortable
   work, because there is not much in their lives that would cheer them if
   they were to think of it. They had rather not see the nakedness of the
   land. There is an ugly thing which they do not want to have much to do
   withcalled repentance: of this they require much, but they are averse
   to it. The more children dislike medicine the more they want it; and it
   is the same with repentance. These people would rather shut their eyes
   and go on to destruction than stop and see their danger and turn back.
   To think about the pastwhy, they might have to mourn it, and who is
   eager after sorrow? Then there is such a thing as a change of heart,
   and they are rather shy of that, for they are almost heartless and do
   not like prying deep. If there were something to be done that could be
   managed in a day or two, if there were some pilgrimage to make, some
   penance to endure, some dress to be worn, they would not mind that; but
   thought, repentance, prayer, and seeking Godthey cannot endure such
   spiritual exactions. If there were some sacrifice to be made, they
   would do that; but this being at peace with God, this seeking to be
   renewed in the spirit of their mindwell, they have no mind to it. The
   world is in their hearts and they have no wish to get it out. They have
   heard some people say that all conversation about God, the soul, and
   eternity is dull Puritanic talk, so they have picked up an expression
   as parrots often do, and they say "No, we do not want to be Puritans.
   We do not care to be extra precise and righteous over much." What a
   misery it is that there should be persons who are bound with such cords
   of vanity as those! These are unreasonable feelings, insane aversions,
   unjustifiable prejudices: the Lord save you from them, and instead
   thereof give you a mind to know him, and a heart to seek after him.
   Why, as a boy, when I began to feel a sense of sin within me, I
   resolved that if there was such a thing as being born again, I would
   never rest until I knew it. My heart seemed set upon knowing what
   repentance meant and what faith meant, and getting to be thoroughly
   saved; but now I find that large numbers of my hearers back out of all
   serious dealing with themselves and God: they act as if they did not
   wish to be made happy for eternity. They think hardly of the good way.
   You see it is such radical work: regeneration cuts so deep, and it
   makes a man so thoughtful. Who knows what may have to be given up? Who
   knows what may have to be done? O, my hearer, if you indulge in such
   demurs and delays and prejudices in the first days of your conviction,
   the time may come when those little packthreads will be so intertwisted
   with each other that they will make a great cart-rope, and you will
   become an opposer of everything that is good, determined to abide for
   ever harnessed to the great Juggernaut car of your iniquities, and so
   to perish. God save you from that.

   I have known some men get harnessed to that car in another way, and
   that is by deference to companions. The young man liked everything that
   was good after a fashion, but he could not bear for anybody to say on
   Monday morning, "So you were at a place of worship on Sunday." He did
   not like to say outright, "Of course I was; where were you?" But the
   rather he said,Well, he did look in at the chapel, or he did go to St.
   Paul's or the Abbey to hear the music. "Oh," says one, "I hear you were
   at the Tabernacle the other day." Yes, he went in from curiosity, just
   to see the place and the crowd. That is how he puts it, as if he were
   ashamed to worship his Maker and to be found observing the Sabbath-day.
   O, poor coward! That young man at another time was charged with having
   been seen in the enquiry room, or weeping under a solemn sermon. He
   said it was rather affecting, and he was a little carried away and
   over-persuaded, but he apologised to the devil and begged that he might
   hear no more of it. He began giving way to his ungodly friends, and
   soon he became their butt. One companion pulled his ear that way, and
   another pulled his ear another way, and in this manner he developed
   very long ears indeed. He did not go very far wrong at first; but
   having allowed sinful men to saddle him, they took care to ride him
   harder and harder as the days ran on. It was only a packthread sort of
   business that held him to sin by a kind of wicked courtesy; but after a
   while he became obsequious to his equals, and fawned upon his
   superiors, doing their bidding even though it cost him his soul. He was
   vastly more attentive to the will and smile of some downright vicious
   comradefar more thoughtful of a fool's opinionthan he was of the good
   pleasure of God. It is a shocking thing; but there is no doubt that
   many people go to hell for the love of being respectable. It is not to
   be doubted that multitudes pawn their souls, and lose their God and
   heaven, merely for the sake of standing well in the estimation of a
   profligate. Young women have lost their souls for very vanity, sinning
   in the hope of securing the love of a brainless, heartless youth. Young
   men have flung away all hope of salvation in order that they might be
   thought to be men of culturethey have abjured faith in order to be
   esteemed "free-thinkers" by those whose opinions were not worth a pin's
   head. I charge you, dear friend, if you are beginning at all to be a
   slave of other people, break these wretched and degrading bonds. I
   scorn that mental slavery in which many glory. What matters it to me
   to-day what anybody thinks of me? In this respect I am the freest of
   men. Yet do I know times when, had I yielded to the packthread, I
   should soon have felt the cart-rope. He who sins to please his friend
   is making for himself a slavery more cruel than the negro ever knew. He
   that would be free for ever must break the cords ere yet they harden
   into chains.

   Some men are getting into bondage in another way; they are forming
   gradual habits of evil. How many young men born and bred amid Christian
   associations do that! It is a little sip, and such a little. "I do not
   take above half a glass." Then why run such great risks for so small an
   indulgence? "The doctor"O you doctors, what you have got to answer
   for!"the doctor says I ought to take a little, and so I do." By-and-by
   the little thread becomes a cart-rope: the tale about the doctor ends
   in doing what no doctor would justify. Will he say, "The doctor says I
   ought" when he comes rolling home at night, scarce can find his way to
   bed, and wakes up with a headache in the morning? He would have done
   better to ask God for grace to escape while yet he held small pleasure
   in the fascinating fire-water, and was the master of his appetite. The
   cart-rope is hard to break, as many have found, though I would
   encourage even these by God's grace to struggle for liberty.

   "Well," says the young man, "that is not my sin." I am glad it is not;
   but any other sin if it be persevered in will destroy you. I will not
   try to describe your sin. Describe it yourself, and think over it; but
   will you please recollect the deceitfulness of sinthe way in which it
   comes to men, as the frost in the still evening in the wintry months
   comes to the lake? The pool is placid, and the frost only asks that it
   may thinly glaze the surface. The coating is so thin, you could scarce
   call it ice; but having once filmed the pool, the sheet of ice has
   commenced; soon it is an inch thick, and in a few hours a loaded wagon
   might pass over it without a crash, for the whole pool seems turned to
   marble. So men give way to one evil passion or anotherthis vice or
   that; and the habit proceeds from bad to worse, till the cords of
   vanity are enlarged into cart-traces, and they cannot escape from the
   load to which they are harnessed.

   I fear that not a few are under the delusive notion that they are safe
   as they are. Carnal security is made up of cords of vanity. How can a
   sinner be safe while his sin is unforgiven? How can he be at peace
   while he is a slave to evil, and an enemy to God? Yet many fancy that
   they are as good as need be, and far better than their neighbors.
   Surely such as they are must surely be secure, since they are so
   respectable, so well inclined, and so much thought of. A man may
   accustom himself to danger till he does not even notice it, and a soul
   may grow used to its condition till it sees no peril in impenitence and
   unbelief. As the blacksmith's dog will lie down and sleep while the
   sparks fly about him, so will a gospel-hardened sinner sleep on under
   warnings and pleadings. At first the hearer had to do violence to his
   conscience to escape from the force of truth, but at last he is encased
   in steel, and no arrow of the word can wound him. O ye that are at ease
   in Zion, I beseech you listen to my admonition and fly from carnal
   security. O Lord, arouse them from their slumbering condition!

   This is a word of warning. I have not the time to-night to go into all
   the details. I wish I had. Beware of the eggs of the cockatrice.
   Remember how drops wear stones, and little strokes fell great oaks. Do
   not play with a cobra, even if it be but a foot long. Keep from the
   edge of the precipice. Fly from the lion ere he springs upon you. Do
   not forge for yourself a net of iron, nor become the builder of your
   own prison-house. May the Holy Ghost deliver you. May you touch the
   cross, and find in it the power which will loose you and let you go.

   II. But, oh, how I wish that every person here who has not yet found
   liberty, but is harnessed to his sin, could escape to-night, forand
   this is my second pointTHERE IS A WOE ABOUT REMAINING HARNESSED TO THE
   CART OF SIN, and that woe is expressed in our text.

   It has been hard work already to tug at sin's load. If I am addressing
   any here that have fallen into great sin, I know that you have fallen
   into great sorrow. I am sure you have. Much of history is happily
   covered with a veil so that its secret griefs do not become open
   miseries, else were the world too wretched for a tender heart to live
   in it. Could we lift the tops of the houses, could we exhibit the
   skeletons hidden in closets, could we take away the curtains from human
   breastswhat sorrows we should see; and the mass of those sorrowsnot
   the whole of them, but the masswould be found to come from sin. When
   the young man turns to paths of unchastity or of dishonesty, what grief
   he makes for himself: what woe, what misery! His bodily disease, his
   mental anguish we have no heart to describe. Ah! yes, "The way of
   transgressors is hard." They put on a smile; they even take to
   uproarious laughter, but a worm is gnawing at their hearts. Alas, poor
   slaves! They make a noise as they try to drown their feelings; but as
   the crackling of thorns under a pot such is the mirth of the
   wickedhasty, noisy, momentary; gone, and nothing but ashes left. I
   would not have you proceed in the path of sin if there were nothing in
   it worse than what has happened to you already. Surely the time past
   may suffice for folly: you have reaped enough of the fire-sheaves
   without going on with the harvest. I would as a brother urge you to
   escape from your present bondage.

   But remember, if you remain harnessed to this car of sin, the weight
   increases. You are like a horse that has to go a journey and pick up
   parcels at every quarter of a mile: you are increasing the heavy
   luggage and baggage that you have to drag behind you. A man starting in
   life is somewhat like a horse with but a slender load in the cart, but
   as he goes on from youth to manhood, and from manhood to his riper
   years, he has been loaded up with more sin; and what a weight there is
   behind him now! Grinning devils, as they bring the heavy packages and
   heap them up one upon another, must wonder that men are such fools as
   to continue in the harness and drag on the dreadful load as if it were
   fine sport. Alas, that men should sin away their souls so lightly, as
   if self-destruction were some merry game that they were playing at,
   whereas it is a heaping up unto themselves wrath against the day of
   wrath, and the perdition of ungodly men.

   Further, I want you to notice that as the load grows heavier, so the
   road becomes worse, the ruts are deeper, the hills are steeper, and the
   sloughs are more full of mire. In the heyday of youth man finds beaded
   bubbles about the brim of his cup of sin, the wine moveth itself
   aright, it giveth its color in the cup; but as he grows older and
   drinks deeper he comes nearer to the dregs, and those dregs are as gall
   and wormwood. An old man with his bones filled with the sin of his
   youth is a dreadful sight to look upon; he is a curse to others, and a
   burden to himself. A man who has fifty years of sin behind him is like
   a traveler pursued by fifty howling wolves. Do you hear their deep bay
   as they pursue the wretch? Do you see their eyes glaring in the dark,
   and flaming like coals of fire? Such a man is to be pitied indeed:
   whither shall he flee, or how shall he face his pursuers? He who goes
   on carelessly when he knows that such a fate awaits him is a fool, and
   deserves small pity when the evil day comes. O you that are drawing the
   wagon of sin, I implore you stop before you reach the boggy ways of
   infirmity, the tremendous swamps of old age!

   Remember, friends, if any of you are still harnessed to your sins, and
   have been so for years, the day will come when the load will crush the
   horse. It is a dreadful thing when the sins which were drawn at last
   drive the drawer before them. In the town where I was brought up there
   is a very steep hill. You could scarcely get out of the town without
   going down a hill, but one is specially precipitous, and I remember
   once hearing a cry in the streets, for a huge wagon had rolled over the
   horses that were going down the hill with it. The load had crushed the
   creatures that were supposed to draw it. There comes a time with a man
   when it is not so much he that consumes the drink as the drink that
   consumes him; he is drowned in his cups, sucked down by that which he
   himself sucked in. A man was voracious, perhaps, in food, and at last
   his gluttony swallowed him; at one grim morsel he went down the throat
   of the old dragon of selfish greed. Or the man was lustful, and at last
   his vice devoured him. It is an awful thing when it is not the man that
   follows the devil, but the devil that drives the man before him as
   though he were his laden ass. The man's worst self, that had been kept
   in the rear and put under restraint, at last gets up and comes to the
   front, and the better self, if ever he had such, is dragged on an
   unwilling captive at the chariot wheels of its destroyer.

   I am sure that there is nobody here who desires to be eternally a
   sinner: let him then beware, for each hour of sin brings its hardness
   and its difficulty of change. Nobody here wants to get into such a
   condition that he cannot help any longer sinning: let him not be so
   unwise as to play with sin. When the moral brakes are taken off, and
   the engine is on the down-grade, and must run on at a perpetually
   quickening rate for ever, then is the soul lost indeed. I am sure there
   is not a man here who wants to commit himself to an eternity of hate of
   God, an eternity of lust, an eternity of wickedness and consequent
   wretchedness. Why then do you continue to harden your hearts? If you do
   not wish to rush down the decline, put on the brake to-night: God help
   you so to do; or, to come back to the text, let the packthreads be
   broken, and the cords of vanity be thrown aside, ere yet the cart-rope
   shall have fastened you for ever to the Juggernaut car of your sin and
   your destruction.

   III. Now I want to offer SOME ENCOURAGEMENT FOR BREAKING LOOSE. It is
   time I did. I do not wish to preach a sad unhappy sermon to-night; but
   I do long to see everybody here saved from sin. My heart cries to God
   that as long as I am able to preach, I may not preach in vain. God
   knows I have never shunned to speak what I have thought, and to speak
   very plainly and very home to you. I never come into this pulpit with
   the notion that I must not say a sharp thing, or somebody will be
   offended, and I must not deal with common sins, for somebody will say
   that I am coarse. I care not the snap of a finger what you choose to
   say about me, if you will but forsake sin and be reconciled to God by
   the death of his Son. That is the one and only thing my heart craves,
   and for that end I have given earnest warnings at this time. I may not
   much longer be spared to speak with you, and therefore I am the more
   earnest to impress you while I may. Help me, O Spirit of God!

   Now, listen. There is hope for every harnessed slave of Satan. There is
   hope for those who are most securely bound. "Oh," you say, "I am afraid
   that I have got into the cart-rope stage; for I seem bound to perish in
   my sin, I cannot break loose from it." Listen. Jesus Christ has come
   into the world to rescue those who are bound with chains. That is to
   say, God himself has taken upon himself human nature, with this
   designthat he may save men from their sins. That blessed, perfect
   babe, such as never mother before had ever seen,that virgin's
   childwhen they named him, it was said, "Thou shalt call his name
   Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." He has come to
   this world in our nature on purpose to save men from their sins. He can
   cut the traces which bind you to Satan's chariot. He can take you out
   of the shafts. He can set you free to-night. You have been dragging on
   for years, and you think there is no chance for youbut there is more
   than a chance, there is the certainty of salvation if you trust in
   Jesus. I remember reading a famous writer's description of a wretched
   cab-horse which was old and worn out and yet kept on its regular round
   of toil. They never took him out of harness for fear they should never
   be able to get his poor old carcase into it again. He had been in the
   shafts for so many years that they feared if they took him out of them
   he would fall to pieces, and so they let him keep where he was
   accustomed to be. Some men are just like that. They have been in the
   shafts of sin so many years that they fancy that if they were once to
   alter they would drop to pieces. But it is not so, old friend. We are
   persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation.
   The Lord will make a new creature of you. When he cuts the traces and
   brings you out from between those shafts which have so long held you,
   you will not know yourself. When old things have passed away you will
   be a wonder unto many. Is it not said of Augustine that after his
   conversion he was met by a fallen woman who had known him in his sin,
   and he passed her by? She said, "Austin, it is I;" and he turned and
   said, "But I am not Austin. I am not the man you once knew, for I have
   become a new creature in Christ Jesus." That is what the Lord Jesus
   Christ can do for you. Do you not believe it? It is true, whether you
   believe it or not. Oh that you would look to Jesus and begin to live!
   It is time a change was made; is it not? Who can change you but the
   Lord Jesus?

   Let me tell you another thing that ought to cheer you, and it is this.
   You are bound with the cords of sin, and in order that all this sin of
   yours might effectually be put away, the Lord Jesus, the Son of the
   Highest, was himself bound. They took him in the garden of Gethsemane,
   and bound his hands, and led him off to Pilate and Herod. They brought
   him bound before the Roman governor. He was bound when they scourged
   him. He was bound when they brought him forth bearing his cross. He was
   fastened hand and foot as they drove in the nails, and thus fixed him
   with rivets of iron to his cross. There did he hang, fastened to the
   cruel tree, for sinners such as you are. If you come and trust him
   to-night you shall find that for you he endured the wrath of God, for
   you he paid the penalty of death, that he might set you free. He bore
   it that you should not bear it: he died for you that you might not die.
   His substitution shall be your deliverance. Oh, come, all bound and
   guilty as you are, and look to his dear cross, and trust yourself with
   him; and you shall be set free.

   God grant that it may be done at this very moment.

   I will tell thee another cheering fact to help thee to overcome thy
   sin, and break the cart-ropes that now bind thee,There is in the world
   a mysterious Being whom thou knowest not, but whom some of us know, who
   is able to work thy liberty. There dwells upon this earth a mysterious
   Being, whose office it is to renew the fallen, and restore the
   wandering. We cannot see him, or hear him, yet he dwells in some of us,
   as Lord of our nature. His chosen residence is a broken heart and a
   contrite spirit. That most powerful Being is God, the third person of
   the blessed Trinity, the Holy Ghost, who was given at Pentecost and who
   has never been recalled, but remains on earth to bless the people of
   God. He is here still and wherever there is a soul that would be free
   from sin this free Spirit waits to help him. Wherever there is a spirit
   that loathes its own unholiness, this Holy Spirit waits to cleanse him.
   Wherever there is a groaning one asking to be made pure, this pure
   Spirit is ready to come and dwell in him, and make him pure as God is
   pure. O, my hearer, he waits to bless you now: he is blessing you while
   I speak. I feel as if his divine energy went forth with the word and
   entered into your soul as you are listening. I trust I am not mistaken.
   If thou believest in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, believe thou also in
   the power of the Holy Spirit to make thee a new creature, and cleanse
   thee, and deliver thee from every fetter, and make thee the Lord's free
   man.

   I will tell thee one thing more, and I will have done. Our experience
   should be a great encouragement to you. I have tried to preach to you
   that are in the traces; poor worn-out cab-horses to the devil,
   post-horses of Satan that seem never to have a holiday, dragging your
   cart of sin behind you through the slush of the foul city of Vanity.
   The mercy is that you are not horses, but men born for nobler purposes.
   You may be free, for some of us are free. Oh, what a load I had behind
   me once: my wagon of inbred sin was a huge one indeed. Had it not been
   for the grace of God I should have perished in the impossible attempt
   to move it. I do not think that my load as to overt sin was at all like
   that which some of you are dragging, for I was but a child, and had not
   yet plunged into the follies of the world; but then I had a dogged
   will, a high spirit, an intense activity, and a daring mind, and all
   this would have driven me headlong to perdition if the Spirit of God
   had not wrought in me to subdue me to the will of the Lord. I felt
   within my spirit the boilings up of that secret cauldron of corruption
   which is in every human bosomand I felt that I was ruined before God,
   and that there was no hope for me. My burden of inward sin at fifteen
   years of age was such that I knew not what to do. We have seen pictures
   of the Arabs dragging those great Nineveh bulls for Mr. Leyard,
   hundreds of them tugging away; and I have imagined how Pharaoh's
   subjects, the Egyptians, must have sweated and smarted when they had to
   drag some of the immense blocks of which his obelisks were
   composed,thousands of men dragging one block of masonry; and I seemed
   to have just such a load as that behind me, and it would not stir. I
   prayed, and it would not stir. I took to reading my Bible, but my load
   would not stir. It seemed stuck in the mire, and no struggling would
   move the awful weight. Deep ruts the wheels were in. My load would not
   be moved, and I did not know what to do. I cried to God in my agony,
   and I thought I must die if I did not get delivered from my monstrous
   cumber: but it would not stir. I have no drag behind me now. Glory be
   to God, I am not bound with a cart-rope to the old wagon. I have no
   hamper behind me, and as I look back for the old ruts where the cart
   stopped so long I cannot even see their traces. The enormous weight is
   not there! It is clean gone! There came One by who wore a crown of
   thorns: I knew him by the marks in his hands and in his feet; and he
   said, "Trust me, and I will set thee free." I trusted him, and the
   enormous weight behind me was gone. It disappeared. As I was told, it
   sank into his sepulcher, and it lies buried there, never to come out
   again. My cart-rope snapped, my cords of vanity melted, I was out of
   harness. Then I said, "The snare is broken, and my soul hath escaped as
   a bird out of the snare of the fowler. I will tell the story of my
   deliverance as long as I live." I can say to-night,

   "E'er since by faith I saw the stream
   His flowing wounds supply,
   Redeeming love has been my theme,
   and shall be till I die."

   Oh, my beloved hearers, believe in Christ as I did. The gospel comes to
   each sorrowing sinner, and it says,Trust the Savior and there is joy
   for thee. There is but a veil of gauze between thee and peace; move the
   hand of faith, and that veil will be torn to pieces. There is but a
   step between thy misery and music and dancing and a life of perpetual
   delights; take that step out of self and into Christ, and all is
   changed for ever. Ask Jesus to break thy bonds, and with a touch of his
   pierced hand, he will make thee free as the swallow on the wing which
   no cage can hold. Thou shalt see him, and see thy sin never again for
   ever.

   God bless thee, and break the cart-ropes, and remove the cords of
   vanity, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   "Listen now! the Lord hath done it!
   For he loved us unto death;
   It is finished! He has saved us!
   Only trust to what he saith.
   He hath done it! Come and bless him,
   Spend in praise your ransomed breath
   Evermore and evermore.
   "Oh, believe the Lord hath done it!
   Wherefore linger? Wherefore doubt?
   All the cloud of black transgression
   He himself hath blotted out.
   He hath done it! Come and bless him,
   Swell the grand thanksgiving shout,
   Evermore and evermore."

   TO MY HEARERS AND READERS.

   DEAR FRIENDS,Owing to delays upon the road, I only reached this place
   on Saturday night, wearied and weak; but this morning I am refreshed!
   and hope to rest in real earnest. I should not sit down to write these
   lines were it not for the importunate requests of many friends who are
   so kindly interested in me. It is a joy to live in the hearts of others
   and to be thought of by them. But what is to be said of the great
   privilege of being thought upon of the Lord? "This honor have all the
   saints." Each one of them may say, "I am poor and needy, yet the Lord
   thinketh upon me." Hence he delights to hear from us because his
   delight is in us. What joy lies in the assurance that his thoughts
   towards us are thoughts of peace, and not of evil! "How precious also
   are thy thoughts unto me, O God!" We are often wandering in thought, or
   we are cast down, and doubtful, and anxious, but he saith, "My thoughts
   are not your thoughts." "The mountains shall depart, and the hills be
   removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee."

   In this confidence let us possess our souls. Our lives, our cares, our
   trials, our concerns are all considered by a love which never grows
   cold, a wisdom which never mistakes, and a power which never fails.
   Wherefore, let us have delight in the Almighty, and lift up our faces
   unto God, seeing he taketh pleasure in his people, and remembers them
   in their low estate with a mercy which endureth for ever.

   Yours in the ever-remembering Father,

   C. H. SPURGEON. Mentone, February 1st.

Certain Curious Calculations About Loaves and Fishes

   (No. 1822)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON OCTOBER 30, 1884.

   "When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets
   full of fragments did you take up? They said unto Him, Twelve. And when
   the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did
   you take up? And they said, Seven. And He said unto them, How is it
   that you do not understand?" Mark 8:19-21.

   THE disciples had come on board the vessel and had forgotten to bring
   bread with them--good men's memories sometimes fail them. For that
   reason they were greatly disturbed in mind and they supposed that Jesus
   was also disquieted and that He had shaped His speech so as to give
   them an indirect rebuke when He mentioned the leaven of the Pharisees.
   How little they understood His mind, though they had been so long a
   time with Him! His thoughts were not occupied about bread for Himself
   and neither was there any carking care in His heart about bread for
   them. His mind was at perfect rest about all secular things and, even
   as to all spiritual things, He was by no means tossed about.
   Notwithstanding all His trials and His sorrows, I suppose that there
   never was a serener mind than that of Jesus Christ our Lord. His heart
   was great as an ocean and though visited with terrible tempests, yet it
   was the Pacific Ocean, still. They might be troubled about bread, but
   He was resting about that and all things else. The winds which tossed
   the little lakes of their little minds into boiling cauldrons did not
   suffice to create a ripple upon the surface of His mighty soul!

   Is it not well for us at this hour that it is so? We are fluttered and
   dismayed, but the mind of our great Lord is fearless and undisturbed.
   "He will not fail nor be discouraged." The child cries because the ship
   rolls, but his father at the helm smiles at the storm--and what a mercy
   it is for the child that father can smile, for if the captain were
   weak, where would the vessel be? If the father's heart failed him,
   where would his boy look for comfort? Calm face of Jesus, we look up to
   You and we are quieted!

   The Master wishing to comfort His servants had them consider what they
   already knew and review what they had already seen. Usually the eyes of
   the Christian should be directed forward--it is foolish to try to live
   on past experience--it is a very dangerous, if not a fatal habit, to
   judge ourselves to be safe because of something that we felt or did 20
   years ago. Yet, for all that, we may look back to gain practical
   lessons for times of service and comfortable lessons for hours of
   trial. Like the archer, we may draw the string back that it may shoot
   the arrow onward with greater force.

   The Master asks His followers whether they had used their eyes. "Having
   eyes, see you not?" They had seen two wonderful miracles, by which
   thousands of persons had been fed--had they really seen them? Had they
   been satisfied just to look at the bread and the fish--and at the
   feasting multitude--and then to let the whole scene melt away from
   them? Had they really heard the voice of what the Lord had done?
   "Having ears, hear you not?" Had they missed the message altogether?
   Then He adds, "Perceive you not yet, neither understand?" Do you not
   know what My action meant when I multiplied the loaves? Do you not see
   how it reveals My all-sufficiency? Have you not read between the lines,
   this Word of God--that God feeds all things--that He opens His hands
   and supplies the needs of every living thing? Have you not yet
   discovered, by those two miracles, that there is nothing impossible
   with your Lord?

   May we not also have missed our Lord's meanings full often? May we not
   have walked through a palace of wonders without observing the gleams of
   Glory, the flashes of Eternal Light? Our unbelief is the undeniable
   evidence that we have not learned all that we ought to have learned,
   for the outcome of spiritually seeing, perceiving and understanding is
   faith. He that believes little has learned little. He that doubts and
   is troubled, is but a baby, still needing to learn the rudiments of
   holy scholarship!

   The Lord further asks them that tender question, "And do you not
   remember?" Brothers and Sisters, we remember much that we ought to
   forget--and we forget much that we ought to remember! Down the stream
   of memory floats trash from the city of Sodom and we diligently gather
   it! But down the same stream descends costly timber from Lebanon and we
   suffer it to drift by us! Our sieve holds the chaff and rejects the
   corn. It ought not so to be. Let us look back upon the whole of our
   past lives at this hour with a careful, leisurely glance, and see
   whether there is not enough in our diaries to condemn our doubts and
   bury our cares--or at least to shut up our anxieties in a cage made of
   the golden bars of past mercy and fastened in with jeweled bolts of
   gratitude! "The Lord has been mindful of us; He will bless us." Let us
   glory in what the Lord is going to do and magnify His name for His
   mercy which is yet to be revealed!

   Let each one of us sing with David, "I will go unto the altar of God,
   unto God my exceeding joy: yes, I will praise You, O God, my God." Then
   has memory performed her part aright when, from the altars of the past,
   she has snatched a living coal with which to set on fire the incense of
   today. Not being able to read your own personal diaries, for these are
   only known to yourselves, I shall endeavor to take you back to the
   records of the Apostles' memories and we will think of the text as it
   brings before us the two great miracles of feeding the hungry. May we
   learn what the Spirit designs to teach us by them!

   I. And the first thing I shall want to bring to your recollection is
   THE DARING PROJECT, YET UNAVOIDABLE. This was the daring project--to
   feed 5,000 persons in the wilderness. Two hundred pennyworth was the
   calculation of one of the ready-reckoner of the hour. Some men are
   always very ready at counting the pennies which they have not got.
   Whenever there is a holy deed to be done, our mathematical-minded
   unbelievers are prompt with their estimates of cost and their prudent
   forecasts of grave deficiencies! We are great at calculations when we
   are little at believing! How can the necessary amount be raised? It is
   so much a head among so many members. Unfortunately the heads do not
   yield the poll tax and the money does not come--and confidence in man
   leaves us weeping by the broken cistern. This is the way in which a
   large part of the Church's thought boils up, evaporates and is wasted.
   Alas for those calculations about pennyworths!

   Or else it is, "From where can we satisfy these men with bread, here in
   the wilderness?" "From where?" as if there could be any "where" but
   one! Where comes everything by which man lives? Comes it not from God?
   It goes round about in different channels, but it knows only one
   source! When any of the channels fail, the fountain is still flowing
   and he that has faith to go to it directly shall not want! But it did
   seem, to the disciples, a very preposterous idea that with nothing but
   sand, stone and rock round about them, they should make a banquet for
   5,000 men! Is it not much more preposterous that the Christian Church
   should have to evangelize such a city as London? It may not seem so to
   you, but if you lived in the midst of the extreme poverty of the East
   End, you would think it the problem of problems--how to reach the
   sunken multitudes! We little dream on what a volcano we live. The
   pent-up misery and the seething sin of London may yet produce a second
   edition of the French Revolution unless the Grace of God shall
   interpose!

   The people are famishing bodily, mentally, morally, spiritually--and we
   must feed them. I marvel not if in the presence of these dying millions
   you cry--"From where?" But then, London is only one out of many cities.
   Our whole nation is a small fraction of the myriads of our race! China,
   India, Africa are yet to be fed. The command is, "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature." The proposal is that
   the knowledge of the Lord shall yet cover the earth as the waters cover
   the sea--and I repeat the keynote which I sounded just now--it is a
   daring project! It is startling to the thoughtful, impossible to the
   calculating--difficult, even, to the believing!

   But then, you see, in the case of the Apostles in the wilderness, it
   was an inevitable project. However strange the proposition might seem,
   it pressed upon them. They could not avoid it, for the people had no
   food with them and were fainting. Many of them had come from far. If
   they attempted to seek their own homes without refreshment, they would
   die by the way and, therefore, it would not do to send the multitude
   away. They must be fed. "How is it to be done?" is the question and
   whether they can answer it or not, the necessity is there, all the
   same!

   With the Savior it was an unavoidable necessity. It would break His
   heart to see them fainting and famishing. He could not endure it. At
   the very thought of their destitute condition He was moved with
   compassion. His whole Nature was stirred, convulsed and filled with
   excitement at the sight of hunger, pallor, weariness and faintness. The
   Great Shepherd

   must feed these hungry sheep! It is not with Him, "Can it be done?" or,
   "Can it not be done?" but it must be done. One of the imperial
   necessities which sometimes took possession of the royal heart of
   Christ had entered into His soul and "He had to" do its bidding. He,
   Himself, took their infirmities and carried their sorrows. He was such
   an all-comprehending Man that he included them within His own Manhood.
   If they hungered, He hungered; if they fainted, He fainted and if they
   died, He, Himself, seemed to die and, therefore, by the intense
   sympathy of His Nature, He was driven to feel that the multitude must
   be fed.

   Just imagine that they had not been fed--that they had begun to faint
   and die of hunger all over those hills to which they had followed
   Jesus--how it would have marred His ministry! Why, surely, the
   disciples who had said somewhat flippantly, "Send the multitude away,"
   would have been oppressed with a lifelong sorrow if their wish had been
   carried out! They never would have forgotten that dreadful dreary day
   and the starvation, the fainting and the death which followed it. Think
   of what mischief it would have done to Christ's cause! The rumor that
   He led the people into solitary places and that there they died of
   hunger would have been greatly derogatory to our Lord, for what Prophet
   ever did this? What capital the Pharisees would have made of it! How
   exultingly they would have cried, "Is this Man, after all, a Prophet
   like Moses, who fed the people with manna in the wilderness?" They
   would have cried, "He said that He was the Son of God; He claimed to
   have raised the dead--but if He had really possessed this power, He
   would have fed the hungry multitude who had spent their strength in
   following Him." No, the Christ cannot have it so. He has come to save
   men's lives--He cannot let them die. He must feed the crowd.

   Now, imagine, Brothers and Sisters, that we never carry out the
   commission which Christ has laid upon us today, that of teaching the
   multitude--imagine that from now on we never labor to win souls--that
   we give up London as a forlorn case--that we abandon the heathen world
   as assuredly given over to destruction like a vessel driven by a
   hurricane upon an ironbound coast--imagine it, I say! Can you endure
   the imagination? I cannot abandon the drifting boat. Let us man the
   lifeboat! I know that some quiet themselves into a kind of despair as
   to the possibility of the Lord Jehovah ever being King over this whole
   earth--will you try the wretched experiment? So these people must be
   left to die, for how can so many be fed? But the project of love shall
   be executed--to that hope we cling and to that end would we spend and
   be spent! If things look not so and Christianity occupies as yet but a
   mere corner of the world, it matters not to our faith--we still
   believe! Faith counts no odds. One man with God on his side is in the
   majority if never another thinks as he does! Therefore, in feebleness
   of numbers we are yet omnipotent in the might of the Most High!

   Had not the multitude been fed, our Lord would have missed a grand
   occasion for the display of His Grace. Grace is sovereign, but it is
   abounding! Wherever it finds the occasion, it displays its power. A
   hungering, fainting crowd! What space for compassion! What vantage
   ground for benevolence! It could not be that the Lord of Love should
   let such an opportunity slip by--His love was too eager to display
   itself to lie quiet at such an hour! But, Brothers and Sisters, what an
   occasion for revealing the splendor of Divine Grace does the present
   age present! London is a brave canvas on which to paint a master
   picture of mercy, of power, of wisdom. What a block of marble the great
   world presents for the Infinite Sculptor! What a monument of Grace will
   the human race become when it shall rejoice in God the Savior! I am
   persuaded that the Lord has permitted the present sorrow that He may
   produce from it a greater glory! I am sure in my own soul that He
   suffers the multitudes to hunger in this terrible wilderness simply and
   only that He may feed them and thus prove to all the universe His power
   to bless.

   I hope I have brought before your minds very clearly that amazing
   project which seemed most daring and even preposterous, and yet was
   necessary and even inevitable.

   II. Brethren, hoping for the help of God's good Spirit, I would take
   you, secondly, to another sight--THE BAFFLED DISCIPLES AND THERE SERENE
   MASTER. The Master has consulted Philip about supplies in order that
   the difficulty of the case and the insufficiency of mere means might be
   seen of all. Philip found that all that was available was a lad's
   breakfast of five barley cakes and a few small fishes and, he anxiously
   added, "What are they among so many?" The prudent counselor had done
   his best, but it did not come to much. He left this problem unsolved,
   "What are they among so many?" As for the rest of the disciples, they
   looked in Jesus' face with astonishment and blank despair and said,
   "Where should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so
   great a multitude?"

   But all the time that they were thus fall of fidgeting and worries,
   there stood the Master, calm as a sweet summer's evening, not in the
   least disturbed or troubled. What a difference between the feebleness
   and unbelief of the disciples and

   the mighty confidence of the Lord Jesus! How much need that we be
   changed from glory to glory as by the image of the Lord, for we, also,
   are very far, as yet, from being like He in our tone and spirit! We
   have not yet entered fully into His rest, nor shall we, till we learn
   His faith in God. Why was Jesus Christ, our Master, so calm? I have
   upon my mind the savor of a word the Lord once gave me for you upon
   that text, "Jesus knew what He would do." [See No. 1,605, Volume
   27--Jesus Knew What He Would Do] It is in great part our ignorance
   which puts us into such a quandary. We do not know what is going to be
   done; we are in suspense and suspense eats into the soul as an acid
   eats into metal. "From where? How? When? Where?"--all these questions
   prick us like so many daggers and each prick kills a joy. "Our thoughts
   are all a case of knives," as George Herbert puts it, and every knife
   in that case destroys a hope.

   But the Master had no suspense--He knew what He would do! We shall get
   peace, Brothers and Sisters, when we also know what we shall do. "Oh,"
   you say, "I thought you were going to say when we know what HE will
   do." Oh, no! We probably shall not know that till He does it. It is
   enough for us to know what we shall do. "But," says one, "that is what
   we do not know." I answer--that is what we ought to know. We ought to
   know that we mean to leave everything with our Lord. If we once settled
   it in our minds that we would trust and not be afraid, what peace we
   would enjoy! If we will leave God's work with God and simply trust, we
   shall drink into the peace of God!

   Besides that, our Lord was thus calm because He had faith, while they
   had nothing better than mere sense. Here they were, as I have said
   before, counting the loaves and numbering the fishes. Hear them saying,
   "Here are only five loaves, and they are of barley, and the fish are
   not only few, but small." They took care to record that fact and to lay
   stress upon it! And they are equally clear as to the greatness of the
   hungry multitude and the barrenness of the wilderness around them. They
   are all going on in that style, judging by the sight of the eyes and
   the touch of the hands. But the Son of God has another and better
   sense--He trusts His Father. Jesus, a Man like themselves, has
   confidence that in the hour of His need the Godhead will not fail Him,
   but will fulfill His needs.

   We have no Godhead in unity with our humanity, but yet we have more
   than Jesus had. "Oh," you say, "that cannot be!" you will agree with my
   statement when I remind you that we have all that Christ had and then
   we have Christ, Himself, in addition. He has given us all that He
   has--so we have that. And then He has given us Himself, so we possess
   the double. We ought never to doubt, but to rely upon the
   Godhead--Father, Son and Holy Spirit--in every time of our need. "In
   the mount it shall be seen"--Jehovah-Jireh--the Lord will provide. Oh,
   for Grace to cast all care away; to be baffled and worried no longer,
   but to rest and be still!

   Moreover, one thing, I think, which made Christ so calm was that He
   really acted while they only questioned. He said, "How many loaves have
   you? Bring them here to Me." He came at once to practical action. The
   people who do not believe in conversions are those who never convert
   anybody, but as soon as a man is led of the Spirit to turn men from
   darkness to Light and God blesses him in his work, he believes in it!
   He that has something to do has less temptation to doubt than the man
   who has nothing else to do but to doubt. Heresies in the Christian
   Church come never from the city missionary, never from the faithful
   pastor, never from the intense evangelist--but always from gentlemen at
   ease--who take no actual part in our holy war. Those literary fops who
   criticize religion in reviews and have nothing else to do except to put
   their hands to their heads and press whimsies out of their brows--these
   are the men that trouble us.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ gave way to no sort of doubt, for He speedily
   took the bread and the fish in His hands and began blessing and
   breaking them, while promptly upon His own action followed the Divine
   energy which multiplied the little store. If you and I would but serve
   the Lord in earnest, we might end our calculations as to how much is to
   be done and how it is to be done--and where it is to be done and all
   that. Get to your work, my Brother, and your doubts shall fly like
   chaff before the wind! The baffled disciples and the calm and quiet
   Master make up an instructive picture--we shall have profited by it to
   the fullest if we, also, become calmly reliant upon God and are no more
   carried away with unbelieving amazement.

   III. Thirdly, and briefly, I want to set two more matters before your
   mind's eye for your comfort. In the miracles

   where we see the multitudes fed, we see MEANS USED, BUT CHRIST
   CONSPICUOUS. You perceive that our Lord

   says of the loaves, "Bring them to Me." The means were used. When He
   has multiplied these very loaves and fishes, He gives them to the men
   that are round about Him and of these the multitudes partake. Whatever
   men in their folly may talk as to neglecting the outward means and
   sitting still and doing nothing because God will do His own work, we
   hear

   nothing of the kind from Jesus! He used the loaves and He used the
   fishes--and He used the men--though He could well enough have done
   without them. He was Omnipotent and did not need them. But He was wise
   and He would teach us the lesson that by instrumentality God's great
   work is to be done. Therefore, despise not means and, at the same time,
   do not rest in them.

   But observe how the fish, the loaves, the men and all the means were
   made to sink. In that picture you see the great crowd--I do not think
   the painter needs to lay his colors on very vividly. He can draw the
   people as a kind of luminous haze if he likes. The one figure that
   stands out like the sun at noonday, hiding all else by the brilliance
   of His light, is the Master, Himself. Only Jesus is glorious in that
   outdoor banqueting room! Where are those few fishes? "Here," says one.
   "Here," cries another. "Here," shouts another. But those few and little
   fishes cannot be in the hands of all those five thousand! Where has the
   bread gone? "I have a loaf," cries one. "I have a loaf," says another,
   and they are all feeding as voraciously as they can! What has become of
   the original five loaves? Bring them here, Brother--at least go and
   make a diligent search for the original five loaves and those little
   fishes--that we may preserve one of them as a relic!

   What? Can you not find one of them? You do not know where they are?
   They are all gone? Of course they are! Whenever God blesses a man very
   greatly, that man sinks to nothing in his own esteem. If Peter's boat
   is full, Peter's boat sinks. If we are plunged in blessing up to the
   hilt, self is hidden under the weight of mercy. A little blessing,
   fancied and imagined to be something extraordinary, elevates the little
   man--but a great, all-swamping blessing comes like a torrent and bears
   the man and his littleness away--and nothing is seen but the Lord and
   the blessing! I am sure that it is so when the Lord uses any one of us
   as the means of doing good to others--we are humbled and He is exalted!

   And after the miracle is over, when they go round to gather up the
   fragments in their 12 baskets or 7 baskets, Peter has a quick eye but
   ask him whether he can find one of those original loaves. He may go
   from basket to basket and he cannot find one. It is lost in the
   creation which God has made out of it! And can he find, in all those
   baskets, the original fishes? They must be there, for it is out of
   those fish that all the meat came to feed the people! But you cannot
   discover them. So it shall be if God will bless us, my Brothers and
   Sisters! People will gather about us and say, "What is there in this
   man? We perceive no superlative talent. What is there in this woman to
   make her so useful? We see nothing special about her."

   Never you mind. Let them pick at any bit of fish which they think they
   can see in your native talent or vigorous character! But as for
   yourself, you know that if any of the multitude are fed, the provision
   came from the Master's hands when he took your little and blessed and
   broke and multiplied it so as to make it sufficient for the occasion. I
   believe that means are honored by Christ's using them, but I am quite
   sure that before He has done with them, the means will sink into the
   uttermost obscurity and Jesus Christ will be All in All--and that not
   because the means are unblessed, but because they are blessed in so
   gracious a degree!

   IV. Furthermore, we see in the miracles of feeding, WORK ACCOMPLISHED
   OF A MARVELOUS KIND, BUT POWER UNEXHAUSTED. Look at those 5,000 men and
   the women and the children! They are all fed. It is a proverb that
   there never was a feast yet from which someone did not go away
   unsatisfied. But there is no rule without an exception. Here are two
   exceptions to that proverb. "They did all eat and were filled," upon
   two occasions! It did not matter how many thousands there were, not one
   of them was overlooked by the ever-blessed Host. It did not matter how
   hungry they were, they all ate till they were full.

   But this is the point I want to show you--the power that multiplied the
   bread and fish and fed the thousands had not come to an end. Their
   power to eat was exhausted, but not Christ's power to feed, for when
   they had received to their utmost capacity, there was yet more to
   follow! The people were sharp set that day, the mountain air made their
   appetites keen and their long fasting put a razor-edge upon them. Yet
   when they had all eaten to the full, great baskets were brought and
   these were filled--in the one case 12, and in the other seven of them.
   There is enough for each, enough for all, and still enough remaining
   for future needs! The infinite Worker reveals His infinity by His
   unstinted bounty, His unmeasured liberality!

   I cannot understand, from the Greek, of what size these baskets may
   have been. The second set, the seven, have a name which shows that they
   were tolerably large, for Paul was let down in such a basket from the
   window when he escaped from his enemies in Damascus. The first sort
   which were used when there were 12 of them, appear to me to have been
   still larger. They give you an idea of a coffin, or a coffer. They were
   large baskets of which it is said that men could

   sleep in them. Yet these baskets, whatever their size may have been,
   were filled--12 and seven--and if the Lord had willed to do so, He
   could have filled 12,000 baskets, or 70,000 baskets! His power was
   running over--it could not be contained in earthly vessels any more
   than a river can be held in a cup! It was still flowing in a copious
   stream when every mouth and every basket had been filled. Some seem to
   fancy that the Lord does everything by the inch and the ounce, keeping
   to stint and quantity, but this is rather the manner of men than the
   fashion of the Lord!

   We know that the Lord Jesus Christ redeemed His elect from among men
   and therefore, some will have it that the merit of His Atonement must
   be limited. No such thing. "He gave Himself for us," and there can be
   no measure to the value of such a gift. "He died for our sins," and not
   for our sins, only, but for the sins of the whole world! His objective
   was definite, but He achieved it by an agency which cannot be limited.
   He not only did that which He mainly aimed at, but He did more--just as
   in this case He not only fed the thousands, but filled baskets with the
   fragments. The power of God and the merit of the Sacrifice of Christ
   are among the infinite things--let us bow before the Lord and rejoice
   in that which surpasses measure.

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, whatever the Lord has given to you, He
   has still far more to bestow upon you. Whatever you may feast upon in
   this public service, there is yet a portion for you to take home with
   you in the basket and lay up in the store. However God may have blessed
   you in your work for Him in the past, He is yet able to do exceeding
   abundantly above all that you ask or even think! However much the
   Church may have been increased by a true revival, God has never done
   according to the fullness of His ability in the Church as yet--even
   Pentecost was but the Firstfruits. I hear a voice from Heaven, saying,
   "you shall see greater things than these." "And greater things than
   these shall you do, because I go unto the Father."

   We have been far from reaching the Ultima Thule of sacred possibility!
   Still "the arrow is beyond you." We have never seen the best of our God
   as yet. We may go forward with the supreme faith that Pentecost has yet
   to be outdone-- that all the mighty preaching of the fathers, when they
   turned nations to Christ, shall yet be exceeded in the triumphs of the
   Cross in the latter days! We are approaching nobler ages and God's
   great acts will not dwindle into trifles. Remember that all that you
   could see and all that you could know would be but a minute portion of
   His glorious power! All that you could apprehend would only be a
   manifestation of the hem of His garment! What Omnipotence is and,
   especially, what it is in the Kingdom of Grace, none know except God,
   Himself. Let us not limit the Holy One, nor bound the Infinite. In our
   Father's house there is bread enough and to spare, even after millions
   have been satisfied from His supplies!

   V. I am going to finish by observing that THE DETAILS OF THESE MIRACLES
   WERE DIFFERENT, BUT

   THEY WERE EQUALLY INSTRUCTIVE. Kindly listen to what I am now saying,
   not as to anything of remarkable weight, but still as to a matter of
   interest in which there may be more instruction than at first sight
   appears.

   Concerning our Lord's great free dinners, remark, first, that the
   remainder after the feast was greater than the stock when these
   banquets began. They began with five loaves and two fishes. They began
   on another occasion with seven loaves and a few fishes--but they left
   off with 12 baskets full in the one case and with seven full baskets in
   the other! Never was this done at any ofyour tables, I am sure, when
   your children have gathered for their meals. But these did all eat and
   were filled--and yet there was more left than when they began!

   This seems impossible, and yet it is the rule in the Kingdom of Grace.
   I have often found, when I have come with a very small stock to feed
   you, Brothers and Sisters, that I have gone away with more than I came
   with. You have been refreshed and I have been more full than when I
   handed out your portions to you. You have gone to the class, dear
   Friend, and felt that you were scantily supplied for feeding your dear
   ones, but you have given them your all and, under the Divine blessing,
   there has been enough for the class and a double portion for you! You
   went out with five loaves and you came back with 12 baskets heaped up.
   Strange!

   We may so give for God as to get in the giving; so spend as to increase
   in the spending; so die for God as to live more than ever! If this is
   fact, what a wide field it opens to our hope and how it banishes our
   fear! It shuts the door of the counting-house where we calculate
   according to human reason and it opens the doors of the treasury where
   we may draw ever-growing supplies! Go, Brother, and scatter your
   handful of seed, for you shall come, again, rejoicing, bringing sheaves
   with you! Give of your meal and oil to the Lord's servant and your
   barrel and cruse shall be replenished in the giving! Remember Bunyan's
   rhyme is true spiritually as well as providentially--

   "There was a man and some did count him mad,

   The more he gave away, the more he had." Next, learn that care is
   always taken by Christ of all the broken pieces. The Lord
   All-Sufficient is yet the God of economy. Since Jesus could create as
   much food as He pleased, you might have thought that it was hardly
   worth His while to gather up the fragments--and yet He did so. Waste is
   of Satan, not of God! God is not lavish of creation, nor prodigal of
   miracles. Though the Lord can raise up in this place, if He pleases, 50
   ministers in an instant, He may not do so. But what He would have us do
   is to make use of such powers as we have. If we are only fragments, our
   place is not the ground, but the basket. We must not allow ourselves to
   be thrown away, or to be consumed by an animal passion, or to be left
   to decay--we must be in the Lord's store, ready to be used when the
   time comes. We shall be of some use, one of these days, if we are
   willing to be used.

   If you, my Friend, are not a whole loaf, you are a crust, and no crust
   may be wasted. If you are not a slice of bread, you are a crumb, and
   even crumbs are dear to hungry men. If you are not a big fish, yet you
   may be a little fish, and you must not waste yourself, nor must the
   Church of God allow you to be wasted, but use must be found for you
   somewhere. But what a wonderful thing this is--Omnipotence picking up
   crumbs! God All-Sufficient, to whom the cattle on a thousand hills are
   as nothing--who could make a whole sea of fishes, or 10,000 worlds of
   bread by His bare will and nothing else--and yet He sets His disciples
   to gather up broken pieces that nothing may be lost! Surely it ill
   becomes us to waste a penny, an hour, or an opportunity! Let us be
   severely economical for the Lord our God!

   Notice a rather curious thing--there was most left when there was least
   to begin with. When they commenced the dinner with seven loaves, they
   gathered up seven baskets full, but when they had only five loaves they
   filled 12 baskets with the fragments. I suppose the baskets to have
   been of the same size, for I do not discover that the second set of
   baskets were any larger than the first. However, from a stock of seven
   loaves, after all expenditure, there came seven baskets as a remainder.
   But when there were only five loaves and a greater expenditure, there
   were 12 baskets full left for the waiters. This is amazing! The more
   they begin with, the less they end with--and the less they begin with,
   the more they have when the feast is concluded!

   Yet I have often noticed that this does occur. Have not you? When you
   and I have begun rather grandly and God has blessed us, we have had
   great reason to thank Him. But when we have begun very feebly, He has
   frequently blessed us far more and we have ended by praising Him upon
   the high-sounding cymbals! We have gone away wondering--"Five loaves
   and 12 baskets! Why, the other day, when I had seven loaves, I had only
   seven baskets!" Yes, let the rich rejoice when he is brought low, for
   he, like Job, shall be richer than before! Do not begin to sink in
   spirit because you seem to have declined in ability--but just be
   confident in God that in your case, also, there will be most reward at
   the end when there was least capital to work with.

   Note, again, that there was less visible means when there was more
   done. There were only five loaves, but they fed 5,000--but when there
   were seven loaves they fed only four thousand. The most was done when
   there was the least to do it with. And so it shall happen to you, O
   worker for Jesus, for the more God blesses you, the less you shall see
   of any adequate reason in yourself why you should be blessed. With your
   five loaves you shall feed your 5,000, while somebody who had seven
   shall do less than you.

   Another curious thing is that when there was most eaten there was most
   left. When 5,000 besides women and children ate as much as they could,
   they left more than the 4,000 did. The smaller number could not eat as
   much as the greater, yet their leftover food uneaten was less than when
   5,000 filled themselves to the full. It is a curious inversion of all
   our regulations. We suppose the larger our company, the less will
   remain. But here it seems that when the company was larger then that
   which was left was largest--and when the company was fewer--less was
   left. It is so with us--the more we have to draw from us, spiritually,
   the more will remain for our own portion. We shall make no saving by
   reducing the number of those whom we serve, but the reverse.

   One other thing learn and that is that where there is the most work for
   Jesus, there will be the most remuneration. It is not so elsewhere, for
   men are often paid best for doing least, but in our Lord's case every
   man's reward shall be according to his service. Those who waited on the
   vast crowd of people could not get much to eat, themselves, during the
   meal, for they were fully occupied in handing the bread to others. But
   when all was over, the Master said to them, "So you have had a great
   company today, there were 5,000 at the least. You must need
   refreshment, yourselves. Yonder are 12 baskets full of that which
   remains over, divide them among yourselves." Another day their work was
   hard, but not quite so labo-

   rious. That extra thousand that always brings in the excessive labor
   through overcrowding had not been there and they had supplied four
   thousand pretty pleasantly. Then it was that they received only seven
   baskets for their share--a liberal allowance, but still not so large as
   on the former occasion.

   If you will work for Christ, give for Christ and labor for Christ, you
   shall have a rich return of present joy from Him and this shall have a
   proportion in it. Many people will always be poor because they never
   give to the cause of God. Poor people should give in order that they
   may not be poor any longer--and the rich should give that they may not
   become poor. I mean not that these are to be the chief motives, but
   they may have their place. You that have little ability should work
   hard with that little ability that you may increase it. And you that
   have great ability, of course, should do so, because you have so many
   talents entrusted to you. The Lord will allow no service to remain
   unrecompensed. And work done for the poor and needy shall win its wage,
   not of debt, but of Grace.

   Satan said, "Does Job serve God for nothing?" Suppose he had done
   so--the devil would have gone his way and said that God was a hard
   master, whose service brought no sort of reward with it! Either way,
   Satan would have made mischief and, as we have no wish to please him,
   we admit that we do not serve God for nothing, but that in keeping His
   Commandments there is great reward! When the multitude have done
   feasting, your Master will let you sit down to meat and you shall have
   abundant joy with Him!

   The chief point for all of us is to get at the blessed work! In the
   name of the ever-living God, let us feed, each one, the man that is
   nearest to him till the whole company shall be fed, for the Christ is
   behind us, the Son of God is working with us--and the bread is not our
   bread but His bread! And the feeding of the multitude is not our work,
   but His! And the power is not ours, but all His own and to His name
   shall be all the glory! Amen.

Peter's Blunder--a Lesson for Ourselves

   (No. 1823)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON JULY 3, 1884.

   "But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is
   common or unclean." Acts 10:14.

   "NOT SO, Lord." This is a very curious expression. I do not care how
   you turn it into English from the original, it is a very strange
   compound. If Peter had said, "Not so," there would have been a clear
   consistency in his language and tone. But "Not so, Lord," is an odd
   jumble of self-will and reverence, of pride and humility, of
   contradiction and devotion. Surely, when you say, "Not so," it ought
   not to be said to the Lord and if you say, "Lord," you ought not to put
   side by side with such an ascription the expression, "AOt so." Peter
   always was a blunderer in his early days and he had not grown out of
   his old habits of honest impetuosity. He meant well and his expression
   was not intended to convey all that we might easily make of it. At any
   rate, it is not for us to condemn him. Who are we that we should sit in
   judgment on a saint of God? Besides, we are not without fault,
   ourselves, in the matter of incorrect speech.

   You and I have said some very curious things in our time. We have
   uttered exclamations that have been so good that the Lord accepted
   them, but they have been so bad that He could not have accepted them if
   it had not been for His infinite mercy! In our utterances there has
   been faith mixed with unbelief, love defaced with a lack of submission,
   gratitude combined with distrust, humility flavored with self-conceit,
   courage undermined with cowardice, fervor mingled with indifference. We
   are as strange beings as the image which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his
   dream and our speech betrays the fact. When we were fashioned by
   nature, first of all, we were "fearfully and wonderfully made." But
   when we fell and were unmade by sin, we became monstrosities,
   combinations of contrary actions! I will not dwell upon that topic, but
   every man who looks within, if the candle of God is shining within him,
   must often cry out, "Lord, what is man, that You are mindful of him?
   And the son of man, that You visit him?'

   In our speech, this mixed estate of ours most plainly shows itself. We
   often feel as if we could eat our words, or at the least, unsay them.
   Speeches that have had about them real sincerity and true devotion have
   been greatly marred by expressions which were not fit for the occasion.
   Our tongues need a sevenfold sanctification if we are always to speak
   that which is good and acceptable. And, surely, that is what we desire.
   Now, we will have a look at Peter and see what we can learn from this
   amazing expression of his--this strangely compounded exclamation, "Not
   so, Lord."

   I. The first Truth of God which we may easily learn is that THE OLD MAN
   REMAINS IN THE CHRISTIAN MAN. Albeit we are made new creatures in
   Christ Jesus and the life that is within us, the dominant life, is new,
   holy and heavenly, yet the old nature still survives. Though crucified,
   it is long in dying and struggles hard. Sin dwells in us so that we
   painfully discover that, though we are new men, we are yet men--and
   though the Grace of God reigns within us, yet there is a struggle for
   the kingdom--and the sin that dwells in us strives after the mastery.
   We are renewed sinners but we are still sinners. Our hearts and hands
   are cleansed by Divine Grace, but they have a sad tendency to become
   defiled.

   Peter was still Peter. Why, dear Friends, I think that if I had never
   before seen this passage in Acts, but had read Peter's life as I find
   it in the writings of the four Evangelists, and somebody had newly
   shown me the present text and said, "I have left out the name of the
   Apostle, but one of them, when he had seen a vision from God and knew
   that God spoke to him, nevertheless said, 'Not so, Lord'--what Apostle
   was that?" I would not have had to guess twice, I am sure! I would have
   been sure that it was Peter. So you see Peter is Peter after the Grace
   of God has renewed him. I think we must say the same of ourselves. You,
   Thomas, who used to be so thoughtful and careful--and somewhat
   particular and nerv-

   ous--you are a child of God, but you are still Thomas! And I suspect
   that you will be wanting to put your finger into the print of the nails
   and to thrust your hand into His side, or else you will not believe.

   And you, John--you always were very loving and hearty and, at the same
   time, hot in your zeal--and now that you have become a disciple of
   Christ, I am sure that you will be more loving than ever. But I would
   not wonder if even now you should be heard saying, "Master, send fire
   upon those who reject You, and destroy them." The man is still the same
   man--he is greatly altered, but he has not lost his identity! Whatever
   change has taken place in him, Peter is Peter, and I should like you
   young converts to remember that, for perhaps you think that in the day
   when you were converted you lost your old selves altogether. I can
   assure you that you did not! The hasty temper, the sluggish
   constitution, the gloomy tendency, or the fickle humor will still be
   there--to be struggled with so long as you are here below! You received
   a new self, and a better self, but the old self is still there.

   Your mother will be able to recognize you, I dare say, if you live at
   home as a young person--she will know that it is the same John, or the
   same Mary, for your foibles and weaknesses will crop up, if not your
   faults and, therefore, you must keep a watch upon yourself. You are
   greatly changed. God has done wonders for you--He has put a new heart
   within you and a new song into your mouth, but the inclination to evil
   is not dead--your passions, appetites and desires are, each one, prone
   to overleap the boundary and transgress. The best of men are men at the
   best! And Peter, after the Holy Spirit has fallen upon him, and he has
   preached a very wonderful soul-winning sermon, is, nevertheless,
   Peter--and you can tell that he is the same person--the accent of his
   words still betrays him.

   Note that Peter here shows how readily he fell, not precisely into the
   same sin, but into the same kind of sin. His tendency was still to err
   in a certain direction. This Peter who said, "Not so, Lord," is he not
   the same man who, in his impudence rebuked His Master and said, "That
   be far from You, Lord"? Impudence, I call it. It was a piece of
   impertinence for which he was well rebuked when the Master said, "Get
   you behind Me, Satan." Our Lord detected Satan endeavoring to work
   through the zealous enthusiasm of Peter, to tempt Him to turn aside
   from the great work that He came to do. I do not think that the other
   disciples would have gone as far as Peter did--they had faults in other
   directions, but it remained for Peter to rebuke his Master--and now we
   see him half rebuking his Lord, again, as he declines to kill and eat
   the creatures let down from Heaven. Yes, Peter actually says, "Not so,
   Lord." May we never be found questioning Providence, or disputing with
   Revelation, lest we be taken in the same fault and receive a rebuke for
   rebuking our Lord!

   Is not this the same man who, at suppertime, refused His Master? When
   the Lord Jesus took a towel and girded Himself, and was about to wash
   the disciples' feet, Peter said to Him, "Do You wash my feet?" for He
   was astounded at such an example of humility. When the Master came with
   the basin, Peter said, "You shall never wash my feet." And then you
   remember what a turn Peter made when his Lord said, "If I wash you not,
   you have no part with Me." Then Peter cried, "Lord, not my feet only,
   but also my hands and my head." He was always impulsive and from this
   cause he rebukes his Master and he refuses his Master. He acts as if he
   fancied that he knew better than his Lord, though in his heart of
   hearts he had no such notion. Yes, this is the same Peter who cried,
   "Not so, Lord." He refuses for the moment to do his Lord's bidding, for
   it happens to be contrary to his ideas of propriety. Oh, that we may be
   kept clear of this grave fault!

   And this is he who flatly contradicted his Master on another occasion.
   When Jesus said to His disciples, "All you shall be offended because of
   Me," Peter said, "Though all men shall be offended because of You, yet
   will I never be offended." His Lord had told him that he would deny Him
   and yet he declared he would not. I know all the excuses that we make
   for Peter and I am quite prepared to make them, but, at the same time,
   that was the way of Peter--that is the part in which he was weak. He
   did this in his earlier days and after the Holy Spirit had come upon
   him and he had been baptized into His power, and had risen into quite a
   superior condition from that in which he was in the life of our Lord on
   earth, yet he still tripped in the same place where he used to fall,
   for he said, "Not so, Lord," as if he would again rebuke, refuse and
   contradict his Lord.

   I therefore put it again. What were your faults before conversion?
   Guard against them now. What have been your failures, your weaknesses
   and your errors since you have been converted? Watch against them,
   still, for if you have now become an experienced Christian and your
   Graces have been greatly developed--and you have become exceedingly
   useful in the Church of God--yet, beloved Brother or Sister, the points
   in which there is a weakness in your natural constitution and in which
   you have made failures are the points at which you must set a double
   guard of watching and praying lest you be led into temptation by those
   special features of your character. Kindly notice this earnest advice,
   which my

   loving anxiety leads me to press upon you. I have seen so much of the
   fruits of presumption that I entreat you not to give way to it. If
   anybody tells you that the old man is quite dead, you may say, "Nobody
   but the old devil could have set you on to whisper such a lie in my
   ear! The truth is not in you."

   You and I know that inbred sin is our daily plague, a fact past all
   question with our souls. We have not to go many steps on our journey
   before we painfully feel that the sins which we thought we had subdued
   and should never be subject to, any more, suddenly awaken themselves
   out of their graves and fight with us as if they had never been
   conquered! If we did not cry to God with tears and agony for hourly
   holding up, we should find ourselves falling into the same ditches into
   which we fell years ago! My venerable Friend, that point in which you
   feel that you are quite safe is the place where you lie most open to
   attack. Listen to my words and see if they are not verified. Where you
   say to yourself, "I am past danger on that account," there the enemy
   will get an advantage over you. "But I am strong," you say. Nonsense!
   You are weak as water! You dream of perfection, but you are a mass of
   needs, infirmities and conceits! And if it were not for the infinite
   mercy of God, who deals tenderly with you, you would soon have most
   painfully to know it to your own dis-honor--and to the grief of your
   Brothers and Sisters around you. Peter is still Peter, notwithstanding
   what Grace has done.

   You notice about Peter this thing still remaining, that he blurts out
   what he feels. Be it for bad or good, prompt deliverance of his mind is
   still the characteristic of Peter. He has seen the vision and he has
   heard the voice of God saying to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat." And
   without a minute's deliberation Peter replies, "Not so, Lord." That was
   how he did before. He was always blundering because he was in such a
   hurry. If he had put his finger to his forehead for half a minute, he
   would not have said many things which he did. This was a man whose
   wisdom always lay at the back of his head, instead of at the front of
   it. It came in to tell him that he had made a mistake, but it never
   came to hand soon enough to prevent the error! And Peter after
   Pentecost had not lost this trait of his character.

   I may be addressing young folk here who are very impulsive and speak
   out in a hurry, things which they, afterwards, are sorry for. I should
   not wonder if you continue to be impulsive when you grow older. Perhaps
   it will be one of your snares through life. Be on your guard against
   it! It is a strength if it is rightly managed. Give me the man who, in
   a good cause, does not think twice, but acts upon the warm impulses of
   a ready mind! Give me the man who understands that second thoughts are
   not always the best, for they are apt to chill--and the best thought is
   that which comes from a heart fired with the love of Christ! The best
   Christian workers to lead the van, to make a dash with a forlorn hope
   have been those brave, impulsive, Peter-like spirits!

   But that same characteristic, if not kept in proper order by the Spirit
   of God, may lead you into a world of mischief. You say your say so
   quickly, but you cannot unsay it, even in years and ages. You cannot
   call back the words which now cause you to bite your tongue with
   regret. You once grew very angry. It is true that 10 minutes calmed you
   and you were as sorry as possible for all your bitter speeches, but
   that could not undo the injury, nor heal the cruel wound that you had
   given to your faithful friend. You must cry to God that if you are
   impulsive, the impulses may always come from Him-- and you must ask
   Him, daily, to lead and guide you in the way of understanding. I pray
   that you may not often pull out your sword and cut off a man's ear, for
   Jesus is not here to work miracles, as He was at hand, fortunately,
   with Peter. And you may cut somebody's ear off and not be able to put
   it on again! Ask Him to keep you in check, that you may not be working
   mischief in your haste which you will have to repent of in your
   leisure.

   But Peter is still Peter and so does the renewed man betray the
   infirmities which were with him before his renewal. Yet Peter as Peter
   still has good points, for he acknowledges all this. Luke could not
   have recorded this incident in the Acts of the Apostles unless Peter
   had personally told him, for no one else knew of it. And in the next
   chapter we find that when Peter was brought up before the other
   Apostles for what he had done, he narrated the whole affair and
   confessed, "But I said, 'Not so, Lord.'" You see he was always
   outspoken, honest and clear as the day. There was a trace of
   dissimulation in him once, but I should think that it was strange work
   with him. As a general rule, the bluff fisherman spoke what first came
   to hand and had no cunning about him.

   In this let us be at one with him. If you carry that trait of character
   with you into the things of Grace, so much the better, for there is no
   Christian that is so little a Christian as the man who is great at
   tricks and mighty at "prudence." I think that is the name folks often
   give it. "Cunning," I call it. The man who blurts out his mind so that
   you know what he thinks, may get himself into lots of trouble, but he
   does not get so many other people into trouble as the double-

   minded man would do and, by the Grace of God, it often happens that his
   directness, sincerity and truthfulness work together to effect a great
   blessing in the midst of his Brethren. May the Spirit of God sanctify
   our peculiarities, that they may make us especially useful--but save us
   from our constitutional infirmities, that we may not, by them, be led
   into sin!

   There is the first head--the old man still remains in the regenerate
   man. It was apparent in Peter and it is evident enough in us.

   II. But now, secondly, THE OLD MAN GENERALLY FIGHTS AGAINST GOSPEL
   PRINCIPLES, for this was the point upon which Peter differed from his
   Lord. This, "Not so, Lord," applied to grand Gospel principles which
   had been put before him, as, for instance, the abolition of the
   Ceremonial Law. Peter was to know that those Ceremonial Laws which
   forbade the eating of this and that, were now to be abrogated. By
   Christ's coming here on earth and bearing a mortal body about with Him,
   He has taken away the ban from all forbidden meats, so far as they were
   forbidden upon religious grounds. God has cleansed them and what God
   has cleansed, Peter was not to call common. Peter, at the first,
   revolted from this--"I have never eaten anything that is common or
   unclean. Not so, Lord; not so! I cannot arise and kill, and eat."

   Many to this day quarrel with God's glorious Gospel on ceremonial
   grounds. The Scripture says that men are to be saved by faith but these
   formalists say, "Surely, they must be regenerated in Baptism--they must
   be further fed by the blessed Eucharist." Persons who are evangelical
   in their hearts and who unwittingly preach the Gospel, nevertheless
   muddle it up with a number of outward ordinances and thus they say,
   practically, "Not so, Lord." Ritualism is practically battling against
   that Gospel which lies in faith in Christ and not in ceremonies--that
   Gospel which demands spiritual life and not external performances! All
   of us are apt to err in this manner, for we incline to attach undue
   importance to matters which are proper and useful in their places, but
   which are, by no means, essential to salvation!

   One person thinks a great deal of confirmation which is purely an
   ordinance of man! Another thinks equally much of attending class
   meetings which is an instructive practice, but not a subject of Divine
   command. Where Jesus has made no rule, we are not to make any! We are
   to receive all whom Christ receives! None are unclean whom He has
   cleansed! None are to be set aside if He admits them to His love. Yet
   this lesson is not soon learned by sticklers for propriety--they
   question any man's salvation who follows not with them and, when bid to
   commune with them, they start aside with Peter's cry in their hearts,
   if not on their lips, "Not so, Lord!"

   The same battle is carried on by certain people who have never eaten
   anything common or unclean in the sense that they have never associated
   with any but very respectable people. Here the fight is concerning the
   equality of men before the Law and under the Gospel. An evangelist
   brings into the congregation all the poor people of the district and
   the very worst of characters gather to hear him. This ought to be a
   great joy, but in certain cases it is not. Many are offended and in
   effect say, "Not so, Lord. Well, really, I--I--I do not like sitting
   next to one who is dressed so badly and smells so vilely. I saw a woman
   of loose character come in and I felt as if I must leave my pew." Oh,
   you very respectable people, you know that you get into that state of
   mind! You do not say much about it when we hear you, because you know
   that it would not answer your purpose--yet you squeeze up against the
   corner of the pew to get away from the poor and needy!

   Do you not? If a man with a smock-frock, or with a dirty face comes in
   here, you would just as soon that he would sit on the flaps in the
   aisle as sit in your seat, and a great deal sooner, I dare say. There
   is a great deal of that kind of feeling about and it may be very
   natural, but it certainly betrays feebleness of Christian love. Truly,
   it is an instinct of cleanliness to shrink from the unwashed, but then
   it is an instinct of the new life to rejoice in the salvation of souls
   and, for the sake of it, to put up with greater discomforts than can
   arise from contact with the fallen. I suppose that in the days of
   James, when he rebuked those who beckoned the rich to sit near them,
   the Roman or the Jewish pauper was quite as disliked as any that are
   among us at this day, yet he makes no allowance for this. Let us prize
   the common and unclean so much that we never think of them in that
   light! Never let us set up the tyranny of caste and rebuild the middle
   wall of partition which our Savior died to throw down!

   "God has made of one blood all nations of men"--we sprang of a common
   parent and for men there is but one Savior! Let us know no
   partialities, but desire, with equal earnestness, the salvation of peer
   and pauper, of matron and harlot, of gentleman and vagabond! To hear
   some people speak of their fellow men is sickening to me--they talk of
   them as if they were mere offal and rubbish--not worthy of their
   genteel notice! I bless God that I seldom hear it, for it arouses my
   wrath! A minister in a certain neighborhood used solemnly to warn his
   people against all such wicked persons as

   Moody and Sankey and the like, because they were the means of saving
   the lower orders. He said, "I see people in this district professing to
   be saved and yet they never before went to a place of worship at all.
   Therefore," he said, "I do not believe in their salvation, for surely
   if God were about to save a great number, He would, first of all, save
   those who have for years regularly attended our places of worship."

   That was a bit of Peter-like propriety coming up and saying, "Not so,
   Lord." Oh, the cruelty of respectability! If you have anything of that
   left in your nature, ask God to turn it out! It was in the great
   Father's own house that there lived an elder brother who said, "As soon
   as this, your son was come, which has devoured your living with
   harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf." He was angry and
   would not go in. He was a very excellent man, indeed, a very
   respectable person--and he was not going in with such rag-tag as this
   prodigal brother of his. He did not like so much fuss made over a
   profligate. My Friend, that proud propriety is of the old man! Whenever
   that disposition comes up in you, it is your baser part--the part that
   ought to die--and in this way it shows its enmity to the Gospel of the
   Grace of God.

   I love to believe in the perfect equality of men in the sight of God as
   to the work of His Grace. If they do but seek the Lord and put their
   trust in Him, there is no difference--and this we must all maintain, as
   Christian men and women, by receiving all classes with joy. Otherwise,
   we shall be just getting where Peter was when he said, "Not so, Lord,"
   for he said that he had not eaten anything common or unclean--and we
   say that we have not associated with any person living in a back slum.

   The same kind of battle takes place when our old man fights against the
   Gospel in its great principle of Free and Sovereign Grace. You war
   against it yourself when you are conscious of having done wrong and,
   therefore, doubt the Grace of God. At once the old man says, "You have
   sinned and, therefore, you are out of God's favor--He will cast you
   away, and you will perish." But the Gospel principle is--

   "Whom once He loves He ne ver leaves, But loves them to the end."

   The tendency to legalism, which is natural to us, kicks against the
   glorious doctrine of Free Grace and unchanging love--and sometimes we
   say, "I am afraid that I am not good enough to pray, or fit to
   participate in the Grace of God"--as if God needed some good in us
   before He could bestow His Grace upon us! A diseased man is fit to be
   healed; a poor man is fit for alms; a drowning man is fit to be
   rescued; a sinful man is fit to be forgiven! God would have us come to
   Him all empty, feeble, sinful and erring--and just receive of His free
   favor in Christ Jesus, spontaneously given on His part, without
   anything in us that can merit His esteem.

   Oh, it is a grand thing to be able to spell that word,
   "Grace--Grace--Grace"! Somebody said the other day that to say, "Free
   Grace" was to use a redundancy. That is so. But there is such a real
   redundancy in Grace that we do not mind using a redundancy of
   expression when we are talking about it. "Free Grace" we still mean to
   say, for, as some people will not believe that Grace is free, it is
   still necessary to make it very clear that it is so, and to say not
   only, "Grace," but "Free Grace." Christ did not die for saints, but for
   sinners. He came not into the world because of our righteousness, but
   He died for our sins.

   The work of God is not to save men deserving salvation, but men who are
   altogether undeserving of it. The great flood of Divine Mercy overflows
   and drowns all our sins--rising and yet rising, 50 cubits upwards--till
   the tops of the mountains of our iniquity are all covered, never to be
   seen again. What a grand article of the creed is that--"I believe in
   the forgiveness of sins"! Why are we so slow to believe it? Is it not
   our old man rising, even as it did in Peter, to give battle to Free
   Grace with its, "Not so, Lord"?

   III. Thirdly, and as briefly as I can, I would remind you that THE OLD
   NATURE SHOWS ITSELF IN MANY WAYS, always fighting against God. "Not so,
   Lord," is often the cry of our unregenerate part. It is so against the
   Doctrine of the Gospel. Some persons do not believe the Gospel because
   they do not want to believe it. They studiously omit to read all such
   parts of Scripture as would enlighten their minds. They are not
   convincible because they have already persuaded themselves as to what
   truth ought to be. "Not so, Lord," is their cry! Beloved, never get
   into that state of mind! Follow God's Word anywhere, believing what the
   Spirit says--let Him teach you what He may. Whatever your notions may
   have been, when you come across a clear statement in the Word of God,
   bow your every thought to it and accept its teaching, for it is true,
   whatever your thoughts may be. It is mine to believe what the Bible
   teaches. It is not mine to object and cry, "Not so, Lord."

   This old nature of ours sometimes cries out against God in matters of
   duty. We can do anything except the special duty of the hour and as to
   that one thing, we say, "Not so, Lord." Yonder young woman knows, that
   according to God's Word, she must not marry that young man, for she
   would be unequally yoked together with an unbeliever. Now, she was
   quite willing to be baptized and she is heartily willing to give her
   money to the Lord and, in fact, to do anything except that one act of
   self-denial which would require her to cease from a fond friendship.
   Yet, my Friend, I do not know what sorrow you will make for yourself if
   you really break that salutary rule. I have seen many instances of
   mixed marriages, but I have had to mourn over nearly all of them as the
   cause of untold wretchedness. Take the precept and, knowing that it is
   God's mind concerning you, never dare, even for a moment, to hesitate.
   "Whatever He says unto you, do it." Never let your lips say, "Not so,
   Lord," for it is disobedience to go against the command of the Lord
   your God!

   As it is with your practice, so let it be with everything else. Our
   corrupt nature will dare to quibble at processes of sanctification. We
   are anxious to bear fruit, but we do not care to be pruned. We are glad
   to be delivered from dross, but not by the fire. Rebukes are
   undervalued, searching Truths of God are avoided, faithful friends are
   shunned and awakening Scriptures are neglected--for carnal ease pleads
   hard for indulgence--and the flesh whines, "Not so, Lord."

   Even in the dispensation of the Kingdom self-will comes in--we like not
   that God should bless men by a sect to which we do not belong! We are
   envious for our own Moses, lest the irregular Eldads and Medads should
   eclipse him. I have known old folks object to the Lord's blessing that
   rather obtrusive young woman, that very forward lad, that overzeal-ous
   person! Let God bless us, certainly, but not by objectionable people!
   Many would prefer Apostles from Athens rather than from Nazareth--they
   prefer the smell of study lamp oil to that of the fishing boats of
   Galilee! We pray for conversions, yet certain persons would not believe
   in them if they happened out of the regular way. We are too masterful
   by half and are far from taking up our proper position as servants. Too
   much of the Peter clings to us and our tongue is much too ready to cry
   out, "Not so, Lord."

   Our natural corruption is apt to quarrel with the Lord concerning our
   sufferings. Against this, also, be always watchful. Whenever you are
   called to endure trial, do not complain of the particular form it
   takes. Perhaps it is great bodily pain and you say, "I could bear
   anything better than this." That is a mistake. God knows what is the
   best for His child. Do not cry, "Not so." "Oh, I could bear sickness,"
   says another, "but I have been slandered! My character is taken away
   and I cannot bear that." Thus our will asserts its place and we pine to
   be our own god and ruler! This must not be. You must, my dear Friend,
   bear that which the Lord appoints, or else you will make the matter a
   lot worse. If you need anything done well, do it yourself, with this
   exception--that if you need your character defended, you should always
   let that alone. Somebody else will take care of that for you and if
   slander is the rod under which you are to smart, many of us have felt
   it before you, and you need not complain so bitterly, as if a strange
   thing had happened to you. Do not cry, "Not so, Lord," but let the Lord
   appoint you care or calumny, sickness or slander, for He knows best.

   "But I am afraid that I shall lose my wife, or a favorite child. I
   think that I could have suffered anything but that." Yes, you see, a
   rebellious spirit contends with God, one way or another--it cannot be
   quiet. I was greatly struck with a story a dear Sister told me
   yesterday. She was very nearly being removed from the Church--she had
   quarreled with the Lord for taking away her husband and she would not
   go to any place of worship she felt so angry about her loss. But her
   little child came to her one morning and said, "Mother, do you think
   Jonah was right when he said, 'I do well to be angry, even unto
   death'?" She replied, "O child, do not talk to me," and put the little
   one away, but she felt the rebuke-- and it brought her back to her God
   and back to her Church--humbly rejoicing in Him who had used this
   instrumentality to set her right with her Lord!

   O Friends, let us be silent before the Lord and judge His ways no
   longer, for in this judgment there is no benefit to ourselves or
   others! Do not say, "Not so," but rather, "It is the Lord, let Him do
   what seems good to Him." When Jacob crossed his aged hands to bless the
   two sons of Joseph, according to the Divine will, Joseph said, "Not so,
   my Father"-- but he could not alter his father's act. Jacob guided his
   hands wittingly and the blessing came as God would have it. Perhaps a
   great blessing is coming on you in a cross-handed manner. The Patriarch
   had experienced many a cross-handed blessing, himself, and, therefore,
   he knew what he was doing--

   "Cross-handed came the blessing down On Jacob's hoary head, When
   Joseph's bloody coat was shown As numbered with the dead."

   Many a wonderful blessing has come to us in that cross-handed way. Bow
   your head, therefore, and silence your tongue--and have done forever
   with arraigning your Maker before your petty judgment seat! Shall not
   the heavenly Father do that which is right and good?

   Sometimes our corrupt nature quarrels with God about our service. The
   Lord says, "Go into the Sunday school." "I should have liked to
   preach," says the young man. "Go into the Sunday school." "Not so,
   Lord," he says, and he will not go, and thus he misses his life-work.
   It will not do for us to choose what work we will do. Who would employ
   servants who, when they are told to do this or go there, should say,
   "No, Sir, I prefer another engagement"? They will get their money on
   Saturday night with the advice to find a new master! We may well pray--

   "Dismiss me not Your service, Lord," if we have been pickers and
   choosers of our work. Do what the Lord bids you, when He bids you,
   where He bids you, as He bids you, as long as He bids you--and do it at
   once! Never say, "Not so, Lord."

   "But," you say, "Hi's Providence is very strange to me. I am called
   away from the place where my heart has struck its roots. God deals with
   me in a terrible manner." Truly His way is in the storm. Yet, never
   say, "Not so, Lord." It is not a pretty position for a child of God to
   be in to be trying to amend the arrangements of the great Father! The
   Omniscient knows best! You think so, do you not? Do not act as if you
   thought the contrary. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, an obedient heart, a
   yielding spirit, a submissive mind and an acquiescence in the Divine
   will are the necessary elements of happiness--the spirit of, "Not so,
   Lord," is the mother of all the mists and fogs that darken our pathway!
   If you will walk contrary to God, He will walk contrary to you. "Unto
   the froward He will show Himself froward," but to the humble and
   contrite, the submissive and obedient, He will show Himself exceedingly
   gracious!

   If you will stoop, you shall conquer. If you will yield, you shall have
   your desire. If you will be nothing, God will make much of you. If you
   will be lowly, God will exalt you. But if you will stand out against
   your Lord, as surely as He loves you, He will correct you and He will
   teach you better manners before He is done with you!

   IV. Let us leave that point and close with a fourth observation--IT IS
   A GREAT PITY WHEN THIS KIND OF

   WILLFULNESS STANDS IN THE WAY OF USEFULNESS. It would have been so with
   Peter if the Lord had not used the process by which He overcame him.
   "Not so, Lord," said Peter. "Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten
   anything that is common or unclean." In some things, Peter was a great
   deal too conservative. He says, "Not so, Lord," and some read it,
   "Never, Lord, never, Lord, for I have never!" That is, "I must never do
   a thing I have never done." Many are of this mind--they cannot advance
   an inch! This is the hymn they sing each morning before breakfast, "As
   it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.
   Amen." And until they go to bed at night, it is the tune they keep on
   singing, "As it was in the beginning. As it was in the beginning." They
   will never do what has not been done, nor learn what they have not
   learned!

   Many will only act as others act. They must keep in the fashion. Now
   this is a rule which I never accepted, for it always seemed to me that
   I was probably to do what nobody had done before me--for was I not, in
   some points, different from everyone else? One likes to look about and
   search for methods of usefulness which have not been tried, for a novel
   form of labor may be like a bit of virgin soil which will yield a
   better crop than our own arable lands which have been drained so long.
   Do you not think that Christian men are apt to be stereotyped in their
   ways? You must always sing so many verses and no more--you must pray at
   a certain time and go right round Europe, Asia, Africa and America
   before you close your petitions. Certain people must always do what
   they have done, even though they fall asleep in the doing of it! This
   kind of routine forbids enlarged usefulness, prevents our getting at
   out-of-the-way people and puts a damper upon all zeal. Let us struggle
   against the spirit which would bind us hand and foot--where the Spirit
   of the Lord is, there is liberty! Let us not say, "Never, Lord, for I
   have never," but, on the contrary--"Right speedily will I attempt this
   work of usefulness because I have neglected it so long--I will make
   haste and delay no longer to keep Your commandments."

   Propriety hinders very many--decorum is their death. I do not know the
   precise meaning of it, but there are genteel people about who consider
   that the finest thing on earth is, "propriety." Mr. Rowland Hill was
   said to have ridden on the back of all order and decorum. "No," he
   said, "I cannot ride on the back of two horses, but I have two horses
   to my carriage and I have called one of them, 'Order,' and the other,
   'Decorum,' to make the report come as nearly right as possible." Order
   and decorum were never put to a better use than when they drew Mr.
   Rowland Hill from town to town

   preaching the Gospel! And I, for one, am glad that he never took those
   horses into the pulpit! He was just as disorderly and indecorous as a
   Christian man ought to be--that is to say, he was perfectly natural and
   spoke the Truth of God from his heart and men that heard it felt the
   power of it--and so he became a blessing to this part of London and,
   indeed, to the whole world! Shake yourself up a little, my Brother! If
   you are too precise, may the Lord set you on fire and consume your
   bonds of red tape! If you have become so improperly proper that you
   cannot commit a proper impropriety, then pray God to help you to be
   less proper, for there are many who will never be saved by your
   instrumentality while you study propriety!

   Again, I doubt not that some are hindered in their usefulness by their
   great dignity. It is amazing what noble creatures men can grow into if
   they are left alone. "This great Babylon that I have built," cries
   Nebuchadnezzar! That is the same gentleman who, afterwards, ate grass
   like the oxen and whose nails grew like birds' claws. We have seen
   very, very, very great little people and very, very little great people
   who have given themselves mighty airs--but we have never seen any good
   come of their greatness! Few people are blessed by these gorgeous
   individuals. God seldom sends His Elijahs bread and meat by peacocks.
   If you ladies are very finely dressed and go visiting into the houses
   of the poor and you "condescend" to them, they will not want to see you
   any more. But if you go in and sit at their side and show them that you
   are their true friends, you get at their hearts.

   Love yourself less and less and love your God more! Love the soul of
   every man with all the intensity of your being. Struggle and agonize to
   bring sinners to the Savior's feet and God will help you. But if you
   stand on your dignity and say, "Lord, not so; for I have never eaten
   anything common or unclean," it will be a serious injury to you. I said
   to one of our classes, "Let I grow very small, and let J grow very
   great," and the Brothers and Sisters did not need an explanation. May
   we so love our Lord Jesus that we cease to care for dignity and are
   willing to be nothing for His sake!

   Are there any here who have not yet believed in Jesus? I hope they will
   trust their souls with Him at once and, when they have done so, let
   them come forward without delay and confess His name and be baptized
   into the sacred Three! Then let them try to grow downward lower and
   lower, till they sink into nothing, that Christ may be All in All!

The History of Sundry Fools

   (No. 1824)

   Intended for reading on Lord's-Day, March 1st, 1885,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [7]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On July 17th, 1884,

   "Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities,
   are afflicted. Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat, and they draw
   near unto the gates of death. Then they cry unto the Lord in their
   trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses. He sent his word,
   and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction." Psalm
   107:17-20.

   THE psalm contains one picture in four panels. It illustrates a single
   experience in its main outlines, for in every case it is written, "Then
   they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saveth them out of
   their distresses"; and yet each case is very different from any one of
   the others. We have variety and similarity. It is just so in the case
   of the people of God. Our fall, our sin, our call by grace, our prayer,
   the Lord's answer to that prayer by Jesus Christin all these, "as face
   answereth to face, so doth the heart of man to man." We are wonderfully
   much alike as children of the first Adam, and alike when we become
   children of the second Adam; and yet no two children of God are quite
   the same. In human families we meet with great diversity of features
   among those who are, nevertheless, the offspring of the same parents.
   In the great family of God the diversity of the features is very
   wonderful indeed. Look at the four pictures which are so much alike,
   and which indeed do but represent one, and yet you shall discover in
   them marked diversity. Learn you this double lessonthat unless your
   spot is the spot of God's children you are none of his: but also, do
   not expect to find that spot exactly the same in you as it is in others
   of his undoubted offspring. As on earth all flesh is not the same
   flesh, and as in the heavens all glories are not the same glory, for
   there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
   another glory of the stars; so in the ordinary life of Christians here
   below there is one Spirit, but there are divers operations. Therefore
   do not judge yourself by any man's biography. Do not condemn yourself
   if, after reading John Bunyan's "Grace Abounding," you say, "I never
   went into these dark places." Be glad that you never did. After reading
   Madame Guyon, do not condemn yourself if you never heard her
   "Torrents," nor felt her ecstasies of divine life. Be sorry that you
   never have, and aspire after such things, but do not condemn yourself.
   Here are four pictures, and you may find your likeness in one of the
   four; but be not so unwise as to condemn yourself if you are not seen
   in the other three. "I never went to sea," says one, "this cannot
   picture me." "I never traversed a Sahara," says another, "this cannot
   picture me." "I never was in prison in the dark," says a third, "this
   cannot picture me." But it is possible, dear friend, that you have been
   a fool, and therefore the sick fool may picture you. When you find
   yourself in one of the pictures, you may conclude that, as the four are
   but variations of the same subject, all the four in some degree belong
   to you. At any rate, if I cannot enter into heaven by twelve gates, I
   shall be perfectly satisfied to go in at one.

   I am only going to bring out two out of the many thousands of things
   that lie packed away in the wonderful box of my text. There are two
   things,the miserable people, and the merciful Lord.

   I. THE MISERABLE PEOPLE, first. I am going to describe them, and my
   object in the description will be to show what some have been who,
   nevertheless, have been saved. These people are called fools. They
   abhorred all manner of meat. They drew near to the gates of death. But
   they were saved for all that, for they cried unto God in their trouble,
   and he delivered them out of their distresses. The inference will be
   that if Iif youshould happen to be just in the same condition as
   these people, yet we may have hope that God will save us.

   To begin with, the first description of them is that they were fools.
   Now, I must not call you fools, but you have all of you liberty to call
   yourselves so. I find it forbidden in Scripture for any man to call his
   brother "fool," but I do not find him forbidden to call himself so.
   Look well to yourself, and see whether you are not a fool now:at
   least, if God's grace has saved you, you are bound to own that you were
   once a FOOL in capital letters; for every unrenewed and unregenerate
   man is a fool. We call those fools who have a great want of knowledge
   of things which it is necessary to know. Where other men find their
   way, they are lost. Where other men know what to do upon very simple
   matters, they are quite bewildered and cannot tell how to act. I
   remember when I did not know the way of salvation. I had heard it from
   my youth up, and heard it explained very simply, too; but I did not
   know it. Many must confess that, though now they understand what faith
   in Jesus is, yet they were very slow in catching the idea. It is an
   idea which a babe in grace can explain, but which wise men, classically
   instructed, do not receive. I may stand here, and beat my very heart
   out in trying to make plain how men are to believe and live, and yet
   out of my congregation not one will receive God's meaning into his
   heart unless God the Holy Ghost shall enlighten him; for we are such
   fools that the simplest matters of heavenly truth are utterly unknown
   to us.

   He, too, is a fool who, when he does know, does not make right use of
   his knowledge. He is a greater fool than the former one. He knows all
   about it, but yet he does not do it. He understands that the only way
   to be saved is to believe in Christ; but he does not believe. He knows
   that men must repent of sin if they would find mercy; but he does not
   repent of sin. He knows that life is uncertain, and yet he is risking
   his soul upon the chances of his continuing to live. He lives as if he
   had a lease of his life, and was absolutely certain that he could not
   die till he chose to be converted. Now this is to be a foolto act
   contrary to your own knowledge and better judgment. How many fools
   there are of this kind!

   We call him a fool who hurts himself without any profitwithout any
   justifying cause. The man who flings his life away to save a nation, or
   even to rescue one solitary person from death, is a hero; but what is
   he who, for no motive whatever, will maim himselfwill take away his
   own healthwill take away his own life? Are there none such here? Look
   at the drunkard! Look at the man who is guilty of unclean living! Look
   at such as prefer this world to the world to come, and throw themselves
   away on trifles! O sirs, there be many men that have injured themselves
   so that their sin lies in their bones. Even now they feel the result of
   their transgressions. The moth is foolish that flies into the candle,
   and, having burnt itself, dashes again into the flame. We count the ox
   foolish that goes willingly to the shambles; but there are multitudes
   of men and women who take delight in sin; and, though every cup around
   them be poisoned, yet they drink at it as though it were nectar.
   Verily, sinners are fools!

   We are great fools when we think that we can find pleasure in sin, or
   profit in rebellion. We are great fools when we displease our God,when
   our best Friend, on whom our eternal future depends, is despised,
   neglected, and even rejected and hated by us. It is the extreme of
   folly when a man loses the good will of one who can help him,when he
   rejects the love of a tender mother, and the counsel of a wise father.
   Some men seem resolved to make their enemies their friends, and their
   friends their enemies. They put darkness for light, and light for
   darkness. They go to find the living among the dead, and true helpers
   among those who pander to their sin. Such fools have you and I been.
   Peradventure, some here are such fools now.

   I call that man a fool who throws away jewels that he may gather
   pebbles, who casts away gold and silver that he may gather up mire and
   dirt. And what do they do who fling away heaven and eternal life for
   the sake of a transient joy, a momentary gain? Are there not some men
   living in this world only to get what will one day turn into smoke?
   They know that this great world, and all the works of men that are
   therein, must be dissolved with fervent heat; and yet they labor to
   build a mansion for their immortal souls in this place, which is to be
   utterly burned up. And, meanwhile, thou, O Son of God, Immortal Love,
   art treated as though thou wert a mere fiction! And thou, great Father,
   fullness of eternal grace, their backs are turned on thee! And O,
   holiness, and virtue, and immortal blessedness all of you are suffered
   to go by while men are hunting for gewgaws and gathering trinkets that
   shall so soon be taken from them. If haply as you sit here you confess,
   "I have been a fool; I know I have," then you may gather comfort from
   the fact that fools were saved. He that has gone to the utmost excess
   of unwisdom may yet hear the invitation of wisdom, and come and learn
   at Christ's feet all that is needful for eternal life.

   The next thing about these people is rather worse: they were not only
   fools, but sinners. The text says that "fools, because of their
   transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted." You see
   they had several sorts of sintransgression and iniquities. They began
   with one transgression; they went on to multiplied iniquities. There
   was first in their heart a transgression against God; afterwards, there
   were found in their lives many inequities, both towards God and towards
   man. Sin multiplies itself very rapidly. It grows from one to a
   countless multitude. We will not go into the details of the
   transgressions and iniquities that you may have committed; but here is
   the point,these people, who were fools, and full of transgression and
   iniquity, nevertheless cried to God in their trouble, and he delivered
   them out of their distresses. What form has your sin taken? Think of it
   in your own heart. But, whatever form it has taken, God is able to
   forgive you. "All manner of sin and blaspheming shall be forgiven unto
   men." "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin."
   There is no sin which is unpardonable if men repent of it. The sin that
   is unpardonable is one of which no man ever thought of repenting, for
   it is a sin which is unto death, and when committed the man is
   spiritually dead, and never repents. If there be a sin upon you,
   however black and foulif it be a horrible sin which I could not
   mention because it might crimson the cheek of modesty if I did but even
   hint at itif you are covered with it, polluted with it beyond all
   imaginationyet, of the saints in heaven it can be said, "such were
   some of you, but ye are washed." You are not more astray than certain
   others, or if you are, so much the greater shall be the glory of God's
   grace in saving you. It is written of our Lord that he is able to "have
   compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way." O you
   out-of-the-way sinners, what a comfortable word that is for you! No sin
   shall destroy you if you will come to the sinner's Savior. No
   excellence of your own shall save you if you reject that Savior. Come
   in all your sin, though it reeks to heaven: though the stench of it be
   loathsome in your own nostrils, yet, come to Jesus, for "the blood of
   Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin."

   But we must go on with the picture. These people were not only fools
   and sinners, which are two bad things; but they had a third mischief
   about them: they were afflicted. "Fools, because of their
   transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted." Their
   affliction was evidently the result of their folly and their
   transgression. Do I address any who are in that case? I hardly like to
   say what may have happened to some here. They may be distressed in
   spirit, and unable to pursue their business with anything like
   cheerfulness. They may be subject to doleful forebodings and heavy
   glooms, and all the result of sin in years gone by. They have now got
   to the core of the apple of sin. It is wonderfully sweet till you get
   to the core, and then it is bitter, ay, more bitter than death itself.

   Once these men were fools and sinners, and now they have to suffer for
   it. They are afflicted because of their transgression and their
   iniquities. Some suffer in body. Others suffer in estate: their
   property is all gone now. They have spent all. Riotously, foolishly,
   wickedly it has gone. They had money once; they have none now. They had
   the means of livelihood and competence, but they have so sinned that
   they cannot be trusted now. They are waifs and strays on the great
   ocean, drifting about, nobody wanting them. How I long to say a word of
   comfort to those who are in that condition! If you repent, if you will
   arise and come to your Father, why should you not be delivered out of
   your distresses? Do you not see that God does deliver such as you are?
   Is not the case before you in the text? They were fools afflicted, they
   were sinners afflicted, beginning to feel, even on earth, a part of the
   result of their sin. They began to reap those sheaves of fire which
   they sowed with such merry-making years ago; and, as they put those
   sheaves into their bosom, they wondered how they could escape being
   immediately consumed. But they did escape, and so may you. God has
   saved such as you now are, and all those saved ones should encourage
   you to hope that he will save you.

   The picture is getting black, but we must put on another coat of color.
   In addition to this, these people had fallen into a soul-sickness.
   Through their trouble and their consciousness of sin, they had fallen
   into such a state of illness that nothing could help them. The best
   food was brought to them, but they waved it away: their soul abhorred
   all manner of meat. Some are in such a state that the amusements which
   once were joys to them are now wearisome. You have been lately to the
   theater, and you used to be charmed there. You cannot make out what has
   come over it: it seems so dull to you. You used to enjoy cheerful
   evenings with your merry-making friends, but now you would sooner get
   upstairs alone, for you feel so wretched. When you are alone, there is
   one person who plagues you: if you could only get away from him, you
   would be content; but that person happens to be yourself, and there
   appears to be no rest for you either in company or in solitude. Your
   soul abhors all manner of meat. I have known souls to get into such a
   state that books, interesting and instructive, they could not read any
   longer. They felt no interest in anything of the sort; and poetry, and
   all the charms of art, which once they very properly enjoyed could
   afford them no pleasure. The best mental recreation cannot give such
   persons any stay from their fierce, self-destroying thoughts. Ay, and
   they even refuse good spiritual meat. If the preacher tries to give
   them milk for babes, that is too weak for them: if he brings out strong
   meat, that is too tough for their teeth. If he brings them "wine on the
   lees, well-refined," that is too heating; if he offers the water of
   life, that is too cold. Nothing will suit them. They grumble at all
   kinds of teaching. Religious books do not cheer them; even the Bible
   itself seems stale and unprofitable. You are in a frightful condition,
   my friends, are you not? You are so sick that the meat which best would
   suit you is that which you least care for. Yet God has saved some who
   have fallen into this wretched way; and he invites you to come to him,
   and trust in him, with the promise that he will save even you, though
   you are as bad as you well can be.

   But the case was worse than that, for we read, "They draw near unto the
   gates of death." This poor creature was almost dead. He could see
   death-gate and hell-gate right before him. He was lying at death's
   door, expecting every moment to be thrown through the portal into
   eternal destruction and endless wrath. I remember when I lay in bosom
   of despair in my own apprehension. I knew that I was condemned on
   account of sin, and my conscience said "Amen" to the condemnation. I
   could not plead any reason why I should not at once be taken out to
   endless execution on account of my sin; and I certainly felt the dread
   shadow of coming wrath falling upon my soul. AND YET I AM SAVED blessed
   be God! And so shall you, dear hearer, though you be ready to die, and
   ready to be damned, be saved by faith in Jesus. Though you begin to
   feel the fire-shower falling, and the first of the dread drops have
   already buried their way into your soul, yet may you escape. The Savior
   comes to those who

   Buried in sorrow and in sin,
   At death's dark door do lie.

   He brings "salvation" to such; and he says to the dying sinner, "This
   day has salvation come unto thy house." What a glorious gospel we have
   to preach to you miserable people!

   But yet we have not quite touched up the picture with the last shade of
   black. This man not only lay at death's door, full of trouble, full of
   distress, but he was surrounded by many destructions. In the twentieth
   verse we read, "and he delivered them from their destructions." What!
   Are there many destructions to a man? Oh, yes, a great many! I have
   known one man destroyed by his shop, another by his wife, another by
   his children. Many a woman is destroyed by her clothes; many a man is
   destroyed by his eating; millions are destroyed by their drinking.
   Everything about us will destroy us unless God saves us. There are a
   thousand gates to hell, though there is only one road to heaven. One
   man may perish by debauchery; another may perish by respectability. One
   man may be lost in the ale-house; another man may be lost through his
   teetotalism, if he makes a god of it. One man may go down to hell by
   his want of common decency, and another by his pride, and prudery, and
   self-righteousness. Do not deceive yourselfthe way to ruin is easy,
   and many crowd it. If you want to go to heaven, well, we shall have to
   tell you a great deal about what is to be believed; but if you want to
   go to hell, I have no need to tell you anything,"How shall we escape
   if we neglect so great salvation?" A little matter of neglect will land
   you in hell. But it is not a little matter of thought that will bring
   you to heaven; there must be a stirring up of the entire soulan
   awakening of the whole man to seek after God in Christ Jesus; or else
   you shall perish. Surrounded, then, with destructionssnares about your
   bed, snares about your table, snares in your solitude, snares in the
   street, snares in your shop, snares at dawn of day, and snares at set
   of sunyou are in awful, terrible danger; and yet persons surrounded
   with destructions have been saved, and why should not you? They have
   cried to God in their trouble, and he has delivered them out of their
   destructions; will he not do the same at your cry? What a charming word
   is this for desponding spirits!

   II. I have but a minute or two left, where I should have wished for an
   hour, to speak upon THE MERCIFUL LORD.

   Very briefly indeed. This merciful Lord appears in this picture where
   you do not at first see him. I think I see him in that first verse: he
   sent the affliction. "Fools, because of their transgression, and
   because of their iniquities, are afflicted." Ah me! "Are afflicted."
   Who afflicted them, then? Why, their own Fathertheir own Shepherd, who
   saw that they would never come back to him if it were not for
   affliction. I see you, friend. You are a stray sheep, and I could not
   get you back. Now you cry, "Alas, I am in trouble!" I am sorry that you
   should be troubled, but I am not altogether sorry. I can see the black
   dog is worrying you. It is that he may get you back to the Shepherd.
   Many will not come back till the black dog has his teeth in their
   flesh, but if it surely drives you to the good Shepherd, it will be
   your true friend. I question whether many of us did come to the Lord
   Jesus Christ until we were afflicted in some way or other. Our bright
   days led us more and more into sin. Then came a dark day; and then we
   began to turn. "When he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
   that land." Blessed be God for the famine! "He began to be in want":
   now he will have to test his gay friends and flatterers. There was a
   gentleman who had drunk his champagne, and put his feet under his
   mahogany; and the prodigal said, "Now I have fed that man, I dare say
   he will entertain me now I am in poverty." "I cannot help you," he
   replied. "Can you give me some employment?" "No. What are you worth?
   Well, you can feed my pigs." And he "sent him into his fields to feed
   swine." That is the black dog again. If the gentleman had said, "Oh,
   yes, my dear young fellow, you were very generous when you had plenty
   of money, I am very sorry for you, come and live with me: while I have
   a crust you shall have part of it;" that would have been the worst
   thing that could have happened, for the prodigal son would never have
   thought of going home. I say that your troubles are mercies in
   disguise. Your sicknesses, your poverty, and your miseryoh, I bless
   God for them! The heavenly Father has sent this rumbling waggon to
   bring you home to himself. Oh that you would but come to yourself! Oh
   that you would but come to him! See, the grace of God appears in the
   very affliction of these rebellious fools.

   But note this, further: they began to pray; and here we see the Lord
   again; for no one seeks after God till God has put the prayer into his
   heart, and breathed a new life into his spirit.

   Then as soon as ever he did pray, the Lord heard the prayer. We read,
   "He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their
   destructions." So, beloved, all that God has to do, in order to save
   us, is to send us his word. He has done that by sending his dear Son,
   who is the incarnate Word. He sends us the word in the shape of the
   Holy Scriptures; he sends us the word in the preaching of his servants;
   but what we want most of all is to have that word sent home by the
   power of the Holy Spirit. "He sent his word, and healed them." There is
   nothing that you want to-night but to have the word which the Lord has
   spoken sealed home to your heart, so that you accept it, and believe
   it. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."

   I want you to notice how the Lord rescued these people. You see, they
   could not eat. They had reached such a state of sickness that they
   could not take anything; they abhorred all manner of meat, and we do
   not find that the Lord sent them any meat. No, he sent his word. Did he
   send his word like a tonic, to give them an appetite? No, he made surer
   work. Many doctors try to deal with the disease, but God does not. He
   deals with the patient himself, and his constitution. He healed them
   radically. Then, when he had healed them their appetite came back. They
   did not abhor all manner of meat when once God had healed them. The
   Lord does not operate upon the symptoms, but upon the person; he does
   not deliver us from this sin and that sin and the other sin; but he
   takes away the old heart, out of which the sin comes, and gives a new
   heart, out of which there come repentance, and faith, and a change of
   life. If you have a lantern, and it is dark, you may polish the outside
   of it as long as ever you like, and no light will come out of it: the
   first thing to be done is to put a candle inside the lantern. This is
   what the Lord does; and then, when he puts the candle inside the
   lantern, we say to ourselves, "this lantern looks very dirty, it must
   be cleaned." Is it any fouler than it was before the light was put into
   it? It is the same lantern exactly, but, when you put the candle into
   it, you perceive how dirty it is by the light shining within. It is of
   no use to try to clean and polish it up till you have placed the
   lighted candle in it. You know how Mr. Moody puts it. A lady, we will
   say, takes a looking-glass, and she looks into it and she sees a spot
   on her face. That is the use of the looking-glassto reveal spots; but
   you never heard of a lady trying to wash her face with a looking-glass,
   for that is not its use. No, the looking-glass shows the spots, but it
   cannot take the spots away. First of all, by means of the law, we find
   out our spots, but we have to go to Jesus Christ, in the gospel, to get
   those spots taken away. Blessed are those who have gone to him!

   "He sent his word, and healed them." With one word, the Lord Jesus at
   this hour can heal every sin-sick soul before me, for where the word of
   a King is, there is power. He spake, and the heavens were of old; let
   him but speak again, and there will be new heavens and a new earth to
   you. Poor sinner, you are dead, but all that Christ did when he raised
   the dead in his time was to speak to them; and his word by these lips,
   through his Spirit, can raise you out of your death in sin. If you are
   black as the very fiend of hell, and steeped up to the throat in every
   infamy that God abhors, yet if his word shall come to you, and you
   receive it into your soul, you shall be saved upon the spot, and
   delivered from your destructions. Here is a word of the Lord. Obey it,
   I entreat you. "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
   earth: for I am God, and there is none else." Here is another; hearken
   to it, and live:"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
   and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
   and milk without money and without price." Let all that labor and are
   heavy-laden come unto Christ, and he will give them rest. The Lord
   grant that you may come at once, without delay, and to his name shall
   be the praise. Amen and Amen.

An Inscription for the Mausoleum of the Saints

   (No. 1825)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 1, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON MAY 8, 1884.

   "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
   seen them afar off, were persuaded of them, embraced them and confessed
   that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For those who say
   such things declare plainly that they seek a country." Hebrews
   11:13,14.

   "THESE all died in faith." Believers constitute a class by
   themselves--"These." They are the people that dwell alone and shall not
   be numbered among the nations. We see a great many distinctions in the
   world which God takes no notice of--there is neither Jew nor Gentile,
   bond nor free in His sight. But there is a distinction which men think
   little of, which is greatly observed of God, and that is the
   distinction between them that believe and those that believe not. Faith
   puts you across the border most effectually, for it brings you out of
   darkness into marvelous light, from death to life and from the dominion
   of Satan into the Kingdom of God's dear Son. It is the most important
   thing under Heaven that we should know that we believe in God. The Holy
   Spirit puts Believers by themselves and speaks of them as, "These."

   Believers are a class by themselves, even when they die. It is idle to
   think that we can mark out a spot in the cemetery where none but saints
   shall sleep, but yet there is a truth at the bottom of that folly.
   There is a separation even in death between the righteous and the
   wicked. The Lord seems to erect a mausoleum in which lie asleep the
   bodies of His people and He writes this epitaph across the front,
   "THESE ALL DIED IN FAITH." As for those who died without faith, they
   indeed, died. But as for His people, a glorious resurrection awaits
   them--

   "They sleep in Jesus and are blest, How kind their slumbers are."

   The characteristics of God's people are peculiar to themselves. They
   are all alike in that they all lived and all died in faith. They were
   not all equally believers, for some were strong in faith, and others
   were weak--but they all had faith and it continued in them even to the
   end so that, without exception--"these all died in faith." We will
   speak, first, of dying in faith. Secondly, of the faith according to
   which they died. Thirdly, of living by faith, for that is mentioned in
   the text, "They confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
   earth." And then, fourthly, of the faith by which they lived--"For
   those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."

   I. First, then, here is DYING IN FAITH. What does it mean? Does it not
   mean that when they came to die they had not faith to seek, but having
   had faith in life, they had faith in death? I will pronounce no opinion
   upon deathbed repentance. I have heard judgments far too sanguine. I
   have heard verdicts far too severe. Where we know little, we had better
   say little, but this much I may say--I would not like to lie upon a
   sickbed, much less upon my deathbed and have a Savior to seek there!
   The pains and dying strife are usually enough to occupy a man's
   thoughts. It frequently happens that the brain is disordered by disease
   and he that was clear of judgment, before, is then scarcely able to
   think. You must, yourself, have often seen men departing out of this
   life to whom it was useless to speak. If conscious at all, they were
   barely conscious. Have I not pressed the hand and received no token of
   recognition from a familiar friend? Have I not spoken into the ear and
   yet there has been neither hearing nor answering?

   Sometimes friends have said, "He seems to know you, Sir, though he
   knows nobody else." And certainly there has been a lifting of the
   eyelids and a movement of the hand which made me feel that my voice had
   penetrated into those dark recesses into which the mind had retired.
   But what could I say of deep mysteries, or even of simple faith, when
   the person has been in such a case? It has been a great joy to feel
   that we could sing, in many instances--

   "'Tis done, the great transaction's done," for there was little hope
   that it could have been done at that hour. Dear Friends, if any of you
   are delaying, permit me to warn you not to do so! How can it be said of
   you that you die in faith if it cannot be said of you that you are
   living in faith? Not long ago, a friend of mine, who was apparently in
   robust health, fell dead in the busy streets of the city. Another came
   up to our religious meetings and on his return died in the waiting room
   of the railway station. Suppose that this had happened to any of you.
   It might have done so! Where would you now have been? I bless the name
   of the Lord that you are spared, or else you would have been where no
   voice of warning or of invitation could have reached you, but where
   darkness, death and despair would have enveloped you forever!

   The saints mentioned in the text had not faith to seek. They had it
   when they came to die! They did die, however, although they had faith,
   for faith is not given to us that we should escape death, but that we
   may die in faith! I have met with one or two friends who have believed
   that they would never die, but they have died, for all that. One
   Brother has often favored me with a kind letter of protest when I have
   spoken about Believers dying, for he affirms that he shall never die
   and that if a Believer does die, it is his own fault, for he must have
   fallen into sin. It is rather awkward for his theory that all these
   saints "died in faith." We believe that hundreds, thousands and
   millions of true and strong Believers have died--and we expect to
   follow through the same dark stream of death unless the Lord shall
   come.

   This proves that God will not, in every case, hear our prayers for
   restoration to health. It is not true that if we gather together and
   pray for a sick man he will always be restored. No Believer would die
   if that were the case, for every Christian man would find some friends
   in Christ to pray for his recovery! If, therefore, God had thus
   divested Himself of His Omnipotence and put it upon us, we would keep
   our dear friends here as long as Methuselah and no one would die! It
   would be a kind of semi-murder to allow our Brother or Sister in Christ
   to depart! It would be destroying life, by omission to pray, and that
   would be murder in a degree! I thank God that He has not endowed us
   with any such power, for it would be a very dangerous privilege for any
   of us to carry about us. Would you have it said that you were the means
   of the death of your child, or wife, or friend, because you did not
   pray sufficiently for them? Is a kind of constructive murder to be laid
   at every man's door when he loses a friend? Is every woman whose child
   is taken away from her to be charged with lack of faith because her
   child died? This would make her guilty of her child's death. It is
   atrocious--it is a piece of fanaticism that will not bear thinking of,
   for, pushed to its legitimate issue, it would be cruel in the extreme,
   for it would condemn men and women who are perfectly innocent and who
   feel that they would have spared the lives of the departed by losing
   their own, had such a thing been possible.

   "These all died in faith." Saints die as well as sinners. David dies as
   well as Saul. He that leaned on the bosom of Jesus lived long, but
   died, at last--died as surely as Judas did, though in a better style.
   "It is appointed unto men once to die." Two have entered into Glory by
   another way, but only two! There shall come a day when we that are
   alive and remain shall not see death, but that day is not yet.

   "These all died in faith." I suppose that it means, again, that these
   all persevered to this end. I have often been told that you may be a
   child of God one day and a child of the devil the next. I do not know
   upon what Scripture that statement is based. I do not believe a word of
   it! "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." But suppose he
   apostatizes? You have no business to suppose what God has promised
   shall not be, for He has promised, "I will put my fear in their heart,
   that they shall not depart from Me." If a man truly believes, He shall
   be saved! "The righteous shall hold on his way and he that has clean
   hands shall be stronger and stronger." It has been said that we assert
   that if a man is once a Believer, he may live as he likes, and yet he
   will never be lost. We never asserted any such thing! It is a
   caricature of the doctrine that we preach. We believe that God has
   given to His people eternal life--and that must be true, for He has
   said--"I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish;
   neither shall any pluck them out of My hand."

   This means that they shall be kept from sin and especially shall be
   preserved from the sin which is unto death. Though they sin through
   infirmity, they shall not sin fatally, nor sin finally, but they shall
   persevere in holiness and in the love of God. If they wander, they
   shall be restored. They shall be kept by the power of God, through
   faith, unto salvation. The seed which God puts into the believing soul
   is a "living and incorruptible seed, which lives and abides forever."
   "The water that I shall give him," said Christ to the woman of Samaria,
   "shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life."
   He gives no transient salvation, but He gives one which will hold the
   Believer's soul from the

   first even to the last. "These all died in faith"--in every one of
   these instances Grace lived to the last and triumphed at the close!

   Does it not mean, also, that they never go beyond faith? These good
   people--Abel, Noah, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Sarah--did they ever get
   beyond faith? We have heard of some who think they have done so. Having
   begun in the Spirit, they are afterwards made perfect by the flesh.
   First, it is the sinner's simple trust--but they get beyond that and
   reach "the second blessing." I wish that they would get beyond that,
   also, and reach the third blessing--and then they would feel more
   deeply than ever the deep depravity of the old nature and cling still
   more closely to Christ. To go on from a second to a third, and a
   fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, and an eighth, and a
   ninth, and a tenth blessing is the thing for a child of God to do--but
   to get into a state of pride and cry that he has got a second blessing,
   is a poor way of growing!

   There are 10,000 times 10,000 blessings after which Believers are
   constantly ready to reach, but, reach what they may, "the just shall
   live by faith." He shall never get beyond trusting in the faithful
   promise of a gracious God, living out of himself upon Christ who must
   be our All in All. "These all died in faith," the very best of them.
   They never got beyond that. How could they? Those who get above faith
   are like the man who went up so high on the ladder that he came down on
   the other side! They get to be so good that they trust in themselves
   instead of resting in Him who is the Lord our Righteousness! The Lord
   save us from self-conceit!

   But then, while they did not get beyond faith, the mercy is that they
   never got below it. They still had faith. They were sometimes troubled
   with suspicions of themselves and doubts as to whether the Lord had
   really worked a work in their souls, but they never quite gave up
   faith. They had many pains in death, but they did not die in despair.
   Some of you cry, "What shall I do when I come to die?" I will tell you
   a more important question, and that is, What will you do now? Take life
   and death just as they come, bit by bit. You know how the Spartans
   endeavored to keep back the Persians. They took possession of the pass
   of Thermopylae and there the brave 200 stood and held the way against
   myriads! The enemy could only advance one by one. Now, do not think of
   all the armies of your troubles that are coming in the future, but meet
   them one by one! "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
   Pray--"Give us this day our daily bread."

   When you come to die, you shall have dying Grace in aging moments. And
   if you have lived in faith, do not doubt that you will die in faith!
   Joyfully, with all the strength I have, my quivering lips shall sing,
   instead of doubting or groaning! Faith shall grow stronger when it is
   about to be changed to full fruition. Go on, dear child of God, though
   the road is dark before you, you can see the next step and that is all
   you need to see, for you cannot take two steps at a time! When you
   reach the next step, you will see the next--and so on to the end. He
   that has helped you up till now will help you even to the end! And when
   you are laid in the grave, it shall be said of you, as of all Believers
   that went before you, "these all died in faith." Thus much upon dying
   in faith. ' II. Now, what was THE FAITH THAT THEY DIED WITH?

   Turn to the text and you get it. "Not having received the promises."
   They had received a great deal, but they had not received the fullness
   of the promises. Abraham had not beheld his seed so many as the sands
   upon the seashore. Neither Isaac nor Jacob had ever seen the Shiloh, in
   whom all the nations of the earth are blessed. No, they had not
   received the promises. And you and I have not received all the
   promises. We have received a great deal, but there are certain promises
   which we have not received yet. The coming, the glorious coming, which
   is the brightest hope of the Church, when the Lord "shall descend from
   Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
   trumpet of God"--we have not received that as yet. And Heaven, itself,
   with all its splendor, its white robes and palms of victory we have not
   yet received. We are looking for these. We do not die in the fruition
   of these. We die in faith, expecting that we shall enter upon the
   fulfillment of these promises.

   But, while they did not receive the promises, notice what they did.
   They saw them--saw them afar off. Faith touched their eyes with eye
   salve so that Abraham could see his seed in Egypt--his seed coming out
   of the land of Zoan. He could see the people traveling through the
   wilderness. He could see them entering upon Canaan and taking
   possession of the land. Yes, our Lord said, "Abraham saw My day." He
   saw the Baby in Bethlehem. He saw the Son of God, who was the Son of
   Man, the son of Abraham, too! And you and I, if we have faith of the
   kind we ought to have, already see the coming of the Kingdom, the
   gathering together of the saints, the glory of the better land, "the
   general assembly and Church of the Firstborn, whose names are written
   in Heaven." By faith we see it! Our faith has such a realizing power
   that it is as

   if we beheld it all! It is better to see it thus than with the bodily
   eyes, for if we looked upon it carnally, we would begin to doubt our
   eyes. But faith is the opposite of doubt, the evidence of things not
   seen!

   They did more than that. We read that they "were persuaded of them."
   "What is your persuasion?" asked one of a Christian man. He answered,
   "Well, this is my persuasion--I am persuaded that neither things
   present nor things to come shall ever separate us from the love of God
   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." He was persuaded of the truth of
   that promise--and so is every Believer when he is in a right state. He
   is of that blessed persuasion--he is quite sure about the promises of
   God. "Airy nothings," mutters one. "Mere fictions," cries another.
   "Absolute certainties," says the saint! He has been persuaded by an
   inward persuasion which others know nothing of. The Spirit of the
   living God has given him a faith which amounts to full assurance and he
   will not permit a question, or tolerate a suspicion.

   It is more than that--the saints "embraced" the promises. The Greek
   word signifies, "salutes," as when we see a friend at a distance. In
   the clear atmosphere of Mentone, I have sometimes stood on quite a
   lofty mountain and seen a friend down in the valley and I have spoken
   his name. And, at first, it was greatly to my astonishment when he
   replied, "Where are you?" I held a conversation with him readily. I
   could not have actually reached him for a long time, but I saluted him
   from afar! At times, dear Friends, we can see God's promises afar off
   and we salute them. We are within hail of the Glory land, and we send
   up rockets in the dark, or, if it is daylight, we signal to the shore.
   Do you ever do that? Do you ever salute the mercies that are to come?
   Do you ever talk to the Glory that is to be revealed, yes, and commune
   with the glorified? This is the faith to live with and to die with--the
   faith that sees and is persuaded--and salutes the promised blessings of
   a faithful God! The Lord grant us more of that faith from this time
   forth!

   III. Now, with extreme brevity, I want to speak upon THE FAITH TO LIVE
   WITH--the life of faith. How do we live if we live by faith? The answer
   is, they "confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
   earth." So are we.

   We are strangers by nature. Born from above, our life differs from
   those about us. "The world knows us not." We do not belong to this
   world at all. We are in it, but not of it.

   We are strangers as to citizenship. Here we are aliens and foreigners,
   whose privileges are connected with another city and not with earth.

   We are strangers as to pursuits. We are wayfaring men hurrying through
   this Vanity Fair. The men of the fair cry, "Buy! Buy!" but they have no
   wares that we care to purchase. We buy the Truth of God and they do not
   trade in that commodity. We have nothing to do with the business of the
   fair but to get through it as quickly as we can. There are certain
   things every traveler has to do when he stops in a town--he must seek
   an inn and He must take due refreshment-- but if he is traveling home
   from a far country, he moves along as fast as he can.

   We are pilgrims in objective. We have not come here for a pleasure
   excursion--we are journeying to the Temple to behold the face of our
   Lord. Our faces are set towards Jerusalem and we are asking the way
   there. Our cry is, "Onward! Hinder me not. I must be away to the Glory
   land, where my home is, where my God is!"

   We are pilgrims as to continuance. We do not expect to be here long. Do
   any of you? Ah, then you are under a great mistake! We shall soon be
   gone. Each time we bid each other, "good night," we may do it with the
   suspicion that we shall not all meet again. There never was the same
   congregation here twice and there never will be. Almost every week two
   members of this Church depart for the upland country and leave us in
   these lowlands. Of late our death rate has largely increased and the
   conscription for the armies of Heaven has fallen heavily upon us. How
   quickly are we gone! Say to yourself, then, next time you are fretting
   about worldly trouble, "I will not fret about it. It will not last
   long." Next time you are tempted to rejoice in earthly treasure, say to
   yourself, "No, I shall not rejoice in this. It is only a shadow. I will
   rejoice in something more enduring."

   Do not wonder if you are found to be strangers as to usage, for the
   world uses foreigners roughly and they that are really of Christ must
   expect to be misunderstood and misrepresented. They burned many
   pilgrims in former days. They cannot do it, now, but there are still
   trials of cruel mockings and the seed of the serpent still hates the
   seed of the woman.

   This, then, is the way of Believers--they live in this world as
   strangers and foreigners who are hastening as fast as they can towards
   their own country where they shall hear their own language spoken, and
   shall abide with their own Father forever. This is the life of faith.

   IV. And what is THE FAITH BY WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS
   THIS? Why, it is this faith--"They that say such things declare plainly
   that they seek a country."

   Our faith is one which we dare to declare. We declare plainly that we
   seek a country! We are not ashamed to say that this is not our rest,
   that we do not expect to find pleasure here. We are speeding over this
   stormy sea to the Fair Havens, where we shall cast anchor forever. We
   are not ashamed to say this, however others may ridicule our hope!

   And we say it because we believe it! In that day in which Christ washed
   away our sins, He gave us the token that we should be with Him where He
   is, for this is the mark of the blessed--"They have washed their robes
   and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." That day in which we
   gave ourselves up to Christ, to be His forever, He gave us a
   certificate that we should be with Him in Glory, for this is His
   prayer, "Father, I will that they also whom you have given Me be with
   Me where I am, that they may behold My Glory." I trust, Beloved, no
   doubt ever crosses your mind as to the fact that every Believer in
   Christ will certainly be in Glory with Christ forever and ever. But if
   you so believe, I pray you to believe it strongly, so that you realize
   it--and if you do, you will sometimes sit yourself down and laugh--and
   if a neighbor asks you, "Why do you laugh?" you will say, "I laugh with
   very delirium of delight to think that this poor aching brow shall one
   day wear a crown--that I shall exchange these dusty garments for the
   snow-white robes of perfec-tion--that I, whose voice on earth is so
   poor and cracked, shall one day sing with seraphim and cherubim."

   Oh, what joy to the invalid to know that he shall leave his bed on
   which he has suffered so much and go where the inhabitant shall no more
   say, "I am sick." There the poor man shall no longer fight with poverty
   and earn his daily bread with toil, for the Lamb that is in the midst
   of the Throne of God shall feed them and none shall know a need. How
   glad I am that this shall be in so short a time! Some here present may
   be in Heaven before this year is out--ah, perhaps he who speaks to you,
   now, may have gone very soon away to his own country! Shall it cost us
   any regret? It does for others, for we would gladly remain to do them
   good, but for ourselves, the contemplation is one of unmingled delight!
   The change has no loss about it--it is unspeakable gain! We lose
   nothing by departing to be with Christ, for it is not only better, but,
   as Paul puts it, it is, "far better."

   So now let us refresh ourselves with the thoughts of what we have and
   forget what we have lost. Let us just think of what is laid up for us
   and forget the penury of our estate below. Come, let us revel in the
   prospect of our ultimate perfection and thus gather strength with which
   to struggle with our present corruption. Come, let us now rejoice and
   ring the joy-bells at the prospect of beholding the Well-Beloved's face
   without a mist or a veil between! And so let us be content, awhile, to
   pass through the darkness, even though we see no light. We will meet!
   We will meet! We will meet in Glory!

   A dear Sister, the other day, wanted to have a long talk with me and I
   did not want she should, for I had 20 more waiting, and she said,
   "Well, dear Pastor, I will have a long talk with you when we both get
   to Heaven." And I said, "Ah, that I will, and I will find you if I can,
   or you will find me--and we will converse without hurry." When we begin
   to speak up there, she will say to me, "How sweet is your voice." And I
   shall look at her, and answer, "How beautiful you have become!" We
   shall be amazed at one another in the perfect country." It does not yet
   appear what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we
   shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He is."

   My dear aged friend will forget all her rheumatism and so shall I! You
   may be bent half double while you are here below, but you will be
   straight enough up there! Those dim eyes need glasses, but you will
   need no spectacles before the Throne of God! Limping, lame and halt you
   may be at this hour, but up there you will be able to join with all the
   happy ones in that music and dancing which shall celebrate the triumph
   of Christ! Arise, then, and be glad! Lift up your eyes from the dust
   and the darkness and gaze upon the eternal Light of God!

   The gate of Heaven is open! If we may not enter yet, we shall enter
   before it shuts--let us rest assured of that! The day dawns and until
   its full light has come, let us rejoice in the anticipation of it.
   Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, let us cry, "Turn, O
   our Beloved, and abide with us!" He will not deny us our fond request!
   The Lord bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                             The Horns of the Altar

   A Sermon

   (No. 1826)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [8]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,

   On March 23rd, 1884,

   "And he said, Nay; but I will die here."--1 Kings 2:30

   WE MUST tell you the story. Solomon was to be the king after David, but
   his elder brother, Adonijah, was preferred by Joab, the captain of the
   host, and by Abiathar, the priest; and, therefore, they got together,
   and tried to steal a march upon dying David, and set up Adonijah. They
   utterly failed in this; and when Solomn came to the throne Adonijah was
   afraid for his life, and fled to the horns of the altar at the
   tabernacle for shelter. Solomn permitted him to find sanctuary there,
   and forgave him his offence, and said that if he proved himself a
   worthy man he should live without further molestation. But very soon he
   began plotting again, and sought to undermine Solomon now that their
   venerable father was dead. It became therefore necessary, especially
   according to oriental ideas, for Solomn to strike a heavy blow; and he
   determined to begin with Joab--the bottom of all the mischief, who,
   though he had not followed after Absalom in David's time, was now
   following after Adonijah. No sooner had the king determined upon this,
   than Joab, conscience-stricken, begin to look to himself and fly. Read
   the twenty-eighth verse. "Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had
   turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab
   fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of
   the altar." I suppose that he thought that, as Adonijah had done this
   successfully before, Joab might repeat it, and have some hope for his
   life. Of course. he had no right to enter into the holy place, and lay
   hold on the horns of the altar; but being driven to desperation, he
   knew not what else to do. He was a man of hoary head, who had thirty or
   more years before committed two atrocious murders, and now they came
   home to him. He did not know where to fly except he fled to the horns
   of an altar, which he had very seldom approached before. As far as we
   can judge, he had shown little respect to religion during his lifetime.
   He was a rough man of war, and cared little enough about God, or the
   tabernacle, or the priests, or the altar; but when he was in danger, he
   fled to that which he had avoided, and sought to make a refuge of that
   which he had neglected. He was not the only man that had done the same.
   Perhaps there are some here who before long will be trying to escape
   from impending woe by like means.

   Now, I want you to notice that when Joab fled to the tabernacle of the
   Lord, and took hold of the horns of the altar, it was of no use to him.
   "And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of
   the Lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomn sent Benaiah the
   son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. And Benaiah came to the
   tabernacle of the Lord and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come
   forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the
   king word again, saying, Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me. And
   the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury
   him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed,
   from me, and from the house of my father. And the Lord shall return his
   blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men, more righteous and
   better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not
   knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of
   Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
   Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab. So Benaiah
   the son of Jehoida went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was
   buried in his own house in the wilderness."

   I have two lessons I am anxious to teach at this time. The first is
   derived from the fact that Joab found no benefit of sanctuary even
   though he laid hold of the horns of the altar of God's house, from
   which I gather this lesson--that outward ordinances will avail nothing.
   Before the living God, who is greater and wiser than Solomn, it will be
   of no avail to any man to lay hold upon the horns of the altar. But,
   secondly, there is an altar--a spiritual altar--whereof if a man do but
   lay hold upon the horns, and say, "Nay; but I will die here," he shall
   never die; but he shall be safe against the sword of justice for ever;
   for the Lord has appointed an altar in the person of his own dear Son,
   Jesus Christ, where there shall be shelter for the very vilest of
   sinners if they do but come and lay hold thereon.

   I. To begin, then, first, OUTWARD ORDINANCES AVAIL NOT. The laying hold
   upon the literal horns of an altar, which can be handled, availed not
   Joab. There are many--oh, how many still!--that are hoping to be saved,
   because they lay hold, as they think, upon the horns of the sacraments.
   Men of unhallowed life, nevertheless, come to the sacramental table,
   looking for a blessing. Do they not know that they pollute it? Do they
   not know that they are committing a high sin, and a great misdemeanour
   against God, by coming amongst his people, where they have no right to
   be? And yet they think that by committing this atrocity they are
   securing to themselves safety. How common it is to find in this city,
   when an irreligious man is dying, that someone will say, "Oh, he is all
   right; for a clergyman has been, and given him the sacrament." I often
   marvel how men calling themselves the servants of God can dare thus to
   profane the ordinance of the Lord. Did he ever intend the blessed
   memorial of the Lord's supper to be a kind of superstitious vialicum, a
   something upon which ungodly men may depend in their last hour, as if
   it could put away sin. I do not one half so much blame the poor
   ignorant and superstitious persons who seek after the sacrament in
   their dying hours, as I do the men who ought to know better, but who
   pander to what is as downright a superstition as anything that ever
   came from the church of Rome, or, for the matter of that, from the
   fetish worship of the most deluded African tribe. Do they conceive that
   grace comes to men by bits of bread and drops of wine? These things are
   meant to put us in memory of the Lord Jesus Christ, and, as far as they
   do that, and quicken our thoughts of him, they are useful to us; but
   there is no wizardry or witchcraft linked with these two emblems, so
   they convey as form of grace. If you do rely upon such things, I can
   only say that this error is all of a piece: it is a superstition which
   begins with, "In my baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, a
   child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven"; which
   statement is altogether false; and then it continues the delusion by
   prostituting an ordinance meant for the living child of God, and giving
   it to the ungodly, the ignorant, and the superstitious, as though it
   could make them meet for entering heaven. I charge you, as before the
   Lord, cleanse yourselves of this superstition. There is no salvation
   apart from faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; and you might as well trust
   in your sins as in sacraments. In fact, the sacraments become sins to
   men who trust in them, for those men sin against the ordinances of the
   Lord by putting them where they never ought to be, and making an
   Antichrist of them, so as to push Christ out of his place with their
   baptisms and their masses. If you died with the sacramental bread in
   your mouths, ye will lost unless your faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ
   alone. Your hands, which are superstitiously laid upon the altar's
   horns, might as well be placed upon your weapons of rebellion. Outward
   emblems can do you no good whatsoever if you remain unspiritual.
   Without faith in Christ, even the ordinances of God become things to
   condemn you. If ye eat and drink unworthily ye eat and drink
   condemnation to yourselves, not discerning the Lord's body; and, if
   this be true, how dare any unconverted, unbelieving man put his trust
   in the outward ordinance of which he has no right to partake?

   There are others who put their trust in religious observances of sundry
   kinds. Their visible altar-horn is something which they believe to be
   very proper and right, and which, indeed, may be so if wisely used, for
   the thing is good if used lawfully; but it will be their ruin if it be
   put out of its own place. For instance, there are, doubtless, some who
   think that they are all right because they frequent sermons. They
   delight to be found hearing the gospel. Now, in this you do well, for,
   "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God"; but, if you
   suppose that the mere hearing of a sermon with the outward ear can save
   you, you suppose what is untrue, and you build the house of your hope
   on sand. "Oh, sir, I have sat to hear the true gospel of our Lord Jesus
   Christ these many years." Yes, and these many years you have rejected
   it. The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you, but I fear it will work
   your damnation through your unbelief; for it will be a savour of death
   unto you. I fear that in the last great day it shall be seen that I
   have ministered unto some of you to your hurt. It will not be laid to
   my charge, but to yours, if I have been faithful in the declaration of
   the word. Oh, may God grant that no man or woman among you may ever put
   the slightest faith in the mere hearing of the word! Except ye receive
   it by faith ye deceive your own souls; if ye are hearers only, what
   good can come of it?

   "Oh, but," says another, "I attend prayer meetings." I admit that it is
   not every hypocrite that will regularly come to prayer-meetings, but
   there are some that do; and, though you are so fond of prayer-meetings,
   yet, my dear friend, unless it can be said of you, "Behold he prayeth,"
   you need not make sure of safety. Your being found in the place where
   prayer is wont to be made may be no true sign of grace. "Ay, but I do
   more than that, for I have prayers in my own house." Yes, and very
   proper , too. I would that all did the same; I am grieved that any
   should neglect the ordinance of family prayer. But yet, if you think
   that the reading of a form of prayer in your household, or even the use
   of extempore prayer, is a thing to be relied upon for salvation, you do
   greatly err. "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life", but he
   that believes not in the Lord Jesus Christ does but offer unbelieving
   prayer to God; and what is that but a vain sacrifice which he cannot
   accept? Oh, do not rely upon the habit of outward worship, or you will
   lean on a bulrush!

   "But I regularly read a chapter," says one. I am extremely glad you do,
   and God bless that chapter to you! I would that all were in the habit
   of reading right thought the Bible regularly, and endeavouring to
   understand it; but, if you trust in your Bible-readings as a ground of
   salvation, you are resting upon a mere soap-bubble which will burst
   under your weight. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, producing in the
   soul a change of heart, a new birth unto God, this is what is wanted;
   and, apart from that, all the Bible reading you ever practice can do
   you no good whatsoever. "Ye must be born again. Ye must be born again";
   and if they be not this inward change, then vain is all outward
   observance. You may wash a corpse, you may clothe that corpse in the
   purest white shroud that was ever woven, but when all is done it does
   not live; and what are all the outward devotions of a carnal man but
   dead things which bring no life with them to men dead in sin?

   Some are foolish enough to put their confidence in ministers. It would
   seem to me to be the maddest thing in all the world for anybody to have
   confidence in me as to helping him in his salvation; and I trust that
   nobody is such a fool. I cannot even save myself; what can I do for
   others? Do not come to me with "Give us of your oil," for I have not
   enough for myself, except as I keep on begging a supply. When I look at
   the priests in whom some trust, especially such as I have seen abroad,
   they may be very fine fellows, but I would not trust some of them with
   a half-crown, let alone my soul. The very look of most priests makes me
   wonder how they manage to secure power over people's minds. They may
   know a great deal, but they do not look as if they were overdone with
   wit. I would as soon trust my soul in the hands of a gipsy with a red
   cloak as I would with the best-ordained priest or bishop that ever
   lived. There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
   and he who sets up another is an enemy of souls. There is but one who
   can be trusted with our soul affairs, even the Lord Jesus Christ; and
   woe to us if we put our confidence in men! Ordained or unordained,
   shaven or unshorn, they cannot help us. Yet I know that people do trust
   in ministers most foolishly. I remember years ago being at three
   o'clock in the morning in a house now pulled down, which stood not far
   from the London Bridge railway-station. A gentleman of considerable
   means had spent the Sunday at Brighton, had come home, and had been
   taken with cholera on a sudden, and nothing would do him, when he was
   in the pangs of death, but he must send for me. I went, not knowing
   what was required of me. But when I got there what could I do? There
   was a little consciousness left to the man, and I spoke to him of
   Jesus. I asked if he had a Bible. The people of the house searched high
   and low, but there was no such thing to be found. The mind was soon too
   beclouded for further comprehension, and as I came away I asked, "Has
   he ever gone to a place of worship?" No, never--never cared for such a
   thing; but as soon as he was ill, then, "Oh, send for Mr. Spurgeon!" He
   must come, and nobody else: and there I stood, and what could I do?
   There died in the City of London, not long ago, a tradesman of much
   wealth; and when he came to die, though I had never seen the man in my
   life before, he importunately asked for me. I could not go. My brother
   went to see him, and, after setting before him the way of salvation, he
   enquired, "What made you wish to see my brother?" "Well," he said, "you
   know whenever I have a doctor I always like to get the best; and when I
   employ a lawyer I like a man who is high in the profession. Money is no
   object. I want the best possible help." Ah me! I shuddered at being so
   regarded. The best help he could get! That best is nothing--less than
   nothing, and vanity. What can we do for you, dear hearts, if you will
   not have our Saviour? We can stand and weep over you, and break our
   hearts to think that you reject him; but what can we do? Oh, if we
   could let you into heaven, if we could renew your hearts, how joyfully
   would we perform the miracle; but we claim no such power, no such
   influence! Go you to Christ, and lay hold upon the true altar-horn; but
   do not be so foolish as to put confidence in us or in any other
   ministers.

   "Ah, well," says one, "I am free of that. I am a professor of religion,
   and have been a member of a church now these twenty years." You may be
   a member of a church fifty years, but you will be damned at last unless
   you are a member of Christ. It matters not though you are a
   church-officer, a deacon, an elder, a pastor, a bishop, or even
   Archbishop of Canterbury, or an apostle, you will perish as surely as
   Judas, who betrayed his Master with a kiss, unless your heart is right
   with God. I pray you, put no confidence in your profession. Unless you
   have Christ in your heart, a profession is but a painted pageantry for
   a soul to go to hell in. As a corpse is drawn to the grave by horses
   adorned with nodding plumes, so may you find in an outward profession a
   pompous way of being lost. God save us from that!

   "No," says one, " but I do not trust in mere profession. I have great
   reliance upon orthodoxy. I will have sound doctrine." That is right,
   friend, I would have all men value the truth. "My confidence is in my
   sound doctrine." That is not mine, friend, and I hope that it will not
   be yours long, for many lost souls have firmly believed orthodox
   doctrine. In fact, I question whether any one is more orthodox than the
   devil, for the devils believe and tremble. Satan is no skeptic; he has
   too much knowledge for that. Devils believe and tremble, and yet they
   are devils still. Put no confidence in the mere fact that you hold to
   an orthodox faith, for a dead orthodoxy soon corrupts. You must have
   faith in Christ, or else this altar-horn of a correct creed, on which
   you lay your hand, will bring you no salvation.

   I will not enlarge upon this topic. Whatever you depend upon apart from
   the blood and righteousness of Christ, away with it! Away with it! If
   you are even depending upon your own repentance, and your faith, away
   with them! If you are looking to your own prayers or alms, I can only
   cry again,--Away with them! Nothing but the blood of Jesus; nothing but
   the atoning sacrifice; but, if you come and lay your hand upon that,
   blessed shall you be.

   II. That assurance is the second part of our discourse, on which I will
   speak briefly. COMING TO THE SPIRITUAL ALTAR, AND LAYING OUR HAND UPON
   IT, WILL SAVE US.

   Now, notice first, the act itself. Joab came within the tabernacle. So,
   poor soul, come and hide yourself in Christ. Joab took hold of the
   horns, the projecting corners of the altar, and he would not let go.
   Come, trembling sinners, and take hold on Christ Jesus.

   "My faith doth lay her hand

   On that dear head of thine;

   While like a penitent I stand,

   And there confess my sin."

   Lean with your hand of faith upon your Lord, and say, "This Christ is
   mine. I accept it as the gift of God to me, unworthy though I be."

   When that is done, a fierce demand may be made upon you. The enemy will
   probably cry, "Come forth! Come forth!" The self-righteous will say,
   "What right has a sinner as you to trust Christ? Come forth!" Mind you
   say to them, "Nay, but I will die here." Your sins and your guilty
   conscience will cry to you, "Come forth! Come forth! You must not lay
   hold of Christ. See what you have been, and what you are, and what you
   are likely to be." Answer to these voices, "Nay, but I will die here. I
   will never give up my hold of Christ." Satan will come, and he will
   howl out, "Come forth! What right have you with the Lord Jesus Christ?
   You cannot think that he came to save such a lost one as you are." Do
   not listen to him. As often as he howls at you, only say to yourself,
   "Nay, but I will die here." I pray God that every sinner here may be
   brought to this desperate resolve, "If I perish, I will perish trusting
   in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. If I must die, I will
   die here." For certain, we shall die anywhere else. If we trust in any
   but Jesus, we must perish. "Other foundation can no man lay than that
   is laid." "Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin." "He
   that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
   not,"--whatever else he trusts to,--"is condemned already, because he
   hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God." Make,
   then, this desperate resolve--

   If I must die, here will I die,

   Here at the cross I bide;

   To whom or whither should I fly?

   Where else can I confide?

   Say to all those who call you away, "Nay, but I will die here"; for
   nobody ever did perish trusting in Jesus. There has not been through
   all these centuries a single instance of a soul being cast away that
   came all guilty and hell-deserving, and took Christ to be its
   salvation. If you perish, you will then be the first that perished with
   his hand laid upon Christ. His love and power can never fail a sinner's
   confidence. Wherefore, may God the Holy Spirit lead you to resolve, "If
   I must die, I will die here." Listen to me, soul, whoever thou mayest
   be out of the crowd, man or women, whatever thy life may have been,
   even though it should have been that of a harlot or a thief, a drunkard
   or a profligate, if thou wilt now believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   thou shalt be saved; for, if not, then God himself will have missed his
   greatest design. What did he give Jesus for but to save sinners? What
   did he lay sin upon Jesus for, but that he might take it off the
   sinner, and let him go free, and be pardoned? If, then, Christ fails,
   God's grandest expedient has broken down. That method by which the Lord
   resolved to show what his almighty grace can do has proved to be a
   failure if a believing sinner is not saved. Dost thou think that such a
   thing can ever be? It is blasphemy to think that Jehovah can be
   defeated. He that believes in Christ shall be saved; nay, he is saved.

   If thou art not saved believing in Christ, then Christ himself is
   dishonoured. Oh, let them once know, down in the dark abode of fallen
   spirits, that a man has trusted in Christ and yet has not been saved, I
   tell you that they will make such exultation over Christ as Philistia
   made over Samson when his eyes were put out. They would feel that they
   had defeated the Prince of Glory. They would trample on his blood, and
   ridicule his claim to be the Saviour of men. If any soul can truly say
   hereafter, "I went to Christ, and he refused me," then Christ does not
   speak the truth when he says, "Him that cometh to me I will in nowise
   cast out." Then he has changed his nature, foregone his word, and
   foresworn himself. But that also can never be. Wherefore, dear heart,
   cling to Jesus, and say still, "If I die, I will die here."

   Moreover, if thou canst perish trusting in Christ thou wilt discourage
   all the saints of God; for if Christ can break his promise to one, then
   why not to another? If one promise fails, why not all the promises? If
   the blood has lost its power, how can any of us ever hope to enter
   heaven? I say it will breed great discouragement in the hearts of all
   people if this be true; for what a wet blanket would e throne over all
   thy fellow-sinners! If they are coming to Christ, they will start back,
   and say, "What is the good of it? Here is one that came to Jesus, and
   he did not save him. He trusted in the precious blood, and yet his sin
   was laid to his charge." If one fails, why not the rest? I must give up
   preaching the gospel when once I hear of a man trusting Jesus and not
   being saved; for I should be afraid to speak with boldness, as I now
   do.

   If one poor soul that puts his trust in Christ should be cast away it
   would spoil heaven itself. What security is there for glorified spirits
   that their splendours shall endure except the promise of a faithful,
   covenant-keeping God? If, then, looking down from their celestial
   seats, they behold the great Father breaking his promise, and the Son
   of God unable to save those for whom he died, then will they say, "We
   will lay our harps aside, and put our palms away, for we, too, after
   all, may perish." See, then, O man, heaven and earth, ay, God and his
   Christ, as to their credit and their glory, do stand and fall with the
   salvation of every believing sinner. If I were in your stead tonight, I
   think that I should bless God to have this matter put so plainly to me.
   I know that years ago, when I was under a sense of sin, if I had heard
   even such a poor sermon as this I should have jumped for joy at it, and
   would have ventured upon Christ at once. Come, poor soul; come at once.
   You have heard the gospel long enough; now obey it. You have heard
   about Christ long enough; now trust in him. You have been invited and
   entreated, and pleaded with; now yield to his grace. Yield to joy and
   peace by trusting in him who will give you both of these as soon as you
   have rested in him.

   Look! sinner, look! A look out of thyself will save thee. Look away
   from all thy works, and prayers, and tears, and feelings, and
   church-goings, and chapel-goings, and sacraments, and ministers. Look
   alone to Jesus. Look at once to him who on the bloody tree made
   expiation, and who bids thee look, and thou shalt live.

   God make this present hour to be the period of thy new birth. I pray
   it, and so do his people. The Lord hearken to our intercessions, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

   LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON

   DEAR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN,--As I am expected to report myself weekly,
   and have only this corner left to do it in, the bulletin shall be
   brief. Weather unsettled; progress fair, but not rapid. I find myself
   too readily depressed with small matters, and I have a sense of
   unfitness for my future work. This shows that while rest has done much,
   there is more to be done. Three weeks have worked such marvels that I
   hope in due time to return in full vigor.

   My heart is with the Special Services at the Tabernacle; for which I
   beg every reader to pray daily.

   C. H. Spurgeon

   Mentone, February 21st, 1885.

Exceeding Gladness

   (No. 1827)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 8, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON DECEMBER 21, 1884.

   "For You have made Him most blessed forever: You have made Him
   exceedingly glad with Your countenance." Psalm 21:6.

   You have heard a great many sermons upon the Man of Sorrows. I am sure
   that you have not heard too many and if, from this time to the end of
   your life, you should, every Lord's Day, hear of Him and of His
   sufferings, you will not be nauseated with that theme. You will still
   feel an intense pleasure in hearing the story of your Lord's griefs and
   in having fellowship with Him in His sufferings, for by His agonies and
   death He has redeemed you unto Himself. Probably you have never
   listened to a discourse upon, "The Man of Joys!" I venture, thus, to
   name the Christ of God. We do not often enough meditate upon the
   happiness of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Remember that it was for the joy that was set before Him that He
   endured the Cross, despising the shame, and the expectation ofjoy is
   joy.

   The light of His coming reward shone on our Lord's daily path and made
   it bright with a glorious hope. Sin is the mother of sorrow and Jesus
   knew no sin. Conscience never made Him a coward; remorse never pricked
   His heart; malice, envy and discontent never gnawed at His soul. He was
   the Prince of Peace even when He was despised and rejected of men. Deep
   as were His griefs, we may reckon Jesus of Nazareth among the happiest
   of men. There was nothing of that efflorescence, that effervescence,
   that froth of joy which carnal men value so highly--but there was a
   deep peace, a calm content which is beyond all price. Jesus did not
   enter into such mirth as might have befitted Herod's palace, or Dives'
   gilded saloons, or Caesar's luxurious banquets. But He knew such joy as
   the Son of God must know when His Father always hears Him and as the
   Savior of men must know when His every word and act are blessing a
   fallen race!

   He felt a supreme delight in doing the will of the Father and in
   carrying out the purpose of His own gracious mind. He was filled with a
   mighty resolve so strong that it beat off every force which would have
   turned His mind aside from His chosen path. And He felt an infinite
   love which found intense satisfaction in yielding up everything for its
   objects. There was, in fact, even in the midst of the sorrows which
   were necessary to His service, a satisfaction in bearing those sorrows,
   a delight in passing through those depths of agony which were necessary
   for the accomplishment of His grand design!

   A man cannot be full of such benevolence as that which filled the heart
   of Christ and yet be utterly miserable. Unselfishness necessarily
   brings with it a measure of joy. A man could not open blind eyes,
   unstop deaf ears, make lame men leap, heal lepers, raise the dead and
   yet remain comfortless! As well suppose that the sun, which scatters so
   much heat, may be, itself, a huge globe of ice! The fountain which
   yields such streams of blessing has its own flash and sparkle--we feel
   sure of it. As pearls may lie in plenty in caverns, over which there
   rolls a dread tempestuous sea, so there slept in the heart of Jesus,
   treasures of joy, even when the ocean of His holy Soul was lashed with
   hurricanes of woe. There is a joy in doing good which cannot be
   separated from the doing of the good--and the Savior possessed it
   beyond conception. There is a joy in living entirely out of one's self
   for the good of others--and this Jesus drank to the fullest! There is a
   joy in achieving a great purpose, even when it is only by sorrow that
   our design is worked out--and that, also, our Redeemer knew. In Him was
   perfectly explained that enigma of Paul, "As sorrowful, yet always
   rejoicing."

   I am not going to say more of the joy of our Lord on earth. And only
   for a few moments shall I enlarge upon the exceeding gladness of the
   God-Man, Christ Jesus, at this present moment in Heaven, though it is
   to this that our text pri-

   marily refers. Jesus has gone up into Glory and the eyes of faith can
   see Him at the right hand of the Father, forever exalted as Head of the
   Church, and Head over all things for her sake. In that position our
   Lord is filled with superlative felicity. His death is rewarded by the
   Father with an endless life of bliss--"He asked life of You, and You
   gave it Him, even length of days forever and ever. His glory is great
   in Your salvation: honor and majesty have You laid upon Him. For You
   have made Him most blessed forever: You have made Him exceedingly glad
   with Your countenance."

   I need not enter into the joy of Christ as God, for this is inseparable
   from His Godhead, but I speak of Him, now, as Mediator, in His complex
   Person, standing between God and man. In that capacity, as risen from
   the dead and gone into Glory, He is supremely glad--glad because His
   work is finished. Such a work as His had so taken up His whole heart
   and engrossed His whole being, that it became a baptism to be baptized
   with--and He was straitened until it was accomplished. It is
   accomplished, now, and the straitening is ended. He has not another act
   to do by way of obedience to the Law. He has not another pang to bear
   by way of fulfillment of penalty due for our guilt. "It is finished,"
   is the finis of His God-like labor! There is not another drop of blood
   to be shed! No more chastisement of our peace is to be laid on Him! No
   more stripes are to be exacted for our healing--

   "No more the bloody spear.

   The Cross and nails no more,

   For Hell itself shakes at His name,

   And all the heavens adore." "Consummatum est" is written at the foot of
   His Throne. His work is so finished that all the results of it are
   sure-- those for whom He died are safe--that which He purchased by His
   blood He has obtained. He has left nothing undone in any point so that
   a degree of failure may yet occur. He has left no stone of the wall to
   tumble from its place. His work is so completely done that, as He looks
   upon it all, He feels unmingled joy and content. The Father looks upon
   Him with such a perfect satisfaction in His glorious work, that our
   text is fulfilled beyond the letter. "You have made Him exceedingly
   glad with Your countenance."--

   "A life eternal as Your years

   A glory infinite like Thine

   Repays Him for His groans and tears,

   And fills His soul with joy Divine." Nor is this all, for Jesus Christ
   our Lord rejoices to think that now, from this day forth, God has made
   Him to be the fountain of priceless, numberless, endless blessings to
   men. Observe the first clause of our text and remember that it may be
   read thus--"You have made Him blessings forever." That is to say, God
   has now opened, in His Son Jesus Christ, a well of blessings which will
   never cease to flow as long as there are men to drink. He is no curse
   to men, but only blessing! He is not one blessing only, but all
   blessings! These blessings are the chief gifts that even God can give
   and they are in Christ Jesus to all eternity! The Lord Jesus, who was
   once the center of grief, has now become the source of love, favor,
   help, healing, benediction, delight, Heaven and whatever else may be
   called blessing--

   "Immortal joys come streaming down,

   Joys, like His griefs, immense, unknown." No, blessings do not only
   come from Him, but He is blessings! He is, Himself, made or constituted
   blessings to all eternity. O blessed Lord, we pause to adore and bless
   You even now! This makes our Lord exceedingly glad, to think that He
   is, in His own proper Person, the very center of all blessing to His
   people. Fullness of blessing abides in Him. There is no blessing that
   you need, poor Sinner, but what Jesus has it, has it for you! "It
   pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell." No blessing
   that you need, dear child of God, shall be denied you, for, "of His
   fullness have all we received, and Grace for Grace." That fullness
   abides where it is--it has never diminished and it never will be
   diminished throughout eternity!--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till
   all the ransomed Church of God Is saved to sin no more."

   Whenever God makes any one of you to be the channel of blessing to
   other people, are you not happy? Yes, certainly, in your measure. But
   what must be the superlative gladness of the Christ in being the Center
   of centers, the Fountain of

   fountains to all those who draw near to Him? God has made Him, beyond
   all others and inclusive of all others, to be blessings forevermore!
   Must He not be filled with gladness?

   Our Lord has joy beyond this. I want you to think much of His gladness
   that you may be able to obey Him, now, should He say to you, "Enter you
   into the joy of your Lord." At this very hour may His joy be in you
   that your joy may be full. Jesus sympathizes with you in your
   sorrows--will you not sympathize with Him in His joys? Should we not
   rejoice with them that rejoice and especially with Him, the Bridegroom
   of our souls? This is a further part of His gladness--He joys in the
   conversion, the comfort, the justification, the salvation of every soul
   that comes to Him. "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God
   over one sinner that repents." Almost everybody who preaches from that
   text is content with the undoubted Truth of God that the angels rejoice
   over sinners that repent. No doubt they do so--but the text does not
   tell us so. It says, "There is joy in the presence of the angels of
   God"--that is to say, they are present where there is joy--they look
   upon the face of Christ and see the joy which fills His heart as His
   redeemed ones are renewed by Grace!

   Angels behold the delight that fills the Father, the Son and the Holy
   Spirit as sinners turn from the error of their ways. If, at this
   moment, a sinner, conscious of his sin, is flying to the Cross for
   refuge, he is making Christ happy! If he is now bowing the knee and
   crying, "God be merciful to me, a sinner," that cry of his is music to
   the soul of his loving Savior! When that repenting sinner casts himself
   upon the great Atonement and rests in the Sacrifice of Jesus, the heart
   of Jesus receives a part of its infinite reward and the promise is, in
   a measure, fulfilled, "He shall see of the travail of His soul and
   shall be satisfied." You know the meaning of the suggestive figure
   couched in those words--the soul of Christ was in pangs, like a woman
   in travail, for these souls--and they are born to eternal life as the
   result of His soul's labor. And then, as the mother sees the child, and
   remembers no more her sorrow for joy that a man is born into the world,
   so does the Savior see each one of His beloved ones born to Himself and
   feels a joy so great that He is more than recompensed for having died
   on the cruel tree!

   Oh, the joy of Christ over a soul that turns to Him! O my Hearer, think
   of it! Consider! Is it really so? You are capable of making the heart
   of Christ to throb with unspeakable joy even now! My beloved Hearer,
   you have lived in sin and I fear you will die in it. Nobody thinks much
   of you and you feel the neglect. You are even now sighing, "No man
   cares for my soul." But Jesus cares for you! And if you come to Him,
   you shall fill His loving heart with gladness! Your forgiveness,
   renewal and salvation will cause Him to rejoice in spirit. What do you
   say? If the Christ in Glory values you, I beseech you, do not trifle
   with yourself, or lie down in despair!

   Moreover, I believe that Jesus in Glory finds great joy in all the
   deeds of His saved people. Whenever He sees one of His believing people
   counting His reproach to be greater riches than all the treasures of
   Egypt, our Lord is glad. When He sees a heart that has been washed in
   His blood, true to Him, refusing to believe false doctrine, or to do
   that which is unjust, then is Christ glad over His disciple! When He
   sees you plotting and planning how you can honor Him; when He marks
   your self-denials; when He sees you prayerful, earnest, active,
   spiritual, loving--His gladness is great! I tell you all the love you
   have for Him, He delights in! And your childlike confidence in Him and
   your little struggling light which seeks after more light--and your
   earnest longings for His coming and His Kingdom, and those broken words
   of yours by which you speak to others of His love--all these things He
   sees with exquisite pleasure! These are flowers that would not have
   grown in your garden if He had not sown them there. If there is
   anything that is honest, true, holy, heavenly and Christ-like, it is
   all His work--and He is right glad to see it! I know you will think
   that He sees in us much to grieve Him and I grant you that He does, but
   He knows our frame and He remembers that we are dust. But when He sees
   anything that His own Spirit has worked in us, He beholds it with
   intense complacency and deigns to take a continual pleasure therein.

   Moreover--and I speak gently and softly here--I believe that our Master
   derives a Divine satisfaction from the holy sufferings of His people
   when they bear pain with patience--when they praise His name on their
   beds and adore Him in the fires and, when coming to die--they bear
   themselves calmly in the last dread article, behaving themselves as men
   who know no fear. When they walk through the very jaws of death,
   fearing no evil, simply confiding in the eternal Christ-- then is Jesus
   glad to see how well they have learned the lesson which He taught them!
   When they come up on the other side of Jordan, like sheep from the
   washing--when they appear before His Throne, "without spot, or wrinkle,
   or any such thing"--when the shining ones draw near before Him and cast
   their crowns at His dear feet. When they lift their

   united hallelujahs unto Him that loved them and washed them from their
   sins in His precious blood--then is the King exceedingly glad!

   My tongue cannot possibly tell you of the joy of our Lord in His
   people's joy. It is from Christ that Heaven's gladness comes and it is
   into Christ that hearers' gladness flows. He gives the redeemed all
   their bliss and He receives from them all that bliss as they lovingly
   ascribe their salvation to Him alone. He, at this moment, is Heaven's
   center, the happiest of the happy, the blessed Leader of a blessed
   company, the triumphant Captain of a triumphant band who, having gone
   forth conquering and to conquer, have, at last, finished the fight,
   sheathed the sword and shared their Master's victory! They cry unto
   Jehovah, "You have made Him exceedingly glad with Your countenance" and
   they, themselves, partake of that gladness!

   All this is my preface at this time and I need not apologize for the
   length of it, since its theme might fitly have been that of the whole
   discourse. The sermon shall be somewhat short and I trust it will be
   sweet. This is the subject of it--I desire that the Lord's people may
   enter into this joy of Christ and that, as each one of them is made a
   king, the text may be fulfilled in each one of them. I have not
   described to you the gladness of our Lord as it ought to be described,
   but I can do no better. If you will endeavor to share in it, you will
   make up for my deficiencies. May the Holy Spirit aid you!

   I. First, I would remark that GLADNESS IS THE PECULIAR PRIVILEGE OF
   SAINTS. "Happy are you, O Israel!" "Rejoice in the Lord, you
   righteous." Why should we not be glad? It is all right between us and
   God. If, having rebelled against Him, we had never repented and had
   never been reconciled, we ought to be miserable. He that is out of
   order with God may well be out of order with himself. But we have been
   brought near--we have been adopted into the family of God--we have
   obtained reconciliation through the precious blood and have enjoyed the
   forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His Grace! Ought we not
   to be glad?

   Dear Heart, there is no quarrel between you and God! Peace has been
   made through Jesus Christ. The peace of God, which passes all
   understanding, keeps your heart and mind through Christ Jesus. If you
   have not a right to be happy, who has? In a well-ordered government,
   those that are friendly with their prince have a right to rejoice in
   his courts. And in the government of God, it seems but right and
   natural that those who are made to be at peace with God should be among
   the happiest of Heaven's courtiers. It is meet that we should make
   merry and be glad! Let us take advantage of that right and may the
   Spirit of Joy make us glad at this good hour!

   In addition to the fact that they are right with God, Believers have
   their present solaces in many ways. Grace endows them with immediate
   joys. I like that part of our song which we sang just now--

   "The hill of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets Before we reach the
   heavenly fields, Or walk the golden streets."

   If I were to try and tell all the things that make Christians glad,
   even here below, I should have to make an endless catalog! Where should
   I begin? Once beginning, where should I leave off? You can count your
   sorrows, dear Brothers and Sisters, I dare say. You are quite au fait
   at adding them all up, but I would have you to recapitulate your joys
   with equal readiness! Why not? Review the shining ranks of your
   mercies. Are they not new every morning? Is not the faithfulness of God
   exceedingly great? Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, God has done so much
   for us that we are glad! He has surprised us with the greatness of His
   goodness!

   If I had been sure, 35 years ago, that I would have possessed, in the
   Covenant of Grace, such a portion as I have at this hour, I think I
   would have leaped out of my body for joy! When I was under a sense of
   sin, if I had been assured that I should yet be forgiven, I do not know
   that I could have contained myself for delight! When I was lying under
   the chastening hand of God on account of my transgressions, if I had
   known that He would turn His face upon me and smile upon me, and make
   me His child, and put me into the ministry and permit me the great
   privilege of telling of the wonders of His Grace, I verily believe that
   it would have been too great a weight of joy--it would have crushed me
   with too much delight!

   And yet, at this moment, I am not half as glad as I should be warranted
   in being because of the unspeakable mercy of God to me. Just apply that
   reflection to your own cases. Is there not about you, now, that which
   would have made your mouth water if you had known 20 years ago that you
   would be what you are now? Yes, 50 or 60 years ago, perhaps, if it
   could have been revealed to you that you would live to be a man verging
   upon 80, still rejoicing in God, you would have

   said, "No, not I. I shall fall a prey to the enemy long before that. I
   shall go back and prove to be a hypocrite long before that." You would
   not have credited that the Lord would ever have done so much for you as
   He has actually done! Come, do not rob your God of His praises! Defraud
   not your King of His revenue of Glory!

   Do not get to fretting and stewing about nothing at all, but rejoice in
   the Lord always, and then rejoice again! This is an appointed feast;
   let us keep it. "The Lord has done great things for us, whereof we are
   glad." I heard a Brother in a Prayer Meeting say, "The Lord has done
   great things for us, whereof we desire to be glad" and I wanted to jump
   down that man's throat and pull that passage back, again, and put it
   into its natural shape! What business had the Brother to change the
   Bible and talk such wretched stuff? " Whereof we desire to be glad"?
   Why, if the Lord has done great things for us, we are glad, we cannot
   help it! And, blessed be His name, we do not wish to do so!

   In addition to that, we have a brilliant future before us. We are the
   heirs of great expectations. The children of God not only possess
   present mercies, like the leaves and flowers of summer, but things
   which God has prepared for them that love Him, laid by in store like
   the fruits of autumn! Come, think of Heaven for a moment or two and
   anticipate its Glory. Put on your crown for a little while and wear
   your white garments! Can you not take a palm branch in your hand in
   imagination, and sing the new song in your heart? You know that you
   will be thus arrayed and thus occupied within a short time--then go
   through your part, rehearsing it by a lively hope! The glorious hour
   will soon arrive when you shall be near and like your God and reign
   with Him forever!

   At this present moment there is a place in Heaven for me that nobody
   can ever fill but myself--and Jesus has gone before, not only to
   prepare it, but to prepare it for me. There is a crown that no head but
   mine can ever wear and a song that no tongue but mine can ever sing!
   And I shall soon cast my crown at Jesus' feet and chant before Him my
   hallelujahs! That is true of every Believer here. Be glad! Yes, rejoice
   before the Lord with all your might! Brothers and Sisters, you have not
   much here, but you will have everything hereafter! You have but a
   little farther to journey through the great and terrible wilderness and
   you will be in Canaan and possess the land that flows with milk and
   honey! Be glad!

   The children of God have further cause to be glad because they have all
   blessings secured to them, so that they shall never lose them. That
   which their God has promised them shall never be taken from them. They
   are in a position of indisputable security, for they are hidden in the
   wounds of Christ, as in the clefts of the Rock of Ages. They shall
   never die, for they are members of His body who is immortal. They are
   in that hand from which none can ever snatch them. "I give unto My
   sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish: neither shall any
   pluck them out of My hand." Let us begin to be merry, as it is said in
   the parable of the prodigal son. "They began to be merry." I have read
   that parable ever so many times and I have looked to see whether it is
   written that they ever left off being merry--and I cannot find that
   they did. "They began to be merry." Very well, let us begin to be merry
   at this hour, dear Friends, and let us never leave off as long as we
   live! Let us rejoice forevermore. As long as we have a God to rejoice
   in, let us rejoice! As long as we have a Heaven to go to, let us
   rejoice! As long as we have an eternal Covenant ordered in all things
   and sure, let us rejoice! As long as we have any being, let us rejoice
   in the Lord!

   II. Secondly, let me remark that THE SAINTS' GLADNESS IS OF A PECULIAR
   SORT.

   The gladness which is peculiar to the children of God is a gladness
   that God has worked in them. "You have made Him exceedingly glad." Oh,
   yes, I heard him! He seemed very glad, but when he began to explain to
   me his gladness, I could tell by his hiccough where he got it--he owed
   it to the deadly cup. Shame on him! Oh, yes, he was exceedingly glad,
   but when I saw his merriment, I could tell that it was his youth and
   his good health that gave him his gladness! These will soon vanish
   away. But the child of God owes his gladness to a deeper source--God
   has made him glad! He that can touch the secret springs of the heart,
   apart from circumstances or conditions, has often made a man glad when
   he has been racked with pain, or when he has been in the depths of
   poverty, or when he has been suffering at the demoniacal hands of
   inquisitors.

   Saints drink from a spring which neither dries in summer nor freezes in
   winter, for that which is of God's making remains. "Your joy no man
   takes from You." If God has made you glad, then the devil cannot make
   you sad. If God has made you glad, then it is not the weather and it is
   not your property, and it is not your health, and it is not your
   friend, neither is it your foe that can make you unhappy. If it is
   written, "You have made him glad," then the man is glad, indeed.
   Beloved, I wish that every one of you had that joy which only God can
   give you, that better part which, once obtained, none can take away. It
   comes from God and from God, alone, and when He bestows it, it is yours
   forever, for His

   gifts are without repentance--He never takes back that which He has
   once granted! This is the joy which is worth having, for it is full,
   deep, lasting, everlasting. They say that philosophers can be merry
   without music and certainly Christians can joy in God without outward
   comforts--and they can even take joyfully the spoiling of their goods.
   They are happy people, to whom even losses are gains and burdens are
   helps!

   Notice, next, in the text, that the gladness which God gives to His
   people is no ordinary gladness, but an exceeding joy. "You have made
   him exceedingly glad"--exceeding--exceeding hope, exceeding measure,
   exceeding the gladness of others, exceeding any delight that can come
   from any other source. "You have made him exceedingly glad." One man
   has become wealthy and he is glad. But the child of God, if the Lord
   has smiled upon him, is exceedingly glad. Here is one that feels his
   blood leaping in his veins with health and he is merry as the birds in
   summer time because of it. When the Lord turns, again, the captivity of
   His people, and smiles upon them, they are exceedingly glad. I wish
   that I could tell you how our eyes sometimes dash and sparkle, how our
   whole spirit dances within us for excessive joy when a sense of Divine
   Love is poured into our souls!

   I cannot communicate by any description what it is, but, Brothers and
   Sisters, you can surely guess, for you, perhaps, have felt the
   same--and if you have, you would not change with Caesar for his empire,
   nor with an archangel for his starry throne! No, when God lifts up the
   light of His Countenance upon His people, it is a far more exceeding
   and an eternal weight of Glory which He lays upon them! Then do they
   sing, "Joy, joy, joy!" I speak of what I know and testify what I have
   felt. May you know it! May you feel it now! I know that worldlings
   imagine that we Christians are a miserable crew and I fear that too
   often we turn our worst side foremost when we are with them. I am told
   that many shopkeepers are so poor that they put the most of their goods
   in the shop window, but this is a method which few Christians
   follow--for the opposite is the fact--their window is badly set out and
   yet they have a costly stock upon their shelves.

   The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
   children of Light in this as well as other things. I would recommend
   such Believers to dress their window a little and show some of their
   better things. Put your ashes into the back yard and pour out the oil
   of joy in the parlor. Let people see that, after all, there are great
   advantages in belonging to the Lord's household! But whether we seem to
   be happy or not, I can speak as one who has not been without abundant
   affliction and trial--we who believe in Jesus are a happy people, an
   enviable people. "Happy are you, O Israel," said Moses, and we can bear
   witness that he spoke the truth. I would change with no man. So long as
   I know whom I have believed, I would prefer my own lot to that of any I
   have ever seen or heard of. I leave that point, but you can be sure of
   this--God-given joy is no common treasure!

   But, according to the text, this joy comes to us in one way. "You have
   made Him exceedingly glad with Your countenance." Have you not,
   sometimes, been made very glad with the look of a friend's face? I
   believe that there is more heart-cheer in the sight of some
   countenances than in sun, moon and stars. Oh, the joy that I had, a
   little while ago, in looking upon one dear face that I shall not see
   again for many a day, for it must necessarily be seen on the other side
   of the globe! What joy I have had in looking upon some of you when you
   have come to tell me what the Lord has done for you and I have seen
   your joy in the Lord! "Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the
   countenance of his friend." Certain friends of ours carry with them
   countenances which are always a half-day's holiday to me whenever I
   look on them!

   I do not say that this is true of all of you, for I know some Knights
   of the Rueful Countenance, whose faces are long and dismal, and I would
   urge these to look into the face of Jesus till His brightness
   illuminates them! There are those among us who are so brimming over
   with sacred joy that a glance at their faces refreshes our hearts! Now,
   catch my thought--What must the countenance of God be? The countenance
   of a friend to a friend, of a bridegroom to his bride, of a wife to her
   husband, of a father to his child--each of these spreads gladness--but
   what is the countenance of God to His elect? It is a countenance that
   seems to say, "I am reconciled! Your sin is put away."

   Oh, the gladness of seeing that face! It is a face that seems to say,
   "I am watching you; I am caring for you; I am smiling upon you." Is not
   this a gladdening look? Lord, You have made me glad with Your
   countenance. "How precious, also, are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How
   great is the sum of them! Carefully and continually You think upon me
   and watch over me, to do me good." Thus to see the observing
   countenance of God is a great delight to His people.

   What shall I say of His approving countenance? When God has looked upon
   you and seemed to say, "you are doing right. Men blame you, but I
   accept you. Dear child of Mine--you are doing My will. You are
   following Me in reproach

   and I will abundantly reward you"--this makes a man exceedingly glad
   and nerves him to bear reproach and misunderstanding, however cruelly
   they may assail him.

   Again, when you come before God in prayer and you are pleading with
   Him. And your faith discerns that glorious face--the face of
   Jesus--your heart cries, "I am accepted! God is hearing my prayer. I
   may ask what I will and it shall be done unto me. I am not praying like
   a stranger; I am pleading like a child. I have my Father's ear and
   heart and His countenance is toward me." Oh, then it is a glad time
   with you! You are being heard and answered--and your heart beats to
   music. When the Lord looks on His chosen follower and says, "I have
   loved you with an everlasting love. I love you inexpressibly; I love
   you without measure--I love you as I love My Only-Begotten--and I will
   love you when time shall be no more. I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you"--then, again, our heart is glad and our glory rejoices! We
   should not be afraid for our flesh to rest in hope, for at such a time
   we could either live or die without a question, so fully is our heart
   filled with God.

   Then does our face shine like that of Moses when he came down from the
   mountain. Out of Heaven there is no gladness that is worthy to be
   compared with the bliss of knowing that the Lord has set His love upon
   us! This is the fullness of the vintage and all beside is as the
   gleaning of the grapes when the summer is ended. I have not time, you
   see, to open up this grand subject, fully, but such is the joy of God's
   people. It comes from a clear sense of the Divine approbation. We must
   walk with God and be heartily agreed with Him, or we shall not possess
   this happiness. Whenever the child of God feels, "I was wrong; God is
   grieved with me," then he goes slinking off to bed like a child that
   cannot have a goodnight kiss--and there is no gladness for him. But
   when, on the contrary, the Lord turns to him in love and mercy and
   says, "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions and,
   as a cloud, your sins: return unto Me, for I have redeemed you." And
   when He smiles upon us in Christ Jesus, then we can say with the
   Psalmist, "You have made me exceedingly glad with Your countenance."

   I will not detain you many minutes more, except to say that this joy of
   the Believer comes to him through many channels. Heaven has many
   windows and out of each one of them the Lord pours out benedictions
   upon His chosen. Let me read a part of the Psalm. "The king shall joy
   in Your strength, O Lord." Oh, it is a great thing, when you are weak,
   to be strong in God, for then you will be happy! Divine strength brings
   Divine gladness with it. "And in Your salvation how greatly shall he
   rejoice!" God's salvation, the election that brings us into it, the
   redemption that makes us full possessors of its blessings, the
   effectual calling which leads us to accept it, the eternal love which
   holds us fast in it--why, in all these, how greatly we rejoice!

   Next, answers to prayer make us rejoice. "You have given him his
   heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips." When a
   man comes from the Mercy Seat, like Luther, saying, "I have conquered!
   I have won my suit with God," what gladness has the Lord given him!
   "For You prevent him with the blessings of Your goodness." God is
   beforehand with us--He outruns us in love. Here is another source of
   joy--when God gives us mercies before we seek them--when He lays them
   in our road and there they are, ready for us before we come to the
   spot! When David was made a king, I am sure he said, "I never thought,
   nor sought, nor worked to be a king." Many of us have received choice
   blessings of which we said, when we obtained them--"Why this to me? I
   never dreamed of this. This was not in my plan. I never proposed this
   to my soul in her hours of largest desire. You prevent me with the
   blessings of Your goodness." Brothers and Sisters, such things as these
   tend to make God's people glad in their hearts.

   This is my last word to you--be glad in the Lord. I do not ask you to
   simulate happiness--to pretend to be glad when you are not. I do not
   ask you to sing when your heart feels that it must sigh. But I do ask
   you to be glad when there is reason to be! Be true and real in all your
   expressions, but let that truth and that expression spring from an
   educated soul that has been in the school of Christ and has learned
   what the facts of the case really are! Let your feelings be according
   to truth and your condition of heart according to the eternal
   settlements of Immutable Love. What are the facts of the case? Here
   they are--"O Lord, I will praise You: though You were angry with me!
   Your anger is turned away and You comforted me." If I do not praise
   You, the timber out of the wall must cry out against me. If I do not
   rejoice in You, I shall be a traitor to my own consciousness and false
   to my own convictions, for You have brought my soul up out of the
   horrible pit and out of the miry clay--and You have set my feet upon a
   rock, and established my goings--and I must have a new song in my
   mouth, even praise forevermore!

   I would, if I could, stir you all up to a burst of holy joy, a blaze of
   sacred gladness! Put on your silver sandals and your bridal ornaments.
   Take off your weeds and gird yourselves in white raiment. Doff the
   sackcloth and ashes--and put on your beautiful array. Cast aside your
   chains! Leave them for those to wear who love them and walk at large,
   in liberty, bedecked with the jewels of infinite Grace, and crowned
   with the diadem of loving kindness! Sing unto the Lord a new song and
   end it not till you get to Heaven--and then it will never end. "I will
   sing unto the Lord as long as I live. I will sing praises unto my God
   while I have any being."--

   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Savior Jesus Christ Who has
   blessed us with such blessings, all uncounted and unpriced! Let our
   high and holy calling, and our strong salvation be Theme of
   never-ending praises, God of Sovereign Grace, to Thee!"

   Hallelujah! Amen.

How "The Unspeakable" is Spoken of

   (No. 1828)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 15, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON OCTOBER 9, 1884.

   "And men shall speak of the might of Your terrible acts: and I will
   declare Your greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of Your
   great goodness, and shall sing of Your righteousness." Psalm 145:6, 7.

   In this Psalm David has reached the Beulah land of his songs where we
   hear nothing else but praise. He begins, "I will extol You, my God, O
   King; and I will bless Your name forever and ever. Every day will I
   bless You; and I will praise Your name forever and ever." And he closes
   with, "My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh
   bless His holy name forever and ever." Happy is our condition when the
   glory of God fills both heart and tongue! Oh, to swim in a sea of
   gratitude, to feel waves of praise breaking over one's joyful head--and
   then to dive into the ocean of adoration and lose one's self in the
   ever-blessed God!

   The royal singer strikes a high note as he repeats the stanza, "Great
   is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and His greatness is
   unsearchable." We never reach the height of that great argument until
   we confess that it is far above us and altogether unsearchable. We have
   not apprehended God if we imagine that we have comprehended Him.

   Next David found comfort in the thought that he was not the only
   worshipper of the Lord and that the praise of God would not cease when
   he fell asleep in death. He foresees an endless line of praiseful
   hearts and utters this sure prophecy, "One generation shall praise Your
   works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts." But, as if he
   would not and could not leave the blessed task to others, but must
   continue his own joyful hallelujahs, he cries, "I will speak of the
   glorious honor of Your majesty, and of Your wondrous works." Whatever
   happens, we must, each one, extol the Lord! Whether the world grows
   atheistic or devout, our duty and our joy are one and the same--we are
   still to magnify the Lord our God. We do not wish to avoid this
   profound pleasure; no, rather we would abound in it more and more!

   All this leads up to a consideration of the various ways in which men
   speak of the Lord and His acts when their minds are moved in that
   direction. All see not the same points of His greatness, neither do
   they see with the same eyes, nor speak in the same spirit. It is ours,
   at this time, to review the various orders of mankind, and to observe
   how the revelation of God to them affects their minds and moves their
   tongues. There is an ascending scale in the four sentences of our text,
   as the poet-Prophet observes and records the ascending forms of human
   thought and speech.

   I. We begin at the lowest step of the ladder. "Men shall speak of the
   might of Your terrible acts." We mingle with the multitude during a
   great occasion of national calamity, or upon the receipt of thrilling
   news from a foreign land--and we hear THE AWE-STRUCK TALK of the
   throng. We join a sobered and thoughtful company--they have come
   together under a common fear and they speak, one to another, of the
   terrible acts of God because they impress them at the moment. They are
   of the Athenian kind, desiring continually to say and hear some new
   thing, and now they have found a novel subject which has the piquant
   devour of terror. God has been doing terrible things and they cannot
   help speaking of them--they have overlooked His mercies, but they must
   notice His judgments, as it is written, "Lord, when Your hand is lifted
   up, they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed." Not only
   shall they see, but they shall speak, too--"Men shall speak of the
   might of Your terrible acts."

   There have been times in human history when this text has been
   fulfilled with tremendous emphasis. The first men who lived after the
   flood must have been affected with the solemn memory of the universal
   deluge. They must have often spoken to one another concerning God's
   terrible acts, when He drew up the sluices of the great deep and burst
   open the

   reservoirs of Heaven to drown a guilty world. They that dwelt over
   against the five cities of the plain, once so prosperous and rich,
   withal so luxurious and vicious--they, I say, that dwelt in the
   neighboring cities must have said, one to another, "Have you heard what
   has happened--how God has rained fire out of Heaven upon those wicked
   cities?" Men, after all these ages, can scarcely go that way and mark
   how desolation rules over the Dead Sea, without speaking in bated
   breath to one another, and saying, "Here vengeance triumphed."

   Egypt was full of this talk, once, when the plagues followed each other
   like terrible claps of thunder. One peal had not ceased before another
   blast astounded them! The noise thereof went beyond Egypt and, in many
   a palace, monarchs heard how Jehovah had gotten unto Himself honor upon
   Pharaoh. It was as Moses sang, "Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed;
   the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the
   inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon
   them; by the greatness of Your arm they shall be as still as a stone;
   till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which
   you have purchased."

   So was it, also, when the sword of Joshua was taken from its scabbard
   in the name of the Most High, and Jehovah began to deal out execution
   against the nations that had gone into uncleanness and given themselves
   over to abominable lusts. When Israel went from city to city, as the
   appointed executioner of the Most High, then men everywhere spoke, one
   to another, of the might of Jehovah's terrible acts, "until their
   hearts melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore."

   These are but early instances in the gray old past, but they are
   typical of like judgments which are scattered throughout history. The
   terrible acts of the Lord are few, but no age is quite left without
   them, for the Lord still lives and He is always the same. He punishes
   nations in this present life. Seeing that there will be no resurrection
   for nations as nations, and no Judgment Day for nations as nations,
   they are judged in time and their sins are followed up by national
   judgments. Have you not heard of the might of His terrible acts that
   happened to Babylon? Know you not that He made Nineveh to be such a
   heap of ruins that for many a century it was altogether hidden away
   from mortal sight?

   Have you not heard what God did to the colossal empire of Rome, when it
   had filled up the measure of its iniquity? Do you not remember how He
   broke it in pieces as with a rod of iron? No Englishman should ever
   forget, in modern times, how the Armada of Spain was given as chaff to
   the wind and that cruel, persecuting power was degraded from her
   pre-eminence. Men have spoken, again and again, to one another as they
   have hidden away from the scourge of war, or as they have stood weeping
   at the graves of their beloved ones slain by the pestilence which walks
   in darkness. And they have said, "Behold the might of Jehovah's
   terrible acts!" Men will speak of that side of the Lord's dealings if
   they are dumb concerning His innumerable benefits.

   When God's judgments are abroad in the world, the inhabitants shall
   learn righteousness. And this is a consolation in times of disaster and
   death. None of us would dare to desire these judgments-- we are of
   another spirit from Elijah, who, in holy jealousy for Jehovah, His God,
   could pray that there should be no rain by the space of three years
   except according to his word. But yet, the thought must have crossed
   the mind of many a faithful follower of God that atheistic nations
   ought to feel the rod to startle them into thoughts of God and
   oppressing peoples ought, themselves, to taste the bitter cup of
   tyranny. "By terrible things in righteousness will You answer us, O
   God." "Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto
   Him?" Will He not smite the beast and the false prophet and put down
   falsehood and wickedness? It shall be so in due time!

   The least that we can do, whenever these terrible acts are abroad, is
   to turn them into special prayer and cry mightily to God that men may
   speak of the might of His terrible acts and may learn to, "kiss the
   Son, lest He be angry, and they perish from the way, when His wrath is
   kindled but a little." It behooves us, when we see the black clouds
   overhead, to pray that they may break in mercy upon the nations and
   that God, Himself, may appear in infinite love, though He should make
   the clouds His chariot and ride upon the wings of the wind.

   "Men shall speak of the might of Your terrible acts." These things
   leave a mark and make, for a while, a manifest impression. Such,
   however, is the heart of man that oftentimes the impression is as when
   one lashes the water and no scar remains, for it is natural to fallen
   man to forget God! Sinners pray in a storm and curse, again, in the
   calm. When the pestilence is abroad, they tremble and adore--but they
   become atheists when the graves are all filled--and things return to
   their usual course. When God sends forth pestilence, (and He has of
   late scourged cities that are scarcely a day's ride from us), let us
   pray that the scourge may not fall upon our own land. Yet I do
   remember, when first I came to this city, how many days and nights I
   stood at the bedside of men and women dying of cholera. And though it
   was a grievous thing

   and this neighborhood felt the scourge very heavily, yet I noticed that
   infidelity was singularly quiet and that persons who never entered a
   place of worship, before, began to attend our services.

   Bibles were routed out of the dust in those times and religious talk
   was tolerated. The minister, who was formerly the subject of their
   caricatures and jokes, was viewed with reverence, for the time being,
   and his visits were sought for in the hour of sickness. It is amazing
   how men laugh on the other side of their mouths when God begins to deal
   with them--how those who scoffed the loudest are the first to wince
   when the lash falls on them! The boldest blasphemers are the first to
   cry out when the Lord binds them with His cords. They cannot bear the
   touch of God's finger and yet they have often dared to challenge His
   hand to be laid upon them! O Lord, men shall speak of the might of Your
   terrible acts when they are driven in utter dismay to bow their ungodly
   heads and acknowledge that the Lord reigns!

   Dear Friends, whenever you find sickness in a house, or death in a
   darkened chamber, seize the opportunity to speak for your Lord. Your
   voice for the Truth of God will likely be heard, for God Himself is
   speaking, and men must hear Him whether they will or not! Meanwhile,
   plead earnestly that the hammer of God may only break hard hearts and
   that the fire of God may consume nothing but that which is evil. Pray
   that the Holy Spirit may work with the chastisement to produce health
   and healing to the souls of men.

   II. Be ready with the second part of our subject, which is this--THE
   BOLD DISCOURSE. Observe how the one follows the other--"Men shall speak
   of the might of Your terrible acts: and I will declare Your greatness."
   After the many have spoken in awe, I will deliver my soul with courage.
   Come in, O single testifier for God, for now you will be welcomed! When
   they have advanced so far as to tremble at God because He has begun to
   smite them, you step forward and declare His greatness! The might of
   His terrible acts has made them see the greatness of His power--they
   perceive what plagues are in His quiver and how easily He can draw them
   forth like arrows, shoot them from His bow--and never miss the mark!
   They are obliged to confess all this and thus a good groundwork is
   prepared for something more.

   Tell them of the greatness of His justice and how He will by no means
   spare the guilty. Tell them of the greatness of His Grace and how, in
   the Person of Jesus Christ, He passes by iniquity, transgression and
   sin. Tell them of the greatness of His fatherly love and how He presses
   returning prodigals to His bosom and kisses away their tears. Tell them
   of the greatness of His saving power to lift up men from the dunghill
   and set them among princes, even the princes of His people! Speak
   exceedingly brave concerning the greatness of His sovereignty, how He
   can create or can destroy. Tell them that, "He will have mercy on whom
   He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whom He will have
   compassion." Point to the greatness and splendor of His love--how He
   receives sinners, how He gives Grace to the graceless and how His Son,
   in due time, died for the ungodly.

   I heard it said of a certain preacher by one who was no ill judge,
   though a simple countryman, "I have heard many preachers, but I never
   heard one that seemed to make God so great as that man does." I would
   like to have such praise, or at least, to deserve it, for I think it
   should be the main objective of the preacher to make God great in men's
   esteem. Today, my Brothers and Sisters, the most approved preaching
   makes much of man. Philanthropy, which is good enough in its place, has
   supplanted loyalty to Jehovah! The Second Table of the Law of God is
   put before the First and, in that position, it genders idolatry--the
   worship of man--which is only a form of self-adoration. All divinity is
   now to be shaped according to man and from man's point of view. And men
   are to think out their theology and not take it from God's mouth, or
   from the Book inspired by the Spirit of God.

   Men are such wonderful beings in this 19th Century that we are called
   upon to tone down the Gospel to "the spirit of the age"--that is, to
   the fashions and the follies of human thought, as they vary from day to
   day! This, by God's help, we will never do--no, not by one diluting
   drop, nor by the splitting of a hair! What have I to do with suiting
   the 19th Century any more than the 9th Century? We have to do with the
   Immutable God and with the fixed Truths which He has revealed to us!
   Having taken our foothold upon the Rock, we shall not stir from it, by
   God's help, while there is breath in our body. Yet so it is--man has
   made man his god and Jehovah is dethroned in his thoughts. I believe in
   God, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob--if there is another
   god, newly come up, let those worship him who will--my resolve is to
   always magnify the stern God of the Old Testament, the loving God of
   the New Testament!

   Time may yet come when men will hear the old Gospel once more, but
   whether they do or not, I will declare Jehovah's greatness! There are
   many shifts and changes, but if we stand still and bide our time, the
   current which runs this way, today, will set in an opposite direction
   tomorrow! And if it should not do so, what is that to us? We are not
   ac-

   countable for popular opinion, but only for our own loyalty to the
   Truth of God! He who is faithful to his God and declares His greatness
   in this evil time, shall be accepted as a faithful servant in the day
   of the last account. Of course he will be stigmatized, today, as,
   "behind the times," and be little esteemed by those who deem themselves
   cultured and advanced, but of this he may make small account.

   Thus I have taken you over two of the sentences. I have shown you an
   awe-struck people talking together of God's terrible acts and then the
   child of God coming in with his personal testimony, saying, "I will
   declare Your greatness."

   III. In the third sentence you see a company of godly people together
   and in their talk you mark THE GRATEFUL OUTPOURING of thankful spirits.
   "They shall abundantly utter the memory of Your great goodness."

   The Hebrew word has something to do with bubbling up--it means they
   shall overflow, they shall gush with the memory of Your great
   goodness--and in handling this sentence I should like to dwell only
   upon that metaphor. A Christian man in reference to the goodness of God
   to him should resemble a springing well. There should always be fresh
   matter from him upon that blessed subject--"the memory of Your great
   goodness." Did you ever tell the story of your life to the fullest to
   anybody? Did you ever write it? I am sometimes not a little amused,
   certainly not surprised, when I get, as I did this week, a letter upon
   foolscap [large sheet of paper measuring 13 by 6 inches]--both sides,
   24 pages--all filled up with the story of a man I never saw, who lives
   far away in the backwoods. Nothing will do but he must tell somebody or
   other what God has done for him and he has selected me to be the
   receiver of the narrative!

   He has only followed the example of many others. I regret that so many
   of these autobiographies come to me, for such good things ought to be a
   little more evenly distributed. I have scarcely the time to get through
   that length of writing and, having so many other epistles, it is
   possible that I am not as grateful for this one as I ought to be. But
   it is a good theme of which we cannot weary. I would encourage all
   Believers to abundantly utter what they remember of the Lord's
   love--and if they cannot tell it viva voce, they must write it. You
   need not send me the manuscript--but do not let it be lost. Tell your
   friends the happy tale of Jesus and His love!--

   "Oh, bless the Lord, my Soul, Nor let His mercies lie Forgotten in
   unthankfulness, And without praises die."

   I like the instinct (and I think it is always an instinct of a child of
   God) that makes a man feel, "I must tell what the Lord has done for
   me."

   They shall abundantly utter, they shall gush, they shall overflow with
   the memory of Your great goodness. Now, if somebody could give you all
   his time to listen to you about what God has done for you, could you
   not keep on forever? I was about to blunder and say I could keep on
   forever, and then begin again! I feel like David, when he said that he
   would praise God's name forever and then said, "and ever," as if he
   could spend two "forevers" in God's praise. We can never exhaust it. We
   may tell it forever and yet it shall remain untold. It is so fresh, so
   new, that no fountain can excel it.

   See, too, how freely a true testimony of holy experience is given out
   by grateful Believers. It is refreshing to yourself to proclaim it.
   Fountains never grudge their streams--they sparkle and they flash,
   their crystal diamonds glitter in the sunlight--they are things of
   beauty and joys forever. Even so it is a holy recreation to let our
   gratitude well up and overflow to the praise of God. Is it not a
   refreshment to those who come within the sound of it? Oftentimes you
   might relieve a Brother's woe if you told him how God relieved you.
   There may be sitting in your own pew some person with a very heavy
   heart whom you could readily relieve if your tongue were not
   frost-bitten. Oh, that out of the midst of your soul would flow rivers
   of living water! Child of God, you may be carrying in your bosom that
   key of Doubting Castle which will open every door and will not only let
   you out of it, but your companion in tribulation, too, so that the two
   of you shall come forth and fairly escape from the giant by the use of
   the key!

   They shall abundantly utter, they shall overflow with the memory of
   Your great goodness, O Lord! Does not this imply a measure of
   continuance? Let us now praise the Lord. Use your memory at this hour.
   Go over your life story. You have not kept a diary. I suppose not, I
   almost hope not, for such daily records are apt to grow stilted. People
   feel that they must put something down every day and, perhaps, they
   write the most when they have least to say. But, at any rate, in your
   memory you ought to retain the recollection of the Lord's deeds of love
   and Grace to you--and you should utter them as they come fresh to your
   memory at this moment.

   Such utterances would help us in reference to the former sentences of
   the text. When men are speaking of the terrible acts of God with bated
   breath, then you come in and say, "But He is good! These acts of
   judgment are few and far between. It is not often that we have a
   thunderstorm. What soft, bright mornings; what clear days; what dewy
   evenings we have and only now and then a tempest!" Tell them of God's
   great goodness. And when, at other times you have declared His
   greatness, it will be wise to change the strain and soften down the
   terror of His grandeur by speaking of the majesty of His love. I do not
   think you should abundantly utter His terrible acts--you need not
   abundantly utter His greatness, but you may dwell with peculiar
   emphasis, freeness and fullness upon His goodness--His goodness to you!
   This third rung of our ladder is a golden one and I am loath to leave
   it, for it is my joy to utter the memory of the Lord's great goodness
   to me.

   IV. And now, you see, all the while it has been talk, but now, in the
   fourth part, we rise a stage higher, for we come to singing. Listen to
   THE SELECT SONG. "They shall abundantly utter the memory of Your great
   goodness, and shall sing of Your righteousness."

   When good men talk of God, they soon find that the tongue leaps with
   liberty, for the strings that held it are broken. Then they cannot be
   satisfied with talking to men--they must rise to something better and
   talk with God in holy song. "They shall sing." Singing is the language
   of joy, the special vehicle of praise, the chosen speech of Heaven!
   Singing is language married to music, words winged with melody. Verily
   the Lord's redeemed may well have much of it, for it every way becomes
   their state and their prospects. "O come, let us sing unto the Lord."

   But is not this a very singular text? Do you not wonder at the subject
   of their song? "They shall sing of Your righteousness." You remember in
   the 51st Psalm, David says, "My tongue shall sing aloud of Your
   righteousness"? That is a strange theme. Why didn't he say, "They shall
   sing of the memory of Your great goodness"? Certainly that is a choice
   topic for song, but yet the more select, the higher subject for music,
   is the righteousness of God. Is it not a singular choice? Probably a
   large part of my audience will not understand how it can be regarded as
   a joyful subject. The righteousness of God is a theme of terror to
   many--they wish He were not righteous! He will by no means spare the
   guilty, but will hold His plummet to every bowing wall and tottering
   fence. And His hail shall sweep away all the refuges of lies! And
   because of this, men dread the Lord and turn away from Him! And yet,
   you see, there are hearts that can sing of His righteousness and who,
   having other themes, having God's terrible acts, having God's
   greatness, having God's goodness to sing of, yet prefer this for their
   song--"They shall sing of Your righteousness."

   What is there to sing about in this?

   Before I answer that question, I want you to notice how this subject of
   God's righteousness is put and how it is connected. Let me read you the
   sentence before it and the sentence afterwards, and you will see how
   this singing of His righteousness is, so to speak, sandwiched in
   between two other themes. Look, now--"They shall abundantly utter the
   memory of Your great goodness, and shall sing of Your righteousness.
   The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger and of
   great mercy." Here are two cakes of honey and my text is put between
   them. Here is a blessed supper for you at this hour if you do but know
   how to feed upon it! Between the two testimonies of goodness and of
   Grace comes in this of righteousness--and I greatly delight in the
   thought that the great subject of song, here, is a righteousness which
   is encompassed about with goodness--a righteousness which does not
   hinder compassion!

   This righteousness is surrounded by mercy and, therefore, the mercy is
   not unrighteous, but is strictly just. Oh, Friends, the very glory of
   the Gospel is that righteousness and peace have kissed each other in
   it--that the sword of justice is not snapped across the knee of mercy,
   but it is sheathed in the scabbard of the Atonement, there to abide in
   its majestic rest, never to be brought out again to smite a soul for
   whom Christ has died! Oh, the joy of getting hold of a righteousness
   perfectly consistent with the goodness and Grace of God!

   What is there concerning this righteousness that we are able to sing
   about? Just let me enlarge upon it for a minute or two. I count it a
   very great joy to every Christian that God is essentially righteous.
   What an awful thing it would be to have an unrighteous God! If the
   heathen who worshipped Jupiter, for instance, had sat down and
   deliberately studied the character of Jupiter, as taught to them by
   their own priests, they would have felt it a degrading thing to be
   under the rule of such a detestable being as Jove was said to be. A
   licentious god--fancy that! An unrighteous god who could do what he
   pleased and pleased to do iniquity! What a horror!

   God in His infinite sovereignty is to be admired because it is not
   possible for Him, in the exercise of His sovereignty, to do anything
   that is unrighteous! No creature of His shall ever have just cause to
   blame the deeds of the Most High. He does as He wills and He gives no
   account of what He does, for He has absolute dominion and none can call
   Him to his bar--but His will is holiness, justice and
   righteousness--and His Being is love. I delight to think that I serve a
   righteous God. An unrighteous God? That were to remove the foundations
   upon which all things must rest, for, after all, the Character of God
   must be the basis of our confidence. If He were not righteous, what
   reliance could we place upon Him? His promises of Grace might be
   broken; His Covenant might be a fiction; the Atonement, itself, might
   turn out to be a sham and save nobody--unless the contract involved in
   it had been made by a righteous God.

   He is righteous! Let us be sure of it and sing about it--righteous in
   all that He reveals. There is no Revelation of God in the Bible, or
   anywhere else, that is unrighteous. A man says, "This is revealed to
   me, but it is not consistent with the perfect righteousness of God." We
   know that he sees not the Light of God at all and knows not what he
   says! There is nothing revealed by God concerning Himself and His
   dealings with men but what is perfectly righteous "The Word of the Lord
   is pure."

   Again, there is nothing commanded by Him but what is perfectly
   righteous. He has not commanded sin--He has not in, all those Ten
   Commandments put down a single precept which is contrary to integrity.
   Everything that He bids us do is safe to do, for it is right and just.
   If He is a holy Master, so is His service perfect holiness.

   Neither is God unrighteous in His decrees. We cannot climb to Heaven
   and turn over those folded leaves, where everything that is, and has
   been and is yet to be, will be found written by His prescient pen--but
   there is nothing in those decrees which savors of injustice. We may be
   sure of that. Nothing could come forth from the heavenly court but that
   which is perfectly right and just. And this makes us sing--we feel
   right glad that everything can be trusted with our Lord and King. He
   shall judge the world in righteousness and the people with His Truth.
   Let Him do what He wills and ordain what He pleases--our spirit bows
   before Him and cries, "It is the Lord, let Him do what seems good to
   Him," for "the Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His
   works," and blessed be His name forever!

   It is the same with God's doings. The Lord has never performed an
   unrighteous act. I want you people of God, especially, to feel this, so
   that if you have lost anyone very dear to you, you may hold your peace,
   like Aaron, even if you cannot go further and bless the Lord in the
   midst of your trials. Nothing harsh or unduly severe has come from the
   Divine hand. He has not dealt with you according to your desert, for if
   He had done so, you would be, now, where His mercy is gone forever!
   Beloved, let us feel that this is a settled point, concerning which no
   question can be raised. Let us have no quarrels with God! I would not
   merely say that He is righteous to you, His dear people, but more, that
   He is invariably tender and kind. That surgeon's knife of His does but
   remove a cancer. That bitter medicine does but heal you of a disease
   that otherwise would be your death. Therefore, accept all that comes
   from God and kiss the hand that smites and honor the lips which
   upbraid.

   And here is matter to sing about. The Lord is righteous in all His
   judgments. You may not need this fact at the present, but you may
   require it in some darker hour when you lie under a false charge and
   your defense is not believed. You have been doing your best in your
   situation, but you are accused of dishonesty and you cannot clear
   yourself. Perhaps the circumstantial evidence is against you, though
   you are as innocent of the deed as the Angels of Light. If you have
   faith enough, you may now sing of the righteousness of God. Some of us
   have sung of it when everybody has misrepresented us and we have been
   sustained thereby. It little matters what men say, for they are not our
   judges. To our own Master we stand or fall! The Lord is righteous and
   we can afford to leave our case in His hands--He will defend the right
   and rectify the wrong. If we have acted with single-eyed honesty and
   uprightness, we may appeal to His court and calmly abide in His
   decision. He will execute judgment for the oppressed and, therefore,
   the children of God sing concerning His righteousness.

   But the loudest song and the sweetest is concerning the righteousness
   of God in Christ Jesus. He would not, even to save His own elect, do an
   unjust thing! Even that His mercy might be glorified, He would not
   stain His justice. Forth came His Son, His other Self, to take upon
   Himself the nature of man, that man's guilt might be imputed to Him and
   that He might bear the penalty upon the Cross. The Cross is, at once,
   the loudest proclamation of Divine righteousness and the most plain
   proof of Divine love! The Lord is able to save to the uttermost, but He
   is not able to retract His declaration, "The soul that sins, it shall
   die." He must punish, even though He must pardon. It is necessary that
   the authority

   of Law should be sustained and, therefore, the Lord will not withdraw
   from the execution of justice upon the ungodly though it is His strange
   work and He desires it not. On His Son He has executed justice for all
   those who are in Him. The Man, Christ Jesus, was the federal Head of
   His own chosen and He has borne their grief and carried their sorrows.
   He has finished their transgression and made an end of their sin--and
   brought in for them an everlasting righteousness.

   And now, at this time, I want you to sing of the Divine righteousness,
   because the righteousness of Christ is yours. If you are Believers, you
   can joyfully wrap yourselves up in the righteousness of God, Himself!
   "This is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our
   Righteousness." See Jeremiah 33:16. Notice the feminine--it is not,
   "wherewith He shall be called," but, "wherewith she shall be called."
   The wife takes the husband's name--the Church is named after Christ,
   her Bridegroom. It is a wonderful sentence to be in God's Book--that
   His Church shall bear His name and Jesus Christ, the Eternal God, shall
   become the righteousness of poor sinners like ourselves! He is made of
   God unto us, righteousness at this hour. "Being justified by faith, we
   have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Let us sing in our
   hearts concerning that glorious wedding dress which adorns us, at this
   very moment, and shall adorn us in the day when we enter into the joy
   of our Lord!

   "They shall sing of His righteousness." If you do not sing about the
   righteousness which God imputes to you, when will you sing?--

   "Jesus, Your blood and righteousness My beauty are, my glorious dress;
   Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed, With joy shall I lift up my
   head."

   But I must close, and I want, therefore, to say to you, dear Friends,
   that I conceive this singing of God's righteousness to be the choicest
   evidence of real conversion, reconciliation to God and of likeness so
   God. If we were more sanctified, we should be less tempted to quibble
   at the righteousness of God. Here is a man who takes down his Bible and
   he reads, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment." "Can't
   stand it," he says. It is because you do not fully know the mind of
   God, or else, terrible as it is, you would say, "It must be right if
   God determines it." Instead of that, the man assumes to judge God and
   dares to weigh the Word of God in his scales and say, "This does not
   suit my inner consciousness and, therefore, it is wrong." Is our inner
   consciousness infallible? Is Revelation a nose of wax to be shaped by
   our inner whimsies? When a man once alters the Word of God a little,
   within a year he alters it again!

   I have noticed brethren who have began their wanderings from orthodoxy
   with the life-in-Christ theory and who have now reached the restitution
   of all things, devils included! Why preachers who believe this last
   theory keep on preaching, I do not know, for there is no practical
   reason why they should! If what they say is untrue, they had better
   hold their tongues. And if what they say is true, their occupation is
   gone, for clearly, it is only a matter of time and everybody will come
   right! Let people swear and live as they like--what difference can it
   make if, in a short time, they will all be restored? As well be wicked
   as righteous, since, in the long run, one shall be as the other!

   I see how it is. God's Word is nothing--these new notions are
   everything. The modern men blot out what they like and tear out what
   they please from the Book. Or they lay the Book aside altogether--for
   they, themselves, make their own bible and every man is his own
   inspiration and will, before long, proclaim himself to be his own god.
   But when the soul is brought to know God, it does not question His Word
   or His doings any longer. It sits down before a great mystery and
   cries, "I do not understand this! I cannot measure it. Oh, the depths!
   But what God says I believe. What God does I accept."

   Brothers and Sisters, let me not deceive you by pandering to the idle
   prattle of the times. Men dream and then assert that their visions are
   the Truth of God. If there is anything of conjecture and of "larger
   hope," so be it. I may conjecture and I may imagine--but for me to
   preach my conjectures and my imaginations as doctrines would be
   damnable! It is an atrocious disloyalty to the majesty of Revelation to
   add to it the maunderings of our poor fallible judgments! The better
   thing is always to feel as a little child at his father's knee when we
   are reading the Scriptures--and to ask to be taught of the Spirit.
   Whatever the Truth of God may be, I shall never quarrel with God!
   However terrible His acts, if I am unable to rejoice in the Light of
   His face, yet in the shadow of His wings will I rejoice!

   When He seems to spread that great wing and hide the sun, I will go and
   nestle beneath Him and cry, "It is the Lord, and it must be right."
   Paul was known to silence those who had objections to offer concerning
   the ways of the Lord--he did not argue, but he simply said--"No but, O
   man, who are you that replies against God?" "Bad argument," modern

   thinkers dare to say. Yet it is the best that such people deserve and
   the best that Inspiration deigns to offer them. The cricket on the
   hearth is not to be debated with when it questions the sun for shining,
   or the thunders for having a voice louder than its own.

   My Brethren, say, each one of you, unto the Lord, "I will sing of Your
   righteousness." It is an awful Truth of God! It is a Truth that makes
   me tremble as I utter it; but I read in the Revelation, concerning
   those that are tormented day and night, that it is, "in the presence of
   the holy angels, and in the Presence of the Lamb." Whatever that
   torment may be, it must be right. Nothing in the presence of the angels
   of God can be contrary to their joy over repenting sinners-- nothing in
   the Presence of the Lamb can be contrary to His ineffable love! The
   Lord shall judge the world by that same Jesus who came into the world
   that the world, by Him, might be saved. Love will inflict the sentence
   of justice. Nothing with regard to the future of the impenitent can
   come from God but that which will be supremely righteous. It is not for
   us to explain to others, or even to understand for ourselves, all that
   the Lord does or is. But it is our duty, as His subjects, our pleasure
   as His children, to bow before Him and adore!

   Oh, eternal God, I do not understand You! If I could comprehend You,
   You were not God, or I not man! The parts of Your ways which You have
   revealed stagger and almost slay me, but, as I fall at Your feet as
   dead, my heart cries, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." For
   the Lord is good and righteous are all His ways. Hallelujah, though the
   world should perish! Hallelujah, though my soul should die with fear!
   The Lord shall forever be extolled. My Hearer, when you speak thus from
   your heart, you are a converted man! There is no mistake about it--you
   are reconciled to God, indeed, when you thus honor Him!

   Alas, many are only reconciled to the half of God, or to the 10th part
   of God! Indeed, I fear that many have shaped a god for themselves and
   are not reconciled to the true God at all! We want a conversion which
   shall make us run in parallel lines with the God who has revealed
   Himself by His Prophets and Apostles--and by His always-to-be-adored
   Son. So may it be with each one of us, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Singular Origin of a Christian

   (No. 1829)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 22, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON FEBRUARY 7, 1884.

   "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God has before ordained that we should walk in them." Ephesians
   2:10.

   THIS text is written by the Apostle as a reason why salvation cannot be
   a thing of human merit--"not of works, lest any man should boast, for
   we are His workmanship." The for indicates an argument. It is a
   conclusive reason why salvation cannot be by our good works, because
   even when we have an abundance of the best of works, they are far more
   due to God than to ourselves! We, ourselves, in our saved condition,
   are the workmanship of God, and with each of us the argument holds
   good--"Not of works, for we are His workmanship."

   We are so completely the Lord's workmanship that we are also styled a
   creation! We are "created in Christ Jesus," and a creation cannot
   possibly be the creature's own work--such a supposition would be absurd
   upon the face of it! It would be a misuse of language to speak of
   anything as creating itself. Whatever, therefore, we are in Christ
   Jesus is the result of God's work upon us and cannot be the cause of
   that work.

   Moreover, our good works, be they what they may, are the subjects of an
   ordinance of God--"which God has before ordained that we should walk in
   them." Truly they are purposed by ourselves and our will and heart
   determine them, but far at the back of all this lies the Divine Purpose
   by which they were settled from of old. If good works are ordained, as
   well as the salvation of which they are the evidence, then the whole
   matter is of Divine ordaining and there is no space left to impute
   salvation to human works! The tree is not created by its fruit, for the
   fruit is created with the tree, and is one purpose for which the tree
   was created. Good works are not the cause of salvation, for they are
   the result of it and were contemplated as a result by God when He saved
   us. The argument deserves to be worked out at greater length, but we
   have not space for it now.

   I want, at this time, to call your attention to four things in the
   text. And if you can carry in your mind's eye the first creation, the
   making of Adam and what he was made for--and where he was put when he
   was made--it will serve as a background to the picture of the second
   creation which I shall attempt to paint. I would dwell upon man as
   God's workmanship in a still higher sense than by his first making. I
   would set him forth as created anew "unto good works, which God has
   before prepared"--for that is the word properly used in the new
   translation--"which God has before prepared that we should walk in
   them."

   I. To begin, then, notice first, THE SINGULAR ORIGIN OF A Christian. Of
   all Christians, whether Jews or Gentiles--of all Christians, even if
   they are the highest Apostles, like Paul, or the least of all the
   family of love, such as we may be--as many as are truly saved and
   brought into union with Christ, they are the workmanship of God!

   No Christian in the world is a chance production of Nature, or the
   outcome of evolution, or the result of special circumstances. "By the
   Grace of God I am what I am," may be said by every man who is saved. To
   nothing can we ascribe the fact that we are in Christ except this--that
   we are God's workmanship. Of regeneration, we must say, once and for
   all, "This is the finger of God."

   The spiritual life cannot come to us by development from our old
   nature. I have heard a great deal about evolution and development, but
   I am afraid that if any one of us were to be developed to our utmost,
   apart from the Grace of God, we should come out worse than before the
   development began! Our flesh would be apt to produce, by evolution,
   something exceedingly brutish and devilish. Mr. Whitefield once raised
   a great outcry against himself by saying that man by

   nature was half beast, half devil--I have never seen any reason why the
   description should be altered, but I have sometimes wondered which was
   the worse of the two--the devil in the man, or the beast in him!

   As to spiritual life coming out of our unrenewed nature, it is
   impossible! "Out of nothing comes nothing." There is no spiritual life
   in men dead in trespasses and sins--how, then, can life come out of
   them? Out of death, truly, there comes a something congruous
   thereto--horrible are the forms of corruption that arise from the body
   in which death holds sway! But this is dissolution and destruction--not
   life. What the corruption of a human soul may be, I cannot attempt to
   say. Terrible as Hell must be, there is nothing in the Pit more awful
   than those who are in it. The lost, themselves, are more unutterably
   dreadful than any punishment that justice may have imposed upon them.
   Developed manhood, developed without any restraining influences, if it
   is shut up in vast numbers, must be a fermenting mass of hate, envy,
   malice, lust, cruelty and pride. Speak of evolution--here it is--"When
   lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished,
   brings forth death." Darkness never begets light, filth never creates
   purity, Hell never yields Heaven and depravity never produces Grace.

   But the point is that we are God's workmanship. We are His workmanship
   from the very first. The first stroke that helps to fashion us into
   Christians comes from the Lord's own hands. He marks the stone while
   yet in the quarry, cuts it from its natural bed and performs the first
   hewing and squaring, even as it is He who afterwards exercises the
   sculptor's skill upon it. It was the Lord who first taught us our need
   of a Savior and gave us our sense of sin--and our early trembling and
   our new desires. The faintest breath of spiritual life that was ever
   breathed by any one of us came from God Himself! We might almost use
   the same words concerning our new nature as the Psalmist used when he
   spoke of his body--"Your eyes did see my substance, yet being
   imperfect; and in Your book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them."

   We shall remain the Lord's workmanship to the very last. The picture
   must be finished by that same Master hand which first sketched it. If
   any other hand should lay so much as a tint or color on it, it would
   certainly mar it all. God has commenced the character of His people
   after so marvelous a sort that no human mind, as yet, fully comprehends
   the full design of infinite love, for none know perfectly the matchless
   Character of Jesus, our Lord. "It does not yet appear what we shall
   be." Since, then, we do not even know what we are to be, we cannot
   intrude into the work and take the pencil from the hand of the great
   Artist, and complete His design--the Author must be the Finisher of
   what He has begun.

   This is very beautiful to remember and it should stir up all that is
   within us to magnify the Lord. If it is so, that from the first the
   Lord has worked all our works in us, what an amount of patience, what
   an amount of power, what an amount of skill, what an amount of love,
   what an amount of Grace has God spent upon us! I was surprised when I
   was told, the other day, by a friend, who was a maker of steel-plate
   engravings, how much labor had to be put into a finely-executed
   engraving. Think of the power that has cut lines of beauty in such
   steel as we are! Think of the patience that lent its arms, its eyes and
   its heart--and its infinite mind--to the carrying on of the supreme
   work of producing the image of Christ in those who were born in sin!
   Think of the skill which makes heirs of God out of heirs of wrath! It
   seemed impossible, when one said that, "God is able of these stones to
   raise up children unto Abraham," but it is more than fulfilled in us!

   Miracles of Grace have been worked upon us as many as the sands on the
   seashore. How graciously has the Lord endured our opposition to His
   gracious operations, never violating the freedom of our will, but
   making us willing in the day of His power! This is one of the greatest
   of the marvels. See how He has continued to work upon us, year after
   year, with final perseverance of undiminished love! How much more of
   power will still be needed and how much more of long-suffering--and how
   much more of careful wisdom--before we shall be perfect and complete?
   According to His riches in Grace will He deal with us and if that
   should not suffice, He will take a higher standard and treat us
   according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus. This we know, that we
   shall certainly receive all that is needed for completion, for He that
   has begun a good work in us will perform it unto the day of Christ.
   Happy is it for us that "we are His workmanship"!

   Now, ought we not, dear Friends, as far as the Lord has gone with us
   already, to bless and praise His holy name? Do you not think that it is
   becoming in all of us who know that God has been at work with us, to
   adore Him continually for what He has done? I know you sigh because a
   part of the picture still looks rough and incomplete. Consider that the
   Artist has not ended His labor upon that portion of us. Sanctification,
   in its practical issues, is not yet ended. But do not

   sigh so much over the incomplete part as to fail in rejoicing over that
   which is accomplished! Rejoice that a hand has been laid upon the
   canvas which is matchless even in its outlines and foundation colors! A
   hand, moreover, which was never yet known to throw away a canvas upon
   which it had once commenced a masterpiece! Remember to magnify His
   work. "He who has worked us for the same thing is God, who also has
   given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."

   One thing I would say to you who are God's people--if we are His
   workmanship, never let us be ashamed to let men see God's workmanship
   in us. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
   works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven." Let us be very much
   ashamed to let them see the remains of the devil's workmanship in us--
   hide it behind a veil of repentant grief! Christ has come to destroy
   it--let it be destroyed! Yet let your simple faith be known and spoken
   of, even though it is ridiculed by the wise men of the age who, by
   wisdom, know not God. Do not be ashamed of your confidence in your God
   at any time, even though men burst into a fit of laughter over it as if
   you must be raving mad--for this, also, is God's workmanship. Nothing
   that God has worked is unfit to be seen. Search from the summit of the
   highest Alp to the bottom of the deepest cavern and there is neither
   plant, nor beast, nor insect, nor even grain of dust which is not
   beautiful in its season.

   I have heard foolish people half scream at the sight of some poor
   little insect, or frog, or lizard--but this is from lack of knowing
   more of the beauty of the creature which our great Father has formed.
   If these are quietly looked at, especially if they are examined under
   the microscope, they amaze us with the marvelous art displayed in them.
   Nothing that God has made should be despised. Assuredly this is most
   true in the spiritual kingdom where the lowest form of Grace is lovely
   as an angel's countenance! All the new creatures of God are
   surpassingly beautiful and as far as you, my Brothers and Sisters, are
   God's workmanship, so far are you comely with the comeliness which He
   has put upon you! Look how the Bridegroom in Solomon's Song extols His
   bride, fair metaphor of the manner in which the Lord Jesus praises His
   Church! He is an impartial Judge of all that is excellent, but when He
   views His people as God's work, He is full of admiration!

   That which is your own work, you may well blush to acknowledge. That
   which is the devil's work, you are bound to detest! But that which is
   the work of the Holy Spirit in you will bear inspection and no guilty
   fear should cause you to conceal it. Let your meekness, your kindness,
   your uprightness, your integrity, your purity appear unto all men.
   Never let it be a question whether you are a Christian. Do not tremble
   at the persecution which the enmity of the ungodly may inflict upon you
   because you belong to Christ, but rather accept it as an honor,
   esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in
   Egypt!

   As to any of you who hear me at this time and feel forced to say, "Ah,
   me! I do not see how I am to be a Christian"-- let me speak with you. I
   am thinking of the matter very differently. I see very plainly how you
   can become Christians-- for all of us who are Believers are God's
   workmanship and that God who has made us His workmanship can make you
   to be the same. "Oh, but I cannot do anything!" Who said you could? Who
   asked you to do any part of God's work? We are God's workmanship! There
   is, in your fallen nature, no power or will towards good and if the
   question were about your workmanship, the answer would be full of
   despair! But while God works, there is hope.

   "Oh, but I have a withered hand!" When Jesus bids you stretch it out,
   do not enquire about your own power, but look to His power who gives
   the command! Do you say, "I cannot save myself. I cannot make myself
   holy"? Look, then, to Him who is a Savior, able to save to the
   uttermost, who was born for this end that He might save His people from
   their sins. "We are His workmanship," cry all the saints! Do you want
   to be your own workmanship? He that can work upon one can work upon
   another. Oh, that you would lie at His feet! Oh, that you would put off
   all idea of what you can do for yourself and draw comfort from these
   few words of my text--"We are His workmanship"! What is there that God
   cannot do for you? Rough material as you are, He can make you what you
   should be! He can make you what it will delight you to be! God grant
   that we may learn to look to the Strong for strength and no longer
   waste our time in enquiring for it where there is nothing but perfect
   weakness!

   Here, then, is the origin of a Christian--he comes out of the workshop
   of God.

   II. Secondly, here in the text we see THE PECULIAR MANNER OF THIS
   ORIGIN. "We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus." "Created in
   Christ Jesus." Catch that thought. Our new life is a creation. This
   goes further than the former expression, for workmanship is less than
   creation. A man may produce a picture and say, "This is my
   workmanship"--a piece of mosaic, or a vessel fresh from the wheel may
   be a man's workmanship--but it is not his creation.

   The artist must procure his canvas and his colors. The maker of a
   mosaic must find his marbles or his wood. The potter must dig his clay,
   for without these materials he can do nothing, for he is not the
   Creator. To One only does that august name strictly belong! None other
   could create a gnat, or the beam of light in which it dances, or the
   eyes with which it is seen.

   In this world of Grace, wherever we live, we are a creation. Our new
   life is as truly created out of nothing as were the first heavens and
   the first earth. This ought to be particularly noticed, for there are
   some who think that the Grace of God improves the old nature into the
   new. It does nothing of the sort! That which we possess since the Fall
   is corrupt and dead and to be buried--of which our Baptism is the type
   and the testimony. That which is of God within us is a new birth, a
   Divine principle, a living seed, a quickening Spirit! In fact, it is a
   creation--we are new creatures in Christ Jesus. What a sweeping
   statement! This goes back to the very beginning of Grace within us. As
   we read, "In the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth," so
   may we say of every man that is born again unto God, that he had no
   true beginning till God created him and made him to be spiritually.
   Creation is the calling of something out of nothing, of light out of
   darkness, of life out of death. Is not this a fair description of the
   new birth? Has not this happened to us? When we were nothing, God, in
   the greatness of His Grace, created us in Christ Jesus!

   Creation was effected by a word. "By the word of the Lord were the
   heavens made." "He spoke, and it was done! He commanded, and it stood
   fast." "God said, Let there be light: and there was light." Is not
   that, again, an accurate description of our entrance into spiritual
   light and life? Do we not confess, "Your Word has quickened me"? "Being
   born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word
   of God, which lives and abides forever." "Which were born, not of
   blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
   God." The Lord breathed upon us by His Spirit and we lived--He spoke,
   and we were created in Christ Jesus.

   In creation the Lord was alone and unaided. The Prophet asks, "Who has
   directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being His counselor has taught Him?
   With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him in
   the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the
   way of understanding?" After all was done, the morning stars sang
   together and all the sons of God shouted for joy--but they did
   not--could not aid in the work! Creation is the prerogative of Jehovah
   and none can share it with Him. So it is in the regeneration of a
   soul--instrumentality appears, but the real work is immediately of the
   Spirit of God.

   See, then, poor Sinners who may hear these words, that they have a
   relation to you! You are saying, "How can we become Christians?" Why,
   you can become Christians by being created--and there is no other way!
   "But we cannot create ourselves," says one. It is even so! Stand back
   and quit all pretence of being creators--and the further you retreat
   from self-conceit the better--for it is God who must create you! How I
   wish that you felt this! "It would drive us to despair," you say. It
   might drive you to such despair as would be the means of your flying to
   Christ--and that is precisely what I desire! It would be greatly to
   your gain if you never again indulged a shred of hope in your own works
   and were forced to accept the Grace of God! I seek not to excite in you
   a proud activity, but a humble reliance on the mercy of God and a
   submissive acceptance of His plan of salvation by Free Grace. Oh, that
   this might be done!

   The Gospel does not call upon you to save yourselves, but its voice is
   the echo of that of the Lord in Isaiah 45:22, "Look unto Me, and be you
   saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none
   else." The Lord does not even ask for your help in your own salvation.
   When He has worked in you, you may work it out, but that is all. Be
   ready to be as clay in the hands of the Potter, plastic to the touch of
   the All-Creating God, and you shall find that He is the God of
   salvation and to Him belong the issues from death! Out of black sinners
   He can make bright saints! Hearts of stone He can take away and give
   hearts of flesh. He can take the infidel and create in him a mighty
   faith; the harlot and make her a pattern of purity; the lowest of the
   low and the vilest of the vile--and put them among the princes--even
   the princes of His people! Granted that a Christian is the result of a
   creation, then nothing is needed to begin with and no help is required
   in the process--the Lord can work and none can hinder Him. This Truth
   of God lifts the whole matter out of the region of the creature's
   merit, worth, or ability--and puts it on another footing, full of hope
   to man and of glory to God! I would be glad and rejoice forever in that
   which God creates--it fills me with comfort for my fellow men and with
   reverence for my God.

   But the text speaks of this creation as, "in Christ Jesus." This is a
   deeply instructive subject which, at this present time, cannot fully be
   discussed, partly from lack of time and partly from lack of ability, on
   my part, to fully open it up. It

   would require a series of discourses, such as Dr. John Owen, or Stephen
   Charnock might have been able to deliver. The theologians of today, if
   there are any, cannot come near it. Herein is a great deep--"created in
   Christ Jesus." This much, however, I may note, for it rises to the
   surface. In the first creation you and I were created in Adam. We wear
   the image of the earthly Adam by our natural descent and, as such, we
   are the creatures of God. It is of our natural birth that the Psalmist
   said, "Your hands have made me and fashioned me." Thus we received our
   being and that is a blessing. But the blessing would have soured into a
   curse had not Jesus come to work our well-being! Creation in the first
   Adam has brought us into a world of misery--and to reach a better
   world, we require to be created in some such fashion that we come into
   union, connection and relationship with the second Adam--the Lord from
   Heaven.

   This is what the Lord does when He new-creates each Believer--He
   creates him in Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus is his federal Head and his
   Representative--his hope is hidden in Him. We are thus put under a new
   economy and are dealt with under a new system and order of things. I
   could tell you something more that I believe, namely, that when the
   glorious Jehovah created the Christ, as the Man, Christ Jesus--and when
   the Godhead came into union with this human Nature of our blessed Lord,
   all of us were viewed as in Him. What says the Lord? "In Your book all
   My members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as
   yet there was none of them." That God saw you and me and all the
   redeemed in Christ from all eternity is a matter of faith to me.

   And we were in Christ when He died, in Him when He rose and we are in
   Him even now that He sits at the right hand of God, the Father. Who can
   separate the Head from the members, or the members from the Head? We
   are regarded as one in the thought and acts of Jehovah! Beloved, there
   is a mystic unity between Christ and the twice-born, into which I will
   not further go. I point to a case which, just now, I will not unlock.
   But to return to the text, here is the glory of it-- first, we are
   God's workmanship--and the peculiar manner in which we have been
   created is that we have been created "in Christ Jesus."

   III. We come, thirdly, to dwell upon THE SPECIAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS
   CREATION--"unto good works,

   which God has before ordained that we should walk in them."

   When Adam was created, the Lord made him for His own Glory. This always
   was, and is, and must be the chief end of man. As soon as he was
   created, the Lord placed Adam in the garden. And what did He give him
   to do? "He had only to enjoy himself," says one. I do not read such a
   statement in the Scriptures. "He put him there," says another, "that he
   might eat of every fruit that grew in the garden." Truly He did permit
   Adam, freely, to partake of all that Nature yielded, but God tells us,
   Himself, that He put Adam in the garden, "to dress it, and to keep it."
   An occupation was found for Adam which would keep him always busy.

   A gardener's business is healthful and interesting, but it offers no
   temptation to idleness, for every season has its demands--and if the
   work is not kept well under hand, it is hard to overtake it again. That
   noble man who was the founder of our race, trimmed the vine and trained
   the tree! He uprooted the weed and planted the herb. Paradise, itself,
   required, to make it perfect, that a man should have something to do!
   Slavish drudgery involved by unreasonable hours is not of God, but of
   the cruel greed of man. Ill-remunerated toil, by which the worker
   cannot earn his daily bread, is the result of human tyranny, not of
   Divine purpose! But a fair share of healthy, useful labor is necessary
   for us all and, if ever this world becomes a Paradise, again, we shall
   have, each one of us, to pay either the sweat of our brow or of our
   brain as the price of our bread.

   When the Lord creates us the second time, in the second Adam, He does
   not make us that we may be merely comfortable and happy. We may enjoy
   all that God has given us, for of every tree of this garden you may
   freely eat, since in the Paradise into which Christ has introduced you,
   there is no forbidden fruit. You may eat and drink abundantly of
   heavenly food, but you are not created anew with so poor a purpose as
   only your pleasure! Around you is the garden of the Lord, and your call
   is that you may dress it and keep it. Cultivate it within; guard it
   from foes without. Holy labors await you! Good works are expected of
   you and you were created in Christ Jesus on purpose--that you might be
   zealous for them. To you the great Father says, "Son, go work today in
   My vineyard." He who died for you calls you to do works like His own.
   The Holy Spirit within you prompts you to consecration, urges you to
   diligence.

   And what are good works? In that question lies another large subject.
   Tell me, you who talk so much of good works, what are they? I should
   say that they are works such as God commands--works of obedience. When
   we heartily keep the Divine precepts, we must be right, for it can
   never be evil for a man to do what God bids him.

   Next, I should say that they are works of love--of love to God and love
   to man--works done out of a pure affection to the great Father and out
   of unselfish regard to men. That which we do to display our own
   liberality is done unto self, and so is spoiled. But where there is a
   single eye to God's Glory, the work is good. Works done out of love to
   Christ, love to saints, love to the poor and love to lost sinners are
   good works.

   Furthermore, I should say that works of faith are good works--works
   done in confidence in God--undertaken in reliance upon His help and in
   the firm belief that He will accept them even though men might censure
   them. The proclamation of His Gospel with faith in its power, the
   pleading of the promise with expectation of its fulfillment, the
   sacrifice of personal gain for the service of the Truth of God--works
   such as these are good and pleasing to God--for without faith it is
   impossible to please Him.

   I am bound to add that good works include the necessary acts of common
   life when they are rightly performed. We are to produce good works in
   our home, in our shop, in our workplace, in our travel abroad, or on
   our sickbed-- everywhere we are to be filled with good works to God's
   Glory. All our works should be good works and we may make them so by
   sanctifying them with the Word of God and prayer, according to that
   precept, "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all in the
   name of the Lord Jesus."

   Observe that God has not created us that we may talk about our good
   works, but that we may walk in them. Practical doing is better than
   loud boasting! God has not created us that we may occasionally perform
   good works, but that we may walk in them--that they may be so habitual
   to us that the common course of our conversation may be full of them.
   God has not created us that we may execute good works as a grand
   performance, but that we may walk in them--not that we may jump up to
   them, or seem to be walking on stilts and making a great display every
   now and then--but that easily, naturally, out of a fully renewed heart,
   our new-created spirit may display itself in good works! May God grant
   that His holy objective may be carried out in us to such a degree that
   our path may be luminous with holiness, that we may leave behind a
   shining track like that of a vessel upon the sea! Oh, that our way may
   be strewn with gracious acts, as when a cloud shines over a thirsty
   land and blesses it with silver showers!

   I have known in a certain village, a spot called, "The Poet's Walk,"
   and another called, "The Lovers' Walk." Oh, that ours may be, "The
   Christian's Walk"! May the good Lord perfect us in every good work to
   do His will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight!

   IV. And now I close with this last head. Fourthly, THE REMARKABLE
   PREPARATION MADE FOR THAT OBJECTIVE, for so the text may be rendered,
   "which God has prepared that we should walk in them."

   God has decreed the salvation of His people--but do not accept that
   statement as it is at times delivered--but clearly understand what it
   means. The Lord has decreed everything and He has as much decreed the
   holy lives of His people as He has decreed their ultimate glorification
   with Him in Heaven! Concerning good works, "He has before ordained that
   we should walk in them." If God has really and of a truth met with you
   in a way of Grace and worked upon you by His Spirit, and new-created
   you, then take it for certain that you are ordained to be a prayerful,
   godly, upright, sanctified man. The purpose is one and
   indivisible--there is no ordination to salvation apart from
   sanctification!

   The Lord has not ordained any man to eternal life with the proviso that
   he may continue in sin. No, but He has ordained him that he shall
   become a new creature in Christ Jesus and then shall forsake his evil
   ways and walk in good works until that walk shall end in perfection
   before the Eternal Throne of God! Understand, then, that the walk of a
   Christian man is predestinated of God as much as the safety of a
   Christian! And so we, whom He has predestinated, are as eager to
   fulfill our holy destiny here as to enjoy our heavenly destiny
   hereafter. Foreordination to holiness is indissolubly joined to
   foreordination to happiness. Note that. Thus, in the Eternal Purpose,
   due provision is made for the good works of Believers.

   But, next, God has personally prepared every Christian for good works.
   "Oh," some say, "I sometimes feel as if I am so unfit for God's
   service." You are not unfit, so far as you are His workmanship, created
   in Christ Jesus unto good works! When God creates a bird to fly, it is
   the best flying-machine that can be manufactured--indeed, none can
   equal it! If God creates worms to plow the soil and bring up the more
   useful ingredients to the surface, they are the best fertilizers under
   Heaven! God's purpose is subserved by that which He makes, else were He
   an unwise worker. We are, in a special degree, God's workmanship,
   created to this end, that we may produce good works--and we are fitted
   to that end as much as a bird is fitted to fly, or a worm is fitted for
   its purpose in the earth.

   "Oh," says one, "but I find it so difficult to walk in good works."
   Then you are not your true and real self. Pray God to put the flesh
   back and to let that dead and carnal part of you be gone! And ask that
   the new life, which He has infused, may have good scope to carry out
   its own natural instincts, for it is a holy thing, created on purpose
   to walk in good works, and it will do so if it is not hindered. Give it
   liberty! Give it opportunity! Feed it! Bring it before God to
   strengthen it and it must, it will, as certainly produce good works as
   a good tree brings forth good fruit! Spontaneous holiness comes forth
   from sincere piety. A pure fountain yields clear streams, it cannot do
   otherwise. The new nature cannot sin because it is born of God. He that
   has a clean heart will necessarily have clean hands. An impure sea
   casts up mire and dirt, but the river of the Water of Life, when it
   overflows its banks, deposits no mud--it leaves sand of gold behind it!

   Once more, observe with content that everything around you is arranged
   for the production of good works in you. "I do not see that," says one.
   But listen. When God made Adam, when did He make him? He did not create
   him till He had made a place for him to live. The great Father's dear
   child could not be created until the garden had its roses blooming and
   its fruits ripening for him, that he might be delighted with them. When
   the Lord God created you in Christ Jesus, as you believe He did, He had
   prepared for you a position of service and usefulness exactly fitted
   for your capacity. That place, for the present, is the position which
   you now occupy." No," says one, "but I am in the place of poverty."
   That is it--it is God's design that you may, in that place, produce the
   sweet fruits of contentment and patience!

   "Alas!" cries another, "I dwell among the ungodly." It is intended by
   your Lord that your light may shine among them and that you, having
   your Graces tried, may become all the stronger and the better
   Christian. "Oh," says one, "I am a Christian, but I believe that I am
   in the worst place that ever was. I am alone, like a plant in the
   desert." Is it not written, "The wilderness and the solitary place
   shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as
   the rose"? Full often the most advantageous place for our manhood is
   that which is surrounded with splendid difficulties! A soldier is
   trained by battles and a mariner by storms. What can a man do when he
   has everything to his hand? Everything is possible to him, but so it is
   to every simpleton! He is truly a man who has nothing to assist him and
   yet is aided by the opposition which confronts him. To sail against
   wind and tide would be more notable than to drift with gale and
   current. Is not he a true man who can turn to account the worst
   possible circumstances so as to produce the best possible results? He
   has an opportunity for distinguishing himself who is placed amid
   temptations and perils. In your life, good works are provided for--"God
   has before prepared that we should walk in them."

   On the whole, you are placed in the best position for your producing
   good works to the Glory of God. "I do not think it," says one. Very
   well. Then you will worry to quit your position and attain another
   footing--mind that you do not plunge into a worse! The wise man says,
   "as a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man that wanders from
   his place." It is not the box that makes the jewel, nor the place that
   makes the man. "Oh, but anywhere rather than this!" Yes, and when you
   get into the place you now covet, you will pine to be back again! A
   barren tree is none the better for being transplanted. A blind man may
   stand at many windows before he will improve his view. If it is
   difficult to produce good works where you are, you will find it still
   difficult where you wish to be! He who said that he leaped so many
   yards at Rhodes, was asked to do the same feat at home--surely the
   place could not take away his strength, nor give it to him!

   Oh, Sirs, the real difficulty lies not without you, but within you! If
   you get more Grace and are more fully God's workmanship, you can
   glorify Him in Babylon as well as in Jerusalem! Were you placed within
   the outskirts of Perdition, you would glorify God if God has sanctified
   you. If you were called to walk through Pandemonium, you would startle
   it with a message from the Most High if the Spirit of God is truly
   within you. Your present possibilities are the best for this
   present--use them as they fly! At any rate, rest assured that Divine
   Wisdom has not only prepared you for the hour, but the hour for you.
   All things are, in a Divine sense, your friends, "For you shall be in
   league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall
   be at peace with you."

   Moreover, the Lord has prepared the whole system of His Grace to this
   end--that you should abound in good works. Every part and portion of
   the economy of Grace tends toward this result, that you may be perfect,
   even as Your Father in Heaven is perfect. I long to be holy--the Holy
   Spirit is given to be my Sanctifier. I desire to live near to God--the
   Holy Spirit dwells in me and this is nearness of the highest order. Did
   I hear you sigh--"I pine to know more of God"? This precious Book is in
   your hands and its Author is among us, ready to expound it to you. "Oh,
   but I agonize to conquer sin!" This is not denied you, for it is
   written, "This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our
   faith."

   Another says, "I yearn to be more like Christ." You are taken into
   communion with Christ on purpose that this may be. Looking at Him, you
   are changed into His image, from glory unto glory! Everything necessary
   for your holiness is to your hand in the Covenant of Grace. All the
   helps that you need in your pilgrim way are already placed along the
   sacred road. The Lord, in the Scriptural sense of the word, "prevents"
   you with the blessings of His goodness. All events, whether terrible or
   joyous, shall be made to work together for this highest form of good,
   namely, your sanctification! January's snow, February's cold, April
   showers, March winds, and July suns, all co-operate to prepare the
   wheat for the garner--and all earthly changes are sent of God to ripen
   us for the eternal future.

   Yes, I may even say that the glories of Heaven call us to a sublime
   life of holiness--and the thunders of Hell urge us to conquer the
   temptations which are in the world through lust. The crown which Christ
   holds over our heads inspires us with ardor in our race--while the
   Cross on which He died stirs us to a fervent enthusiasm for His praise.
   Nothing in Heaven, or on earth, or in Hell, rightly used, will excuse
   us in lukewarmness, but everything will impel us to intense zeal for
   holiness. Even the sin which so sadly abounds around us should make us
   the more watchful and careful in life. When dung is laid to the roots
   of the vine, it is not, thereby, defiled, but even out of the foul
   decay it finds nutriment with which to swell its delicious clusters!
   Thus, even the wickedness of man, by driving us nearer to our God,
   should prove a powerful motive for producing more exemplary lives in
   the midst of an untoward generation.

   Oh, Sirs, if God calls you His workmanship, take care that none can
   justly find fault with the Worker! If you are, indeed, God's creation
   in Christ Jesus, take care that none despise the second birth, or the
   second Adam. And if it is so, that the Lord has before prepared all
   things that we may walk in good works, let us get into gear with
   Creation--let us be in harmony with Providence--let us keep step with
   the march of God's Purpose. What more shall I say? I will only breathe
   a wish. Oh, that you who have not yet believed in my Lord Jesus would
   do so now! For, "to as many as received Him, to them gave He power to
   become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name"! Amen.

All Or None--or, Compromises Refused-- a Sermon With Five Texts

   (No. 1830)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 29, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON NOVEMBER 25, 1883.

   "There shall not an hoof be left behind." Exodus 10:26.

   I SHALL have five texts--one of them a good one, the other four bad.
   The first text is good. It is God's text.

   That is God's text and the whole sermon will illustrate it by exposing
   the compromises with which it was met. The other four are Pharaoh's
   texts, or, if you like, the devil's, for that is exactly what the devil
   says to men. Exodus 8:25-- "Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and
   said, Go you, sacrifice to your God in the land." That is his first
   proposal. Then we find him saying, at the 28th verse, "I will let you
   go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only
   you shall not go very far away." That is the second of his compromises.
   In the 10th chapter, at the 8th verse, you have the third. He said to
   them, "Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?"
   Adding, "Go now, you that are men, and serve the Lord." And Pharaoh's
   fourth and last proposal is in the 24th verse of that same 10th
   chapter-- "Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Only let your flocks
   and your herds be stayed."

   Satan is very loath to give up his hold on men. He is quite as loath as
   Pharaoh and he must be driven to it by force of arms--I mean by force
   of Divine Grace--before he will let God's people go. Having once got
   them under his power through the Fall, through their sin and through
   their hardness of heart, he will not lose his subjects if he can help
   it. He will put forth all his craft and all his strength, if possible,
   to hold them in his accursed sway! Many of Satan's slaves altogether
   disregard the voice of God. For them there are no Sabbaths, no Bibles,
   no religion. Practically, they say, "Who is Jehovah that we should obey
   His voice?" Now, when God means to save men--when the eternal purpose
   so runs and the Divine determination is to be accomplished, He soon
   puts an end to this. For some reason quite unknown to the man--it may
   be quite unthought of by him--he feels uneasy. He is disturbed. He
   thinks, one morning, that he will go up to a place of worship--not that
   he cares much about it--but he thinks that he shall, perhaps, be a
   little easier there. He takes his Bible--he begins to read a chapter. A
   very striking passage comes before his eyes. He is not more easy, for
   the text has fixed upon him. Like a barbed shaft it has stuck into his
   soul and he cannot possibly draw it out. He is more troubled than ever!
   He begins to enquire a little about the things of God--there is now
   some outwardly respect to religion--the man is considerably changed.

   But do not imagine that the work is accomplished! Our blessed Master
   has to fight for every inch of ground which He wins in human hearts.
   With the matchless artillery of His love, He drives the enemy back
   farther and farther, till, at last, He conquers! But it is often a long
   and slow process and, were He not possessed with infinite patience, He
   would give it up. But where it is His resolve that a man shall come out
   of the world and shall be saved, that resolve must and will be carried
   into effect! And the man, though he is only brought so far that he
   begins to think a little about Divine and eternal matters, he will have
   to go a great deal farther than that.

   You see him sitting under the Word of God and, perhaps, Satan now says,
   "Well, you are a fine fellow! You are beginning to occupy a seat Sunday
   after Sunday in the house of prayer. You have given up your evil habits
   to a large extent. You are quite a different man. Now that you have
   done something very pleasing to God, you may rest content with this."
   And it is a very sad thing when men do rest content with such a paltry
   hope as can have come out of poor performances

   like these! But still, they will stop just there if they can, for Satan
   does not mind where he makes men stop so long as they will stay under
   the dominion of sin and refuse to come to Christ.

   Now the Lord begins to deal with the man, perhaps, in a way of
   affliction and trouble. His wife sickens. A child dies. He is, himself,
   unhealthy--he fears he is about to die and his fancied righteousness
   evaporates before his eyes and he thinks that now, surely, he must seek
   after something better. Then will Satan come in and say, "There is time
   enough! Do not be in too much of a hurry."

   If the Lord drives a man from that, by the solemn movements of the
   Spirit upon his soul, then the devil will say to him, "How do you know
   that this is all true?" And he has not to go far before he finds
   infidels to help his unbelief. I am sorry to say that he can find them
   in the pulpit pretty plentifully, preaching their infidelities as
   "advanced thought!" And so poor souls get bewildered and scarcely know
   their right hand from their left! They begin, again, to relapse into a
   condition of indifference and remain where they were.

   Blessed be God, if He means to save such, He will, by push of pike and
   point of bayonet, carry the day! They shall not rest where they are.
   The right hand of the Lord is still stretched out and He will make the
   Pharaoh of evil yet know that Jehovah is stronger than he! Grace is
   mightier than nature and the eternal purpose more sure of fulfillment
   than all the resolves of case-hardened consciences! And so, at last, it
   comes to this--that the man is driven to yield to God and when he is
   driven to that point Satan comes in, again, with his promises.

   We are going to speak about these four compromises tonight. The first
   compromise is found in the 8th chapter at the

   25th verse.

   "Sacrifice to your God in the land."

   "Yes," says the devil, "you must be a Christian, that is evident. You
   cannot hold out any longer, for you are too uneasy in your sins. You
   will have to be a Christian." "But," he says, "stay in the world and be
   a Christian. Remain where you are. 'Sacrifice to your God in the
   land'"--by which he sometimes means this--live in sin and be a
   Believer. Trust yourself with Christ and then indulge yourself in
   whatever your heart desires. Do you not know that he is a Savior of
   sinners? Therefore stay in your sin and yet trust in Him.

   Oh, I charge you, by the living God, never be duped by such a
   treacherous lie as this, for it is not possible that you can find any
   rest or salvation while you live in sin! My dear Hearers, Christ came
   to save us from our sins, but not in our sins! He has built a hospital
   of mercy into which He receives the worst possible cases. All are
   welcome, but He does not receive them that they may continue to be
   sick! He heals them and make sound men of them. When the Lord Jesus
   Christ takes hold upon a thief, the man is a thief no longer! His
   inmost heart becomes honest. When the Lord meets with the harlot, He
   blots out her iniquity and she is affected with deep repentance for her
   crimes--and she turns to her Savior, desiring, from that time on, to
   walk in purity all her days. It is impossible that you should serve God
   and yet continue to indulge in knowing sin!

   What a fool that man is who thinks that he may drink and be a
   Christian! That he may cheat in his business and be a Christian! That
   he may act like the ungodly world in all respects and yet be a
   Christian! It cannot be. Mark Anthony yoked two lions together and
   drove them through the streets of Rome--but he could never have yoked
   together the lion of the Pit and the lion of the tribe named Judah!
   There is a deadly hate between these two. The principle of good, if it
   is yielded to, will destroy the mastery of evil. There cannot be a
   compromise between them. No man can serve two masters. He may serve
   two, but not two when each determines to be master! Satan will be
   master if he can, and Christ will be master and, therefore, you cannot
   serve the two! It must be one or the other.

   If you are to have your sin forgiven you, you must leave your sin.
   Remember that voice which came to Master John Bunyan when he was
   playing tip cat on Elstow Green on Sunday morning? He thought that he
   heard a voice say, "Will you leave your sins and go to Heaven, or will
   you have your sins and go to Hell?" That problem is proposed to you if
   you are unconverted and undecided. But as to the idea of keeping your
   sins and going to Heaven, shut that out of the question, for it must
   not, cannot and shall not be! It is a compromise proposed by Satan, but
   the Lord will not have it.

   Yes, but then Satan, retreating a little, says, "Well, now, of course I
   did not mean that you were not to give up your grosser sins, but I mean
   to tell you of something better. Love the world and live with
   worldlings--and find your company and your joy among them--and yet be a
   Christian. Surely you are not going to throw up everybody, are you? You
   know you must not be singular. You must not make yourself altogether an
   oddity! You have many merry companions--

   stay with them. They do not, perhaps, do you much good, but you must
   not be too particular and precise." So he says, "Continue in the world
   and be a Christian!"

   Shall I tell you God's Word about that? "If any man loves the world,
   the love of the Father is not in him." That is short, though not sweet.
   A man says, "Well, I shall be a Christian, but I shall find my chief
   pleasure and my amusement where the world finds theirs." Will you? "I
   shall be a Christian, but I shall hold with the hare and run with the
   hounds. I shall be with the church on Sunday, but nobody shall know
   that I am not the best worldling on the week-day. Can I not put my hymn
   book in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other, and so go to
   Heaven and stay friends with the world?" No, it is not possible. "Let
   My people go, that they may serve Me," is God's Word. Not, "Let them
   stay in the land and still serve you and serve Me, too." It cannot be!

   "Know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?"
   That text is another sharp, drawn sword cutting to the quick and there
   are professors who ought to feel it go to their very hearts, for they
   are trying all that they possibly can to go as near as ever they can to
   the border and yet to keep up a hope. What would you think of a man who
   went as near as he could to burning his house down, just to test how
   much fire it would stand? Or of one who cut himself with a knife to see
   how deep he could go without mortally wounding himself? Or of another
   who experimented as to how large a quantity of poison he could drink?
   Why, these are extreme follies! But not so great as that of a man who
   tries how much sin he may indulge in and yet be saved! I pray you, do
   not attempt such perilous experiments. "Come you out from among them;
   be you separate, and touch not the unclean thing." Shun with horror
   Satan's old compromise--dream not that you can love the world and yet
   have the love of the Father in you.

   When the enemy cannot get on with that, he draws back a little and
   cries, "That is very proper; you are hearing very faithful teaching
   this time, but listen to me--you can live for yourself and be a
   Christian! Do not go out into worldly company, but enjoy yourself at
   home. You see, you need to have your own soul saved. Well, live for
   that." This is only a subtler and uglier form of selfishness. It is
   nothing better. "Look," says Satan, "I do not ask you to be profligate
   with your money, be penurious with it--be very thrifty. Everybody will
   pat you on the back and say, 'He is taking care of number one and he is
   doing the right thing.' Come, now, and make a good thing of religion.
   Believe in Jesus Christ, of course, in order that you, yourself, may be
   saved, and then live all the rest of your life trying to hear sermons
   that will feed you and read books that will comfort you--and become a
   great man among religious folks."

   Hateful advice! Do you not know, dear Friends, that the very essence of
   Christianity is for a man to deny himself? Self can never properly be
   the end-all and be-all of a man's existence. Self is to religion, in
   fact, nothing but the flesh in a pretended spiritual form! If a man
   lives to himself, he is under the dominion of an evil spirit just as
   much as if he went out into open sin. So you must come out of that.
   Selfishness will not do. You must love the Lord with all your heart,
   and you must love your fellow men. There must be an obedience to that
   command that you "love the Lord your God with all your heart, and your
   neighbor as yourself," or else there is no coming out into safety. Thus
   the first compromise will not hold at all.

   Pushed back from the first compromise, Pharaoh proposes a second, and
   this is found in the 28th verse of the 8th chapter--

   "Only you shall not go very far away." Satan says, "Yes, I see your
   conscience tells you that you must come out from the world and come out
   from sin, but do not go very far away, for you may want to come back,
   again. In the first place, do not make it public. Do not join a church.
   Be like a rat behind the wainscot--never come out except it be at night
   to get a mouthful of food. Do not commit yourself by being baptized and
   joining the church--do not go so far as that! Just try, if you can, and
   save yourself from the wrath to come by secret religion, but do not let
   anyone know it. There really cannot be any need of actually saying, 'I
   am a Christian.'"

   My Friend, this is the very depth of Satan! When a soldier goes to the
   barracks, if he is a child of God, he may say, "I shall not kneel down
   to pray because they might throw a boot at me, as they generally do in
   the barracks. I can keep my religion to myself." That man is wrong. But
   if he boldly says, "I will fly my flag. I am a Christian and I will
   never yield that point, come what may"--he will stand! The beginning of
   yielding is like the letting out of water--no man knows to what a flood
   it will come. This is what Satan would have with some of you, that you
   may fall by little and little. Therefore defeat him--come out boldly!
   Take up your cross and follow Jesus. "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved."

   The Tempter also says, "Do not be so very precise and exact. The
   Puritan saints--well, people point the finger at them. You need not be
   quite so particular." By which he means this--that you may sin as much
   as you like so long as you do not violate propriety and that, after
   all, you are not to obey God thoroughly, but only to obey Him when it
   pleases you. This is flat rebellion against God! This will never do!

   "Well," he says, "if you are to be so precise, yet do not be so
   desperately earnest! There are some of those friends down there at the
   Tabernacle who are always looking after the souls of others and trying
   to proclaim Christ to everybody. You know they are a very dogmatic lot
   and they are a great deal too pushy and fanatical. Do not go with
   them." Just so. He means, stand and serve the Lord because you dare not
   do any other, but never give Him your heart. Never throw your soul into
   His cause. That is what Satan says--and do you think that such
   traitorous service will save you? If Moses had thought that going a
   little way into the wilderness would have saved Israel, he would have
   let them go a little way into the wilderness and that would have been
   the end of it. But Moses knew that nothing would do for God's Israel
   but to go as far away as ever they could--and put a deep Red Sea
   between them and Egypt! He knew that they were never to turn back, come
   what might, and so Moses pushed for a going forth to a distance--as I
   would, in God's name, push for full committal to Christ with everybody
   who is tempted to a compromise.

   "Oh, but," Satan will say, "be earnest, too. Yes, be earnest. Of course
   that is right enough. And be precise in all your actions--but do not be
   one of those people who are always praying in secret. You can keep an
   open religious profession going without much private praying, without
   heart-searching, without communion with God. These are tough things,"
   he says, "to keep up. You will find it difficult to maintain the inward
   life and preserve a clean heart and a right spirit. Let these go by
   default and attend to externals--be busy and active--and that will do."
   But it will not do, for unless the heart and soul are renewed by the
   Spirit of God, it little matters what your externals may be. You have
   failed before God unless your very soul is joined unto Him by a
   perpetual covenant that shall never be forgotten.

   What a blessing it is when a man can say, "I have done with these
   compromises! I do not want to serve God and win favor with the world. I
   do not want to go just a little way from the world. I pray God to
   divide me from the world by an everlasting divorce, just as it was with
   Paul when he said, 'The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
   world. From henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus.'" Happy man who has come right out under
   Divine guidance to seek the eternal Canaan! His is the path of safety
   and acceptance! But they that temporize and parley with sin and Satan
   will find mischief come out of it.

   Pushed back from that, the enemy suggests another compromise in the
   10th chapter, at the 8th and 11th verses--"Go, serve this Lord your
   God: but who are they that shall go? Go now, you that are men, and
   serve the Lord." Yes, that is his next point. "Yes," he says, "we see
   what it has come to. You are driven, at last, to this--that you must be
   an out-and-out Christian. But, now," he says, "do not worry your wife
   with it; do not take it home." Or he says to the woman, "You are to
   follow Christ. I see you must. You seem driven to that, but never say
   anything to your husband about it." Was not that a pretty idea of
   Pharaoh's--that all the men were to go and were to leave the women and
   children to be his slaves? And that is just the idea of Satan. "You
   have plenty to do to look after yourself--but your wife--well, leave
   her to her own ways. Your husband--leave him to his irreligion."

   Let us answer him thus--"As for me and my house, we will serve the
   Lord." So said Joshua of old and so let every man here say! Remember
   Paul's words to the Philippian jailer, "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house." Let us pray that we
   may have the whole house for Christ! Up to your measure of influence
   over your family, say within yourself, "My Lord, I will never rest
   until I see all my family brought to Your dear feet. Lord, save my
   wife: save my husband: save my father: save my brothers and sisters!
   Bring these out of bondage!" You cannot be a Christian unless that is
   your heartfelt desire. He that cares not for his own house is worse
   than a heathen and a publican!

   And then the children. "Oh," Pharaoh says, "leave the children!" Do you
   not see he knew very well that if they did that, they would,
   themselves, come back? What man among us would go away into the
   wilderness and leave his wife and children in slavery? Should we not
   want to come back to them? Should we not think that we heard their
   cries? Should we not want to look into their dear faces again? Leave
   them in slavery? Oh, that cannot be! And yet, let me sorrowfully say
   that there are many professing Christians who seem as though they were,
   themselves, determined to be the Lord's, but their children should
   belong to Pharaoh and to the devil!

   For instance, the boy is getting to be a certain age. Let him be sent
   to a foreign school, and, preferably, a Roman Catholic school. Will
   that be useful to his religion? Yet if he should turn out a Papist, his
   foolish father will almost break his heart! It was all his own doing,
   was it not? Well, the girls, of course, they must go into society--of
   course they must, "go into society." And so everything is done to put
   them into places of danger, where they will not likely be converted and
   where, in all probability, they will become frivolous, vain and light.
   Then a situation is looked for the boy. How often there is no question
   about the employer being a Christian! Is it a business that the lad can
   follow without injury to his morals? "No, it is a fine roaring trade,
   and it is a cutting house, where he will pick it up in a smart way. Let
   him go

   there."

   Yes, and if he goes to Hell? Alas, there are Christian men who do not
   think of that! The children of some professors are offered up to the
   Moloch of this world. We think it a horrible thing that the heathens
   should offer their children in sacrifice to idols and yet many
   professors put their children where, according to all likelihood, they
   will be ruined. Do not let it be so! Do not let the devil entangle one
   of you in that compromise, but say, "No, no, no! My house, God helping
   me, shall be so conducted that I will not put temptation in my
   children's way. I will not lead them into the paths of sin. If they
   will go wrong, despite their father's exhortations and their mother's
   tears, why, they must--but, at any rate, I will be clear of their
   blood, for I will not put them into places where they would be led
   astray."

   I am sure there is a great deal of importance in this remark--and if it
   cuts anybody very closely and he says, "I think you are very personal,"
   that is exactly what I mean to be--the precise thing I am aiming at! I
   desire to put this thing before every individual Christian, that all
   may see the right and the wrong of it--so that they may resolve, "Our
   women and our children shall go with us to worship God. They, as well
   as ourselves, shall leave this Egypt, as far as God's Grace can help us
   to accomplish it."

   Now the devil is getting pushed into a corner. Here is the man's whole
   house to go right for God and the man gives himself up to be a
   Christian out and out! What now? "Well," says the enemy, in the 24th
   verse of that 10th chapter--

   Go you, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed."
   Just so. What does Moses say to that? "You must give us, also,
   sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our
   God. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left
   behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know
   not with what we must serve the Lord until we come there." This was the
   Divine policy of, "No surrender!" And I plead for it with you. Satan
   says, "Do not use your property for God. Do not use your talents and
   your abilities! Especially do not use your money for the Lord Jesus.
   Keep that for yourself! You will need it one of these days, perhaps.
   Keep it for your own enjoyment. Live to God in other things, but as to
   that, live to yourself."

   Now, a genuine Christian says, "When I gave myself to the Lord I gave
   Him everything I had. From the crown of my head to the sole of my feet
   I am the Lord's. He bids me provide things honest in the sight of all
   men and care for my household--and so I shall, by His Grace. But yet I
   am not my own, for I am bought with a price and, therefore, it becomes
   me to feel that everything I have, or ever shall have, is a dedicated
   thing and belongs to the Lord, that I may use it as His steward, not as
   if it were mine, but at His discretion and at His bidding. I cannot
   leave my substance to be the devil's. That must come with me and must
   be all my Lord's, for His it is, even as I am."

   The Christian takes the line which Moses indicated--"I do not know what
   I may be required to give. I know that I am to sacrifice unto the Lord
   my God, but I do not know how much. I cannot tell what may be the needs
   of the poor, the needs of the Church, the needs of Christ's Church all
   over the land. I do not know, but this I do know--that all that I have
   stands at the surrender point. If my Redeemer wants it, He shall have
   it. If Satan wants it, he shall not have a penny of it! If there is
   anything that is asked of me that will not contribute to good
   morals--that will not contribute to the promotion of that which is
   right in the sight of God--I withhold it! But if there is anything that
   is for Christ's Glory and for the good of men, then, as the Lord shall
   help me, it shall be given freely and not be begrudged as if it were a
   tax. It shall be my joy and my delight to devote all that I am and all
   that I have to Him who bought me with His precious

   blood."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, you that profess to be Christians, come,
   stand right square out and acknowledge yourselves wholly and altogether
   the Lord's--

   "'Tis done! the great transaction's done; I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine."

   "My house is His and my all is His. Whether I live or die--whether I
   work or suffer, all that I am and all that I have shall be forever my
   Lord's." This is to enter into peace--this, indeed, is to be totally
   delivered from the power of Satan! This is to be the Lord's free man
   and what remains but with joyful footsteps to go onward toward Canaan,
   shod with shoes of iron and brass, fed with heavenly bread, guarded by
   the Lord, Himself, guided by His fiery-cloudy pillar, enjoying all
   things in Him and finding Him in all things? This is to be a Christian
   of the true order! The Lord make you so by faith in His dear Son! Amen
   and Amen!

Smoking Flax

   (No. 1831)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON JUNE 1, 1884.

   "The smoking flax shall He not quench." Isaiah 42:3.

   I BELIEVE that the first sense of these words is not the one usually
   given to them, nor yet the one upon which I intend to preach tonight.
   We read in the 12th of Matthew that our Divine Lord was assailed by the
   scribes and Pharisees, but He did not enter, at that time, into
   controversy with them, neither did He make them the perpetual target of
   His observations. Considering what hypocrites they were and what
   boundless mischief they were doing, He treated them very gently,
   indeed. They were, compared to Him, but as bruised reeds and as the
   smoking flax, and He could, if He had pleased, have broken them up
   altogether, or have altogether quenched them--but He did not come to be
   a mere controversialist. He was, in truth, the greatest of all
   Reformers, but He was not so much a breaker-down as He was a
   builder-up. He came not so much to drive out error by reason, as to
   expel it by the natural and efficient process of putting the Truth of
   God into its place. So, to a large extent, He left these scribes and
   Pharisees, and other opponents, alone, and He went quietly on with His
   own work of healing the sick and saving the sinful--a very good lesson
   to us.

   We get a little pugnacious, sometimes, and seek religious controversy.
   But our Savior did not strive, nor cry, nor cause His voice to be heard
   in the streets--a bruised reed He did not break and a smoking flax He
   did not quench. The best way to put out the twinkling light of a
   smoking flax was to let the sun shine. Then nobody could see it!
   Instead of talking down these bruised reeds, He set up the higher claim
   of sure and certain truth, for men would not care to trust in bruised
   reeds when they had once seen something more stable and worthy to be
   relied upon. You and I will best put down error by preaching the Truth
   of God. If we preach up Christ, the devil goes down. If a crooked stick
   is before you, you need not explain how crooked it is--lay a straight
   one down by the side of it and the work is well done. Preach the Truth
   of God and error will stand abashed in its presence.

   That is, no doubt, the first meaning of this passage, as you will see
   by the connection in Matthew. It is said, "A bruised reed shall He not
   break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He sends forth
   judgment unto victory." When the Lord sends forth judgment unto
   victory, then it will be all over with the bruised reed and the smoking
   flax of the hypocrite, the Pharisee, the formalist, the legalist and
   every other opponent.

   Usually these words are understood to mean that Jesus Christ will deal
   very gently with timid Believers and this meaning is not to be rejected
   for, in the first place, it is true. And, in the second place, it is
   true out of this text, also, for if our Lord Jesus, in His lifetime,
   was gentle even to hypocrites, how much more will He be gentle to
   sincere but timorous spirits? If it is true that He will not quench the
   smoking flax even of a Pharisee, how much more true must it be that the
   smoking flax of a penitent shall not be quenched! So that, if the text
   does not say what is generally understood by it, it implies it and the
   words so clearly run into the meaning that is commonly given to them.

   I take it that there is a kind of instinct in the Church, so that even
   when judged according to criticism, she may seem to misapply a passage
   of Scripture. She generally does not misapply it, but only brings out a
   second light which was always behind the first and which shines none
   the less brightly, but all the more so, because the first was there. I
   shall therefore take the text to mean something other than I have
   stated. "The smoking flax shall He not quench," is a text for you
   timorous, desponding, feeble-minded and yet, true-hearted Believers,
   and you may appropriate it to yourselves. May the Holy Spirit help you
   to do so!

   I. In talking of it, at this time, I shall first enquire, WHAT STATE
   THIS METAPHOR REPRESENTS. A smoking flax represents a state in which
   there is a little good. The margin is "dimly burning flax." It is
   burning, but it is burning

   very dimly. There is a spark of good within the heart. You, my dear
   Friend, have a little faith. It is not much bigger than a grain of
   mustard seed, but faith of that size has great power in it! I wish that
   your faith would grow to a tree, but I am very glad that you have any,
   even though it is minute as the mustard seed. You have a desire, too,
   after better things. You are always wanting to be more holy. You love
   to be among God's people and though, sometimes, you are afraid that you
   are not one of them, you would give all that you have to be sure that
   you were, for you love their conversation. Having those desires, you
   pray. "O Sir," you say, "it is not worth calling prayer!" Well, we will
   not call it prayer, then, but it is prayer, for sometimes, when not
   even a word is spoken, the desire of the heart is a most acceptable
   pleading with God. "O Sir," you say, "but I do not always desire
   alike!" I am very sorry that it is so. I wish you always had a strong
   desire after Christ. Still, you do desire. There is a longing, a
   desiring, a panting, a hungering, a thirsting--therefore there is some
   little good in you.

   "Do not praise me," you say. Oh, no, dear Friend, I will not praise
   you! I know that you would not like it, for you have a modest estimate
   of yourself and, like the publican, you cry, "God be merciful to me a
   sinner." That tune suits you, does it not? I can see somewhat of good
   in you since you do not think well of yourself. If you did, we might
   think ill of you--but inasmuch as you even repent over your repentance
   and feel as if your tears need weeping over, I am glad of it. Lowliness
   of heart is a Grace very much despised in these days, but very much
   valued by the King of Heaven. "To this man," He says "will I look, even
   to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at My Word."
   There is some little good in you put there by the Spirit of God. "Ah,"
   you say, "I like that word, Sir. I am sure there was no good in me by
   Nature." Friend, I am sure of it, too, if you are at all like I am. The
   Grace of God has put in us our first desire, our first loathing of sin,
   our first wish to be forgiven, our first desire to return to our Father
   from whom we have wandered. The Spirit put it there and you are like
   the smoking flax because there is a little living fire in you.

   You are like smoking flax, again, because your good is too little to be
   of much use to anybody. What could we do with a smoking flax if we had
   it here, tonight, and the gas was all out? You would, perhaps, see a
   glimmer, but you would say, "It is not light, but darkness visible." I
   like a soul in darkness to find that darkness visible! There is a good
   point about that. Alas, you are such a poor timid creature, you could
   not comfort a child of God--you cannot even comfort yourself! You could
   not strengthen the weak, for you need all the strengthening for
   yourself. You are not much of a soldier. You could not march in
   rank--we have to carry you about in the ambulance. Well, we are not
   tired of carrying you, nor is God, either! You are still a soldier, for
   you would fight if you could.

   Though you are an invalid, yet whenever the trumpet sounds, you wish to
   be in the thick of the fight. Poor thing that you are, you would soon
   be trampled down, but you have spirit enough for it, for which I thank
   God. Though your courage is of no great use to anybody, yet it is of
   use to you, for it proves you to be a soldier of the Cross, a follower
   of the Lamb! I would to God that you had more of the Light of God that
   you might light your Brother on his dreary way. I wish you had more
   faith, more joy, more hope, more rest, for you might, then, be of
   service to the Lord's household and the King might find in you a
   willing helper. But as you cannot do that, you are like the smoking
   flax--there is a little good, but that good is not great enough to make
   you very useful. Yet I will tell you one thing you can do. When you
   meet with another poor soul that is like you, you can sympathize, can
   you not? You see, when bright and shining lights come near those who
   are dim, they are apt, rather, to shame them than to comfort them--but
   you will not do that. So far you may even help the despondent--at least
   you will do so one of these days.

   Smoking flax, then, has a little fire, but it is so little that it is
   of small service and, what is worse, it is so little that it is rather
   unpleasant. No one delights in the smell of a candle that is dying out.
   Smoking flax does not yield a sweet savor, neither does a Christian
   when he is in a mournful condition. There is a little good in him, but
   there is a great deal of wrong about him and that wrong has an ill
   smell. Sometimes these smoking-flax people believe a great many errors.
   They do not hold the true and solid doctrine of God's everlasting love.
   They favor notions that are not Scriptural and error is never sweet to
   Christ, nor to any of His own people. Besides, they have a great smoke
   of doubts. They doubt this and they question that--and they suspect the
   other thing. There is nothing more obnoxious to our Divine Lord than
   distrust of Him. It is a gracious act on His part that He puts up with
   it.

   One said to Christ, "If You can"--and that was a shocking thing to say
   to Almighty God! Another said to Him, "If You will"--and that was a
   shameful thing to say to One so kind--and yet He bore with them both.
   Doubting hearts will cry, "If You will," and, "if You can," and do
   anything sooner than believe. This is to make an ill savor in the Pres-

   ence of the Lord Jesus Christ for, though we may reckon our doubts to
   be trifling, they are no trifles to Him, but exceedingly grievous and
   provoking to His heart! A dear Sister came in after service, this
   morning, and told me that she was 50 years old on the same day as
   myself, so she came to shake hands with me, and she added, "I am like
   you in that, but I am the very reverse of you in other things." I
   replied, "Then you must be a good woman." "No," she said, "that is not
   what I mean." "But are you not a Believer?" "Well," she said, "I--I
   will try to be." I got hold of her hand and I said, "You are not going
   to tell me that you will try and believe my Lord Jesus Christ, for that
   means unbelief of Him who must be true!" And I held her fast while I
   added, "When your mother was about, did you say to her, 'Mother, I will
   try and believe you'? No, you would believe her because she was
   true--and I must have you believe Jesus Christ." She said, "Sir, pray
   for me." "No," I said, "I am not inclined to do that. What should I
   pray for you about? If you will not believe my Lord, what blessing can
   He give you? What has He ever done that you should say, 'I cannot
   believe Him'?"

   She again answered, "I will try." I was not content till I had reminded
   her of the Word of God, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life,"
   and I pressed her to a full faith in the risen Lord. The Holy Spirit
   enabled her to trust and then she cried, "I have been looking to my
   feelings, Sir, and this has been my mistake!" I have no doubt that she
   had done so--and a great many others are doing the same! And their
   doubts are just that horrible smoke which comes from smoking flax. O,
   you poor doubters, believe the Lord Jesus Christ! To say, "I cannot
   believe Him," is to say, in other words, that He is a liar and we
   cannot allow you to say that!

   Dear Friend, if you are like the smoking flax, there is something good
   in you, but that is so sadly little that there is a great deal that is
   trying about you--yet the Lord will not quench you! You are full of all
   sorts of fears. You are afraid of a shadow. You are trembling at
   nothing at all! Why is this? You are troubled when you ought to be glad
   and you make your whole family sad when there is no earthly reason for
   it. May the Lord deliver you! Those that are highest in faith have
   tried to comfort you and you have pulled them down instead of their
   being able to draw you up. Come, Friend, I would be as gentle as ever I
   can--my text bids me be so. I have no extinguisher for your smoking
   flax, for my Lord has said, "The smoking flax shall He not quench."

   I must add one more thing about this state and it is this, though the
   good of it is so little that it is of very little use to other
   people--and sometimes is very obnoxious--yet there is enough good in
   you to be dangerous in Satan's esteem. He does not like to observe that
   there is yet a little fire in you, for he fears that it may become a
   flame. If any of you were to see a man standing at the back of one of
   our public buildings lighting his pipe, I will be bound to say that you
   would be half afraid of an explosion, for he might be applying
   dynamite! There are times when the smallest smoke would fill the
   bravest men with fear. Even so--

   "Satan trembles when he sees

   The weakest saint upon his knees" If he hears you groaning about your
   sin, he is frightened at it. "Oh," he says, "they have begun to feel!
   They have begun to mourn. They have begun to desire. They have begun to
   pray and soon they will leave me!" Let a farmer perceive a little smoke
   coming out of one of his ricks and I am sure that he will not say that
   there is nothing at all in a smoking flax! No, he will hasten to
   prevent a conflagration. So the little Grace that is in you, dear
   Friend, Christ sees and He approves of it, for He knows the
   possibilities of it--how little faith can grow into strong faith--how
   the grain of mustard seed can become a tree and the birds of the air
   may yet lodge in its branches! And Satan, also, knows what may come of
   it and he is moved to quench it if he can. We, therefore, would
   encourage you and fan your spark to a flame. There is the first
   question answered. What state does this represent?

   II. Secondly, WHEN ARE SOULS IN THAT STATE? Some are in that state when
   they are newly saved--when the flax has just been lighted. Those that
   are to be received into the Church, tonight, I welcome very heartily,
   but they are very newly lit and some, perhaps, would have said, "Let
   them wait a bit." Yes, but then our Lord does not quench the smoking
   flax because it is newly lighted and nor will I. No place in the world
   is so good for the lambs as the fold. No place is so good for babes as
   their own home. No place is so good for young Christians as the Church
   of God. So let them come!

   Being newly converted, they are strange to many things. You have made a
   host of discoveries. You find more depravity in your heart than you
   thought was there. You find enemies where you expected to meet with
   friends. All this is apt to

   dampen your courage, but do not be cast down--for though it is but a
   little that you are lighted--yet the loving Jesus will not quench the
   smoking flax!

   Sometimes a candle smokes, not because it is newly lit, but because it
   is almost extinguished. I know that I speak to some Christians who have
   been alight with the fire of Grace for many years and yet they feel as
   if they were near the dark hour of extinction. But you shall not go
   out. The Lord will not quench you, Himself, nor will He permit the
   devil to quench you. He will keep you alight with Grace. "Oh," but you
   say, "I am so depressed in spirit!" Yes, some of God's best servants
   have been of a sorrowful spirit. Remember Hannah, whom Eli cruelly
   rebuked, but who, nevertheless, got a blessing? David had to say, "Why
   are you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within me?"
   And yet he was a man after God's own heart. Perhaps you are not well,
   or you have had an illness that has taken much upon your nervous system
   and you are depressed--perhaps that is why you think that Grace is
   leaving you--but it will not! Your spiritual life does not depend upon
   Nature, else it might expire--it depends upon Grace, and Grace will
   never cease to shine till it lights you into Glory! Therefore be not
   cast down. You may think that your light will go out in eternal
   darkness, but it never shall, for the Lord Jesus Christ will preserve
   the flame.

   Sometimes the wick smokes when worldliness has dampened it. If some of
   you never have any holy joy, I am not surprised, for you are so taken
   up with the world and so fond of it. The life of God is in you, but it
   is smothered! You are like an autumn fire out in the garden when they
   are burning the weeds--there is a fire, but all you can see is smoke.
   Yes, you smother up your piety with the things of this world and no
   wonder that it smokes! What a mercy it is that the Lord does not allow,
   even you, to perish! He keeps the dying flame alive though hidden away.

   At times a wick burns low because a very strong wind has blown upon it.
   Many men and women are the subjects of very fierce temptations. The
   place in which they live is a trial to them and their natural
   constitution furnishes them with a host of temptations--and so the flax
   scarcely burns, but smokes and smolders. We do not wonder that it
   should be so.

   There are many other reasons why we grow dim at times--reasons, but
   none of them sufficient to be an excuse. If we were what we ought to
   be, we would always be burning and shining lights--and there would be
   no times in which we would be like the smoking flax. But then we are
   not what we ought to be--we fall short of the true standard--and we
   become feeble Believers.

   III. I desire to finish with a word of promise. WHAT DOES JESUS DO WITH
   THOSE WHO ARE IN THIS

   STATE? He says that He will not quench the smoking flax. What a world
   of mercy lies in that Word of God! Everybody else would quench us but
   Christ! I am sure that some Christians get into such a state that the
   most loving Christian friends find it hard to bear with them and fear
   that such a state of mind cannot be consistent with Grace at all. Thus
   your friend would give you over as lost. But Jesus Christ says that He
   will not do so.

   He will not quench you, first, by pronouncing legal judgment upon you.
   He will not say, "You have broken My Laws and I have done with you." If
   He did, our only answer could be, "Enter not into judgment with Your
   servant, for in Your sight shall no man living be justified." If the
   Lord were once to come to that, He would quench us all! Not only some
   few of the tremblers, but the strongest among us must go to the wall!
   The Lord Jesus Christ has not come to condemn, but to save.

   He will not quench you, dear Friend, by setting up a high experimental
   standard. Certain deep divines will say, "You must have felt so much of
   this and so much of the other, or else you cannot be a child of God."
   Who told the good man that? Who made him to be a judge? The Lord Jesus
   Christ does not quench even the feeble, faint desire, or the trembling
   faith of His servants, though they fall far short of that experience
   which ought to belong to a child of God.

   He will not judge you, dear Friend, by a lofty standard of knowledge. I
   have known persons who have thought, "If that convert is not better
   instructed in the doctrines, he is no child of God." The Lord has some
   of His children whose heads are in a very strange state and if He first
   puts their hearts right, He afterwards puts their heads right. But for
   you and for me to say that a man is not a child of God because he does
   not know all that the advanced saints know, is a very wicked thing! I
   am sure that your little child, who cannot read or write, is pressed to
   your bosom, dear mother, with just as much affection as that brave son
   of yours who has just been winning the first prize at school. You do
   not say, "I will not love the little one because he is not a man" or,
   "I will not love my little daughter because she is not grown up to
   womanhood." Oh, no! The Lord loves the little ones. If you can say,
   "One thing I know, whereas I was blind, now I see,"

   you are taught of God! If you know these two things--yourself a sinner
   and Christ a Savior--you are scholar enough to go to Heaven!

   And the Lord Jesus Christ will not quench you by setting up a standard
   by which to measure your graces. It is not, "So much faith and you are
   saved. So little faith and you are lost." Oh, no! If you have faith as
   a grain of mustard seed it will save you. If you believe in Christ, you
   are saved! That woman who touched the hem of Christ's garment with her
   fingers and then tremblingly slunk back was truly healed--slight as her
   touch was! Even Simeon, who took the Savior up into his arms, and said,
   "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace," cannot more surely be
   said to have had a saving faith than that poor woman who came behind
   and touched the hem of the Master's garment!

   Come along, you little ones--you trembling ones! Be not afraid! Jesus
   will not quench you by any of these means. I will tell you what He will
   do with you and that is, instead of quenching you, He will protect you!
   He will blow upon you with the soft breath of His love till the little
   spark will rise into a flame! You young folks do not know what trouble
   some of us used to have 45 years ago, when we got up in the morning and
   had to strike a light in the old-fashioned way. There we were, with a
   flint and a steel--striking away in a tiresome manner till we spied a
   little spark down in the tinder--oh, such a little one--and then we
   gently tried to blow it into a flame! How we used to prize a spark on a
   cold, frosty morning, when our fingers were pretty well frozen! We
   never put out the sparks by shutting the lid on the top of the tinder,
   but we tried, if we could, to light our match.

   Now, the Lord Jesus Christ will blow softly upon you with His gentle
   Spirit. He will bring to your mind exceedingly great and precious
   promises. He will bring to you kind friends who shall tell you their
   experience and try to comfort you. I should not wonder, my dear
   Brother, that one of these days I shall hear you pray a strong, brave
   prayer! I should not wonder if you, before long, come forward and made
   an open profession! And if you have done so already, I feel pretty sure
   that you will honor it and grow stronger till, one day we shall say,
   "Who is that bold witness for Christ? Who is that burning and shining
   light?" He is the man who was once likened to the smoking flax!

   I have had the portraits of my two boys taken on their birthdays--from
   the first birthday till they were twenty-one. The first year the little
   fellows are sitting, two of them in one baby carriage. At 21 they are
   doing nothing of the sort-- they are men full-grown! Yet I can trace
   them all along, from the time when they were babes, till they became
   little boys, and then youths, and then young men! I should not have
   been pleased to have seen them wheeled about in the baby carriage for
   21 years! In that case, I would have thought myself a most unfortunate
   father. And so I do not want to have any of you remaining in spiritual
   infancy--we long to see you come to the fullness of the stature of
   perfect men in Christ Jesus!

   Life is precious, but we look for growth. A spark is fire, but we
   expect flame. Grace is priceless, but we long to see it daily increased
   by going on unto perfection! Despise not the day of small things, but
   advance to greater things than these. Be comforted, but not
   self-satisfied. Rest, but do not loiter. The table of the Lord is
   spread and it is a feast not for men, alone, but for babes in Grace.
   Come here, you that love the Lord, and you that trust Him, however
   feeble your trust. However faint your courage, come and welcome! My
   Lord's table is not for giants, only, but for infants, also. The viands
   are not strong meat, but bread and wine, fit food for the faint and
   feeble. Examine yourselves, you sincere tremblers, but do not let the
   examination end in your staying away! Rather, mark how the text says,
   "let a man examine himself, and so let him eat"--not, "so let him
   refrain from eating" Ho, you that hope in His mercy, your Lord invites
   you to His own feast of love! You may come and welcome! If you have
   come to Christ, Himself, by faith, come to His table and remember Him
   tonight. The Lord bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Elijah's Plea

   (No. 1832)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON NOVEMBER 9, 1884.

   "Let it be known that I have done all these things at Your word."
   1Kings 18:36.

   THE acts of Elijah were very singular. It had not been known, from the
   foundations of the earth, that a man could shut up the doors of the
   rain for the space of three years. Yet Elijah suddenly leaped upon the
   scene, announced the judgment of the Lord and then disappeared for a
   time. When he reappears, at the bidding of God, he orders Ahab to
   gather the priests of Baal and to put to the test the question as to
   whether Baal or Jehovah was, indeed, God. Bullocks shall be slain and
   laid upon the wood without fire--and the God who shall answer by fire
   shall be determined to be the one living and true God, the God of
   Israel. We might question within ourselves what right the Prophet had
   to restrain the clouds, or to put God's honor under test. Suppose the
   Lord had not willed to answer him by fire? Had he any right to make the
   Glory of God hang upon such terms as he proposed?

   The answer is that he had done all these things according to God's
   word. It was no whim of his to chastise the nation with a drought. It
   was no scheme of his, concocted in his own brain, that he should put
   the Godhead of Jehovah or of Baal to the test by a sacrifice to be
   consumed by miraculous fire. Oh, no! If you read the life of Elijah
   through, you will see that whenever he takes a step, it is preceded by,
   "The word of the Lord came unto Elijah the Tishbite." He never acts of
   himself--God is at his back. He moves according to the Divine will and
   he speaks according to the Divine teaching-- and he pleads this with
   the Most High--"I have done all these things at Your word; now let it
   be known that it is so."

   It makes the character of Elijah stand out, not as an example of
   reckless daring, but as the example of a man of sound mind! Faith in
   God is true wisdom--childlike confidence in the Word of God is the
   highest form of common sense. To believe Him that cannot lie and trust
   in Him that cannot fail is a kind of wisdom that none but fools laugh
   at! The wisest of men must concur in the opinion that it is always best
   to place your reliance where it will certainly be justified and always
   best to believe that which cannot possibly be false.

   Elijah had so believed and acted on his belief and now he naturally
   expects to be justified in what he has done. An ambassador never dreams
   that his authorized acts will be repudiated by his king. If a man acts
   as your agent and does your bidding, the responsibility of his acts lie
   with you--and you must back him up. It were, indeed, an atrocious thing
   to send a servant on an errand and, when he faithfully performed it to
   the letter, to repudiate your sending him. It is not so with God. If we
   will only trust Him as to do as He bids us, He will never fail us--and
   He will see us through, though earth and Hell should stand in the way!
   It may not be today, nor tomorrow, but as surely as the Lord lives, the
   time shall come when he that trusted Him shall have joy of his
   confidence.

   It seems to me that Elijah's plea is, to obedient saints, a firm ground
   for prayer. But to those who cannot say that they have acted according
   to God's Word, it is a solemn matter for question.

   I. To begin with, this is A FIRM GROUND FOR PRAYER. You are a minister
   of God, or a worker in the cause of Christ, and you go forth and preach
   the Gospel with many tears and prayers. You continue to use all means
   such as Christ has ordained--do you say to yourself, "May I expect to
   have fruit from all this?" Of course you may! You are not sent on a
   frivolous errand! You are not bid to sow dead seed that will never
   spring up! But when that anxiety weighs heavily upon your heart, go to
   the Mercy Seat with this as one of your arguments, "Lord, I have done
   according to Your Word. Now let it be seen that it is even so. I have
   preached Your Word and You have said, 'It shall not return unto Me
   void.' I have prayed for these people and You have said, 'The effectual
   fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much'-- let it be seen that
   this is according to Your Word."

   Or, if you are a teacher, you can say, "I brought my children in
   supplication before You and I have gone forth, after studying Your
   Word, to teach them, to the best of my ability, the way of salvation.
   Now, Lord, I claim it of Your Truth that You should justify my teaching
   and my expectations by giving me to see the souls of my children saved
   by You, through Jesus Christ, Your Son." Do you not see that you have a
   good argument if the Lord has set you to do this work? He has, as it
   were, bound Himself by that very fact to support you in the doing of it
   and if you, with holy diligence and carefulness, do all these things
   according to His Word, then you may come with certainty to the Throne
   of Grace and say unto Him, "Do as You have said. Have You not said, 'He
   that goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come
   again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him'? Lord I have done
   that! Give me my sheaves. You have said, 'Cast your bread upon the
   waters, for you shall find it after many days.' Lord, I have done that
   and, therefore, I entreat You fulfill Your promise to me." You may
   plead in this fashion with the same boldness which made Elijah say in
   the presence of all the people, "Let it be known this day that You are
   God in Israel and that I have done all these things at Your word."

   Next, I would apply this teaching to a whole Church. I am afraid many
   Churches of Christ are not prospering. The congregations are thin, the
   Church is diminishing, the Prayer Meeting scantily attended, spiritual
   life low. If I can conceive of a Church in such a condition which,
   nevertheless, can say to God, "We have done all these things at Your
   Word," I should expect to see that Church soon revived in answer to
   prayer! The reason why some Churches do not prosper is because they
   have not done according to God's Word. They have not even cared to know
   what God's Word says! Another book is their standard. A man is their
   leader and legislator, instead of the inspired Word of God. Some
   Churches are doing little or nothing for the conversion of sinners. But
   any man, in any Church, who can go before God and say, "Lord, we have
   had among us the preaching of the Gospel and we have earnestly prayed
   for the blessing. We have gathered about Your minister and we have held
   him up in the arms of prayer and faith. We have, as individual
   Christians, sought out, each one, his particular service. We have gone
   forth, each one, to bring in souls to You, and we have lived in
   godliness of life by the help of Your Grace. Now, therefore prosper
   Your cause," shall find it a good plea!

   Real prosperity must come to any Church that walks according to
   Christ's rules, obeys Christ's teaching and is filled with Christ's
   Spirit! I would exhort all members of Churches that are in a poor way
   just now, to see to it that all things are done at God's Word--and then
   wait hopefully in holy confidence. The fire from Heaven must come--the
   blessing cannot be withheld!

   The same principle may be applied, also, to any individual Believers
   who are in trouble through having done right. It happens often that a
   man feels, "I could make money, but I must not, for the course proposed
   would be wrong. Such a situation is open, but it involves what my
   conscience does not approve. I will rather suffer than I will make gain
   by doing anything that is questionable." It may be that you are in
   great trouble distinctly through obedience to God. Then you are the man
   above all others who may lay this case before the Most High--"Lord, I
   have done all these things at Your Word and You have said, 'I will
   never leave you nor forsake you.' I beseech you interpose for me."
   Somehow or other God will provide for you. If He means you to be
   further tried, He will give you strength to bear it, but the
   probabilities are, that now He has tested you, He will bring you forth
   from the fire as gold--

   "Do good and know no fear,

   For so you in the land shall dwell,

   And God your food prepare,"

   Once again. I would like to apply this principle to the seeking sinner.
   You are anxious to be saved. You are attentive to the Word of God and
   your heart says, "Let me know what this salvation is and how to come at
   it, for I will have it whatever stands in the way." You have heard
   Jesus say, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate." You have heard His
   bidding, "Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that which
   endures to life eternal." You long to enter the strait gate and eat of
   the meat which endures. You would give worlds for such a gift! You have
   spoken well, my Friend. Now, listen--you cannot have Heaven through
   your doings, as a matter of merit. There is no merit possible to you,
   for you have sinned and are already condemned! But God has laid down
   certain lines upon which He has promised to meet you and to bless you.
   Have you followed those lines? For if you have, He will not be false to
   you!

   It is written--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved"--can
   you come before God and say, "I have believed and have been baptized"?
   Then you are on firm pleading ground. It is written again--"Whoever
   confesses and forsakes

   his sins shall have mercy." When you have confessed them and forsaken
   them, you have a just claim upon the promise of God and you can say to
   Him, "Lord, fulfill this Word unto Your servant, upon which You have
   caused me to hope. There is no merit in my faith, or my baptism, or my
   repentance, or my forsaking of sin--yet as You have put Your promise
   side by side with these things, and I have been obedient to them--I now
   come to you and say, 'Prove Your own Truth, for I have done all these
   things at Your Word.'" No sinner will come before God, at last, and
   say, "I trusted as You bid me trust and yet I am lost!" It is
   impossible! Your blood, if you are lost, will be on your own head--you
   shall never be able to lay your soul's damnation at the door of God. He
   is not false--it is you that are false You see, then, how the principle
   can be applied in prayer--"I have done these things at Your Word;
   therefore, O Lord, do as You have

   said."

   II. We shall go a little over the same ground while I ask you to put
   yourselves through your paces by way of SELF-EXAMINATION as to whether
   or not you have done all these things at God's Word.

   First, let every worker here who has not been successful answer this
   question--Have you done all these things at God's Word? Come. Have you
   preached the Gospel? Was it the Gospel? Was it Christ, you preached, or
   merely something about Christ? Come. Did you give the people bread, or
   did you give them plates to put the bread on and knives to cut the
   bread with? Did you give them drink, or did you give them the cup that
   had been near the water? Some preaching is not Gospel--it is a knife
   that smells of the cheese, but it is not cheese. See to that matter.

   If you preached the Gospel, did you preach it rightly? That is to say,
   did you state it affectionately, earnestly, clearly, plainly? If you
   preach the Gospel in Latinized language, the common people will not
   know what it means--and if you use great big academy words and
   dictionary words, the market people will be lost while they are trying
   to find out what you are talking about. You cannot expect God to bless
   you unless the Gospel is preached in a very simple way. Have you
   preached the Truth of God lovingly, with all your heart, throwing your
   very self into it, as if, beyond everything, you desired the conversion
   of those you taught? Has prayer been mixed with it? Have you gone into
   the pulpit without prayer? Have you come out of it without prayer? Have
   you been to the Sunday school without prayer? Have you come away from
   it without prayer? If so, since you failed to ask for the blessing, you
   must not wonder if you do not get it!

   And another question--Has there been an example to back your teaching?
   Brothers, have we lived as we have preached? Sisters, have you lived as
   you have taught in your classes? These are questions we ought to answer
   because, perhaps, God can reply to us, "No, you have not done according
   to My Word. It was not My Gospel you preached--you were a thinker and
   you thought out your own thoughts--I never promised to bless your
   thoughts, but only My revealed Truth! You spoke without affection. You
   tried to glorify yourself by your oratory--you did not care whether
   souls were saved or not." Or suppose that God can point to you and say,
   "Your example was contrary to your teaching. You looked one way, but
   you pulled another way." Then there is no plea in prayer, is there?
   Come, let us alter. Let us try to rise to the highest pitch of
   obedience by the help of God's Spirit--not that we can merit
   success--but that we can command it if we do but act according to God's
   bidding! Paul plants and Apollos waters--but God gives the increase!

   And now let me turn to a Church and put questions to that Church. A
   certain Church does not prosper. I wish that every Church would let
   this question go through all its membership--do we, as a Church,
   acknowledge the Headship of Christ? Do we acknowledge the Statute Book
   of Christ--the one Book which, alone and by itself, is the religion of
   a Christian? Do we, as a Church, seek the Glory of God? Is that our
   main and only objective? Are we travailing in birth for the souls of
   the people that live near us? Are we using every Scriptural means to
   enlighten them with the Gospel? Are we a holy people? Is our example
   such as our neighbors may follow? Do we endeavor, even in meat and
   drink, to do all to the Glory of God? Are we prayerful? Oh, the many
   Churches that give up their Prayer Meetings because prayer is not in
   them! How can they expect a blessing? Are we united? Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, it is a horrible thing when Church members talk against one
   another and even slander one another as though they were enemies rather
   than friends! Can God bless such a Church as that? Let us search
   through and through the camp, lest there be an Achan, whose stolen
   wedge and Babylonian garment, hidden in his tent, shall bind the hands
   of the Almighty so that He cannot fight for His people. Let every
   Church see to itself in this.

   Next I speak to Christian people who have fallen into trouble through
   serving God. I put it to them, but I want to ask them a few questions.
   Are you quite sure that you served God in it? You know there are men
   who indulge crotchets, whims and fancies. God has not promised to
   support you in your whims! Certain people are obstinate and will not
   sub-

   mit to what everybody must bear who has to earn his bread in a world
   like this. If you are a mere mule and get the stick, I must leave you
   to your reward. But I speak to men of understanding. Be as stern as a
   Puritan against everything that is wrong, but be supple and yieldable
   to everything that involves self-denial on your part. God will bear us
   through if the quarrel is His quarrel--but if it is our own
   quarrel--why, then, we may help ourselves! There is a deal of
   difference between being pig-headed and being steadfast. To be
   steadfast, as a matter of principle, in the Truth which is taught by
   God's Word is one thing--but to get a strange idea into your heads is
   quite another.

   Besides, some men are conscientious about certain things, but they have
   not an all-round conscience. Some are conscientious about not taking
   less, but they are not conscientious about giving less. Certain folks
   are conscientious about resting on the Sabbath--but the other half of
   the command is, "Six days shall you labor"--and they do not remember
   that portion of the Law of God! I like a conscience which works fairly
   and impartially. But if your conscience gives way for the sake of your
   own gain or pleasure, the world will think that it is a sham and they
   will not be far from the mark! But if, through conscientiousness, you
   should be a sufferer, God will bear you through. Only examine and see
   that your conscience is enlightened by the Spirit of God.

   And now to conclude. I want to address the seeking sinner. Some are
   longing to find peace, but they cannot reach it. I want them to see
   whether they have not been negligent in some points so that they would
   not be able to say with Elijah, "I have done all these things at Your
   word."

   Do I need to say that you cannot be saved by your works? Do I need to
   repeat it over and over again that nothing you do can deserve mercy?
   Salvation is the free gift of God. But this is the point. God will give
   pardon to a sinner and peace to a troubled heart on certain lines. Are
   you wholly on those lines? If so, you will have peace. But if you have
   not that peace, something or other has been omitted. To begin with, the
   first thing is faith. Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
   God? Do you believe that He has risen from the dead? Do you trust
   yourself wholly, simply, heartily, once and for all, with Him? Then it
   is written--"He that believes in Him has everlasting life." Go and
   plead that! "I have no peace," says one. Have you unfeignedly repented
   of sin? Is your mind totally changed about sin so that what you did
   once love you now hate--and that which you did once hate you now love?
   Is there a hearty loathing, giving up and forsaking of sin?

   Do not deceive yourself! You cannot be saved in your sins--you are to
   be saved from your sins. You and your sins must part, or else Christ
   and you will never be joined. See to this! Labor to give up every sin
   and turn from every false way, otherwise your faith is but a dead faith
   and will never save you. It may be that you have wronged a person and
   have never made restitution. Mr. Moody did great good when he preached
   restitution! If we have wronged another, we ought to make it up to him.
   We ought to return what we have stolen, if that is our sin. A man
   cannot expect peace of conscience till, as far as in him lies, he has
   made amends for any wrong he has done to his fellow men. See to that,
   or perhaps this stone may lie at your door and because it is not rolled
   away, you may never enter into peace.

   It may be, my Friend, that you have neglected prayer. Now, prayer is
   one of those things without which no man can find the Lord. This is how
   we seek Him and if we do not seek Him, how shall we find Him? If you
   have been neglectful in this matter of prayer, you cannot say, "I have
   done all these things at Your word." May the Lord stir you up to pray
   mightily and not to let Him go unless He blesses you! In waiting upon
   the Lord, He will cause you to find rest for your soul.

   Possibly, however, you may be a Believer in Christ and you may have no
   peace because you are associated with ungodly people. You may go with
   them to their follies and mix with them in their amusements. You see,
   you cannot serve God and Mammon! Thus says the Lord, "Come out from
   among them: be you separate: touch not the unclean thing, and I will be
   a Father unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the
   Lord Almighty." I know a man who sits in this place--he is probably
   here tonight. And concerning him I am persuaded that the only thing
   that keeps him from Christ is the company with which he mingles. I will
   not say that his company is bad in itself, but it is bad for him--and
   if there is anything that is right in itself, yet if to me it becomes
   ruinous, I must give it up.

   We are not commanded to cut off warts and excrescences, but Jesus bids
   us cut off right arms and pluck out right eyes--good things in
   themselves--if they are stumbling blocks in our way so that we cannot
   get at Christ. What is there in the world that is worth keeping if it
   involves me in the loss of my soul? Away with it! Therefore many things
   which are lawful to another, perhaps to you may not be expedient
   because they are injurious. Many things cause no harm to the

   bulk of men and yet to some one man they would be the most perilous
   things and, therefore, he should avoid them. Be a law to yourselves and
   keep clear of everything that keeps you away from the Savior.

   Perhaps, however, you say, "Well, as far as I know, I keep out of all
   evil associations and I am trying to follow the Lord." Let me press you
   with a home question--will you be obedient to Jesus in everything?--

   "For know--nor of the terms complain-- Where Jesus comes He comes to
   reign."

   If you would have Christ for a Savior, you must also take Him for a
   King. Therefore it is that He puts it to you, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." Will the baptism save me? Assuredly not, for
   you have no right to be baptized until you are saved by faith in Jesus
   Christ! But remember, if Christ gives you the command--if you accept
   Him as a King--you are bound to obey Him! If, instead of saying, "Be
   baptized," He had simply said, "Put a feather in your cap," you might
   have asked, "Will putting a feather in my cap save me?" No, but you are
   bound to do it because He bids you! If He had said, "Put a stone in
   your pocket and carry it with you"--if that were Christ's command--it
   would be necessary that you take the stone and carry it with you! The
   less there seems to be of importance about a command, often the more
   hinges upon it.

   I have seen a rebellious boy, to whom his father has said, "Son, pick
   up that stick. Pick up that stick." There is no very great importance
   about the command and so the youth sullenly refuses to obey. "Do you
   hear, Son? Pick up that stick." No. He will not. Now, if it had been a
   great thing that he had been told to do--something that was somewhat
   beyond his power--it would not have been so clear an evidence of his
   rebellion when he refused to do it! But when it is but a little and
   trifling thing and yet he refuses to obey--it glaringly shows his
   rebellion! Therefore, I lay great stress upon this--you who believe in
   Jesus Christ should do according to His Word. Say, "Lord what would You
   have me do? Be it what it may, I will do it, for I am Your servant."

   I want you, if you would be Christ's, to be just like the brave men
   that rode at Balaclava--

   "Yours not to reason why; Yours but to do and die" if it need be, if
   Jesus calls you to do it. Be this your song--

   "Through floods and flames if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes."

   That kind of faith which at the very outset cries, "I shall not do
   that, it is not essential"--and then goes on to say, "I do not agree
   with that and I do not agree with the other"--is no faith at all! In
   that case it is you that is master--and not Christ. In His own house
   you are beginning to alter His commands. "Oh," says one, "but as to
   baptism--I was baptized, you know, a great many years ago, when I was
   an infant." Oh really? You have heard of Mary when her mistress said,
   "Mary go into the drawing room and sweep it and dust it." Her mistress
   went into the drawing room and found it dusty. She said, "Mary, did you
   not sweep the room and dust it?" "Well, Ma'am, yes I did--only I dusted
   it first and then I swept it."

   That was the wrong order and spoiled the whole! And it will never do to
   put Christ's commands the other way around, because then they mean
   nothing! We ought to do what He bids us, as He bids us, when He bids us
   and in the order in which He bids us! It is ours simply to be obedient
   and when we are so, we may remember that to believe Christ and to obey
   Christ is the same thing--and often in Scripture the same word that
   might be read, "believe," might be read "obey." He is the Author of
   eternal salvation to all them that obey Him--and that is to all them
   that believe on Him! Trust Him, then, right heartily and obey Him right
   gladly!

   You can then go to Him in your dying hour and say, "Lord, I have done
   all these things at Your Word. I claim no merit, but I do claim that
   You keep Your gracious promise to me, for You cannot run back from one
   Word which You have spoken."

   God bless you, Beloved, for Christ's sake. Amen and amen.

A Proclamation from the King of Kings

   (No. 1833)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 5, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON OCTOBER 16, 1884.

   "Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you
   backsliding Israel, says the Lord; and I will not cause My anger to
   fall upon you: for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not remain
   angry forever. Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have
   transgressed against the Lord your God, and have scattered your ways to
   the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice,
   says the Lord." Jeremiah 3:12,13.

   BACKSLIDERS are very many. Departing from the living God is no strange
   thing. Every Church has to lament many that turn aside. In fact, it has
   become so common in many Churches, that they have not faith enough to
   hold to the Scriptural doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints--as
   if the lack of perseverance in mere professors could alter the Truth of
   God that where the life and power of God are really in the soul, there
   it will abide and remain. Bitter are the disappointments which result
   from the apostasy of avowed disciples and the declension of true
   followers of the Lamb. We sow, but when we expect to reap, we fill not
   our bosoms with sheaves, for many of those who sprung up hastily from
   the stony ground are withered as soon as the sun has risen! The morning
   cloud charms us with the hope of rain, but it soon vanishes--the early
   dew gives us promise of moisture, but it is exhaled--and the earth is
   hot beneath our feet. Our hearts ache because of blighted hopes where
   we looked for blessed results.

   And not only is it a common thing for men who profess godliness and,
   for a while, run well, suddenly to turn aside, but even God's own
   people do not keep up the pace as they should! Many Christians are one
   while hot, another lukewarm and even cold. They are diligent and
   fervent today, but idle and indifferent tomorrow. There are still
   Galatians among us who seem, one way or another, to be bewitched with
   error. Even the best of Believers are not always at their best. Who
   among us has not had cause to make confession that he has not kept up
   to his first love at all times? Neither has his lamp been always
   clearly burning, nor has he, himself, been all through the night
   equally wakeful and watchful for the coming of the Lord. The wise
   virgins sleep as well as the foolish ones!

   Alas, that it should be so! Had it not been for the interposition of
   God's Grace, in many an instance, backslidings that have been healed
   might have been backslidings unhealed--and the gaping wound might have
   bled to the dreadful weakness of those who suffered from it. May God,
   in infinite mercy, help those of us who have been kept by His power
   until now, to rest in faith in Him--and may we be very careful that we
   slip not with our feet and decline not with our hearts! Nor let our
   earnestness end with self, but let us pray with all our might for those
   who have wandered upon the dark mountains, that they may not wander for
   another hour, but that at once, before this service is ended, they may
   be restored to the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls--and may find
   rest as once they used to find it--at the feet of Jesus Christ.

   Pray for me, that I may speak in the power of the Holy Spirit, so as to
   lead back benighted ones who are now stumbling upon the dark mountains.
   I feel deeply my need of such help and would breathe my own desire to
   God in the language of our sweet poetess--

   "O strengthen me, that while I stand Firm on the Rock, and strong in
   Thee, I may stretch out a loving hand

   To wrestlers within the troubled sea."

   I. I shall keep to the passage before us and we will commence with it
   at once and notice, first, in the text--THE PROCLAMATION. The Prophet
   receives this message--"Go and proclaim these words toward the north,
   and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says the Lord."

   It was to be a proclamation, for God is King, and if His subjects
   rebel, He does not lose the rights of His sovereignty. He sends them,
   therefore, a royal message with all the power which belongs to the word
   of a king. "Go and proclaim." It is meant to be a loud summons, such as
   a proclamation should be when the herald, in the name of his royal
   master, publishes a decree. "Go and proclaim." It is to be done in
   state, with order and regularity, with a purpose and with authority.
   And so do I wish to speak at this time. Hear me, O my Brothers and
   Sisters, while I plead with you in Christ's name! In the name of the
   Ever-Blessed, who has not lost His right to you, O Backslider, you are
   called upon to return! In His name, who is your Creator and your Lord,
   is the message sent to you, "Return unto Me." It is not delivered as a
   mere piece of advice from myself, personally, which you may treat as
   you like, because it comes from your friend and your equal--it comes
   from your God and your King, to whom you must give an account,
   by-and-by! It is not even sent as a simple word of advice from Him, but
   the majesty of God is at the back of it! At your peril it will be if
   you trifle with it! I pray you act not so presumptuously. It is a
   proclamation which demands that every ear should hear it and that every
   heart should bow before it. Only traitors will despise our message when
   the Lord says to us, "Go and proclaim these words, and say, Return."

   This proclamation is sent to the worst of sinners--to the very basest
   of backsliders! The proclamation is to be given publicly, but it was
   intended for a certain people and meant for their hearts as well as
   their ears. It was meant for those who have backslidden--and the house
   of Israel contained many jet-black backsliders! They were people who
   had gone aside after beholding the most glorious manifestations of God,
   for unto what people did the God of the whole earth ever reveal Himself
   as He did unto Israel, a people that had been delivered by the plagues
   of Egypt, that had drunk of water from the Rock and had been fed upon
   angels' food--a people in the midst of whom the peculiar Presence of
   God had been revealed? He had ransomed them, fed them, led them and
   taught them--and they had been singularly indulged-- and yet, for all
   that, they had turned aside from the living God!

   They were a provoking nation of backsliders because they turned aside
   to the basest idols. After knowing something of Him who is invisible,
   they made a golden calf and said, "These are your gods, O Israel"--and
   in later years they bowed themselves before the lowest and most
   degrading shapes of idols. They went after the wickedness and the
   bestialities of the nations among whom they dwelt--and they defiled
   themselves so that God, who never speaks too harshly, said--"They went
   a whoring after the gods of the heathen." They broke their marriage
   bonds to the one living and true God and made themselves loathsome in
   His sight by the most detestable idolatries! It is sad that there
   should have been such a race of backsliders, but it is glorious to
   think that to such as these the message of God's mercy was sent! They
   were the lowest grade of backsliders--and if there are any here,
   tonight, who must be put in the same list, it is to them that the
   message of God's Grace and mercy is to be proclaimed! And I proclaim it
   in the name of Him that sent me!

   These backsliders were old offenders who had long been false to their
   vows and covenants. They went aside once and they were chastened--and
   they repented. But their hearts were not true and so, when the scourge
   was taken away, they went aside again and proved that deceit was bound
   up in their souls! Many a time did He forgive them and put back His
   wrath, but as often did they return to their provocations. Many and
   many a time did He smile upon them, again, in favor and forgive their
   transgressions, but they provoked Him unto jealousy yet more and more
   until He declared that they were bent to backslide from Him. It seemed
   to be the way of them. It was ingrained in their nature. "Israel is a
   backsliding heifer," says the Lord. They would not go aright--they
   would turn aside.

   Do I address any such in this discourse? O my Hearers, may the Lord
   deal graciously with you by my means, and my heart shall sing for joy!
   I am not going to enlarge upon any of these points of character, for if
   the Spirit of God is dealing with you, He will enlarge upon them. I
   have lately met with a considerable number over whom I have both
   sorrowed and rejoiced--I think of them, now, with mingled feelings
   because God is bringing them very low under a sense of their
   backsliding and I am hoping that this will be a blessing to them. The
   Lord is chastening them and I trust they will turn at His rebuke. Their
   sin, which was written with an iron pen upon the very horns of their
   altars, they did not see and would not see, but now He says they shall
   see and He is making them weep as they see! I know that some of you
   bleed with an inward wound at the heart, a wound which man cannot
   reach, which only God can heal. I am glad that it is so, for this will
   con-

   vince you that you shall not be at ease away from God--but that in
   wandering from Him into the far country there shall come a mighty
   famine for you and you shall begin to be in need. Oh, may your need
   drive you home to the great Father's House where the best of welcomes
   awaits you!

   The Israelite people were not only the worst kind of backsliders, but
   they had already reaped, in a very large measure, the result of their
   backsliding, for they had been carried away captive. They were taken
   away to the north country by the king of Assyria, far off from the land
   of promise which flowed with milk and honey! They were bondslaves under
   the cruellest of oppressors. They had suffered the loss of all things
   because they had departed from their God and yet they had not learned
   the lesson which affliction was meant to teach them. It was still
   necessary to call them to repentance and God bade them return to
   Him--His proclamation was to them!

   I have known men to come down from wealth to poverty through their sin.
   I have known them fall from health and happiness to disease and misery.
   I have seen them brought down from honorable associations to
   degradation and shame wholly as the result of their departing from the
   living God! While they walked with Him, all went well with them. But
   when they walked contrary to Him, He began to walk contrary to them.
   There are some who hear me, at this moment, who know the meaning of
   that text, "The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways."
   They have sinned and they have smarted--and in the smart this thought
   has come to their mind, "He will never forgive me. He has beaten me
   with the blows of a cruel one. He has set me for the target of all His
   arrows; His arrows drink up the blood of my soul. I am sorely wounded
   and broken in the place of dragons."

   Yes, so was Israel carried away by Shalmaneser and yet they were bid to
   return unto God with a promise of mercy! Captives and poverty-stricken,
   they sat down and wept when they remembered Zion--and then came this
   royal proclamation of reconciliation upon repentance. From the Throne
   of God, where they might have expected condemnation and the sentence of
   death, there came this mission, this word, this message, "Go and
   proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding
   Israel, says the Lord."

   I see some mercy, and that of no little kind, in the messenger who was
   sent to deliver this message, for it was Jeremiah, that man of a broken
   spirit, who could say of himself, "I am the man that has seen
   affliction." Somehow, your bright-eyed joyous spirit astonishes the
   backslider into greater grief. "Alas," he cries, "such joy I might have
   known, but I put it all aside!" Such reflections deepen the poor
   sinner's woe. Moreover, the man that has never been emptied from vessel
   to vessel and has had no experience of the bitterness of sin is too apt
   to speak proudly, or, at least, harshly and severely, to a wandering
   brother. He does not sufficiently remember himself, lest he, also, is
   tempted. But as for Jeremiah, his eyes were red with weeping and his
   cheeks were guttered by his burning tears! And when he spoke, there was
   a depth of pathos about every word--thus he was qualified to meet
   mourning souls upon their own ground.

   How he longed for men to come back to God who had chosen them! How
   pathetically he exclaimed, "Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a
   fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
   daughter of my people!" And God selected this man that he might go
   after the smitten ones and proclaim in stately manner, blended with
   womanly tenderness, this message, "Return." I do not feel so fitted as
   Jeremiah and yet I have an intense desire that any of you who have gone
   away from God would come back while I speak with you. The Lord knows
   how this has burdened me of late, for I cannot bear it that you who
   have sunned yourselves in His smile should choose darkness! That you
   who once rejoiced in Christ and gloried in His Cross, should now be
   crucifying Him afresh and putting Him to an open shame!

   Here is a huge world that "lies in the Wicked One" and we need all our
   time to try and enlighten it and, meanwhile, you that are our camp
   followers and, as we thought, our fellow soldiers, have put away your
   swords and gone over to the enemy! At least you act as if you had, and
   it pains us! It pains us at the heart! Hear, then, at this hour, the
   proclamation which we will give forth as best we can, looking in your
   direction if you have gone up to the north, and proclaiming these words
   towards your place, your cold and shivering place, your place of
   darkness and of misery, your place in the far-off country. I say, we
   look anxiously and yet hopefully in your direction and proclaim these
   words to you, "Thus says the Lord, Return!"

   So far concerning the proclamation.

   II. But now, secondly, in our text we find A PRECEPT. It is a very
   simple one and as short as it is clear. It is given in the
   proclamation--"Return, you backsliding Israel." Return--be as you were.
   Come back--repent and do your first works. O Wanderer, return to your
   God! You have forgotten Him. You have transgressed against Him and you
   have

   grieved Him exceedingly. For these months you have not sought Him, nor
   called upon Him. You have not trusted Him nor confided in Him. You have
   not loved Him, nor sought His honor. Return! You can never be right if
   you stay where you are! All ills attend the man who forsakes His God.
   Come back--back to the old place of humiliation in His Presence, of
   confession, of childlike faith, of holy consecration--come back to the
   happy place which was yours when you were in your best estate! Yes,
   further back than that--back nearer to God than ever you were before!
   Return unto your God!

   Listen! This is the precept--return to your Savior! Just as you are,
   come back to Him. Come back as you came at first, with your sin
   acknowledged, looking to His Cross for pardon! Did you grow too great
   and think you could live without your Savior? Return! Did you dream of
   being so perfect that you did not need His righteousness, for your own
   would suffice? Away with that glittering bauble, that idle notion of
   your perfection, and come back and beat upon your breast, and say, "God
   be merciful to me, a sinner!" Repent of your pride and return, again,
   to your Lord Jesus Christ. He will as gladly receive you as a mother
   presses to her bosom a lost child. The road is paved for your return,
   the stumbling blocks have been removed, the door of the Father's House
   is open wide!

   Come yet again and receive pardon and cleansing from the precious blood
   of Jesus. It has not lost its power! The fountain of cleansing is open,
   not only for the common sinner, but for you, the backslider, for
   remember how the Scripture has it, "A fountain opened to the house of
   David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem." It is open for those who
   are already in the Church of God, as well as for those who are newly
   brought into it! Come at once and tarry not! If your feet are foul with
   your wandering through the mire and through the slough, your Savior
   takes the towel, yet again, and fills the basin from the ewer and
   stoops to wash your feet! Will you not have them washed at this moment
   till He can say to you, again, "You are clean every whit"? You have
   once been washed in the atoning blood and you need not now except to
   wash your feet--and when this is done, all is well! Go and wash your
   brethren's feet in gratitude. "When you are converted, strengthen your
   brethren."

   You see, then, dear Friends, how the Lord puts it to you. "Return," for
   where you lost your roll there you will find it. Mr. Bunyan pictures
   his pilgrim dropping his passport under the seat in that arbor at the
   bottom of the Hill Difficulty, or half way up it, where he sat down to
   rest--but where he did not only rest, but fell into a sinful slumber.
   Under that very settle, whereon you sat and went to sleep, you will
   find the roll which you must carry in your bosom to secure you a
   welcome at the Palace Beautiful! You must go back and look for your
   spiritual enjoyment where you lost it. Did you lose it by neglect of
   prayer? Then search the closet through. Did you lose it by a dusty
   Bible? Dust that Bible and search its pages till you find it. Did you
   lose it by neglect of the means of Grace? Were your Sabbaths wasted and
   week-night services neglected? Then go back, I say again, to the place
   where, by your sin, you allowed your holy confidence to slip from
   you--and there you will find it again. The point at which you diverged
   from the right road is the point that you must find and come back to.
   "Repent, and do your first works," is the Master's call to you tonight!
   It is His royal proclamation, "Return, you backsliding Israel."

   But listen while I make this proclamation, again, in God's name. Return
   at once. Delays are always dangerous, but never so dangerous as when
   they are proposed by backsliders. Return without another day's
   indulgence in sin! The message tolerates no further backsliding. Come
   back at once! Wait not for second thoughts--your prompt, immediate
   thoughts are best. And come you back with all your heart. Let there be
   no mimic repentance; no pretended returning. You shall find the Lord if
   you seek Him with all your heart and all your soul. God help you to do
   it now!

   And mind that you return practically. That is, that your life shall be
   changed, your idols broken, your omitted duties fulfilled with
   eagerness, neglected means of Grace pursued with fervor--that done
   which you have left undone and that evil forsaken into which you have
   gone with such headlong folly. When the Lord says, "Return," He does
   not mean, "Think about returning; promise to return; talk about your
   wandering" and all that--He means that you should practically come back
   to Him with weeping and with supplication, with a true heart believing
   in the Lord Jesus Christ and beginning again.

   "Alas," says one, "I do not know whether I am a backslider, or whether
   I have been a hypocrite up till now!" Do not argue that question at
   all. I am constantly asked to decide for people whether they ever were
   true Christians or were in error about their condition. It is a
   difficult enquiry and of small practical value. I say to myself,
   sometimes, "Well if I never was a child of God, I know that I am a
   sinner, and Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners--and so I
   will at once trust in Him." Thus I recover confidence. If ever I was a
   child of God, then I am a child of God and He will bring

   me back. But if I never was a child of God and my profession was all a
   mistake, yet still the free salvation sounds out its silver trumpet--

   "Come, and welcome, Sinner, come,"

   and I hasten to accept the invitation! You can discuss the question of
   your previous character after you get back into the fold. But while you
   are out of it, it does not matter much to you. You had better leave
   such discussions till you are out of the reach of the wolf. In all
   probability it would be impossible for you to discover your precise
   condition--but, O poor Soul, this is clear enough, that the Lord cries
   to you, "Return, you backsliding Israel!"

   This precept is clear as noon-day, and it is sent to you. Come back
   with the whole of your nature, in all ways and respects, back to your
   God and back to your Savior--and back to prayer, and back to holy
   living, and back to the people of God--back to the very Church from
   which you have wandered! It will be wise to do that before another sun
   has risen. Come back to the Lord's Supper, back to feeding spiritually
   upon His flesh and upon His blood and living only in Him, and by Him,
   and to Him, and with Him! God help you to hear this precept and to turn
   it into practical effect!

   III. Now, listen, in the third place, to THE PROMISE--"Return, you
   backsliding Israel, says Jehovah, and I will not cause My anger to fall
   upon you." "I will not cause My anger to fall upon you." See that
   anger, like a black cloud, charged not with refreshing rain, but with
   fire flakes that shall burn as they fall--yes, burn their way into the
   very core of your being as with the fires of Hell! A sense of wrath is
   Hell setting the soul on fire till conscience flames with its own
   peculiar fierceness and seems to anticipate the fire that never can be
   quenched. You see that gathering storm around you, do you not?

   But here is the fair promise, "Return, and I will not cause My anger to
   fall upon you." Not a flake of it shall burn you if you return unto
   your God. There is forgiveness, there is full, free and immediate
   forgiveness to be had! "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
   transgressions, and as a cloud, your sins. Return unto Me." This is a
   grand motive for coming back--the sin that separates is put away! He
   will wash you thoroughly from your iniquity and cleanse you from your
   sin and whatever you need, He will give to you--and He will not upbraid
   you. When the father received the prodigal, did he remind him of his
   ingratitude, or of his wasting of his substance? Not a word of it--he
   kissed away the memory of his wrong-doing! He covered him with a robe
   of righteousness and he put a new song into his mouth. The Lord is
   prepared to do that with you at this moment!

   I know that your doubts and fears ask the question again and again,
   "Can it be possible?" All things are possible with God and especially
   all deeds of mercy! His mercy endures forever and He delights in it! I
   know that you say, "Oh, but does the promise mean me, even me?" It
   means you, even you! You are a backslider! You plead guilty to the
   charge and, therefore, it is to you that the promise is given. Accept
   the mercy! The man that is condemned by that description-- the
   "backslider"--is the man who is commanded to return and he is the man
   to whom the promise is made, "I will not cause My anger to fall upon
   you." In all this you can see yourself as in a mirror!

   I find that the passage might be read, "I will not cause My face to
   fall upon you," meaning this--that if the child of God comes back, God
   will not look angry at him any more. This is a very great blessing, for
   when the Lord does not lay chastisement upon His people by way of
   judgment and wrath, yet He does often hide His face from them, or
   frowns upon them like a cruel one. If you have sinned, God cannot smile
   upon you! He must chasten you. His own words are, "you only have I
   known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for
   all your iniquities." You are a child and, therefore, you must be
   whipped if you do wrong--love ensures you the chastisement. "As many as
   I love, I rebuke and chasten."

   But the great Father, here, shows that He will not continue to frown on
   you--He will not make His face to fall at the mention of you. He has
   said, "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for My
   anger is turned away from them." He might justly say, "you are My
   child, but I cannot speak comfortably to you, for you are so
   disobedient that I must send you to a distance and make you feel the
   evil of disobedience." But, instead of that, He says, "I will not cause
   My anger to fall upon you. I will not even cause my face to fall at the
   sight of you; but I will receive you graciously; I will, in tender
   mercy, put away your transgressions and reveal My love to you." "Come
   now, and let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are as
   scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool." Will you not come to Him, when He
   speaks thus?--

   "Return! O erring, yet beloved!

   I wait to bind your bleeding feet, for keen

   And rankling are the thorns where you ha ve been.

   I wait to give you pardon, love, and rest.

   Is not My joy to see you safe and blest?

   Return! I wait to hear once more your voice

   To welcome you anew, and bid your heart rejoice."

   A woman has a husband who has loved her as his own, but she has lent
   her ear to a serpent--to one who with words of flattery has beguiled
   her, and she has sinned against her fidelity. She has defiled herself
   with another and she has gone away, far away--and the man who has
   deceived her has forsaken her. She is now a woman of a sorrowful
   spirit, broken down and cast off. A friend whispers to her, "Return to
   your husband, for it was better with you then, than now." But this is
   her stumbling block--"Will he receive me? Can he receive me? I have
   dishonored him. Will he take me back? Can I expect the love that
   gladdened my girlish days to be lavished upon me again? Will he not
   call me an outcast and say that I have darkened his house and shall
   never enter it again?"

   But if the message comes to her, "He will receive you graciously and
   love you freely," will she not hasten home? When she learns that the
   anger which he felt is gone and that his heart yearns towards her, will
   she not fly home as on the wings of the wind? Unless she has become a
   monster of wantonness, she will seek the man whom she has grieved and,
   at his feet she will fall in gratitude for his forgiveness! The parable
   is concerning ourselves who have backslidden from the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Shall we not, also, return, now that we hear Him thus inviting
   us to come back--yes, making a royal proclamation of His Grace?
   "Return, you backsliding Israel, says the Lord; and I will not cause My
   anger to fall upon you." The Lord grant that this word may go home to
   those whom He has ordained to bless.

   IV. I pass on, in the next place, fourthly, to notice THE ARGUMENT. The
   argument here used is twofold and you will recollect the two arguments
   all the more readily because they begin with the same letter--Mercy and
   Marriage. We have, in the 12th verse, "For I am merciful, says the
   Lord." And in the 14th verse, "For I am married unto you."

   Here is, first, God's mercy. Nothing delights God more than to forgive
   sin--He is at home in this blessed work! To some men it is a hard task
   to forgive an injury. They do it with a squeeze, a twist and a
   wrench--and even then it is questionable if it is done at all, for
   forced forgiveness is no forgiveness. Some are not unlike the dying man
   who said to the priest, "If I die, you will remember that I forgive Pat
   Maloney, but if I live, I'll pay him back as soon as I can." Many
   forgive because they cannot revenge--their virtue is the result of
   their inability to be vicious. But, with God, it is His nature to
   forgive--He is Love--and mercy is a drop from the honeycomb of love.
   God must be just, but to punish is His left-handed labor, while to
   forgive is His right-handed work. He is happy at it! He finds pleasure
   in man's turning to Him and finding life.

   Mercy was His last-born attribute. Until sin came there was no room for
   mercy--the mercy that forgives and, therefore, mercy is God's Benjamin,
   the son of His right hand and He delights to give to it 10 times as
   much as to His other attributes when they feast together. It is
   written, "He delights in mercy," but I never read that He delights in
   justice, or delights in wisdom, or delights in power--He delights in
   mercy! God is charmed when He can wash a scarlet sinner white. It is
   the Heaven of His Heaven to receive a Hell-black sinner to His heart
   and put away his sin. "I am merciful," says the Lord.

   Did I hear a trembling voice exclaim, "Oh, but you do not know what I
   have done, Sir"? No, and, "Sir," does not want to know! But then I do
   know that the Lord delights in mercy! Perhaps you had better not tell
   those midnight deeds, those sins that have defiled you through and
   through--the confessional is by no means a healthy place--the smell of
   it is putrid! Confess to God--not to me! You have lain in the dye till
   you are soaked and saturated in sin. You are ingrained with the scarlet
   of iniquity, but the Lord delights to take out these glaring stains!
   Things which are impossible with man are the joy of God. Therefore come
   to Him and believe in His mercy! Doubt no longer, but lovingly receive
   what He lovingly gives.

   As for you who once knew Him, loved Him and rejoiced in Him, I want you
   just to dwell on that second argument, namely, marriage. "For I am
   married unto you, says the Lord." Oh, those were blessed days when you
   used to sing--

   "'Tis done, the great transaction's done! Iam my Lord's, and He is
   mine. He drew me, and I followed on

   Charmed to confess the voice Divine." And then you used to join with
   all of us in singing--

   "Happy day! Happy day!

   When Jesus washed my sins away " Ah, poor Soul, where have you been
   since then? You have been where you ought not to have been and now your
   Bridegroom says, "Return, for I am married unto you. You may have put
   off the ring, but you are Mine for all that, and I will have you come
   back to Me. Return." The bonds that Christ makes are not to be broken.
   The favor that Christ has shown is not to be removed. Stronger than
   death and Hell is the love of Christ and who shall separate us from it?
   Notwithstanding all your sins and iniquities, He says, "Return, for I
   am married unto you, says the Lord." It is done and though you do not
   stand to it, He does! The great transaction still stands on His
   part--though you believe not, He abides faithful!

   He has bought you with His blood and the price will never return into
   His veins. He has loved you with an everlasting love and, therefore, it
   cannot cease! In that love He will always rest, nor from His oath
   return. Come back to Him!--

   "Return! O fallen, yet not lost!

   Can you forget the life for you laid down,

   The taunts, the scourging, and the crown of thorns?

   When o ver you first My spotless robe I spread

   And poured the oil of joy upon your head,

   How did your wakening heart within you burn!

   Can you remember all, and will you not return?

   Return! O chosen of My lo ve!

   Fear not to meet your beckoning Savior's view;

   Long before I called you by your name, I knew

   That very treacherously you would deal;

   Now I have seen your ways, yet I will heal.

   Return! Will you yet linger far from Me?

   My wrath is turned away, I have redeemed thee." V. And I finish (for
   time has failed me) by noticing THE ADVICE that He here gives as to how
   we are to return. He says, "Only acknowledge your iniquity." "Oh," you
   have said, "I cannot get back to God--it is such a long way back to
   Him. I feel that I have to set myself right and in that process to pass
   through a world of sorrow." Yet the Lord says, "Only acknowledge." I
   rejoice in those blessed, "onlys" of the Bible! "Only acknowledge your
   iniquity." "Alas, I have so wandered!" Acknowledge it! "But I have done
   it so many times!" Acknowledge it! "But I have wandered against light
   and knowledge!" Acknowledge it! It is not a hard thing to do, to get to
   your chamber and, before God, confess your fault. You have, first of
   all, to have a knowledge of it and then to acknowledge it. Feel your
   sin and then confess it. Be convinced of it and then plead guilty at
   the Judgment Seat. Do not attempt to excuse it, or to make apologies
   for it. As long as you do so, you will never get peace--but let this
   perilous stuff be purged from your soul by a clear, plain
   acknowledgment, such as David made when he said, "Deliver me from
   blood-guiltiness." He had tried to call his crime by other names, but
   his forgiveness came when he admitted that it was murder! When we know
   our sin, God will make us to know His Grace--but if we are
   self-righteous, our pride will be our ruin.

   "What am I to acknowledge?" Acknowledge chiefly three things. Your
   breach of covenant--that you have transgressed against Jehovah your
   God. You professed to be a child of God, a member of Christ, a temple
   of the Holy Spirit and you have been false to all these avowals. You
   have broken your vows, you have been false to your Baptism, false to
   your communion at the Lord's Supper, false to your Church membership,
   false to your prayers. Go and tell the Lord all this and acknowledge
   that you have transgressed against Jehovah your God.

   Next acknowledge your greedy sin--that you "have scattered your ways to
   the strangers under every green tree." Israel had sinned wherever she
   had an opportunity--sinned openly. You would not have thought that she
   would have dared to do it--sinned again and again till as many as there
   were trees in the grove were her adulteries with idol gods! Confess
   this crime if it is, indeed, true--"Lord, I have sinned with both hands
   since I have departed from You. I have committed sins of the eyes, sins
   of the feet, sins of the hands, sins of the head and sins of the
   heart--sins against Your holy Law, sins against Your love and blood,
   sins immense and innumerable. I might as well hope to count the drops
   that make the ocean as to tell the number of my sins." Make this
   confession heartily and explicitly. Do not stutter over it and

   try to lessen it, but bring it straight out in deep humility. As a
   backslider you have done far more evil than you know and there is no
   fear of your exaggerating your guilt!

   And I finish with this--"You have not obeyed My voice, says the
   Lord.''" That is to say, you have been guilty of sins of omission. This
   is sufficient to swamp any one of us! Our sins of commission may be
   few, but as for our omissions, these would sink me, I know, past all
   hope, were it not for the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. Dear
   Friend, hasten to acknowledge your omissions.

   Confess also your hardness of heart. God has spoken and you would not
   hear. He has entreated and you would not regard Him. He has come very
   near to you and you have turned your back on Him. Thus He complains of
   you, "I have spoken and you would not hear. You have not obeyed My
   voice."

   Confess, also, your ingratitude. His voice, which is your Father's
   voice, you have not heard or obeyed. What unnatu-ralness! Shall a wife
   not know her husband's voice? Shall a brother forget his brother's? Yet
   it is so with some of you who once used to be with us--you were our joy
   and we were your joy--and God the joy of us both but you have gone
   aside. You have left your first love. You have departed from the ways
   of the Lord. Yet remember at this moment there is no judgment for
   you--no threats, no scolding words--simply this, "Only return." The
   heart of love has room in it for you! Hasten home to Him who is your
   only resting place. You can never be happy where you are and as you
   are. You have tried it! Oh, how long you have tried it, but you are
   going downward and waxing worse and worse!

   Oh, that you would say, "I will end it! I will end it! Never more will
   I depart from Him who has redeemed me with His blood. I will yield
   myself to Him at once." Happy is the preacher if this has been effected
   by the Spirit of God. Happy shall you be, also, and happy are these
   Christian folk to know that such a thing has been done in their midst.
   God bless you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

To Lovers of Jesus--an Example

   (No. 1834)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 12, 1885,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON NOVEMBER 2, 1884.

   "She has worked a good work for Me." Mark 14:6.

   THIS holy woman had displeased the disciples. She must have been very
   sorry to do that. She would not have willfully grieved the least
   servant of her Lord. But she did so without the slightest blame on her
   part--it was the unexpected consequence of a most blessed action and
   the fault lay with those who complained of her holy deed--not with her.
   I do not know whether all the disciples felt grieved, but we are told
   by Matthew that, "they had indignation," and he seems to speak of them
   as a body, from which I gather that those who love Jesus much must not
   measure their conduct by that of Christ's ordinary disciples. Indeed,
   it might fare ill with them even if Apostles became their judges! They
   must not tone down the fervor of their zeal to the lukewarmness of the
   general order of Christian men. They must not measure the consecration
   of their lives by the little which many professors present upon the
   altar to God. No, my Brother, or Sister, you must not be too much
   distressed if the best of the household misjudge you, for it has
   happened to many favored sons before you.

   You, O man, greatly beloved, can not abide to be lukewarm, but be not
   surprised if the lukewarm cannot agree with you! Count it no strange
   thing if, in your ardor, you should come to be accused of fanaticism,
   lack of prudence, rashness, forwardness. Do not break your heart over
   it if they should even call you mad, or suspect that you have more zeal
   than knowledge, for Mary, whom we would be glad to imitate, came under
   this kind of censure! And David, and your Lord, the Son of David, were
   each thought to be madmen!

   This honored woman performed a notable act which is to be rehearsed
   wherever the Gospel is preached and yet, she thereby stirred the wrath
   of the brotherhood of the disciples--of how small account is the
   judgment of men!

   Chiefly, she called down upon her head the censure of Judas. As far as
   Judas was known to his brethren, he was reckoned among the best of
   them. They never suspected him of playing the traitor or they would not
   have approved of his being their treasurer--they once had indignation
   at James and John--but the shrewd Judas had their respect. I should
   think he was the most businesslike man of the whole company--which is
   not saying much for business, is it? He was a leading spirit among that
   little band. He was one who would be selected because of his
   prudence--and that is not saying much for prudence, is it?

   Doubtless Judas abounded in that cool, calculating shrewdness which
   makes a man fit to deal with moneys and purchases. He had far more
   business ability than impetuous Peter, or affectionate John, or
   thoughtful Thomas. He was the right man in the right place, if he had
   but happened to have been an honest man. Wonderful it was that he could
   conceal the deep meanness of his spirit from all his fellows during the
   years in which they lived together. But he had done so and, therefore,
   his opinion carried weight with it. Among the Apostles the censure of
   Judas meant the calm condemnation of a judicious person. His judgment
   was not what you and I would esteem it to be, for we should think
   nothing of his censure, now, because we know that he betrayed his
   Lord--but the disciples could not foresee this--and, in their judgment,
   that which Judas would condemn must be very censurable. At least it
   must not be businesslike; it must lack common sense; it must be
   imprudent and wasteful. Was not Judas the perfect model of economy? Was
   he not the sort of man who, in these days, many a father would point
   out to his boy as an example? Hear him say, "Boy, if you want to get on
   in the world, imitate Judas Iscariot. He is the model man. He is a
   Christian and yet he has a keen eye for his own advantage and is a
   sharp man of business."

   It was a hard thing for a timid woman to bear such a censure from one
   so highly respected in the college of Apos-tles--but she had this
   solace, which I will guarantee you put quite out of her mind all care
   about the censure of disciples, even of the biggest of them--she
   pleased her Master! She could see, by the very look of Him, that He
   accepted what His followers condemned. She knew in her conscience that
   she had the approbation of the Lord, even though she had the
   disapprobation of the servants. And oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us
   always carry our case into the highest court and live before the Lord
   and not as the slaves of men! If we are conscious that we have
   sincerely done what we have done as unto the Lord and if we feel sure
   that He has approved our service, it is of the smallest possible
   consequence what men shall say about us! Let us never provoke our
   Brothers and Sisters to be ill-tempered with us, neither let us do
   anything that can be rightly censured--but if we have gone somewhat
   beyond common custom in the fervor of our spirit, let us reply with
   young David to his envious brethren, "Is there not a cause?" The
   opinions of other men are no rule to us--we have our own obligations to
   discharge and, as our debt of love is larger than usual, let us take
   liberty to be as full of love and zeal as we can be--only regretting
   that we cannot go still further in the way of sacred service.

   "Well," says one, "but do those who love Christ encounter the frowns of
   men at this time?" Oh, yes, and of their own Christian Brethren, too!
   If you consort with the common Brethren and travel on the road to
   Heaven so slowly that it is a question whether you are going there at
   all, then you will escape criticism! If you keep with those who
   practice the snail's march, they will call you a good, easy man--a
   right respectable person! But if you run for it. If you put out all the
   energy of your nature and are determined to live at a high pitch for
   Christ, you will get the cold shoulder, even from many of His
   disciples, for you will be practically condemning their
   half-heartedness--and who are you to be such a troubler in Israel?

   The more prudent among your Brethren will say that your pride and the
   naughtiness of your heart make you so forward and presumptuous--and
   they will try to put you down, or put you out! You cannot commit a
   greater crime against some people than to be more useful than they are!
   When a person reckons himself to be the standard of holiness, he looks
   upon one who excels him as guilty of a kind of blasphemy. If you outrun
   others, do not reckon upon smiles, but count upon black looks. You will
   be called impudent and thought impertinent. Bear it all and fret not!
   Go to your Lord and tell Him that you have done and are doing all you
   can as unto Him and entreat Him to smile upon you. Crave His acceptance
   of your poor doings and then go about your business, working till He
   shall come. Sow the seed of duty and care not whether, in human
   judgment, it shines or rains. "He that regards the clouds shall not
   reap." If you regard not the clouds at all, you will do your sowing and
   your reaping with the comfort of true faith--and God will bless you.

   I am going to talk about this blessed woman at this time with this
   hopeful desire--that you and I may imitate her ever-memorable example.
   I shall have nothing to say but to open up the meaning of our Lord, as
   far as I know it, when He said, "She has worked a good work for Me,"
   or, "in Me." The passage might be rendered thus--only the translators
   do not like to use the term--"She has worked a beautiful work for
   Me"--a comely work. "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." This was a
   thing of beauty which is a joy forever to the Church of God, in that
   constant memorial of her which is blended with the preaching of the
   Gospel of Christ, for as long as the Gospel is proclaimed, this Mary of
   Bethany shall have a memorial because of what she did. What was there
   beautiful about her work--the breaking of the alabaster vase, and the
   pouring out of the liquid nerd? What was there beautiful about that? I
   will try to show you.

   I. There were seven beauties in it and the first and chief beauty,
   perhaps, was that IT WAS ALTOGETHER GLORIFYING OF JESUS. She meant,
   when she poured that ointment on His head, to honor Him personally--
   every drop of it was for Him, out of reverence for His actual
   personality.

   She was not so much thinking of His deeds of love, or of His words of
   Truth, as of His own unrivalled and most precious Self. She had seen
   His deeds of love when Lazarus was raised. She had heard His Words of
   Truth when she sat at His feet. But now she felt an adoring reverence
   for His thrice blessed Person and she brought that box of precious
   spikenard and offered it to Him as her Teacher, her Friend, her Lord,
   her All. Suggestion was made that she should have sold it and given it
   to the poor, but she longed to present one offering to Him, direct, and
   not by any roundabout method. Doubtless she was not behindhand in her
   gifts to the poor, but she felt that when she had done that, she had
   not satisfied the cravings of her grateful heart towards Him who had
   become poorest of the poor for her sake.

   She wanted to give something to Him--something suitable for such an One
   as she conceived Him to be--something suitable for the time and
   circumstances then present with regard to Him. I think this holy woman
   knew more about our Lord than all His Apostles put together! Her eyes
   had peered within the veil. You remember that only a day or two after

   this, He rode in triumph through Jerusalem a proclaimed King. Should He
   not first be anointed? And who would visibly anoint Him to the kingdom
   with oil but this consecrated woman? She was come to give Him a royal
   anointing preparatory to His proclamation in the streets of His capital
   city! At any rate, her spikenard must be poured out only for Him. She
   forgot the poor, just then, as she quite forgot the disciples. Martha
   was busy at the table waiting upon them all, disciples and Master, but
   Mary had concentrated all her thoughts on Jesus. She "saw no man save
   Jesus only." Blessed exclu-siveness of vision! What she did must not be
   for Peter and James and John with Jesus, but it must be for Him, alone,
   who indeed is alone, above and beyond all others, worthy of a homage
   all His own! Because she had a love for Him beyond all others that she
   had ever heard of, her heart must find expression in a deed of love
   which must be entirely, wholly, only towards Himself.

   Now, this is, as we have read the text, a beautiful thing. It will be
   beautiful on your part and mine if, having taken care of the poor
   according to our ability, having discharged the claims of our
   relationships to our fellow men, we then feel that we must do something
   for Jesus--distinctly for our Lord. Do you ask me what you shall do for
   Him? Yes, but, Sister, I must not tell you--your own heart must
   originate the thought, as your own hand must carry it out. "Oh," cries
   a Brother, "tell me what I can do for Jesus!" Yes, but, Brother, I must
   not tell you! The better part of the whole matter will lie in the
   hallowed ingenuity of your spirit in inventing something for Him out of
   your own fervent soul. The holy woman's deed would have been somewhat
   spoiled if there had been a command for her to bring the alabaster box
   and pour the ointment on His head--her love commanded her--and that was
   better than a formal precept. Her deed had not possessed half its worth
   if Simon had suggested to her, "I have not sufficient spikenard to
   anoint our guests. Fetch a box from your home." The very glory of it
   lay in the spontaneous suggestion of her own heart that she must do
   something which should be all for Jesus.

   She must do it herself, personally, and not by proxy. And she must do
   it unto Him distinctly, directly, openly. Others might smell the
   spikenard. That she did not wish to prevent, but still, the perfume was
   never meant for them, but for Him exclusively. She poured it on His
   head. She poured it on His feet. She would anoint Him from head to foot
   with this token of her intense and reverent gratitude and her boundless
   love. She felt wrapped up in Him, her Lord and her God, and so her
   willing offering was for Him and for Him, alone. What a joy to be
   permitted to do anything for Him whose great love holds us fast! I feel
   as if I would gladly, at once, retire from all of you to indulge my
   heart in this rare luxury.

   Alas, good Lord, how little have You of this devotion in these
   calculating days! Instead of, "all for Jesus," how seldom we do
   anything for Jesus! Brothers and Sisters, when you sing your hymns, do
   you "sing a hymn to Jesus"? When you are in prayer, do you pray to
   Jesus and for Jesus? Is it not written, "Prayer, also, shall be made
   for Him continually, and daily shall He be praised"? When you come to
   this communion table, I pray that you may forget all that are with you
   in this assembly and cry, "I will remember Fou." In the chief place, at
   any rate, let Jesus fill your thoughts. Set Him, alone, upon the
   Throne, and think only of eating His flesh and drinking His blood--and
   receiving Him into your very self, that there may be a vital union
   between the Christ of God and your own souls.

   To my mind this is the beauty of our fellowship in the Holy Supper,
   that we feed only on Jesus. Let us make Him our soul's sole meat and
   drink--and then let us live for Him. My heart craves, now, to know what
   I shall do that I may imitate her who gave to "Jesus only" that box of
   spikenard, very costly. Oh, you lovers of my Lord who have been washed
   in His precious blood, who owe your all to Him, think of His matchless
   beauties, now, and as you look up into that face where shines your
   Heaven, think to yourselves, "What can we do for Him--for Him
   absolutely, directly and personally?" There is the first beauty of this
   woman's act of homage--it was for Jesus, for Jesus only, for Jesus
   wholly.

   II. A second beauty lay in this, that IT WAS AN ACT OF PURE LOVE,
   altogether of love to Jesus. The other woman--blessed was she, also,
   among women--I refer to that woman who was a sinner--she also came and
   brought an alabaster box and did much the same thing as this Mary of
   Bethany. But she did what Mary did not do--she mingled weeping with her
   ointment--she washed His feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs
   of her head. That was a beautiful act in its own way, but Mary's deed
   is a beautiful thing in another way. In this lies the
   distinction--there does not seem to have been, in Mary's act, any
   remembrance of personal sin, though, doubtless, that feeling was in her
   heart and had brought her to the higher stage of adoration of her
   pardoning Lord. Her sin was put away long ago.

   Mary had sat at Jesus' feet and had chosen the good part. The matter of
   pardon for sin had been transacted a long while before and now,
   although in her heart there is deep gratitude for it, and for the
   raising of her dear brother, Laza-

   rus, yet it seems to be quite absorbed in the deeper thought of her
   soul, for she had attained to an all-consuming love of Jesus. She never
   would have known that kind of love if she had not learned to sit at His
   feet. To sit long, there, has a wonderful operation on the human
   mind--it causes even things that are good in themselves to be
   overshadowed by matters that are less and less in relation to self. It
   is a blessed thing to love Christ because we escape from Hell by Him.
   It is a blessed thing to love Christ because He has opened the Kingdom
   of Heaven to all Believers. But it is a still higher thing to forget
   yourself and to contemplate with delight the ineffable perfections of
   Him whom Heaven and earth acknowledge to be chief among 10,000 and
   altogether lovely! "We love Him because He first loved us." Here we
   begin and this beginning always remains, but on it we pile tier after
   tier of precious stones of love which are crowned with pinnacles of
   inexpressible affection for the great Lord, Himself! He in Himself has
   won our hearts and carried our spirits by storm! And now we must do
   something which will express our love to Him. That love is not only a
   gratitude for benefits received from Him, but an intense affection for
   His glorious, adorable Person.

   Come, dear Friends, do you feel that kind of emotion in your hearts at
   this time? Do you, even now, feel that so perfectly has Christ won the
   verdict of your understanding, so completely has He bound, in silken
   fetters, every movement of your affections that you need to be doing
   something which shall have but this one aim--to express your love to
   Him who has made you what you are? Indulge the emotion! Crown it with
   action and continue it through life! In this point be not slow to be
   imitators of the sister of Martha and Lazarus. O sweet love of Jesus,
   come and fill our souls to the brim and run over in delicate personal
   service!

   III. The third beauty of the action was that IT WAS DONE WITH
   CONSIDERABLE SACRIFICE. There was an expense about it and that of no
   trifling character to a woman who was neither queen nor princess. I
   shall always feel obliged to Judas for figuring up the price of that
   box of costly nerd. He did it to blame her, but we will let his figures
   stand and think more of her for his calculations. I would never have
   known what it cost, nor would you, either, if Judas had not marked down
   in his pocket-book that it, "might have been sold for much." How he
   grudged that, "much"! He calculated the value at 300 pence. He did well
   to put it in pence, for his sordid soul reveled in small moneys which
   make up the pounds. Pence, indeed, when the expense is for Him to whom
   the silver and the gold belong!

   Yet I like his calculation in pence, for it is suggestive, since a
   Roman penny was a day's wages. Take a day's wages now--say 4s--and you
   get some £60. It was a large sum of money for a woman in her state of
   life in Bethany. It was £10 of their money, but money, then, was of a
   different value from what it is now, and it was a great sum for her to
   expend in one single deed of love. Her gift was costly, but the Lord
   Jesus deserved to be served at the best rate and at the highest cost.
   There was a woman who served the Lord at a higher rate than this--she
   only spent two mites in the doing of it, but then, you know it was all
   that she had. I do not know how much Mary had, but I feel persuaded
   that it was pretty well all she had and that all she could get together
   seemed to her to be far too little for the Lord Jesus Christ!

   If His head was to be anointed, plenty of ordinary oil might have been
   procured at Bethany. The Mount of Olives was close by. But she would
   have scorned the thought of pouring common olive oil on Him--she must
   find an imperial ointment such as Caesar might have accepted! If Jesus
   is to be anointed, there is nerd to be bought in the bazaars at
   Jerusalem at a very reasonable rate. Why must you, Mary, seek after
   this liquid ointment of the East, this oil distilled from myriads of
   roses, of which it needs leagues of gardens to make a drop? Why must
   you buy the "very precious" nerd and spend such a large amount of money
   upon that which will only last half an hour, and then the wind will
   have carried it away, and its perfume will have vanished?

   Yes, but the glory of service to Christ is to serve Him with the best
   of the best! He deserves, if we serve Him with sermons, that we preach
   the best discourses mind can frame or tongue deliver! Or if we serve
   Him with teaching in the class, He deserves that we teach in the most
   tender fashion and feed His lambs with the best nourishment! Or if we
   serve Him with the pen, that we write not a line that may need to be
   erased! Or if we serve Him with money, that we give with liberality of
   the best we have and much of it! We must see to it that in everything
   we do not serve Christ with the lean sheep of the flock, or with such
   as are wounded, broken, or torn by beasts--but that He has the fat of
   our offerings! We should not be content, if we are rich, to give Him
   out of our estate the cheese-parings and candle-ends such as we dare
   not keep back for very shame.

   Usual donations have little beauty in them--those moneys dragged out of
   people by importunity--that guinea dribbled out by custom because it is
   a respectable amount. There is nothing to satisfy love in the slender
   oblations which

   come forth like an unwilling taxation--which a miser could scarcely
   withhold. But oh, to give to the Lord Jesus freely, richly, whatever it
   is with which He has entrusted us, whether it is gold or genius, time
   or words--whether it is the minted coinage of the purse, or the living
   courage of a loving heart, or the labor of an earnest hand! Let us give
   our Well-Beloved the best we have and He will call it beautiful! Mary's
   gift was all for Him and all for love. And it was done at great expense
   and, therefore, it was beautiful.

   IV. Next, remember that part of the beauty of Mary's action lay in
   this, that IT WAS DONE WITH PREPARATION. We are told by John what we
   should not, otherwise, have known, "Against the day of My burying has
   she kept this." "Kept this." It was not that seeing Jesus there at the
   feast and being seized with a sudden thought, she rushed back to her
   stores and fetched out the little vase of spikenard--and broke it in a
   passion of affection which, in cooler moments, she might regret. Far
   from it! She was now consummating the long thought of weeks and months.
   We have known warm-spirited Brothers and Sisters both say and do and
   give grandly, under a certain spur and impulse, what they would never
   have thought of doing when they entered into the assembly.

   I shall not blame them. Rather do I commend them for obeying gracious
   impulses, but it is not the best way of doing service to our
   ever-blessed Master. Passion seldom gives so acceptably as principle.
   Mary did not perform a thoughtless action under a tempestuous force of
   unusual zeal. No, she had kept this. She had kept this choice ointment
   on purpose till a fitting time should come for putting it to its most
   appropriate use. My own belief is that when she sat at Jesus' feet, she
   learned much more than any of the disciples had ever gathered from His
   public preaching. She had heard Him say that the Son of Man would be
   delivered to the scribes and Pharisees and that He would be spat upon
   and scourged--and they would put Him to death and the third day He
   would rise again--and she believed it. She thought it over and she
   studied it--and made out more of the meaning of it than any one of the
   Apostles had done.

   She said to herself--He is going to die as a Sacrifice at the hands of
   wicked men and I will, therefore, render Him special honor. I should
   not wonder if she began to read the Old Testament with that light,
   "This is He whom God has sent, upon whom He has laid the iniquities of
   us all, and He shall be given up to judgment, and He shall bear the sin
   of man." Then she thought within herself, "If that is so, I will get
   the spikenard ready to anoint Him for His burial." Perhaps she intended
   as much as that, for so the Lord, Himself, interpreted the deed. At any
   rate, she thought, "Alas, for my Lord! If He dies, He will need to be
   embalmed and I will be ready to aid in His burial." Therefore she kept
   this.

   "Against the day of My burying has she kept this." Brothers and
   Sisters, there is great beauty in an action which is the outcome of a
   long time of loving, careful consideration. It is ill to delay a good
   deed which might be done at once, but if a deed must be delayed, it is
   well to be doing it at once by preparing for it. When a person feels,
   "The time is not yet, but I will be prepared when it does come," it
   shows that the heart is occupied with a love of a very engrossing
   character. We sing--

   "Oh, what shall I do My Sa vior to praise?"

   And it were well if the question were constantly in our minds. Let each
   man resolve in his heart--"I will not offer my Lord the hasty fruit of
   impulse, or that which shall cost me nothing, but I will consider what
   I can do for Him. Of what will there be a need? In what direction can I
   do Him homage where He might lack that honor? I will turn it over and
   meditate and consider--and then I will perform."

   This last the preacher would repeat with emphasis, for oh, my Brothers,
   it is a custom with many of us to get a grand thought and then, as we
   turn it over, to let it evaporate without its leaving even a drop of
   practical result behind! This holy woman was no mere planner and
   purposer, but a doer of holy deeds! She could keep her alabaster box as
   long as was prudent and yet she did not arrive at the tempting
   conclusion to keep it altogether. She allowed her heart to weigh the
   project and the more she weighed it, the more resolved she became to do
   it--to do it when the due time came. When she believed that the hour
   had come, she did not delay for an instant! She was as prompt as she
   had been thoughtful. The Passover was drawing very near. It was within
   six days and so she brought out what she had held in reserve. Blessed
   are the punctualities of service which are the result of earnest
   endeavor to honor the Lord in the best possible way!

   There is something beautiful in seeing, as we have seen, some poor
   woman saving her little bits and putting them by for years till she
   could accomplish a secret purpose by which Jesus would be glorified. It
   is striking to see, as you and I did see, a woman of moderate wealth
   discarding all the comforts of life, that she might save enough that
   there might be an

   orphanage in which children might be cared for--not, as she said, for
   the children's sake--but for Christ's sake, that He might be glorified.
   The Stockwell Orphanage is the alabaster box which a devout woman
   presented to her Lord! Her memory is blessed. Its perfume is recognized
   in all parts of the earth at this moment, to the glory of the Lord she
   loved.

   Such a thoughtful deed is what Jesus would call a beautiful thing. Let
   us abound in such beautiful things! For a man to say, "There will come
   a crisis when I shall have to stand out for God and His Truth and it
   will be a serious loss to me." And then to ponder it so as to be almost
   eager for the occasion is a beautiful thing. To feel like the Lord
   Jesus, "I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straitened
   till it is accomplished!" is a beautiful thing. A courageous,
   self-sacrificing decision for the Truth of God is a beautiful thing,
   when its action is well considered and carried out with enthusiasm. God
   give us to mix thought and impulse, reason and affection, and thus
   serve Him both with the mind and the heart!

   V. There is a fifth point of beauty. MARY DID HER GREAT DEED WITHOUT A
   WORD. Dear Sisters, you will pardon me for commending this holy woman
   for her wise and fitting silence all through her gracious act. She did
   not talk about it beforehand. She said not a word while she did it and
   she said nothing afterwards. Martha was the worker and the talker, too,
   but I think that all you will find Mary saying is, "Lord, if You had
   been here, my brother had not died." And she was so scant of words that
   she had to borrow those from Martha. Martha said a great deal more than
   that, but Mary was quite satisfied to be as brief as possible. She was
   a great thinker, a great sitter at Jesus' feet and a great learner--but
   not a great talker. When the time came, she was a great worker, for it
   is very curious, though Martha bears the palm for work in our ordinary
   talk, yet Mary, the thinker, did more than Martha, the worker!

   "She," said Christ, "has worked a good work for Me," which He never
   said of Martha, good as Martha was. He censured, a little, the elder
   sister for being cumbered with much serving. But Mary's work He
   commended and decreed that it should be remembered as long as the world
   stands. Though she does not bear the name of a worker in the vulgar
   judgment, yet is she the queen in the kingdom of good works! Yet, I
   remind you, she did not say a word. There is such a thing as spoiling
   what you do by making so great a fuss, before you do it, that when the
   mouse is born, people are only astonished that such a small creature
   should be the only fruit of the dreadful throes of the mountain!
   Moreover, there is such a thing as talking so much afterwards of what
   we have done that it spoils it all. It seems as if we must let all the
   world know something about ourselves--whereas the joy and bliss of it
   all is not to let yourself be seen, but to let the oil go streaming
   upon the Master till He is anointed with perfume and we, ourselves,
   sink back into our natural insignificance. Silent acts of love have
   musical voices in the ears of Jesus! Sound no trumpet before you, or
   Jesus will take warning and be gone!

   If we could all do more and talk less, it might be a blessing to
   ourselves and, perhaps, to others. Let us labor in our service for the
   Lord to be more and more hidden! As much as is the proud desire to
   catch the eye of man, let us endeavor to avoid it. "I should like to
   know," says one, "how to do holy work." Go and do it and consult not
   with flesh and blood! "I have done my work and now I should dearly like
   to hear what you think of it." You should rise above such idle
   dependence upon man's opinion! What matters it to you what your fellow
   servant thinks? To your own Master you stand or fall! If you have done
   a good thing, do it again! You know the story of the man who comes
   riding up to the captain, and says, "Sir, we have taken a gun from the
   enemy." "Go and take another," said the matter-of-fact officer. That is
   the best advice which I can render to a friend who is elated with his
   own success!

   So much remains to be accomplished, that we have no time to consider
   what has been done. If we have done holy service, let us do it a second
   time and do it a third time--and continue to do it, always praying the
   Lord to accept our persevering service. In any case, let our
   consecrated life be for our Lord's eyes, only, a spring shut up, a
   fountain sealed! Anything like sounding a trumpet before us is hateful
   to the lowly Lord! Secrecy has a charm for Jesus and the more carefully
   we preserve it, the better.

   VI. Next, and sixthly, there was this beauty about the action of
   Mary--that SHE DID IT IN REFERENCE TO OUR LORD'S DEATH. The Disciples
   shrank from thinking of that sad subject. Peter said, "That be far from
   You, Lord." But Mary, bearing her Master's heart very near her own, and
   sympathizing with Him in His glorious enterprise, instead of drawing
   back from the thought of that death, performed her work in connection
   with it. I am not certain to what degree she was conscious that it was
   so, but there is the fact--the anointing had reference to the burial of
   the Lord. It seems to me that the best and most tender duty that
   Christians do for their Lord Jesus is that which is touched with the
   blood-mark--which bears the stamp of the Cross.

   The best preaching is, "We preach Christ crucified." The best living
   is, "We are crucified with Christ." The best man is a crucified man.
   The best style is a crucified style--may we drop into it! The more we
   live beholding our Lord's unutterable griefs and understanding how He
   has fully put away our sin, the more holiness shall we produce. The
   more we dwell where the cries of Calvary can be heard, where we can
   view Heaven, earth and Hell all moved by His wondrous pas-sion--the
   more noble will our lives become! Nothing puts life into men like a
   dying Savior! Get close to Christ and carry the remembrance of Him
   about you from day to day and you will do right royal deeds.

   Come, let us slay sin, for Christ was slain. Come, let us bury all our
   pride, for Christ was buried. Come, let us rise to newness of life, for
   Christ has risen. Let us be united with our crucified Lord in His one
   great objective--let us live and die with Him and then every action of
   our lives will be very beautiful.

   VII. The seventh beauty, to my mind, is this--you may think it a little
   far fetched, but I cannot help mentioning it,

   for it touches my heart. I believe that MARY HAD, IN THIS ANOINTING OF
   THE SAVIOR, SOME LITTLE

   GLIMPSE OF HIS RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD and of His later existence.
   For I would ask of you--Why do nations at all embalm their dead? Why
   not consume them in the fire? A mysterious something makes the ordinary
   Christian shudder at the thought of cremation. That must surely be an
   acquired taste--unsophisticated Nature does not court the furnace, or
   covet the flame--we prefer to lie beneath the green hillock with our
   fathers. Many nations of antiquity, and especially the Egyptians and
   other Orientals, took great care to anoint the bodies of the departed
   with precious perfumes and to lay them asleep in gums and fine linen.

   Why? Because there darkly shone upon their minds some thought of the
   hereafter. There remained with man, long after the Fall, a glimmering,
   undefined belief in immortality. That truth was so universally received
   that the Old Testament takes it for granted. The existence of God and
   the immortality of the soul lie at the basis of Old Testament teaching.
   The after-life of the body was accepted, also, in a manner more or less
   clear. Immortality was not brought to light, but there it was, and they
   who reject that doctrine go back into a darkness denser than that in
   which the heathens, themselves, dwelt! Why did the Egyptian king embalm
   his father and lay him in spices, but that he thought that somehow or
   other there was another life and he would, therefore, take care of the
   body? They would not have wasted precious linen, gems and spices, if
   they had thought that the body was mere rottenness for worms to consume
   forever.

   Mary had deeper and clearer thoughts than that, for she expected that
   something would happen to that blessed body after Christ had died and
   she must, therefore, anoint it and bring the most precious spices that
   she could procure for His burial. At any rate, let your service of the
   Lord Jesus be the service of a risen Christ! Come not here to worship
   One who died years ago--a hero of the past--but come to adore the
   ever-living Jesus!--

   "He lives, your great Redeemer lives." He will certainly come in His
   own Person to reward His saints. And before He comes, He sees what you
   are doing. "We live," said one, "in the great Taskmaster's sight." I
   care not for that title. I have no Taskmaster! It is far more an
   impulse to my life that I live within the sight of Him whom, having not
   seen, I love, because He loved me and gave Himself for me! If this does
   not quicken you, what will? If this does not nerve you to tireless
   diligence in holy service, what can? Our Lord Jesus Christ lives! Let
   us find some way of anointing His dear and reverend head--some way of
   crowning Him who wore the crown of thorns for our sake! Ours it is to
   know that He lives and that we live in Him. On Him would we expend the
   full force of our being, counting it all joy to spend and to be spent
   for His sake.

   I am not going to stir you up, my fellow Christians, to do anything for
   Christ, for I fear to spoil the freeness of your love's life. I do not
   want to be pleading with you to enter into His service more fully, for
   the work of pressed men is never so much prized as that of happy
   volunteers. Yet as I love you, I would have you love your Lord more and
   more. It is so sweet to belong to Christ, that the more fully we can
   belong to Him, the more free we are! I like that saying of Paul, where
   he calls himself the doulos of Christ, the slave of Jesus! He says
   exultingly, "Let no man trouble me. I bear in my body the marks of the
   Lord Jesus," as if he gloried to think of himself as the branded slave
   of His Lord! He had been beaten and scourged and he retained upon his
   back the marks of his lashings and, therefore, he was known to say to
   him-self--and smile all the while--"these are my Master's marks. I am
   branded with His name." Oh, sweet service, in which if it were slavery
   it would be joy! I would not have a hair of my head that was not my
   Lord's if I could help it, nor a drop of my blood that did not flow for
   Him if I could help it. My liberty--and I speak for you all--my
   liberty, if I might

   choose it, would be liberty never to sin again; freedom to do Christ's
   bidding and that alone! I would gladly lose my free will in His sweet
   will and find it again as I never found it before in having yielded it
   up completely to His command!

   I will not, therefore, so much intrude upon the sanctity of your
   heart's love as to suggest what you can do for Jesus. As the best juice
   flows from the cluster with the least pressure, so shall the best
   service be that which is most spontaneous. Do not let me push you on,
   or draw you on, or drag you on--be eager on your own account! Say to
   the Lord, Himself, "Draw me: I will run after You." Have you not a
   certain private reason why you should love your Lord better than any
   other of His redeemed? I repeat it, I will not pry into your sacred
   secrets, but leave you to commune with your own heart and with your
   Lord. Only let us so love Him that when we look at Him, He shall say,
   "You have ravished My heart, My sister, My spouse; you have ravished My
   heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck." Then shall
   we know what to do for our Well-Beloved, and, what is better, we shall
   do it without further exhortation.

   There I leave it. May the Holy Spirit bless the word! As for you that
   do not love the Lord Jesus, God be merciful to you! I will not
   pronounce upon you an Anathema Maranatha, but I tremble lest it fall
   upon you. I am sorely grieved for your sakes. I am, moreover, sorely
   vexed for Christ's sake that He should be deprived of your love and
   service. What has He done that you should slight Him? Oh, blind eyes
   that cannot see His beauties, and deaf ears that cannot hear the charms
   of His voice! God be merciful to you and help you to trust your
   Savior--and then you will love Him for His salvation! It is no wonder
   that the saved ones love their Lord--it is a marvel that they do not
   love Him 10,000 times more! The Lord be with you for Christ's sake!
   Amen.

                              The Man Christ Jesus

   A Sermon

   (No. 1835)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, April 12th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [9]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Now consider how great this man was."--Hebrews 7:4.

   CONSIDER how great Melchizedek was. There is something majestic about
   every movement of that dimly-revealed figure. His one and only
   appearance is thus fitly described in the Book of Genesis,--"And
   Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the
   priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be
   Abram of the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy
   hand. And he gave him tithes of all." We see but little of him, yet we
   see nothing little in him. He is here and gone, as far as the historic
   page is concerned, yet is he "a priest for ever," and "it is witnessed
   that he liveth." Everything about him is on a scale majestic and
   sublime.

   "Consider how great this man was" in the combination of his offices. He
   was duly appointed both priest and king: king of righteousness and
   peace, and at the same time priest of the Most High God. It may be said
   of him that he sat as a priest upon his throne. He exercised the double
   office to the great blessedness of those who were with him; for his one
   act towards Abraham would seem to be typical of his whole life; he
   blessed him in the name of the Most High God. "Consider how great this
   man was" that he not only ruled his people with righteousness and
   brought them peace, but he was their representative towards God and
   God's representative to them; and in each character distributed divine
   blessings.

   "Consider how great this man was" in the power of his benedictions.
   Abraham had already been greatly blessed so much so that he is
   described as "he that received the promises." Yet a receiver of
   promises so great, a man with whom God had entered into solemn
   covenant, was yet blessed by Melchizedek, and without all contradiction
   the less is blessed of the better. This great man yet further blessed
   the blessed Abraham, and the father of the faithful was glad to receive
   benediction at his hands. No small man this: no priest of second rank;
   but one who overtops the sons of men by more than head and shoulders,
   and acts a superior's part among the greatest of them.

   "Consider how great this man was" in supremacy over all around him. He
   met Abraham when he was returning as a conqueror from the overthrow of
   the robber kings; and the victorious patriarch bowed before him and
   gave him tithes of the best of the spoil. Without a moment's hesitation
   the man of God recognized the priest of God, and paid to him the
   tribute of a subject to the officer of a great king. In Abraham's
   bowing all the line of Aaronic priesthood did homage unto Melchizedek;
   for as the apostle saith, "Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes
   in Abraham, for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek
   met him." So that all kings in Abraham, and all priests in Abraham, did
   homage unto this man, who, as king and priest, was owned to be supreme.
   "Consider how great this man was" when Paul had once proved that
   Melchizedek was greater than all other, at least to the Hebrews; for
   the seed of Abraham can recognize none greater than Abraham; and since
   Abraham by paying tithes acknowledges his subordination to Melchizedek,
   it is clear that the priest of the Most High God was the greatest of
   men.

   "Consider how great this man was" as to the singularity of his person,
   "without father, without mother, without descent": that is to say, we
   know nothing as to his birth, his origin, or his history. Even this
   explanation hardly answers to the words, especially when it is added,
   "Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life." So mysterious is
   Melchizedek that many deeply-taught expositors think that he was
   veritably an appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. They are inclined to
   believe that he was not a king of some city in Canaan, as the most of
   us suppose, but that he was a manifestation of the Son of God, such as
   were the angels that appeared to Abraham on the plains of Mamre, and
   that divine being who appeared to Joshua by Jericho, and to the three
   holy ones in the furnace. At any rate, you may well consider how great
   this man was when you observe how veiled in cloud is everything about
   his coming and going--veiled because intended to impress us with the
   depth of the sacred meanings which were shadowed forth in him. How much
   more shall this be said of him of whom we ask--

   "Thy generation who can tell,

   Or count the number of thy years?"

   "Consider how great this man was" in the specialty of his office. He
   had no predecessor in his priesthood, and he had no successor. He was
   not one who took a holy office and then laid it down; but as far as the
   historic page of Scripture is concerned we have no note of his quitting
   this mortal scene; he disappears, but we read nothing of his death any
   more than of his birth. His office was perpetual, and passed not from
   sire to son; for he was the type of "One who is made not after the law
   of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."

   "Consider how great this man was" in his being altogether unique. There
   is another "after the order of Melchizedek," the glorious Antitype in
   whom Melchizedek himself is absorbed; but apart from him Melchizedek is
   unique. Who can equal this strange, mysterious priest, prophet, king,
   sent of the Most High God to bless the father of the faithful? He is
   altogether alone: he receives no commission from the hands of men, nor
   from God by men; and he does not transmit to a successor what he had
   not received from a predecessor. Melchizedek stands alone: one mighty
   crag, rising out of the plain; a long Alp, whose brow is swathed in
   cloud sublime. "Consider how great this man was" but think not to
   measure that greatness.

   I shall leave you to that consideration; for my business this morning
   is not with Melchizedek, but with a greater than he. I shall take my
   text in its connection, but lift it up to a higher application. Beloved
   friends, if Melchizedek was so great, how much greater is that man whom
   Melchizedek represents! If the type is so wonderful what must the
   Antitype be! I invite you to consider "how great" is he of whom it is
   written, "The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou are a priest forever
   after the order of Melchizedek." I will not say "Consider how great
   this man was", for there is no verb: the "was" is inserted in italics
   by the translators. We are to consider "how great this man." Say "was"
   if you will, but read also "is," and "shall be." Consider how great
   this man was and is, and is to be, even the Man Christ Jesus.

   And first, this morning, let me exhort you to consider how great this
   man is: then let me assist you to consider how great this man is: and
   then let us practically improve our consideration of how great this man
   is, trying to turn it to holy account as the Holy Ghost may enable us.

   I. First, then, LET ME EXHORT YOU TO CONSIDER HOW GREAT THIS MAN, THE
   LORD JESUS CHRIST, is.

   This subject claims your consideration. I do not think it should be a
   matter of option with you whether you will now consider the greatness
   of your Lord or not; it is his due and right that you should consider
   his greatness. For he of whom we speak,--"this man," is one well known
   among us. If you be true to your profession he is one most dear to you,
   to whom you owe all things, aye, owe your very selves. He is one
   between whom and you there is a troth plighted: you are espoused unto
   him, your hearts are his, even as his heart is yours. If you do not
   consider him, who will? He has loved you, and given himself for you.
   Strangers may listen to our teaching at this time, and in vain we may
   cry,

   "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?

   Is it nothing to you that Jesus should die?"

   But you are no stranger, you are not even a guest in his house, but you
   are a child living at home with him. He is your brother, and much more;
   for he is bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh. All your
   interests are wrapped up in him. You are one with him: by an endless
   union, one. I claim, therefore, and I am sure you assent at once to the
   claim, that you should often consider your Lord, and the greatness of
   his nature, person, office, and work. His greatness should be your
   perpetual theme. I would urge that all other thoughts should now be
   banished, for this is your Lord's own day, and therefore to him it
   should be dedicated with glad consent. If you are in the Spirit on the
   Lord's day, you will, like John in Patmos, give all your thoughts to
   the Son of Man who walketh among the golden candlesticks. I urge it on
   you that you do now consider with your whole heart and mind, how great
   this man is. Do you not consent to the claim?

   Certainly the subject needs consideration; for, dear friends, we shall
   never gain an idea of how great he is unless we do consider, and
   consider much. Here is a great deep, and it cannot be fathomed by the
   thoughtless. You think you know Christ, and, blessed be his name, you
   do know him in a sense; but do you know the thousandth part of him?
   When the apostle Paul had known Christ for many years he wrote to the
   Philippians, and he then expressed himself as desiring to know Christ;
   for though he knew him to his own personal salvation, yet he felt that
   he did not know him to the full. He owned that he knew the love of
   Christ, but he added, "it passeth knowledge." Well may each of us who
   has been for years a student at the Master's feet exclaim, "I find
   myself a learner yet." I suppose the saints who have been in heaven now
   for thousands of years, and have been evermore adoring him, are still
   students of him. This is the philosophy which the most cultured mind
   shall never fully compass,--"God manifest in the flesh." "Consider how
   great this man is!" This is a matter worthy of continual research, and
   calling for profound thought. You must weigh this subject, and turn it
   over, and meditate upon it the livelong day. You must let it lie both
   day and night upon your hearts as a bundle of camphor, perfuming the
   bosom in which it lies. You must look, and look, and look, and look
   again: still looking unto Jesus. The angels standing on the golden
   mercy-seat have ever their eyes bent downward, desiring to look within;
   and that must be your posture. Oh, you servants of the Lord, by looking
   to Jesus you began to live, by looking to him you shall continue to
   live, and your life shall find strength and growth. This sacred subject
   shall ever need more and more consideration from you. Oh the depths of
   the love, and wisdom, and glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ!

   I go a little further, and say that not only does my subject claim your
   consideration and need your consideration, but it solemnly commands it.
   The text is not a mere piece of advice; it is by inspiration that the
   apostle bids you today out of this sacred page, "Consider how great
   this man was." He charges you to think of Melchizedek but much more
   would he have you remember Melchizedek's Antitype. Oh, do not, my
   brethren, do not need to be pressed to this divine study: love it,
   never cease from it. Count every minute wasted in which you are not
   learning more about Jesus. Reckon all other knowledge to be as mere
   chaff and dog's meat as compared with the knowledge of Christ
   crucified. In these days of science, falsely so called, determine with
   the apostle to know nothing among men save Jesus Christ and him
   crucified. It is imperative upon you that you love the Lord your God
   with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your mind; and that God
   in Christ Jesus should call into exercise every faculty of your inner
   man, while, with blended intellect and emotion, you consider how great
   he was.

   Follow out this meditation, I pray you, because there is an exceeding
   great reward for any man who will "consider how great this man was." I
   find for myself that the only possibility of my living is living in
   Christ and unto Christ. Look you about and try to live by the wisdom of
   man. Unstable as water and fickle as the wind is the product of human
   wisdom. The history of philosophy, from the beginning until now, is the
   history of fools; and never was folly so self-evident as in the
   philosophy which is now dominant. I believe that within a century it
   will be found impossible to make men believe that educated men were
   ever so degraded as to accept the philosophy of the present hour; it
   will seem to be so altogether absurd and contrary to all reason and
   common sense, that it will be rejected with scorn as a popular delusion
   of a dark age. Even today this generation is kicking about like
   footballs the philosophies of preceding ages, and we may rest assured
   that future generations will do the same with the doting of today. I
   find, therefore, that I must come back to the revelation of God. Here
   is a rock beneath my feet--"God was in Christ, reconciling the world
   unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them." Certain great
   facts concerning God and his Christ have been made known to us by the
   Holy Ghost, and these are infallibly sure. God's revelation is true,
   whatever man's dreams may be. On the basis of revelation there is
   foothold. A personal knowledge of Christ revealed by the Spirit is also
   a sure matter. I get to Jesus, I speak to him, and meditate upon him,
   and he rises before me greater than ever, till in his presence all the
   learning of men condenses into folly. He is "God only wise." Ah, then I
   live when he is all in all! My heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth
   when I forget all else save Christ Jesus my Lord. Therefore, brethren,
   I say that you shall find a great reward in full often coming near to
   your Lord, and considering again and again how great he is.

   Consider his greatness, and I again remind you that the blessing comes
   only by consideration. I may speak to you this morning about the
   greatness of my Master, but I shall not succeed in fully declaring it.
   I am never more vexed with myself than when I have done my very best to
   extol his dear name! What is it but holding a candle to the sun? What
   are my lispings compared with the loud acclamations which such an one
   as he is might well expect from those who love him? You must carefully
   consider, or you will miss the blessing. It will not be enough for you
   to hear, or read; you must do your own thinking, and consider your Lord
   for yourselves. You may even read the Bible itself without profit, if
   you do not consider as well as read. The wine is not made by gathering
   the clusters, but by treading the grapes in the wine-vat: under
   pressure the red juice leaps forth. Not the truth as you read it, but
   the truth as you meditate upon it, will be a blessing to you. "Read,
   mark, learn, and inwardly digest." "Consider how great this man was."
   Shut yourselves up with Jesus, if you would know him. "Come, my people,
   enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide
   thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
   overpast." In Christ there is shelter, and the more you consider him
   the greater your peace will be. Come and lay your finger into the
   prints of the nails, and thrust your hand into his side. Commune with
   the personal Christ, who ever liveth; and evermore "consider how great
   this man was."

   Thus have I exhorted you to this duty; now let me try to help you in
   it. But what help will mine be unless the Divine Spirit be with me,
   that the word spoken may be with power?

   II. LET ME NEXT ASSIST YOU TO CONSIDER HOW GREAT THIS MAN WAS.

   And first, lest the very use of the expression, "this man," should
   leave anybody for a moment in doubt as to our faith in his Godhead, I
   bid you consider how great this man was in his relationship to God. For
   though he was man, he was not merely man. He was assuredly and truly
   man in all respects, "man of the substance of his mother," bone of our
   bone and flesh of our flesh; and yet he was indeed and of a truth very
   God. Do not think of him as a divine man, or as a human God; he was
   neither the one nor the other. He was perfectly man, yet he was
   infinitely God. Think, then, into what a position of honour and dignity
   his manhood was uplifted by union with the Godhead in one person. Born,
   growing, gathering strength, coming to manhood, suffering, dying, in
   all this he was man; yet he was never at any time less divine. Our
   Lord's humanity is not to be thought of apart from his deity, for he is
   one and indivisible. I have sometimes heard objections made against
   certain expressions in Dr. Watt's hymns in which our Lord is spoken of
   as the God that bled and died, and so forth. I fear that the objection
   is frequently aimed less at the poet than at the truth of the deity of
   our Lord: the objector figures as a critic because he dares not avow
   himself a heretic. Take note that in the Scriptures you shall find
   frequent confusions of speech upon the person of our Lord,
   intentionally made, in order to show that although the natures were
   distinct, yet they were indissolubly united in the one person of Jesus.
   Of his one person might popularly be predicated that which in strict
   accuracy could only be true of his humanity, or only of his deity. To
   the one person of our Lord will be found to be ascribed what he did
   both as God and as man, and it is not needful for us to be wise or
   accurate above what is written by the Spirit of God. It is possible to
   be so true to the letter as to be false to the spirit. Cavillers have
   no monopoly of wisdom. My Lord Jesus is to me no less a man because he
   is God. Oh, how my heart loves him! He is to me fairest of the sons of
   men, chief among ten thousand, and altogether lovely. But he is to me
   because of his manhood none the less, but all the more, "God over all,
   blessed for ever." Into the dust my spirit bows before his majesty, and
   my soul adores him. I ask you, therefore, to consider the greatness of
   his manhood because it never was apart from his Godhead, and cannot be
   thought of except in connection therewith. "The Word was made flesh,
   and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." Inconceivable is the
   greatness of the man who is thus one with God.

   You, my brethren, are not in doubt upon this vital matter; let me,
   therefore, ask you to consider "how great this man was" as to his
   relationship to men. Christ Jesus is the second man, the Lord from
   heaven. Adam, our first father, was the head of the race, and all men
   were in him as their representative: in him they stood in the garden;
   in him, alas, they fell when he broke the divine command, and the Lord
   took up the quarrel of his covenant, and cast him out of Paradise. "Oh,
   what a fall was there, my brethren: then you and I and all of us fell
   down." We inherit because of Adam's failure a nature whose tendencies
   are towards evil. Adam was a very great personage in relation to the
   race: he was the summary of all the generations, the fountain of the
   stream of humanity. To him we might apply the language of the prophet,
   "Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God. . . . Thou wast perfect in
   thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found
   in thee." As Adam came forth from God he was as a covering cherub,
   under whose wings the race nestled down. But now comes in the Lord
   Jesus Christ as the greater man, the representative man, in whom none
   are made to fall, but multitudes arise. In this man the Lord is again
   well pleased with men. Time was when God looked on rebellious man, and
   it repented him that he had made him; but now that he turns his eye to
   this perfect man he feels no such repentance; but, on the contrary, we
   read that "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." For
   the sake of the man Christ Jesus he deals with the innumerable race of
   sinners in a way of long-suffering and pity, and does not destroy them.
   Long ago had the flood-gates been pulled up again, and man been swept
   away by a deluge, not of water but of fire, if it had not been that the
   long-suffering Lord looks on the Well-Beloved Christ and therefore
   spares mankind. Yea, more; for his sake he sends the gospel of peace to
   men, and in the name of Jesus glad tidings are sent to every creature.
   It has sometimes happened that the illustrious deed of one man has
   served to elevate a class, or even a nation into honour. A grand,
   heroic deed has welded you not only to that one person but to all his
   kith and kin. Consider, then, how great this man was, that the divine
   mind which cannot look upon sin without indignation, nevertheless was
   so charmed to look upon the person and character of this glorious Man,
   that an amnesty was proclaimed to the race, and a message was sent to
   the sons of men bidding them repent and turn to him and live.
   "Consider," then, "how great this man was."

   Come a little closer, and reach forward to that which will delight your
   hearts far more; consider the relationship of Christ to his own people.
   Now we get on sure ground, and feel a rock beneath our feet. Long
   before the heavens and the earth were made, God with prescient eye
   beheld the person of his Son as God in human nature, and he saw all his
   elect lying in him. The church is his body, "the fulness of him that
   filleth all in all." God the Father saw in the divine decree the
   mystical Christ, and he was well pleased with all his redeemed for
   Christ Jesus' sake. How wondrous was that transaction when in the
   council-chamber of eternity the covenant was made, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ became the surety of that covenant. He entered into covenant
   with the eternal God on the behalf of his chosen that he would make
   atonement for their sin, and would perfect the righteousness which
   should cover every one of them, and make them to be accepted in the
   Beloved. No actual sacrifice was offered for thousands of years; but
   see how great this man was, since on the strength of his bare promise
   the Lord continued to save men for thousands of years, admitting them
   to his infinite glory before the Mediator had appeared, or the Redeemer
   had put a hand to the work. Consider that you and I, and all of us who
   are in Christ, are this day beloved for his sake, accepted for his
   sake, justified for his sake. Still doth God embrace us in the arms of
   almighty love for his sake; for his sake heaven is being prepared for
   us; for his sake the treasures of the infinite are given to us; because
   we are the covenanted ones for whom he pledged his troth, and for whom
   in the fulness of time he poured out his heart's blood, that he might
   redeem us unto God. "Consider how great this man was." He is so great
   that all the saints are blessed in him. He is so great that we, as many
   as have believed, dwell evermore in the clefts of this great Rock, and
   find in him our castle and high tower. For ye are dead, and your life
   is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
   then shall ye also appear with him in glory. "Consider how great this
   man was."

   Let me help you a little further, dear friends, to "consider how great
   this man was," by reminding you of the surroundings of his first
   advent. Thousands of years before his birth holy men had been speaking
   of him. Prophets and seers all pointed to him as The Coming One. "How
   great this man was," since the wisest and best of mankind all looked
   forward to his day with gladness. Think of that wonderful system of
   types, and emblems, and symbols which God ordained by his servant
   Moses; for the whole of this system was meant to set forth the Messiah,
   who would yet appear in the fulness of time. To him witnessed each
   bleeding sacrifice, each censer of sweet incense, each golden vessel,
   each curtain and wall of tabernacle or temple: all spoke concerning
   him. Ay, and more than that, all the histories of all the empires were
   all but concentric rings of which he was the center; for the Lord Jesus
   is the center of history, the sum total of all God's doings and
   manifestations among the sons of men. That was an august Person towards
   whom all the past had been labouring, and for whom all the present was
   agonizing. "How great this man was," that when he came the saints were
   watching for him: Simeon and Anna could not depart till he appeared.
   Angels stood on tip-toe ready to descend and sing, Glory to God in the
   highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. Humble shepherds, as
   they watched their flocks, did but wait for the signal to hasten to
   adore him; and wise men from the east forgot the fatigues of a long
   journey that they might lay their gold and incense at his feet. How
   great this man was, when being born and laid in a manger, the whole
   earth was moved by his appearing.

   Consider too, "how great this man was," not only as to the outward
   circumstances of his coming, but as to the secret mystery of his birth.
   For this man was not "born in sin," as we are; neither was he "shapen
   in iniquity." This is a thing to be thought of and considered in our
   privacy, but it cannot be omitted here. Thus said the angel to the
   blessed Virgin, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
   the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
   shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." "Conceived by
   the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary," he was truly a man, but not
   fallen man. The method by which the pure human nature of the man Christ
   Jesus was produced is a great mystery, but it serves to make us see
   "how great this man was." I will say no more than this, that we have
   here the fulfillment of the promise, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive,
   and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel." Think of that word
   of old: "When he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he
   saith, And let all the angels of God worship him." Let us, therefore
   worship. Reverently forbearing all idle intrusion into the deep things
   of God, let us go to Bethlehem, and "consider how great this man was."

   Now, let us look at his life. After he emerged from the obscurity of
   his childhood, what a life was that of our Lord! His greatest
   adversaries, unless they have been mad, have never dared to speak
   against his character. If the Christian religion were supposed to be an
   invention, the existence of the narrative of the life of Jesus would be
   more wonderful than the facts themselves. The conception of a perfect
   character requires a perfect mind, and a perfect mind would never have
   prepared a fiction and imposed it upon men as a veritable history. If
   the life of Jesus be a fable, then a perfect being has deceived us; and
   this it is not possible for us to imagine. The life of Jesus Christ is
   great throughout. It is so tender and so gentle that it is never little
   and mean: it is so unselfish that it never ceases to be majestic; it is
   so condescending that it is pre-eminently sublime. Above all, it is
   full of truth, transparent, artless, natural. No one ever thought of
   Jesus as acting a part yet; he is reality itself. He is so simple, so
   unaffected, so truly the holy child Jesus, that in this he is great
   above all. Never was a man so wholly seen as the Christ; and yet never
   was man so little understood. You have read memoirs of departed
   worthies, and you have felt, The biographer did well to say no more
   upon this point; but you never felt that anything need be reserved as
   to the character of Jesus. If his chronicles had kept on writing till
   the world itself had been made a library of the lives of Christ they
   would never have recorded an unworthy act or a regrettable word. It is
   not only that his pursuits were majestic, for he came to save men; that
   his motives were divine, for he revealed the Father; but it is himself
   that is so great--I mean his soul, his spirit, the man himself. Look at
   Alexander, he is a great conqueror, but what a pitiful creature he
   appears when the drunkard's bowl has maddened him. What a poor thing is
   Napoleon as seen in privacy! In his captivity he was as petulant as a
   spoiled child. Consider the Lord Jesus, and it does not matter where
   you view him: in the wilderness he is grandly victorious over
   temptation, in the crowd he is greatly wise in answering those who
   would entrap him. Behold him in his agony in the Garden; was there ever
   such an Agoniser? Behold him as the crucified; did ever cross hold such
   a sufferer? When Jesus is least he is greatest, and when he is in the
   direst darkness his brightness is best revealed. In death he destroys
   death; in the grave he bursts the sepulcher. "Consider how great this
   man was": the field of his life is ample; do not be slow to investigate
   it.

   Beloved, I cannot speak as I would of him. The blaze of this Sun blinds
   me! Yet consider how great this man was in his death; for then he
   appeared as the great Sin-offering, putting away the sin of his people.
   The Lord had made to meet in him the iniquity of us all. What a weight
   was on him, yet he sustained it! The wrath of God on account of sin
   fell upon him who had never sinned, and he bore it all. A penalty which
   must have made a hell for us for ever was exacted of our Lord upon the
   cross, and he discharged it. He drank the whole of our bitter cup. He
   bore in himself all that was necessary to vindicate the divine justice
   until he could truly say, "It is finished." "Lama Sabachthani" is the
   most terrible word that ever came from human lips; and therefore "It is
   finished" is the greatest utterance that tongue ever gave forth. The
   work was colossal; what if I say it was infinite; and therefore our
   Lord Jesus when he cried "It is finished," had reached the summit of
   greatness. "Consider how great this man was."

   Now, beloved, consider for a minute "how great this man was" when he
   rose again; for he could not be holden with the bonds of death, and his
   body could not see corruption. It was a great thing in itself for
   Christ to rise, but what I want you to remember is, that we all rose in
   him. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive;"
   and especially his covenanted people were raised up together with him.
   There was for his redeemed a death in his death and a rising again in
   his rising again; for we have been made partakers of his resurrection,
   and we live in newness of life by his rising from the dead. This is his
   cry as he rises from the tomb, "Because I live ye shall live also."
   "Consider how great this man was" whose life imparts life to all who
   are in him.

   But he has gone up on high, and has led captivity captive. Think of the
   gifts which were showered down from heaven in consequence of this man's
   ascent into the highest. For the Holy Spirit descended never to return
   till the close of this dispensation, and now all the gifts that rest in
   the church of God, and all the works of regeneration, illumination,
   sanctification, and the like, which are wrought by the blessed
   Paraclete, are the effects of the entrance of this man into the secret
   place of the tabernacles of the Most High. Every soul regenerated,
   every heart comforted, every mind quickened, every eye illuminated,
   every creature spiritually blessed, reflects glory upon this man. How
   great is he!

   Beloved, I would we had time this morning to introduce you to this man
   as he now sits at the right hand of God, even the Father. There is no
   need for me to depict him; if there were it were impossible to me. What
   said the man who loved him best, and knew him best? "When I saw him I
   fell at his feet as dead." "Consider how great this man is" now, when
   every angel pays him homage, and at the name of Jesus every knee doth
   bow, of things in heaven; as by-and-by every knee shall bow of things
   on earth, and things that are under the earth, for Jesus Christ is Lord
   to the glory of God the Father. "Consider how great this man is," and
   then remember that he shall shortly come to be our Judge! Possibly,
   while I am yet speaking to you, he may appear; no man knoweth the day
   nor the hour; but "how great this man is" will be clearly seen when, in
   flaming fire, he shall take vengeance upon those that will not obey
   him. How "great" will he be when in the manifestation of his glory all
   believers shall be glorified. I think I hear, even now, sounding out of
   my theme, shouts of "hallelujah, hallelujah," from assembled worlds.
   Yes, the music peals forth loud and long, "King of kings, and Lord of
   lords. HALLELUJAH. For he shall reign for ever and ever. HALLELUJAH!"
   Break forth with your loud hosannas, oh, ye waiting spirits of
   believing men, for the time is at hand when he shall be admired in all
   them that believe! Consider how great this man is. I have but reached
   the fringe of my subject. We see but the skirts of our Lord's garments;
   his actual glory is unspeakable, unsearchable. Oh, the depths! Oh, the
   depths!

   III. This in a few words is THE PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENT of the whole
   subject, with which we must wind up. Consider how great this man was,
   and as you consider, believe in his infinite power to bless men. He is
   full of blessing as the sun is full of light, that he may shine upon
   his needy creatures. Christ is full of blessing that he may bless poor,
   needy, empty sinners. Dost thou say, poor sinner, "I am so great a
   sinner that he cannot save me"? Consider what this man did when he was
   here on earth; he went about and laid his hands on the diseased, and
   they were cured; he looked at devils, and they fled; he spoke to fevers
   and they disappeared. And he in heaven is, and if I may so say, greater
   than when he was here below, for here on earth he was veiled in
   humiliation, but now he is enthroned in infinite majesty, "able to save
   to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth
   to make intercession for them." Believe in the infinite blessedness
   treasured up in Christ for every believing soul, and come and take your
   share of it this morning. All that you want, and all that wish--come
   and receive freely, for he doth graciously dispense it, and it is a
   part of his glory that he delights to enrich the children of men. Let
   faith in Jesus be one lesson--may God write it on each heart.

   And then let us ascribe to our Lord Jesus Christ all the honour that
   our thoughts can compass. Let us give to him this day our very selves
   over again. Consider how great this man was, and go away feeling how
   greatly you are indebted to him, what great things you ought to do for
   him, and how little your greatest thing is when you have done it as
   compared with the greatness of his deservings.

   "Let him be crowned with majesty

   That bowed his head to death;

   And be his honour sounded high

   By all things that have breath."

   Do not you feel that question pressing upon your heart?

   "Oh what shall I do

   My Saviour to praise!"

   Do something; and having done it do more, and yet more. Give up your
   whole being to the showing forth of how great this Man is!

   Once more, considering how great this Man is do not be afraid, nor
   troubled, nor tumbled up and down in your thoughts about anything that
   is happening, or is yet to happen. "Consider how great this man was."
   Our wise men are going to do away with the old faith; modern culture
   means to stamp out old- fashioned orthodoxy. Christianity itself is
   getting to be effete, and something better is to supersede it. Listen!
   "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The
   kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
   together, against the Lord, and against his anointed. He that sitteth
   in the heaven shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Yet
   have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." One said to me the other
   day, "The current of thought does not seem to run in the direction of
   evangelical religion." Well, I said I should not believe in evangelical
   religion an atom the more if the current of thought did run that way.
   We do not believe according to the counting of heads. The currents of
   men's thoughts are so uncertain that you can better tell the flight of
   birds, or the changing of English weather. The gospel is perhaps the
   surer to be true because there are so few who believe it. It is
   according to our expectation that God's revealed truth should be
   abhorred and hated by the wise men of every generation. I shall not
   believe the gospel any the less if I am left alone, nor shall I believe
   it any the more if the whole world shall cry it up. Let God be true and
   every man a liar. He whose faith stands upon the consensus of popular
   opinion has placed his feet upon the sand, but he who has read his
   Bible and has been taught of the Spirit of God what truth is, will hold
   to it come what may. When you consider how great this man is, it seems
   to me that to be a fool for his sake is the highest wisdom, and that to
   cling to what he says is the best philosophy, and to believe him, and
   none beside is not alone a duty but a necessity of every Christian
   spirit. Be of good cheer, dear friends! Let no man's heart fail him
   because of modern doubt. Let no man be troubled because of the
   fierceness of the fight. I can hear already the sounding of the
   trumpets of the Lord's coming. He is not far away; even if thousands of
   years intervene before his feet touch the Mount of Olivet the victory
   will never be doubtful. All is done that is required for winning the
   battle, his blood has been shed, his life has been accepted as a
   ransom. The eternal decree has settled it, nothing can change it! "He
   shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied." Amen.

   A pamphlet is being widely advertised as prefaced by "Mr. Spurgeon." I
   have written no such preface. My views on all subjects are as they
   were. It is disgraceful that an attempt should be made to propagate
   doctrines which I loathe, by leading the public to suppose that I have
   espoused them.

First Healing and then Service

   (No. 1836)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 19, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, He sawhis wife's mother
   lying sick with a fever. So He touched her hand and the fever left her.
   And she arose and served them." Matthew 8:14,15.

   This event took place at Capernaum, but Peter's residence was at
   Bethsaida, for we read, "Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew
   and Peter." How came Peter to have a house at Capernaum? Poor fishermen
   do not often have two houses. May not the conjecture be highly probable
   that, finding the Lord Jesus Christ was frequently at Capernaum, Peter
   thought it best to have a dwelling there, that he might always be
   present when the Master was preaching and that he might do his best to
   entertain Him between visits? I like to think that the servant changed
   his place of abode for his Master's sake. Would it not be well if many
   Christian people had some little consideration when they are choosing a
   house, as to whether it will be convenient for the hearing of the Word
   of God? Do you not think that a great many professors look chiefly for
   every other kind of advantage and, when they have virtually made their
   choice, they afterwards enquire into the very important item of their
   nearness to a place where they may worship God, enjoy Christian
   fellowship and be useful?

   There are some in this congregation who have moved to this part of town
   to become members of an earnest, prayerful Church. Such Believers feel
   that the first consideration in life must be the health of their souls,
   the benefiting of their children and their usefulness in promoting the
   cause of Christ. When they have made the selection of a house in that
   way and for that reason, they have found a blessing resting upon them
   according to the promise, "Seek you first the kingdom of God, and His
   righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." Some who
   have forgotten this rule and, like Lot, chosen the well-watered plains
   of Sodom, have lived to regret their choice. Although the house may be
   commodious and the position convenient, these advantages will not make
   up for losing the means of Grace and missing opportunities of holy
   service. When Mephibosheth lived at Lodebar, the place of no pasture,
   David fetched him up to Jerusalem where he, himself, delighted to
   dwell. It would be well for many a limping Brother if he made a like
   change.

   Thus, before we actually cross the threshold of Peter's house, we learn
   a lesson. Our Lord Jesus Christ had been having a heavy day--He had
   been to the synagogue and He had preached and had worked miracles. He
   had moved in the midst of a great throng and now, as the Sabbath was
   drawing to a close, He needed refreshment--and it was most convenient
   that Peter had a house into which the Lord could go. I do not suppose
   it was a stately mansion. Probably it was little better than a hut, for
   Peter was only a fisherman. But the Lord Jesus made it honorable enough
   by entering it. Where the king is there, the palace is!

   Though our Lord went to Peter's house to rest, He did not find it free
   from trouble. It was a hospital before He made it a palace. Peter's
   wife's mother was on her bed prostrate with "a great fever." Typhus of
   the worst kind was burning out her life. However good a man may be, he
   will not escape trial in the flesh. You may have a house full of
   sanctity and full of sickness at the same time. We find it true, while
   we are here, that "the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is
   life because of righteousness." The regenerated spirit has risen into
   life, but the body lingers under the power of death and its attendants,
   pain and weakness. Certain persons attribute all sickness to the devil
   and impute special sin to those who are grievously afflicted. This
   teaching is as false as it is cruel! "Whom the Lord loves He chastens."

   I can bear witness that some of the saintliest persons I have ever
   known have been bedridden for years--and others in whom the very image
   of Christ was conspicuous, from whose lips all the country round
   gathered up the choicest sentences of holy experience--have been
   invalids for 20 or 30 years at a stretch. Our sicknesses are of the
   Lord's appointing however painful they may be and we may, without
   doubt, say, as David did, "The Lord has chastened me sorely." "Lord, he
   whom You love is sick," is still a Truth of God! Even Peter's house,
   though it was the abode of a chosen saint, and a leading Apostle whose
   very shadow would one day heal the sick, had a terrible fever in it
   which threatened death. Yet Jesus came where the fever polluted the
   air. If the disease had come, the Great Physician had come also! We are
   not alarmed at the Cross if Christ comes with it!

   Notice, with regard to our Lord's entering the house of Peter, that He
   came there with His three most favored disciples. If you read the
   statement given by Mark in his first chapter, you may be somewhat
   surprised to discover Peter, James and John there. We read--"When they
   were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon
   and Andrew, with James and John." Whether Andrew was there or not I
   cannot tell--he was joint proprietor of the house-- but he is not
   mentioned as being there. Whenever you see Peter, James and John
   present, together with the Lord, you may look for special wonders.
   These were the men who beheld the Lord's exceeding Glory on the Mount.
   These were nearest to the agony of Gethsemane. These were admitted to
   behold the raising from the dead of the young maiden when the Lord sent
   away all the gathered company. To this most select triumvirate did
   Jesus display Himself as He did not to the rest of the Apostles--and
   much less to the world! Did not the Savior thus give us notice that the
   healing of Peter's wife's mother was a choice manifestation of His
   power and Grace--and was intended to convey a lesson to the choicer
   spirits among His followers? I think so and, therefore, I shall so use
   the incident. To you who love Jesus much and live in special nearness
   to Him, there is a voice from the bed of her who rose from the fever to
   minister to her Lord! You, also, are called from your weakness that you
   may pay personal service to Him who heals all your diseases!

   Yet though Jesus and Peter and James and John were there, nothing is
   before you but a family group, a scene in a house. True religion
   displays its greatest marvels around the domestic hearth. A fisherman's
   mother-in-law becomes an historic person through the Lord's touching
   her. What glory Jesus casts upon common things! With what grandeur He
   invests a room in a poor man's house! A fisherman's hut becomes the
   headquarters of the Captain of our salvation! He heals a woman within
   its doors and, before long, "all the city was gathered together at the
   door." O that we may see the same--our own dear ones saved--and then
   the whole city awakened to seek Divine healing!

   We will arrange our discourse under the headings of four observations.

   I. First, let us observe that IT MAY BE WE HAVE SOME IN OUR HOUSE WHO
   NEED THE MINISTRY OF THE LORD JESUS. One in Peter's house could not as
   yet minister to Christ, for she needed that Christ should minister to
   her! She was sick of a great fever and quite prostrated by it, so as to
   be altogether unable to rise. Let us think whether we have not some
   about us who are spiritually sick in a way which may be likened to a
   great fever.

   What would the fever represent? Those who are in a fever represent,
   spiritually, those who are on fire with sin. The original word for
   "fever" bears a close relation to the word, "fire." The world's great
   poet speaks of "the fiery fever." A burning heat inflames the body,
   quickens the pulse to an unnatural pace, parches the mouth and tongue
   and dries up the entire system. Those who have a fever in their souls
   are hot after sin, dried up with evil desires, inflamed with evil
   lusts. What unhealthy energy many even show in the indulgence of their
   passions, or in the pursuit of their ambitions--they are so inflamed
   with their desires that their life is consumed! Have we not seen some
   whom we dearly loved, afflicted with this fierce distemper?

   Touch upon certain points and we discover that they are diseased in
   reference to them--they are in such an inflamed state of mind they
   cannot be made to think coolly or judge calmly and they grow excited
   and angry. Their touch is that of a fevered hand. Their whole nature is
   burning with the fire of sin. Such persons are not always inflamed
   thus--they are frequently gentle and tractable--so much so, that we are
   filled with hope concerning them! Often fever is intermit-tent--the
   patient is hot at one time and cold at another--and in many sinners the
   fever of sin is intermittent in its symptoms. They are not always
   drinking--sometimes they are sober for a long period and express
   themselves as deeply penitent for former falls. What pleasant company,
   what fine genial spirits they are at such times! The fever returns and
   nothing can restrain them--they drink, even, to delirium! Alas, the
   misery which is thus caused! Others are gentle and loving for a
   season--then they suddenly give way to anger and there is no telling
   what they will say or do. When once the fever is on them, they become
   as inflamed as ever!

   We know persons from whom the heat of the fever is so long gone that we
   think, surely, they are healed, but, alas, their cool times are only a
   pause between the attacks--and the evil returns with increased energy!
   Their goodness is as

   the morning cloud and as the early dew--it comes hopefully, but it
   disappears utterly. We have mistaken the period between the fever fits
   for the calm of a cure, but it has not turned out to be so. They have,
   perhaps, been even worse after their hopeful times than they were
   before! Like he from whom the evil spirit went out on his own accord,
   only to return, again, and bring with him seven other spirits more
   wicked than himself to enter in and dwell there. Have you not such
   cases under your own roofs, or among your next of kin--poor souls
   inflamed with the terrible heat of sin?

   These fevered people are frequently very restless. It is one effect of
   the fever that the man cannot lie long either on this side or on the
   other, but turns to and fro. Even his sleep is broken--neither by day
   nor by night can he find rest. He is dried up and feels as weak as if
   he were brought into the dust of death and utterly dissolved. His
   experience is not so much pain as something worse than pain--an utter
   absence of rest. Have you not friends who, in this sense, are feverish?
   I had almost said I hope they are so, if they are, indeed, under the
   power of sin--there are signs of life where unrest abounds! We know
   young men with happy homes who cannot be content. They seem resolved to
   break their mothers' hearts and their fathers know not what to do with
   them. Nothing pleases them, they are always unsettled. They have been
   put to half-a-dozen businesses, already, and have left each one of
   them--they are now longing for a foreign country, or for enlistment in
   the army, or for anything other than their present calling.

   We have known them go to the colonies and come back again, finding
   nothing there. A sea voyage was to cure them, but, alas, a sinner on
   land is a sinner at sea! The malady is inward and needs change of self
   rather than change of place. Under the influence of the fever of sin,
   men wish and do not know what they wish. They are like a rolling thing
   before the whirlwind, or as waves of the sea driven with the wind and
   tossed about--no part of them seems to be at rest--a sort of madness
   possesses them. Above all, there is a restlessness about them in
   reference to sin. They sin, but they are not pleased, and after they
   have sinned, they are eaten up by remorse, a remorse, however, which is
   not practically opera-tive--for they go back to sin, again, flying like
   the moth to the candle where they have already burned their wings. Such
   persons often become irritable towards their friends when checked in
   their wrong doing and even become, at last, like Pashur in the book of
   Jeremiah--a terror to themselves and to their friends!

   I may be treading upon tender ground in all this. I believe my words
   are true to the letter. I shall ask Christian people who have not this
   heavy trouble to be very thankful and to pray to God for those who
   have. With those dear friends who have to endure the sore affliction of
   having such in their family, I desire to sympathize and to encourage
   them to bring these feverish spirits to the Lord Jesus by prayer and
   faith--that in them the parable of the prodigal may be literally
   fulfilled.

   One symptom of a fever is that a man loses appetite for that which
   would be good for him. Some of our unconverted friends have no taste
   for the Gospel. We cannot easily induce them to come to hear it. If you
   could get them under the sound of the Word of God, you would sit and
   pray and even agonize for them while the Truth was being preached! But,
   alas, they will not come near! They have no taste, no liking, no care
   for heavenly things. The thing they most require is that for which they
   have the least desire! Yet, fear not, Jesus can give them appetite and
   everything else which is necessary to a perfect cure!

   On the other hand, a fevered patient often feels a great thirst which
   he cannot, by any means, satisfy. He longs to drink and drink again,
   and with all his drinking the heat is not abated. Sometimes the sick
   man has an appetite for what he must not taste. He craves after the
   most injurious and even unnatural things! He prefers foods which would
   be most pernicious. So is it with unconverted ones when under the full
   power of sin--they are eager enough to hear a godless lecture, or to
   listen to opinions which are the opposite of the Truth of God! They
   would go through any hardship to indulge their passions and sacrifice
   any amount to be allowed their desires. As the horseleech cries, "Give,
   give," so is sin insatiable! Sin can never yield satisfaction to the
   soul of man--as well might the thirsty hope to relieve their anguish by
   draughts of brine.

   As it is with cups of wine, so is it with sin--one makes room for
   another. He that has sinned will sin. It is an awful part of the
   punishment of sin that it grows into a habit and increases in intensity
   as it is indulged. I may rightly say of the black well of sin, "He that
   drinks of this water shall thirst again and thirst more." Sin is a
   thing of rapid propagation and never abides alone. You cannot retain
   one sin in the house by itself, for it will, before long, produce a
   numerous progeny, a generation of vipers--many as the hairs of your
   head! What a dreadful thing it is for a man to have a fever upon him
   which makes him thirst for that which increases his thirst!

   But the worst point in the case of the sinner is this, that this fever
   of his will prove fatal. This son, daughter, husband, or wife of yours
   will perish through the fever of sin if it is not cured! A great fever
   is a great danger--and so is sin. In our Lord's days, men did not know
   how to deal with fever as well as now and, therefore, those who were
   taken with it were doomed. This poor woman would have died if Jesus had
   not interposed--thus is it with the sinful ones whose cases we deplore.

   I have thus described the disease. What shall we do with it? Let us see
   what the disciples did.

   Mark says, "And they told Him about her at once." I would earnestly
   persuade you to do the same. Take the case of the person who is laid
   upon your heart and spread it before the Lord. Go over the matter in
   detail. Not for His information, but to excite your own prayerfulness.
   Look the matter in the face, making no excuses for the sinner and, in
   all truthfulness, tell the Lord what ails the sinful one. Pour out your
   heart before the Lord and sorrow over the lost one, even as Samuel
   mourned over Saul, only with better hope. Tell the case to Jesus just
   as you would mention a physical case to a doctor. He is ready to hear
   it all and to consider it. Make a confidant of Jesus! Do not go and
   complain all over the neighborhood, "My boy does this," or, "My husband
   does that," for you may increase the evil in that way by incensing the
   person against yourself and your religion. You may tell Jesus all about
   it, without restraint. No harm can come of such a relation. It will be
   a relief to your own mind and it will be the most proper way of
   engaging your Lord to help you.

   Luke tells us, "they besought Him for her." After you have stated the
   case to your Lord, then plead with Him! Plead His promises and plead
   His Nature. Plead the need of the case and the glory which a cure will
   bring. Let it be no cold prayer, but a warm, hearty, intense entreaty.
   Do not wrangle with sinners about religion, but wrestle with Christ
   about them. Beseech the sinners for Christ, but never fail to beseech
   Christ for the sinners! When little can be done with men, you can still
   do much with Jesus. It will be of very little use to be always worrying
   them with, "you should not do this," and, "you should not do that." But
   it will be of infinite service to go and say, "Lord, have mercy upon
   these poor souls who know You not." Never give over praying for your
   prodigals as long as there is breath in their bodies--no, not even if
   they curse you for doing so!

   We find, also, that when they had thus told Jesus of her, and had
   besought Him, then they brought Him into the chamber, so that we read
   in our text, "When Jesus was come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's
   mother lying sick with a fever." They seemed to say, "Lord, this is all
   we can do. We would have You look upon the dying woman and consider
   her. There she is." Can you not, by faith, so realize the Presence of
   the Lord Jesus Christ that you see Him viewing the lost estate of those
   for whom you are concerned? Your friend is fevered with sin, but Jesus
   sees it. Your boy is restless, but Jesus watches Him. Your daughter is
   likely to perish, but Christ looks upon her! Every day let your
   importunate prayers keep them under Christ's eyes! Bring unto Jesus all
   your sinful ones! Lay them at His feet. Leave them in His Presence.
   When you have done all this--when you have told Him of her and besought
   Him about her and brought Him to the house to look upon her--then you
   may expect His healing touch and saving Word! That is our first remark.

   II. Secondly--THE MINISTRY OF JESUS MUST PRECEDE THE MINISTRY OF THE
   SAVED ONES. We anxiously desire that these friends of ours who are now
   sick of the fever of sin should yet become the servants of Christ and
   should minister to Him. I can imagine the joy of that anxious mother
   over yonder if she should ever be privileged to hear her boy preach the
   Gospel--that boy who has even been known to swear! What delight would
   fill the wife's bosom if she could hear her infidel husband engage
   publicly in prayer! Some of you are now thinking of certain gifted
   persons who are using all their abilities against the cause of Christ
   and, "Oh," you say, "if they might be converted, my heart would dance
   with delight!" This is a right desire, but do not indulge it unwisely.
   Do not ask them to do anything for Jesus while they are unregenerate.
   Healing must come before serving!

   When a person is "lying sick of a fever," do not ask her to rise and
   wait upon the Lord Jesus Christ. No--His ministry to Peter's wife's
   mother preceded her ministry to Him! She was "lying," that is,
   prostrated by the terrible malady. As a body greatly weakened seems to
   cling to the bed and almost sink into it, so was she. She was like a
   crushed thing, or a sheep cast upon its back in a trench--and so she
   was powerless to do anything. Thus is it with the sinner. What can he
   do for Christ? "When we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ
   died for the ungodly." There is no strength in an ungodly man with
   which to serve God! He has no faith and, "without faith it is
   impossible to please God." He has no love and even if a deed were done
   rightly, yet if there were not love as the motive, it would not be
   acceptable with God.

   The sinner, in fact, has no spiritual life and if he should try to do
   good works they would be dead works and could not please the living
   God. Out of a foul spring no clean waters can come and out of a corrupt
   heart no acceptable works can proceed! Christ must give us strength and
   cause us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure, for without
   Him, we can do nothing.

   Moreover, this sick woman was utterly unfit to do anything for Jesus
   and His disciples with a great fever upon her. Everywhere she went, she
   would spread the contagion of her malady. Everything she touched would
   be infected--any food she prepared would be nauseous even to think
   upon! Let her stay in her bed, by all means, and let none go near her
   unless they are compelled to do so, for fever soon seizes upon fresh
   victims! So you that are ungodly cannot serve Christ, for everything
   you do is defiled--you cannot lay your hands, even, upon holy things
   without polluting them! Your thoughts are feverish, your words are
   feverish, your acts are feverish and, therefore, we cannot invite your
   cooperation in the work of the Lord. You would do more hurt than good,
   if, as sinful men, you pretended to render service to a holy God! Such
   is your natural depravity that you would spread infection all around,
   even if you attempted to minister to the Lord Jesus.

   What is more, a person sick of a fever, if in her feverishness she were
   to arise and wait upon guests, would get no good, but run terrible
   risks. Persons in fever must not be exposed to drafts, or be driven to
   exert themselves. Every doctor would judge it to be most injurious to a
   person in a high state of fever to attempt to work. I solemnly believe
   that unconverted people get hurt when they attempt religious duties. To
   preach with an unrenewed heart must be to pronounce one's own death
   warrant! If unrenewed men come to the sacramental table, they eat and
   drink condemnation to themselves! And if they, in any way, make a
   profession of faith, they are enacting a falsehood in the sight of high
   Heaven, seeing they have no such faith. "Unto the wicked, God says,
   What have you to do to declare My statutes?" No, you must stand back,
   you that have never been washed in the blood of the Lamb! You cannot
   minister to Christ while the red fever is on your brow. He who has
   seraphim for His servitors wants not feverish services from souls
   diseased with iniquity. King Jesus wants no slaves to swell His train!
   You must be, first, freed from the yoke of sin and then you shall
   become the servants of the Lord!

   Listen to me, any fevered ones who are here, while I briefly describe
   how the Lord Jesus Christ ministered to this woman!

   He ministered to her by His Presence. His being in the room with her
   meant that salvation was come to her house. Beloved, believe that Jesus
   Christ is here! To His ministers He has said, "Lo, I am with you
   always, even unto the end of the world." I want you to know that He is
   not shut up within the heavenly gates, but He is here and His power to
   save is present in the midst of this assembly--and will be present in
   your room when you go home and fall upon your knees!

   The next thing that blessed this woman was His look. "Jesus saw her."
   There is more, here, than appears upon the surface. You know what a
   physician means when he says, "I will come and see your sick child." He
   does not mean that he will barely look at it--he intends to search into
   the matter, study it, and see what can be done. Will you try to think
   that the Lord Jesus Christ sees you--that He reads your heart, knows
   your secret thoughts, hears your secret groans and notes your inward
   desires? He perceives the power which sin has over you, the difficulty
   you find in coming to Him--He sees it all and knows how to deal with
   it. Not only is Jesus near at hand, but He is present with His eyes
   open, observing all that ails you. And He sees it with a mind which is
   deeply sympathetic and a heart quick to relieve!

   The next thing the Lord Jesus Christ used was His touch. This is the
   healing point. He "took her by the hand and lifted her up." There was a
   contact established. Oh, that glorious Doctrine of the Incarnation of
   Christ! There is healing in it! I do not mean in the doctrine, but in
   the fact, itself, that the Lord Jesus Christ took our flesh and became
   Man, "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh." Thus He touches us and
   heals us! Had He not been Man, He could not have died. And had He not
   died, we must have died forever. God in Christ Jesus is very near to
   you, poor Soul! He is so near to you that if you, by faith, touch the
   hem of His garment, you are saved! If you believe in the Lord Jesus, He
   is in contact with you--His cool hand is grasping your fevered hand and
   as your fever dissolves into Him--for "He Himself bore our
   sicknesses"--His health flows into you so that you may arise and
   minister unto Him! Contact by faith with Jesus Christ our Lord is the
   ordained means of salvation!

   And there was, beside this contact, another form of power--our Lord
   spoke to the fever. His word is a word of might. If the touch of our
   Lord represents incarnation, His word represents resurrection, for by
   hearing the voice of the

   Son of God shall all the dead arise from their graves! His word is
   quickening and where it falls, it proves itself to be a living and
   incorruptible seed! By the word of the Lord, even by the Gospel of
   Jesus, the fever of sin is driven out of men and women. Oh, that the
   Lord Jesus may now speak to you by these lips of mine--speak with
   almighty power to your hearts! Oh, that you, poor sin-sick Sinner, may
   hear the word of the Lord with your inner ears, for such hearing is
   eternal life! God help you so to hear.

   There is healing for you and I warn you, again, that you must have this
   healing before you can work for Jesus. Your Lord must begin with you
   before you can begin with Him. Do not go blundering out of the
   Tabernacle and say, "I will take a class in the Sunday school" "I will
   try to preach." "I will give my money to the Lord's cause." No--stand
   back till you are healed--weep and pray and agonize till you are
   healed! You must receive from Jesus all He has to give before you can
   give anything to Him!

   This may sound harsh to you who mean well, but God forbid that I should
   bolster you up in a zeal for God which is not according to knowledge.
   Aliens cannot stand in the Lord's courts--you must be made Israelites
   before you can be priests unto God! First, salvation, then service.

   III. Thirdly, it is plainly taught in the text that STRENGTH TO
   MINISTER COMES WITH HEALING. "Immediately she arose and ministered to
   them." Fever causes extreme weakness and when it leaves the patient, he
   is, for a considerable length of time, greatly debilitated. The cures
   of Nature are slow. But when Jesus cures, He does it at once. Though He
   uses only a touch and a word, yet He cures so perfectly that no
   weakness remains! The woman did not lie in bed a week or two and feed
   upon nourishing diet and so recover her strength. No, then and there
   she arose from her bed, girt her garments about her, and went about the
   duties of the household! Is it not wonderful to see her hasten to the
   kitchen to prepare the evening meal for the Lord Jesus Christ and His
   friends? With gratitude beaming from her face, she placed each dish
   upon the table and brought forth water with which her guests might wash
   their feet. The moment the Lord Jesus Christ saves a soul, He gives
   that soul strength for its appointed service!

   I want to call your attention to this, that her service was immediate
   service, rendered on the spot, without delay. Some of you have been
   converted during our late special services--let me bid you serve the
   Lord at once, even as the Lord has served you. "What, get to work
   directly?" Yes, immediately, for there is something very beautiful
   about that which is done by new converts. Oh, the beauty of that first
   look of love! Oh, the sweetness of those first notes of praise! Oh, the
   power of those first sentences of testimony! I do not find any fault
   with our dear old saints--there is a richness and maturity about
   them--but still, my soul desires the first ripe fruits! There is a
   pungency of flavor about the first berries of Grace and even a kind of
   tartness about them which makes their taste all the more perceptible to
   those who are dull and careless! Give me fruit with the dew of the
   morning upon it! New blood in the veins of the Church is a great
   promoter of its health and vigor! The first fruits are, in some
   respects, the best fruits! I would not have a converted person wait a
   week before trying to do something for Jesus. Run as soon as you find
   your feet!

   But notice that what this good woman did was very appropriate. Peter's
   wife's mother did not get out of bed and go down the street and deliver
   an address to an assembled multitude. Women are best when they are
   quiet. I share the Apostle Paul's feelings when he bade women be silent
   in the assembly. Yet there is work for holy women and we read of
   Peter's wife's mother that she arose and ministered to Christ. She did
   what she could and what she should. She arose and ministered to Him.
   Some people can do nothing that they are allowed to do, but waste their
   energies in lamenting that they are not called on to do other people's
   work! Blessed are they who do what they should do. It is better to be a
   good housewife, or nurse, or domestic servant, than to be a powerless
   preacher or a graceless talker. She did not arise and prepare a
   lecture, nor preach a sermon--she arose and prepared a supper--and that
   was what she was fitted to do.

   Was she not a housewife? Let her serve the Lord as a housewife. I do
   not say that if you were converted a week ago you are at once to
   preach. No, but you are to minister to the Lord in the way for which
   you are best qualified--and that may happen to be by a living testimony
   to His Grace in your daily calling. We greatly err when we dream that
   only a preacher can minister to the Lord--for Jesus has work of all
   sorts for all sorts of followers. Paul speaks of women who helped him
   much and, assuredly, as there is no idle angel, there ought to be no
   idle Christian! We are not saved for our own sakes, but that we may be
   of service to the Lord and to His people--let us not miss our calling.

   When healed of her fever, Peter's wife's mother had strength to perform
   a suitable ministry, such as the peculiar occasion required. She did,
   for Jesus and the three companions, that which was necessary then and
   there. Jesus had had a

   hard day's preaching and that is hungry work--He had spent a heavy day
   in healing and that is exhausting work--and now He needed to eat and,
   therefore, He came into Peter's house. The principal worker there was
   laid aside, and so our Lord did not ask for refreshment. He always
   thought of others before Himself and though He was faint and hungry, He
   put back His own needs till He restored health to the fevered woman.
   This being done, the next necessary thing was that the wearied Preacher
   and Physician should be refreshed--and this, the grateful woman
   attended to. When our Lord sat on the well and talked with the woman of
   Samaria, He was faint and weary and asked for a drink. But the claims
   of Nature, He put aside till He had preached the Gospel to her. Then
   came the disciples with the meat which they had bought. On this
   occasion at Peter's house, the refreshment was ministered by her who
   had just left her bed. "She arose and ministered to them."

   Now, dear Friends, you that are converted may minister to Christ in a
   way which is as necessary as the service of His ablest preachers and
   pastors. There is something for you to do which will be a refreshment
   to Him and to His servants. He condescendingly permits it and will
   graciously accept it. You can personally minister to a personal Christ.
   You cannot do everything, but you can do something that will be
   acceptable to Him. You may, you can and you ought! Ministry to Jesus is
   practicable, permissible, acceptable and obligatory. You owe your very
   life to Him. Come, spend that life in His service! Immediately, this
   very day, minister to Jesus! If you have only been saved this day, yet
   there is something incumbent for the day and, in its place, it is as
   necessary to the glory of God as the ministry of cherubim and seraphim!
   Now then, do it! I will not urge you because I can see in my last head
   something that will move you to it.

   IV. THE DESIRE TO MINISTER ALWAYS ARISES OUT OF HEALING. Here was a
   woman, a poor woman, an

   old woman, a widow woman--one who had just been sick--and she desires
   to minister to Christ at once. She can do it and she does it! How do
   you think she was moved to this? Was not it that strength naturally
   suggests activity as soon as you get it? When you are very prostrate,
   you do not want to do anything. You feel as if you must lie
   still--there is no power in you and there is no industry in you. But
   persons who have recovered, need something to do. Sometimes they try to
   do more than they can, such is the suggestion of revived strength.

   Now, if the Lord has given you spiritual life, that life will need to
   work! If He has given you light, that light will shine. "Now candle, do
   not shine." Will the candle take any notice of you? No, it cannot help
   shining if it has been lighted! If Christ has given you His Grace and
   it is in you as a well of living water, it must flow out that others
   may drink! It is no use saying, "Water, do not flow--fountain, cease."
   The fountain cannot help it! It must send forth its streams--as it must
   be so with you. The strength God has given you in Christ suggests
   activity.

   And then the gratitude for the strength impels you to activity. How can
   a man be still when Christ has spoken for him and delivered him? We
   read in the paper, some time ago, that the King of Italy, to his great
   honor, appeared in a court of law on behalf of a man brought up under
   charge of causing a death. The King had seen the accident and he came
   forward as a common witness in the court to say that the horse had
   mastered the driver and the man was not to be blamed. I do not know the
   name of the man, but I feel pretty sure that Jacobi or Antonio, whoever
   he may be, if ever King Humbert wants somebody to speak up for him,
   will find a friend in him! He will say, "My King came into court and
   spoke for me, and I will, as long as I live, speak up for him." Now,
   the Lord Jesus Christ is an Advocate for you--therefore, be an advocate
   for Him! Can you ever be silent for Christ, now that the Lord Christ
   has redeemed you from the curse of the Law and the penalty of sin? I
   tell you, if you can be quiet and do nothing for Christ, I am afraid
   you have never tasted of His love and Grace.

   Once more, I think I may say that those who are healed by Christ are
   sure to do something for Him of the right sort because their former
   habits will assist them. I do not mean by this, that sinful activity
   can ever help us into holy activity, but I do mean that we can turn our
   old habits to account for Jesus. I believe that Peter's wife's mother
   was a particularly nice old lady. There is rather a prejudice against a
   wife's mother, but if Peter found it the proper thing to have her
   living in the house, I am sure she was a specially good woman. I have a
   picture of her in my mind's eye--a dear old soul, always busy and
   happy. When there was nothing else to do, she would mend the stockings,
   or do any commonplace work. She was always busy. You never had to ask
   her to work--she did it of her own accord. At cooking the meals and
   preparing everything for the house, she was perfectly at home, never
   grumbling, never complaining, never setting the husband against the
   wife, but always looking out to do everything that possibly could be
   done to make the household go along in all its concerns with oiled
   wheels.

   When she had the fever, she did not like to be laid aside and so, the
   moment she is restored, there she is, at it again! The ruling passion
   is strong, now that death has been removed. She begins to serve Jesus,
   for she had always been serving somebody. When Jesus came into the
   house with Peter, James and John, she could not bear to think that
   there was nothing for supper. But the moment she felt well, away she
   went to the kitchen and, with all the utensils of her cooking craft,
   she began to prepare the best meal in her power! You people who, when
   you were not converted, were always active, ought to be doubly active
   now! In the family, do all for the Lord Jesus Christ. Those commonplace
   things--sweeten and flavor them with love for Him! Reverence Him and
   glorify Him in all that you do. Is there not something you can do for
   your neighbor, something you can do for your children, some part of the
   Lord's work you can undertake?

   As for you young men who have been so restless, so vigorous, so dashing
   in sin--it seems to me that this habitual energy ought to be placed
   under consecration to Christ. A horse that has no mettle in it is
   easily managed. Still, a horse with a little mettle, though he may kick
   and plunge--and do a great deal of mischief--is all the better horse
   when he is broken. If he is under proper management. If he answers to
   the bit, you like the mettle! So it is with a man when he is converted.
   If he had mettle in him that led him to kick and plunge when he served
   the devil. If he did so much mischief and damage against the Kingdom of
   Christ, he is the very man to pull well in Jesus Christ's chariot! I
   pray the Master, therefore, that He will come and heal that young man
   of his fever and make his blood cool within him this day, and restore
   him, by His Grace! Oh that the Lord would touch all sick folk and make
   them healthy! Then when all are healed, let us rise to serve Him who
   has served us--and unto Him be glory forever and ever! Amen and amen.

A Great Gospel for Great Sinners

   (No. 1837)

   Intended for reading on Lord's-Day, May 3rd, 1885,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [10]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On June 2nd, 1884,

   "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. Howbeit
   for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might
   show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should
   hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. Now unto the King eternal
   immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and
   ever. Amen."1 Timothy 1:15-17.

   WHEN Paul wrote this ever-memorable text, "This is a faithful saying,
   and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners," he placed it in connection with himself. I would have
   you carefully notice the context. Twelfth verse:"I thank Christ Jesus
   our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting
   me into the ministry; who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor,
   and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
   unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
   and love which is in Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying, and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners." You see, the apostle had spoken of himself, and then it
   was that the Holy Spirit put it into his mind to write of the glorious
   salvation of which he was so notable a subject. Truly it was a
   seasonable and suggestive connection in which to place this glorious
   gospel text. What he preached to others was to be seen in himself.

   When I read to you the story of Saul's conversion, suppose I had
   finished it by making the remark, "This is a faithful saying, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," you would all have
   said, "That is true, and it is a natural inference from the narrative."
   Such a remark would have served as the moral of the whole story. It is
   an easy and a simple inference from such a conversion, that Christ
   Jesus must have come into the world to save sinners. See, then, why
   Paul uttered it in this particular place. He could not help bringing
   his own case forward; but when he did bring it forward it was to add
   emphasis to this declaration that Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners. It is my conviction that our Lord in infinite wisdom
   intends that his ministers should themselves be proofs of the doctrines
   which they teach. If a young man, a very young man, stands up to tell
   you of the experience of an aged Christian, you say at once, "That may
   be very true, but you cannot prove it, for you are not an aged person
   yourself." If one who has been privileged in the providence of God to
   enjoy the comforts of life stands up to preach upon the consolations of
   the Spirit in poverty, you say, "Yes, that is very true, but you cannot
   speak from experience yourself." Hence the Lord likes his servants to
   have such an experience that their testimony shall have a man at the
   back of it. He would have their lives sustain and explain their
   testimonies. When Paul said that Christ came into the world to save
   sinners, his own conversion, his own joy in the Lord, were proof
   positive of it. He was a witness who had tasted and handled the good
   Word of life to which he witnessed.

   Paul went to heaven years ago, but his evidence is not vitiated by that
   fact; for a truthful statement is not affected by the lapse of time. If
   a statement was made yesterday, it is just as truthful as if you were
   hearing it to-day; and if it were made, as this was, eighteen hundred
   years ago, yet, if true then (and nobody disputed it in Paul's day), it
   is true now. The facts recorded in the gospels are as much facts now as
   ever, and they ought to have the same influence upon our minds as they
   had upon the minds of the apostles. At this moment the statement that
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners has Paul still at the
   back of it. "He being dead yet speaketh." Oh, you who are burdened with
   your sins, I want you to see Saul of Tarsus before you at this moment,
   and to hear him say, with penitent voice, in your presence, "The Lord
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." Doubt
   not the statement, for the man is the evidence of it. He who saved Paul
   can save you: yea, he is willing now to display his power upon you. Be
   not disobedient to the heavenly message.

   But, beloved, if we have not Paul in our midst to bear his personal
   witness we have still many living proofs: we have indisputable evidence
   in those that are still about us that it "is a faithful saying, and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners." I could summon to this pulpit scores who were literally
   the blackest of transgressors, but they are washed, and sanctified, and
   so they are living arguments of the Lord's power to save. Many also are
   now present who could not be numbered by their fellow-men among the
   chief of sinners in certain aspects of the case, yet they most
   willingly put themselves down as the chief of sinners under some other
   way of viewing it, and they bear their testimony, as I do to-night,
   that Jesus is able to save unto the uttermost. I, who now stand before
   you, am a living witness that Christ Jesus can save sinners, and does
   save them still. The Lord has forgiven and justified me, and I have
   found grace in his sight. In my case, also, it is proven that it "is a
   faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." Oh, how I wish
   that my hearers would believe me! Many of you would accept any
   statement which I should make; why do you not accept this? You do not
   think me a liar,why, then, do you not believe my testimony concerning
   Jesus? He is as ready to save to-day as he was of old. He is ready to
   save you if you will trust him.

   The run of thought at this time will be, first, concerning those who
   are the chief of sinnerssecondly, we will enquire why God has saved
   them; and thirdly, what they say when they are saved.

   I. First, then, who ARE THE CHIEF OF SINNERS? Paul says that he was the
   chief. I think, however, that he was only one of the regiment. There
   are different classes of sinners, and some are greater and some less.
   All men are truly sinners, but all men are not equally sinners. They
   are all in the mire; but they have not all sunk to an equal depth in
   it. It is true they have all fallen deep enough to perish in sin,
   unless the grace of God prevent; yet there are differences in the
   degrees of guilt, and there will doubtless be differences in the
   degrees of punishment.

   Some are the chief of sinners in the same way as the apostle Paul, for
   they have persecuted the church of God. Paul, who was then called Saul,
   had given his vote against Stephen; and when Stephen was stoned, he
   kept the clothes of them that murdered him. He felt that blood lying
   upon his soul long afterward, and he bemoaned it. Would not you, if you
   had been a helper at the murder of some child of God, feel that you
   were among the chief of sinners? If you had been willingly and
   willfully, maliciously and eagerly, a helper in putting a man of God
   like Stephen to death, you would write yourself down as a sinner of
   crimson dye? Why, I think that I should say, "God may forgive me, but I
   will never forgive myself." It would seem such a horrid crime to lie
   upon one's soul. Yet this was merely a beginning. Saul was like a
   leopard, who, having once tasted blood, must always have his tongue in
   it. His very breath was threatening, and his delight was slaughter. He
   harassed the people of God: he made great havoc of the saints: he
   compelled them, he says, to blaspheme: he had them beaten in the
   synagogues, driven from city to city, and even put to death. This must
   have remained upon his heart as a dark memory, even after the Lord
   Jesus Christ had fully forgiven him. When he knew, as Paul did know,
   that he was a justified man through the righteousness of Jesus Christ,
   yet he must always have felt a smiting at his heart to think that these
   innocent lambs had been worried by him; that for no other reason but
   that they were lovers of the Crucified, he had panted for their blood.
   This matter of deadly persecution placed Saul head and shoulders above
   other sinners. This was the top-stone of the pyramid of his sin,
   "because I persecuted the church of Christ." I thank God that there is
   no man here who has that particular form of sin upon his conscience in
   having actually put to death or joined in the slaughter of any child of
   God. The laws of our country have happily prevented your being stained
   with that foul offense, and I bless the Lord that it is so. Yet if
   there should be such among those who are hearing these words, or among
   those who shall one day read them, I must confess that they are,
   indeed, numbered among the chief of sinners, and I pray God to grant
   that they may obtain mercy as Saul did.

   But you can go very near to this; in all probability certain of you
   have done so. That husband who has threatened his wife so bitterly if
   she obeys her conscience, that man who has discharged his servant for
   no other reason but his fidelity to Christ, that landlord who has
   turned out his cottager from his home because he held a religious
   service beneath his roof, that man who has willfully and maliciously
   slandered a servant of God, not because he did him any harm, but
   because he cannot bear to hear of any truly following after
   Christthese are the people who must be reckoned among the chief of
   sinners. They have done no murder, but they have gone as far as they
   dare to go, and their heart is full of venom against the people of God:
   this is a grievous crime. Though it may seem a very small thing to
   grieve a pious child, or to vex a poor godly woman, God does not think
   it so. He remembers jests and scoffs levelled at his little ones, and
   he bids those who indulge in them to take heed. You had better offend a
   king than one of the Lord's little ones. That poor man in the workshop,
   who has so hard a time of it with your jests and chaff, has a Friend in
   the heavens. That other men who, seeking the Lord, has found the cold
   shoulder in society, has an Advocate on high, who will not see him
   despised without espousing his cause. It may appear a trifle to make a
   saint the target of ridicule, but his Father in heaven does not think
   so. I know this, that many patient men will bear a great deal, but if
   you strike their children, their blood is up, and they will not have
   it. A father will not stand by to see his child abused, and the Great
   Father above is as tender and fond as any other father. You have seen
   among birds and beasts that they will put forth all their strength for
   their young: a hen, naturally very timid, will fight for her little
   chicks with all the courage of a lion. Some of the smallest of animals,
   and the least powerful, nevertheless become perfectly terrible when
   they are taking care of their offspring; and think you that the
   everlasting God will bear to see his children maligned, and slandered,
   and abused, for their following of him? Is the God of nature without
   natural affection? I trow not. You shall rue the day, sir, in which you
   took up arms against the people of God. Humble yourself before God on
   account of it, otherwise you will be numbered among the chief of
   sinners, and the chief of punishments shall be meted out to you.

   I have no doubt that there may be some of that kind here; and, if there
   are, I can only pray that the story of Saul of Tarsus may be repeated
   in them by boundless grace. May they even yet come to preach the gospel
   which now they despise. It is no new thing for the priest to be
   converted to Christ. It is no new thing for the opposer to become the
   advocate, and to be all the better and more powerful a pleader because
   of the mischief which he formerly did. Oh that the Lord would turn his
   foes into friends! God send it! For Christ's sake may he send it now!

   Further, among the chief of sinners we must of course reckon those who
   are guilty of the coarser and grosser sins. I will not occupy a moment
   in mentioning what they are, for it is a shame even to speak of them.
   God keep us from unchastity and dishonesty,from any one of those sins
   which are censurable even under the head of common morality; for, if
   notif we indulge in thesewe shall certainly come by them to be
   numbered among the chief of sinners. I must, however, mention blasphemy
   and lewd speaking, because these are unhappily far too common. Does a
   man think that he can go on damning his own body and soul in so many
   words, and never provoke the Lord to anger? Does he dream that he can
   use foul and filthy words, and wicked oaths, without incurring sin? I
   believe that these things bring the blackest guilt on the conscience;
   for God has expressly said that he will by no means hold him guiltless
   that taketh his name in vain. It is true of every sin that God will not
   hold a man guiltless who does it; but it is especially said about this
   sin, because men are apt to fancy that words are of no great
   importance, or that God takes no notice thereof. Even the thoughtless
   or trifling repetition of the name of the Lord involves great sin, for
   thus a man taketh the sacred name in vain. Yet men trifle with that
   name in common conversation, and that with fearful frequency. There is
   no excuse for this wanton wickedness, because it brings neither profit
   nor pleasure to the person who so offends. What practical end can it
   serve? As George Herbert said long ago,

   "Lust and wine plead a pleasure, avarice gain:
   But the cheap swearer through his open sluice
   Lets his soul run for nought, as little fearing
   Were I an Epicure, I could bate swearing."

   I am unable to frame an excuse for profane language: it is needless
   wilful wickedness. Men talk so as to horrify us: they chill our blood
   with fear lest God should take them at their word; and all for nothing
   at all. I would to God that every blasphemer here (if such there be,
   and I have no doubt that there are), would abandon that vile,
   inexcusable, useless habit, which lowers men in society, defiles them
   before God, and ensures their condemnation. Filthy speech puts those
   who are guilty of it among the chief of sinners, and to them will
   certainly be meted out a terrible vengeance in that day when God shall
   solemnly curse those who have so glibly cursed themselves. It will be
   an awful thing for the man who used profane imprecations to find out at
   last that his prayers were heard, and that they will be answered. O
   swearer, beware lest the Lord God hear thy prayers at once to thine
   everlasting confusion! Sit down at this moment in deep contrition, and
   weep to think of the many times in which thou hast defied the God of
   heaven, and uttered words of provocation against the God in whose hand
   thy breath is. Not yet has he cut thee down. Oh, wonder of mercy! Take
   heed to thyself. Above all, marvel that there should be mention of
   mercy for such a one as thou art.

   Now, dear friends, there are other chiefs among sinners who do not go
   in for these grosser sins at all. Let me mention them, for in this line
   I shall have to place myself and many of you. Those are among the chief
   of sinners who have sinned against great light, and against the
   influences of holy instruction, and gracious example. Children of godly
   parents, who have been brought up and instructed in the fear of God
   from their youth, are among the chief of sinners if they turn aside
   from the way of life. When they transgress, there is a heavy weight
   about their fault, which is not to be found in the common sin of the
   children of the slums, or the arabs of the gutter. The offspring of the
   degraded know no better, poor souls, and hence their transgressions are
   sins of ignorance; but those who do know better, when they transgress,
   transgress with an emphasis. Their sin is as a talent of lead; and it
   shall hang about their necks like a millstone. I remember how this came
   home to my heart when I was convinced of my sin. I had not engaged in
   any of the grosser vices, but then I had not been tempted to them, but
   had been carefully guarded from vicious influences. But I lamented that
   I had been disobedient to my parents, proud in spirit, forgetful of
   God's commands: I knew betterknew better from the very first, and this
   put me in my own estimation among the chief of sinners. It had cost me
   much to do evil, for I had sinned against the clearest light.
   Especially is this the case when the possession of knowledge is
   accompanied by much tenderness of conscience. There are some of you
   unconverted people, who, when you do wrong, feel that you have done
   wrong, and feel it keenly too, even though no one rebukes you for it.
   You cannot be unjust, or hasty in temper, or faulty in speech, or break
   the Sabbath, or do anything that is forbidden, without your conscience
   troubling you. You know what it is to go to bed and lie awake in
   misery, after some questionable amusement, or after having spoken too
   frivolously. Yours is a tender conscience; do not violate it, or you
   will be doubly guilty. When God puts the bit into your mouth, if you
   try to get it between your teeth, and it does not check you at all, you
   must mind what you are at, for you may be left to dash onward to
   destruction. "He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
   suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy." It puts men among the
   chief of sinners when against light and against conscience they
   deliberately choose the way of evil, and leave the commandments of the
   Lord.

   Especially is it a grievous offense to sin against the gentle checking
   of the Holy Spirit. Have you not been sad offenders upon this point?
   You felt the other Sunday night that if you could once get out of the
   chapel, and get home, you would bow the knee in prayer; but you did
   not. You have felt like that many times, and you have shaken off the
   feeling, and now a sermon scarcely moves you: it had need be full of
   thunder and lightning to make you turn a hair. Truths which used to
   make you shake from head to foot scarcely affect you now. Take care, I
   pray you, for he that sins against the Holy Ghost may find himself
   water-logged by sin, so as to be no longer able to move his vessel
   towards the shores of salvation. Nothing hardens like the gospel when
   it is long trifled with. To lie asoak in the truth without receiving it
   into the heart is sure destruction. To die on holy ground is to die
   indeed. God grant that it may not be so with any here!

   Yet if you be this day the chief of sinners, do not despair, nor turn
   away in sullen anger; for we are going to say to you at this hour, in
   the name of the merciful God, that his Son, Jesus Christ, has come into
   the world to save sinners, even the very chief.

   I think that I must put down those among the chief of sinners who have
   led others into sin. Ah, this is a sad, sad, sad, sad subject! If you
   have led others astray, if you yourself seek the Lord, and are saved,
   yet you cannot save them. If it be young persons whom you have polluted
   with evil, you cannot take the wretched stain out of their minds. You
   can leave off sowing the devil's seed, but you cannot gather up what
   you have sown, nor prevent its growing and ripening. Fire is easily
   kindled, but not so soon extinguished when it has taken hold upon the
   fuel. It is an awful fact that there may be souls in hell whom you have
   sent there! It was a wise penitential prayer of a converted man who had
   exercised influence for evil,"Lord, forgive me my other men's sins."
   When you lead others to sin, their sins are to a large extent your
   sins. They do not cease to be the sins of those who commit them, but
   they are also the sins of those who promoted or suggested them by
   precept or example. A bad example, a lewd expression, an unholy life,
   may be the means of drawing others down to perditionand those that
   destroy others, and so are soul-murderers, are among the chief of
   sinners. He who uses dagger or pistol to the body is abhorred; what
   shall we say of those who poison human minds, and stab at the heart of
   piety? These are guiltiest of the guilty. Woe unto them!

   Especially must I rank him among the chief of sinners who has preached
   falsehood,who has denied the deity of Christwho has undermined the
   inspiration of Scripturewho has struggled against the faith, fought
   against the atonement, and done evil even as he could in the scattering
   of scepticism. He must take his place among the ringleaders in
   diabolical mischief: he is a master destroyer, a chosen apostle of the
   prince of darkness. Oh, that he might be brought by sovereign grace to
   be among the foremost teachers of that faith which hitherto he has
   destroyed! I think that we should do well as Christian people if we
   prayed more for any who make themselves notorious by their infidelity.
   If we talked less bitterly against them, and prayed more sweetly for
   them, good would come of it. Of political argument against atheists we
   have had enough, let us carry the case into a higher court, and plead
   with God about them. If we use the grand artillery of heaven by
   importunate prayer, we should be using much better weapons than are
   commonly employed. God help us to pray for all false teachers that they
   may be converted to God, and so display the omnipotence of his love.

   I shall not say more upon this mournful matter, for, indeed, I have
   only mentioned these examples in the hope that some here present may
   confess, "I am sorry to say that the preacher means me. Under some
   aspect or other I must take my place among the chief of sinners."

   II. Now, secondly, WHY ARE THE CHIEF OF SINNERS SO OFTEN SAVED? The
   Lord Jesus Christ, when he went into heaven, took with him one of the
   chief of sinners as a companion: the dying thief entered Paradise the
   self-same day as our Lord. After our Lord Jesus had gone to heaven, so
   far as I know, he never did save more than one person by his own
   immediate instrumentality; and that one person was this very apostle
   Paul, who has given us our text. To him our Lord spake personally from
   heaven, saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" To him he
   revealed himself by the way, and called him to be his apostle, even to
   this man who truthfully called himself the chief of sinners. It is
   wonderful to think that it should be so: but grace delights in dealing
   with great and glaring sin, and putting away the crying crimes of great
   offenders.

   The Lord Jesus not only saved the chief of sinners, but he was related
   to some of them by blood. Look through the long line of our Lord's
   genealogy. You know that doctrine, the last invention of Rome,
   concerning the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary. I am going to
   tell you a doctrine which is about as far apart from that as the east
   is from the west. In the genealogy of our blessed Lord we find the
   names of certain of the chief of sinners. Three women especially hold a
   position in it, who were each notorious for sin. Not many women are
   mentioned, but among the first is Tamar, guilty of incest. The next is
   Rahab the harlot, and a third is Bathsheba the adulteress. This is a
   crooked pedigree, an ancestral tree whose branches are more than a
   little gnarled and twisted. Admire the condescension of our Lord in
   coming of such a stock. He came of sinners, because he came for
   sinners. According to the flesh he comes of sinners that sinners may
   come to him. There was mixed in the veins through which flowed his
   ancestry the blood of Ruth the Moabitess, a heathen, brought in on
   purpose that we Gentiles might see how truly he was bone of our bone,
   and flesh of our flesh. I say not that there was any defilement in his
   humanity, God forbid; for he was not born after the manner of men, so
   as to be polluted in that fashion; but still I say that his genealogy
   includes many great sinners in order that we may see how closely he
   allied himself with them, how thoroughly he undertook their cause. Read
   the roll of his ancestry, and you will see that David is there, who
   cried, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned ", and Solomon, who
   loved strange women; and Rehoboam, his foolish son; and Manasseh "who
   shed innocent blood very much," and worse men than they, if worse could
   be. Such sinners as these are in the genealogy of the Savior of
   sinners. "He was numbered with the transgressors." He was called "The
   friend of publicans and sinners." It was said of him, "This man
   receiveth sinners, and eateth with them." Still he delights to save
   great sinners. O my hearer, it will delight him to save you!

   Why does he do it? The apostle says, in the sixteenth verse, "For this
   cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth
   all longsuffering." What, is that his reason for saving a sinner? It is
   that he may show in that sinner his long-suffering, revealing his
   patience and forgiveness. In a great sinner like Paul he shows all his
   long-suffering, not little grains of it, nor portions of it, but all
   his longsuffering. Is Jesus Christ willing to show forth all his
   long-suffering? Does he delight to unveil all his love? Yes; for
   remember that he calls his mercy his riches: "he is rich in mercy." I
   do not find that he calls his power his riches, but he calls his grace
   his riches, "in whom we have redemption through his blood, the
   forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace." Oh, dear
   friends, the Lord, who is rich in mercy, seeks a treasury in which to
   put his riches; he wants a casket for the sacred jewellery of his love;
   and these atrocious criminals, these great offenders, these who think
   themselves black as hell, these are the very men in whom there is space
   for his rare jewels of goodness. Where sin has abounded there is
   elbow-room for the infinite mercy of the living God. Ought you not to
   be encouraged, if you feel yourself greatly guilty, that God delights
   to show forth all his patience by saving great sinners? Will you not at
   once seek that all long-suffering may be shown in your case? Believe on
   the Lord Jesus, and it shall be so.

   And what does Paul say next? He says that the Lord saved him for a
   pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life
   everlasting. For a pattern. It means for a type or specimen. Paul was a
   "proof before letters." The first prints of an engraving are sharp and
   clear, and therefore they are very valuable: they exhibit the
   productive power of the plate at its highest point, before the surface
   is worn down in the least degree. Paul was one of the proof-engravings
   taken off the plate in the earliest days, and under the most favorable
   circumstances for bringing out every line of grace. All God's
   long-suffering was seen in him for a pattern. I would to God that we
   could put some of you under that same engraved plate, and issue more
   impressions at this very hour; for the plate is not worn out: the type
   that God uses is as new as ever. When a printer sets his type, he sends
   to the author a sheet to let him see what the type is, and he calls it
   his proof. So also Paul was God's proofone of the first taken off by
   the glorious machinery of grace to let us all see what God has to say
   to us concerning longsuffering love. That printing-machine is at work
   at this very moment: it is making impressions at this hour, most clear,
   sharp, and readable. I would to God that some great sinner here would
   be like the paper laid under the type to take the impression of
   almighty grace. A grand edition of the Work of Love was issued before
   Paul was printed off, and published; I refer to the time when Peter
   preached at Pentecost. Many large and splendid editions have been
   issued from that press since. I see before me a whole library that God
   has printed in this housethe proofs that God has taken of late years
   from the old standing type; but Paul stands at the head of the list as
   a fine first proof of what God can do.

   Then God can save me. I came to that conclusion a year ago, and putting
   it to the test, I found it true. Dear fellow sinners, come to the same
   conclusion! Who are you? No, I do not ask you to tell me. I do not want
   to know. God knows. But I want you to come to this conclusion,"If Paul
   is a specimen of saved ones, then why should not I be saved? If Paul
   had been unique, a production quite by himself, then we might justly
   have doubted as to ourselves; but since he is a pattern, we may all
   hope to see the Lord's long-suffering repeated in ourselves." Nowadays,
   by the Parcels' Post, people are sending you patterns of all sorts of
   things, and many articles are bought according to sample. When you buy
   from a pattern you expect the goods to be like the pattern. So God
   sends us Paul as a pattern of his great mercy to great sinners. He thus
   says, in effect,"That is the kind of thing I do. I take this rough,
   bad material of the chief of sinners, and I renew it, and show forth
   all my mercy in it. This is what I am prepared to do with you." Poor
   soul, will you not accept the mercy of God? Enter into this salvation
   business with the Lord, that you, too, like the apostle, being a
   sinner, may become like him in obtaining the glorious salvation which
   is in Christ Jesus, who came into the world to save sinners. I am
   talking very plainly and simply to you; but if you love your own souls
   you will be all the better pleased to listen. I do not want to amuse
   you, but to see you saved. Do, I pray you, bend your minds to this
   subject, and learn that there is good hope for the worst of you if you
   will cry unto the Lord.

   That is why Jesus saves those who have most grievously erred, that he
   may display them as specimens of what his grace can do.

   "But I belong to such a wicked family," cries one. Oh, yes; and many
   have been saved who belonged to the most depraved and degraded of
   families. They have entered into relationship with Christ, and their
   own base condition has been swallowed up in his glory. The children of
   criminals when converted belong to the family of God. "To as many as
   received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
   them that believe on his name."

   "Oh, but I have indulged in such horrible vices." This is a sad
   confession, but it does not doom you to despair, for the blood of Jesus
   washes away the worst of filth. Blasphemers, adulterers, drunkards,
   thieves"such," O ye saints"such were some of you, but ye are washed,
   but ye are sanctified"; and why should not others of like character be
   washed and sanctified too?

   III. I must close by dwelling a moment on the third head, which is
   thisWHAT THE CHIEF OF SINNERS SAY WHEN THEY ARE SAVED. What they say
   is recorded in the text. It reads like a hymn:"Now unto the King
   eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for
   ever and ever. Amen." See, the first word is "Now." As soon as ever
   they are saved they begin praising the Lord. They cannot endure to put
   off glorifying God. Some one might whisper to them, "You will praise
   God when you get to heaven." "No," replies the gracious soul, "I am
   going to praise him now. Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
   invisible, be glory for ever and ever." Grateful love cannot be
   restrained, it is like fire in the bones. Our heart would break for
   love if it could not find a means of expressing itself at once.

   Does another person whisper, "When you praise God, do not be too long
   about it. Leave off as soon as you have moderately praised and adored.
   Do not be for ever engaged in the work of praise." "No," says the saved
   man, "I cannot have done while life lasts,'To him be honor and glory
   for ever and ever.'" Not only for ever: that might seem to be long
   enough; but "for ever and ever." It is a redundant expression, such as
   enthusiasm delights to use: it indicates a sort of double eternity. The
   saved sinner can never have enough of glorifying the Lord; he will
   praise him throughout eternity. As soon as a man is cleansed from sin,
   he is clothed with praise. A new song is put into his mouth, and he
   must sing it: he cannot help doing so. There is no stopping him.

   Notice what titles Paul here heaps together. First, he calls the Lord
   Jesus Christ a King. "Now unto the King eternal." Or apply it to God
   the Ever-Blessed, in his sacred unity, if you will: he calls the Lord
   King, for he would give him the loftiest name, and pay him the lowliest
   homage. He calls him a King, for he had found him so; for it is a king
   that distributes life and death, a king that pardons rebels, a king
   that reigns and rules over men. Jesus was all this to Paul, and much
   more, and so he must needs give him the royal title: he cannot speak of
   him as less than majestic. If Jesus is not King to all the world, at
   least he is King to the man whose sins have been forgiven him. "Now,"
   says he, "unto the King eternal be honor and glory for ever and ever."

   See how he puts it, "the King eternal." Not a king that will lose his
   kingdom; not a king who will cease to reign, or abdicate, or die. Oh,
   dear brethren, the King that pardoned Paul is a King to-day equally
   mighty to save. Eighteen hundred years after his great deed of grace to
   the chief of sinners he is still a King.

   "Jesus sits on Zion's hill:
   He can save poor sinners still."

   He sits upon the throne of mercy in the sovereignty of his grace, in
   the splendor of his love, in the majesty of his power, passing by
   iniquity, transgression, and sin. Will you not bow before him? Here at
   this moment I pause to do him reverence,Glory be to the Lord Jesus,
   for he is the King eternal!

   Then he calls him the King immortal. He is the King that ever lives by
   his own power, and is therefore able to give life to dead souls.
   Blessed be the name of the Savior that he died for sinners, but equally
   blessed be his name that he ever liveth to make intercession for
   sinners, and is therefore able to save unto the uttermost them that
   come unto God by him. The quickened, raised-up spirit cries aloud,
   "Glory be unto the King immortal, for he has made me immortal by the
   touch of his life-giving hand!" Because he lives, we shall live also.
   Our life is hidden in him, and throughout eternity we shall reign with
   him.

   Then Paul styles him the King invisible; for as yet we see not all
   things put under him, and his reign is perceived rather by faith than
   by sight. The Lord Jesus is to mortal eyes invisible, and therefore our
   service must be rendered by the spirit rather than through the senses.
   He must be trusted if we are to draw near to him, and we must say of
   him, "whom having not seen we love." An unseen Lord, who can only be
   known to our faith, has saved us, and will save us, world without end.
   We have not a King that we have seen or touched, or whose voice we have
   audibly heard; but ours is a King who is invisible, and yet moveth to
   and fro among us, mighty to save. Thanks be unto the Holy Spirit for
   giving us eyes of faith to see him that is invisible, and hearts to
   trust and to rest upon an invisible Lord!

   "Now, now, now, now, now, now, now," that is the word for every saved
   soul. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, be endless glory.
   Do you not respond to the call by immediate praise? Do you not say,
   "Awake up my glory! Awake, psaltery and harp"? Oh, for a seraph's coal
   to touch these stammering lips! As a sinner saved by my Lord and King,
   I would fain pour out my life in a continual stream of praise to my
   redeeming Lord.

   Furthermore, our apostle speaks of the only wise God. He is so wise
   that he saves great sinners to make them patterns of his mercy; so wise
   that he takes bigots and persecutors to make them into apostles; so
   wise that he makes the wrath of man to praise him, and the very
   wickedness of man he uses as a foil to set forth the brightness of the
   glory of his grace. Unto the only wise God, wise enough to turn a lion
   into a lamb, wise enough to make a sinner a saint, a persecutor a
   preacher, an enemy a friendto him be glory. Oh, the wisdom of God in
   the plan of redemption! It is a deep unfathomable. Compared with it
   there is no wisdom elsewhere, and God is seen to be "only wise."

   To him be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. Unto him be glory on
   earth and glory in heaven, honor from all of us poor imperfect beings,
   and glory from us when he shall have made us perfectly meet to behold
   his face. Come, lift up your hearts, ye saved ones! Begin at once the
   songs which shall never cease. The saints shall never have done
   singing, for they remember that they were sinners. Come, poor sinner,
   out of the depths extol him who descended into the depths for you!
   Chief of sinners, adore him who is to you the Chief among ten thousand,
   and the Altogether Lovely! You black sinners, who have gone to the very
   brink of damnation by your abominable sins, rise to the utmost heights
   of enthusiastic joy in Jesus your Lord! Put your trust in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and all manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto you; and at the receipt of such a pardon you shall burst out into
   new-made doxologies to God your Savior. "Come now, and let us reason
   together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." O ye guiltiest of the guilty, the apostle Paul speaks to you,
   and stands before you as the bearer of God's white flag of mercy.
   Surrender to the King eternal, and there is pardon for you, and
   deliverance from the wrath to come. Thirty-five years Paul lived in
   sin. Twenty years after that, when he was older than I am, he wrote
   these words, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
   chief." Is there not some thirty-five years' old fellow here to-night
   who had better turn over a new leaf? Is there not some woman here of
   that age who has had more than enough of sin? Is it not time that you
   turned unto the Lord and found a new and better life? Turn them, Lord:
   turn them, and they shall be turned! Make them live and they shall live
   unto thee, world without end. Amen and Amen.

The Good Ananias--a Lesson for Believers

   (No. 1838)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 26, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to
   him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here,
   Lord." Acts 9:10.

   AT this season we are called upon to think of foreign missions. As
   members of the Baptist Missionary Society, we are in happy and hopeful
   circumstances. God is smiling upon the work, both at home and abroad,
   and raising up men whose hearts are in the cause. Last year the Society
   was in arrears--it has expended very much more money this year than
   last year--and yet it has paid its way, is clear of debt and begins the
   year with a balance in hand! For this we are very thankful, not only
   because the money is necessary to defray the charges of the holy
   service, but because it shows that the Churches have confidence in the
   Missionary Society and that they are awakening to their responsibility
   concerning it. The more Believers in the Lord Jesus consider the
   matter, the more they will see that it is the duty and the privilege of
   all who know the Lord to make Him known to others.

   There was a time when Christian people thought it idle to send
   missionaries to the heathen, but that time only survives in regretful
   memories. We remember reading that in a Scottish assembly, a Moderate
   minister, famous in his day, talked of the proposal to send
   missionaries to the heathen as the greatest absurdity to which he had
   ever heard! One who was of another mind cried out, "Reach me that
   Bible"--and when the Bible was opened and he began to point to its
   teachings, the quibbler was silenced. Are there any such quibblers yet
   afire? If there are, they are wise enough to hold their tongues! No
   reviewer in our day would dare to sneer at "consecrated cobblers," for
   they remember Carey and tremble in their shoes! Brothers and Sisters,
   we are to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature. This is our Captain's orders and it would be treason to
   disobey! We have acted negligently towards this commission far too
   long! It is high time that we awakened from our sinful slumbers. May
   many a man and woman among us be called to mission work and may the
   rest be eager to help them by their generous gifts.

   What subjects have risen before me while thinking of a discourse upon
   missions! Many grand and exciting themes have tempted me. The coming of
   the Lord, the conquest of nations to His sway, the reign of peace, the
   overthrow of falsehood and all manner of glorious topics invite me! But
   something less ambitious has won my thoughts. It lies upon my heart not
   to speak of things upon a great scale, above our present power, but to
   talk of practical matters within the reach of common Christians. I
   shall not, therefore, treat of the Millennial reign, but of the kingdom
   of Christ in your soul and mine--and of how we can increase His
   dominions and cause His Kingdom to come with power! I had rather speak
   five words to practical purpose than 50,000 for oratorical effect.

   I have selected my text that we may see what can be done by private
   Christians and learn how we can personally serve the Lord and become
   links in the great chain of His gracious dispensation. The mass of us
   cannot go abroad as missionaries, but we can all be messengers for
   Christ in our own city. We cannot all preach, but we can all pray! We
   cannot all give money, but we can all fill the treasury of
   supplication! The question for each one to ask, is--"Lord, what would
   You have me do?" What can I do with a household about me? What can I
   do, who can only take rank as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ,
   without special office in the Church?

   It seems to me that Ananias may serve as a typical person and that his
   history may furnish us with many useful lessons. Brethren, I shall
   invite you, this morning, to think about this good Ananias, to whom the
   Lord said in a vision, "Ananias, and he said, Behold, I am here, Lord."

   I. First, let us think a little about THE MAN. He is described as "a
   certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias." We hear of him this once
   and we know nothing more about him. He comes forward at a critical
   point in Paul's life-- executes for him a very useful office--and then
   disappears. The good soldier was sent upon special service by his
   Captain and, when he had fulfilled his commission, he retired to his
   ordinary place in the ranks. Who was this Ananias?

   We remark of him, first, that he was simply a private person. He is not
   described as pastor, or evangelist, or even as deacon or elder of a
   Church--yet this private person, obscure in life and without special
   distinction in the Church, was the channel for communicating the Holy
   Spirit to the great Apostle of the Gentiles! For the time being, he
   became one of the most important persons in sacred history! The Lord
   did not send to Paul for the opening of his eyes and the comforting of
   his heart, an Apostle, lest any should have said that Paul received his
   commission second-hand from those already in office. The Lord did not
   send to him any man of distinguished position or eminent gifts, lest it
   should be concluded that Paul received the Gospel at his hands. The
   great Apostle could say in later days, "I neither received it of man,
   neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ."

   It was necessary that instrumentality should be used, but it was wise
   that such instrumentality should be of the most ordinary kind, lest any
   power should be ascribed to it and lest it should arrogate to itself
   credit for the Apostle's conversion and later life. I see, therefore,
   in many of you, dear Brothers, special qualifications for certain uses,
   even qualifications which your being Church officers, or preachers,
   might take from you your very obscurity and lack of glittering talent
   may be a fitness for peculiar service. There is a special work for you
   to do who are private Christians and I trust you will be prompt in the
   doing of it.

   Ananias is especially said to have been a disciple. Dwell on that
   title. He was a learner. He sat at Jesus' feet and learned of Him and,
   therefore, was ready to instruct Saul of Tarsus. A true disciple is
   also a follower--he is an imitator of his Master. Christ's discipleship
   is always practical--it is of the heart and of the hands as well as of
   the head--all these were needed in the mission of Ananias to Paul. Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, we must take care that we keep up the character
   of disciples! May we bear fruit, so we shall be His disciples. Let us
   never dream of knowing more than our Master teaches us. Let us never
   think that we are perfect, so that we have no more to learn. He who
   gets beyond a disciple rises beyond his proper place. Our strength for
   usefulness lies in our remaining disciples. You cannot disciple all
   nations unless you are disciples, yourselves! How can you teach others
   that which Christ does not teach you? But if you sit at His feet and
   receive of His Words, then shall you speak so that others shall learn
   of you.

   Paul tells us, in Acts 22:12, that Ananias was "a devout man." How much
   I wish that all avowed disciples of Jesus were devout men! I suppose he
   was devout while he was yet a Jew, before he received Christ. But when
   he was enlightened, another element entered into his devotions, so that
   he worshipped God in the name of Jesus. Nowadays we greatly need more
   devout men, men of prayer, men who dwell with God in secret--devoted
   men, men of devotion--for the strength of the spirit of man lies in
   fellowship with the Spirit of God. A devout man is soon
   discovered--this fire from Heaven cannot be hid! The devout man may not
   be more somber than others--why should he be? He certainly will not be
   more anxious to make a display, but it will soon be seen that he is
   more full of power.

   A devout man is a remarkable man! If he prays, you perceive that he is
   familiar with that holy exercise. If he is called to endure trials, his
   patience proves that he submits himself to God. His daily conduct in
   the affairs of this life exhibits a secret, sacred something which few
   understand, but which all feel. The Spirit of God dwells with the
   devout man and fits him for the Lord's service! I believe that God
   loves to send, as His special messengers, those who ordinarily dwell
   near Him. Let us aim to abide with God that we may be employed by Him!
   Every Christian man cannot be a talented man, but every Christian
   should be a devout man! Every man cannot be eloquent, but every man who
   loves the Lord may be de-vout--and in that devotion lies a main
   qualification for service. He that has power with God will not fail to
   have power with men.

   Paul also tells us that Ananias had "a good report of all the Jews
   which dwell in Damascus." They hated Christians, but they could not
   help respecting this devout man. The world had then, as it still has, a
   respect for those who walk with God. If we are to be useful to our
   fellow men, we must deserve their esteem. We are not to curry favor
   with them by lowering our principles to gain their approbation, but, on
   the contrary, we are to win their respect by sheer force of unbending
   holiness so that we may have power over them for their good. We are to
   win influence over our fellow men by an upright character and a
   generous behavior--so that if they wish to speak against us, they may
   find no matter for accusation

   unless it is concerning our zeal for the Lord our God. Oh, that our
   Church members were all men of spotless character! Oh, that all
   professors were well reported of! The Church is injured in her efforts
   for the conversion of the world by the inconsistencies of certain of
   her members. Let us provide things honest in the sight of all men and,
   by our lives, adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things--and
   then we shall be prepared for the Lord's use among our neighbors!

   This, then, was Ananias, a disciple towards Christ, devout towards God
   and upright towards men.

   Another qualification of Ananias for the work which the Lord put upon
   him was his general thoughtfulness for the Church of God. This comes
   out in his own words. It is evident that he thought about the
   persecutions of his Brothers and Sisters. He says, concerning Paul, the
   persecutor, "I have heard by many of this man." No doubt he had
   frequently made Paul the subject of conversation, for he was grieved at
   the afflictions of the saints in Jerusalem and he feared for his
   Brethren in Damascus. Observe that he is the first to call Christians,
   "saints," or holy ones. He had evidently observed the followers of
   Jesus and had noticed with delight this point of their character! It is
   well to speak frequently of matters which concern Christ's Kingdom.

   Ananias was in sympathy with tried saints, was deeply touched by the
   story of their trials and could not forbear to dwell upon their
   sorrowful experiences. All the servants of God who are what they should
   be, take a great interest in the condition of the Church of God--they
   bear one another's burdens and share each other's griefs. They do not
   go in and out of their pews on Sunday and then fancy that their
   connection with the Church is ended--they bear upon their hearts the
   interests of Zion! They hang their harps upon the willows if she is
   captive and they rejoice when they see her enjoying prosperity. They
   take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof. It is one mark
   that a man is right towards God when he is right towards the family of
   God. All that belongs to Jesus belongs to me if I belong to Jesus. All
   the interests of His Kingdom are my interests if I am truly walking in
   fellowship with my Lord!

   See, then, the man Ananias--there is nothing brilliant about him--he,
   by no means, claims distinguished rank. But he is what I pray we may
   all be--a vessel fit for the Master's use--cleansed, prepared,
   consecrated, set apart unto God! Hence he was used of the Lord.

   II. Now, secondly, let us consider HIS POSTURE. This is seen at once in
   his answer to the Divine call. The Voice said to him, "Ananias," and he
   answered, "Behold, I am here, Lord." He was familiar with the Old
   Testament. He remembered how the Lord said, "Abraham," and the
   Patriarch answered, "Here am I." He remembered how the young child,
   Samuel, when the Lord said to him, "Samuel, Samuel," answered, "Here am
   I." He remembered how the Prophet, when he saw the excellent Glory and
   heard the Voice saying, "Who will go for Us?" responded, "Here am I,
   send me!" He made the same answer, because his mind was full of
   Scripture and also because he could not find a better reply, for the
   words were few, reverent and very fully expressive of what he felt.

   Did not this indicate that his heart was responsive to the Divine
   Voice? "Ananias." "Here am I." Do you not think that God speaks to us
   many times and gets no answer? Happy is he who can say with David,
   "When You said, Seek you My face, my heart said unto You, Your face,
   Lord, will I seek." Every Sabbath you receive a heavenly message and,
   in your reading of Scripture and in your private worship, voices
   whisper to you from God, voices which the ears hear not-- does your
   heart hearken to these calls? When your heart hears a rebuke for a
   certain omission, do you respond by fulfilling that omission? Or if it
   is a rebuke for sin committed, is your heart humbled at once and ready
   to respond by putting away the sin? If there is a call to duty, or a
   secret prompting to sacrifice, does your spirit say at once, "Here am
   I"? Scarcely should we need the Lord to speak, for, "as the eyes of a
   maiden look unto the hand of her mistress," responding to very motions
   of her hands, so should our heart be immediately answerable to the will
   of the Lord in all things. O Lord, make us like wax to Your seal. May
   our heart echo the voice of our heavenly Father!

   He was also ready. "Here am I," he said. He did not ask, "What for?"
   but, "Here am I," ready for anything! Oh, that our hearts might be in
   such a state that were it for living or for dying, for giving or for
   losing, for suffering or for working, the same response would come
   forth--"Here am I, make what use You can of me, my Lord; I shall count
   it an honor and a joy if You will send me anywhere, to anyone, with any
   message, at any time--here am I." Oh, Brothers and Sisters, are we free
   from reservations? Whatever the Lord says to us, are we prepared to do
   it? What drawbacks there often are! What hindrances to consecration,
   what reserves for the flesh! But, blessed shall that man be who has no
   answer to give to God's call but just, "Here am I." Ready, yes ready!

   Again, I think his posture was one which I can only describe by using
   the phrase that he was all there. "Ananias." "Here am I," he said.
   Would not some Christians be compelled to say, if they described
   themselves truthfully, "1 am not here--You call me but I am not here"?
   Is it not so, that sometimes in prayer we are not there? In singing the
   praises of God, how often it happens that the mind is wandering--we are
   not there! I know there is such a thing as preaching, teaching and
   doing service for God with a portion of yourself--and it is not a fact
   that all that is within you is stirred up to the service of the Lord. I
   often see upon a sunny wall, a chrysalis, and when I go to take it
   down, I find that the summer's sun has shone upon it and the insect has
   developed and left nothing but an empty shell behind. How often in the
   pew we find the chrysalis of a man, but where is the man? Wait till
   tomorrow morning, and see him in his shop--there is the man! Or, to
   follow up the figure, there is the butterfly with all its wings! Wait
   till you find our friend engaged in secular employment to his own
   advantage and then you will see what he is made of! But in the work of
   the Lord, he is not worth his salt!

   But oh, Brothers and Sisters, if ever a man ought to be all there, it
   is when he is called to the service of God! He should marshal all his
   faculties and every faculty should reply, "Here am I." Call over the
   muster-roll of all your powers, capacities and abilities--and let each
   one of them answer to it, "Here am I!" The whole of a living man is
   something worth having, but a fragment of a man is only fit to be
   buried. Oh, that we might be found with our loins girt and our lamps
   trimmed--and we, ourselves, as men that wait for our Lord and watch for
   His coming! We are to be ready at His bidding to consecrate every
   faculty of spirit, soul and body, to the grandest cause that ever moved
   the soul of man. There is the man and there is his posture--may we be
   like he and stand as he stood! Help us, O Spirit of the living God!

   III. Now, thirdly, we are to look to HIS DIRECTION. When he had thus
   said, "Here am I!" the Lord gave him his orders in detail. I do not say
   that the Lord will give us orders verbally as he did to Ananias. And I
   would have you take heed that you do not mistake whims of your own mind
   for the voice of God, but I do say that whatever your hands find to do,
   you are to do it with all your might and believe that God's voice is
   calling you to that service which His Providence places in your way.
   God still guides His servants when they are willing to be guided.
   Ananias had his orders as to where he should go. The Lord said, "Arise,
   and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the
   house of Judas." The Lord knows the street and He knows the house where
   the sinner lives who is to be blessed by you. The Lord is very specific
   in His directions, for He gives Ananias the name of the person who kept
   the house. Whether it was a house of public entertainment or not, I do
   not know, but the Lord knew all about it and He gave His messenger
   precise directions. If you stand waiting for the Lord, He will direct
   you, today, to the right street and to the right house. Only wait upon
   Him and if you go in His name, He will take care that you are not sent
   to the wrong person.

   His directions further related to the person to whom he was to go. This
   person was to be named Saul, known to come from Tarsus, and he was to
   be a blind man, for he was to "receive his sight" through this Ananias.
   The Lord knows the individual whom you are to bless and all about him.
   He knows what he is, where he is and what he has been doing and what he
   is doing and what he is going to do. Though, as I have already said,
   you have no verbal directions given to you, yet any person who falls in
   your way, if you will but seek to do God's work to him, will turn out
   to be the person whom God intends you to bless. You are to deal with
   him in faith under that impression and you will not be disappointed.

   Ananias was also told when to go. He was to arise and go at once.
   Perhaps he had not yet left his bed, or it was a vision of the night,
   but he was to, "Arise and go." God's errands are so important that we
   must not delay in their performance. Whenever a man proposes to obey in
   a week's time, he confesses himself to be disobedient for that time. He
   who, when he receives a message, delivers it at once, with the
   impression of his call fresh upon him, will deliver it with authority
   and power. This day there is a call to each Believer to proclaim the
   glories of the name of Christ wherever he has opportunity--let him do
   this at once!

   Ananias was also told why he was to go. He was to go to Saul of Tarsus,
   "for behold he prays." The servant was to go because the Master was
   already there! God had inspired the prayer of the blinded persecutor
   and now He was about to answer it by Ananias! Where God has plowed, we
   are to sow. Of that preparation you know but little, but your own duty
   is clear enough. If you begin to pick and choose the objects of your
   labor, you will select the wrong persons. But if because God has put
   such and such a person in your way, you tell him of Jesus and His love,
   you will make no mistake! The Lord who prepares you to speak has
   prepared him to listen! In fact, in this case, Paul was so prepared
   that he had "seen

   in a vision a man named Ananias coming in." If we are always ready for
   the Master's work, we shall be surprised to find how beautifully He
   makes us fit in with His Providence and His Grace!

   There is a person in this Tabernacle, this morning, who has been here
   many times and has always expected that a Christian friend would speak
   to him, but nobody has done so yet. But if you do it this morning, he
   will respond to you and say, "Thank you; this is what I was looking
   for. God has been troubling me of late in my thoughts and I am desirous
   to find the way of peace. You are the very person whom I wished to
   see." God sends the right messenger to the right man--Ananias to Saul.

   He had further directions, for he was told what he was to do when he
   found Saul--he was to lay his hands on him. There is a great deal in
   the touch of an earnest man. If you stand half a mile off from a man
   and throw the Gospel at him, you will miss him. But if you go close to
   him and lay hold upon him, giving him a hearty grip of the hand, and
   show that you have an affection for him, you will, by God's blessing,
   lead him in the right way. You must come into heart contact if you are
   to influence the man. "But," you say, "if I did thus grasp a man and
   speak with him, I could not open his eyes." Could Ananias do so? Yet
   the Lord worked by Ananias and why not by you? "Oh, but I do not think
   I could comfort a troubled heart." Ananias could not have comforted
   Paul unless the Lord had been with him. Paul was a vastly superior man
   to Ananias, yet the humbler man was the means of the spiritual
   enlightenment of the greater mind--and why should not you? Though you
   should meet with a great skeptic, or a very learned person who is quite
   a giant Goliath, compared with you, yet make bold to play the man--for
   the Lord does not work by gigantic instruments--but by young David who
   seems unequal to the task. At any rate, I do pray you, dear Brother,
   are ready to speak what the Lord has spoken to your own soul--and be
   this your resolve--

   "Now will I tell to sinners round What a dear Savior I have found!
   Point them to Your redeeming blood, And say, Behold the way to God."
   Your instructions are in the Scriptures--follow them!

   IV. But now, fourthly--good Ananias, excellent man as he was, had HIS
   DIFFICULTIES and so, when he was told to go, he said, "Lord, I have
   heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to Your saints at
   Jerusalem: and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all
   that call upon Your name."

   These difficulties were very natural. Saul's conversion was astonishing
   to the last degree. Ananias had long been thinking of the terrible
   persecutor, Saul--"I have heard by many of this man." Could it be that
   this wolf had become a lamb? Ananias had Saul on the brain through
   terror of his cruelties and now he was to have Saul on the heart
   through joy of his repentance! He had heard such dreadful stories of
   the ferocious persecutor, that as soon as he heard the word, "Saul," it
   took his breath away! There is a promise that the leopard shall lie
   down with the kid but it is not surprising that the kid should, at
   first, shrink from the monster--and so this dear, plain, simple-minded
   man was startled at the idea that he was to visit the malicious man who
   had sought the lives of Christians.

   But notice that his objections were such that he could tell the Lord
   about them and, whenever you feel any difficulty, if you can lay it
   before the Lord in prayer, there may be unbelief in it, but there will
   be no willful sin in it. We do not praise that good man who said, "Send
   by whomever You will send, but not by me." Yet he was not blamed when
   he gave his reason and mourned that he was slow of speech. The Lord met
   him in great tenderness and helped his infirmity. To tell your
   difficulty to God may be an evidence that you are hearty in his service
   and only regret that you have not greater ability to consecrate to it.

   But, observe, that his difficulty was unfounded. If he had thought for
   a minute, he would have concluded that if Saul prayed, he must have
   ceased to persecute. To any man who prays, we may go with confidence
   that he will listen to our witness concerning Christ, in whose name he
   is praying. Ananias had forgotten this. The Lord had changed the heart
   of Saul. He had visited him with the light of His Glory and made him
   His captive for three whole days of darkness. And now he was ready
   enough to welcome the man by whom his eyes would be opened! Do we not
   lose opportunities of doing good by dwelling too much upon the past
   characters of those to whom we are sent? Do we not say, "I have heard
   of this man, that he is a desperate, drunken, swearing fellow--I shall
   not go near him"?

   My dear Friend, this is the man who most needs your aid and who knows
   but, at the very time, when you go to him, the Lord may be dealing with
   his conscience so as to set before you an open door? Are we to speak to
   none but those who

   will welcome us? In that case we shall be often disappointed, for such
   persons do not always repay our exertions. Those who have been, for a
   long time, very hopeful, are usually the most hopeless of cases--but
   utterly hopeless people are often the most hopeful when we have faith
   enough to approach them. Do not bury a man before he is dead! Hope that
   so long as a sinner lives he may yet live unto God! Be hopeful that He
   who placed this sinner in your way and you in the sinner's way, has
   designs of love which are about to be accomplished.

   V. Concerning Ananias, I want to remind you, in the fifth place, of his
   COMFORT in the work. The Lord reassured His servant, first, by
   reminding him of the doctrine of election. God said to him, "He is a
   chosen vessel unto Me." Some read it, "He is a choice vessel," as if
   there were originally something in Paul which rendered him a choice
   person. But the Apostle, himself, does not put it so, for he describes
   Ananias as saying, "The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you
   should know His will." He did not know the will of the Lord except
   through the Divine choice. To him, the Revelation of God came as the
   gift of Sovereign Grace! Here was one whom God had chosen to bless,
   though Ananias knew it not. The grand doctrines of Sovereign Grace and
   of electing love are the most powerful inducements to labor for the
   conversion of all who come in our way!

   Did not our Lord say to one of His servants, "I have much people in
   this city"? And did he not make this his encouragement for preaching
   the Truth of God with all boldness? So let it be your encouragement.
   Behind all opposition there is an almighty will which cannot be set
   aside--there is a purpose which must be accomplished--there is a
   predestination that can, by no means, be defeated. "Oh," says one, "if
   I believed that God had an elect people, I should not preach again." It
   is amazing how people argue--for that is the very reason why I do
   preach! If the Lord has not chosen any, what is the use of my
   preaching? But if He has done so, I shall not preach in vain! Often
   have I thought to myself--I shall have a picked congregation today--God
   will bring the very people here that He means to bless--and He will
   save His own elect by His own Word! It does not rest with me, nor with
   them, but with HIM and, therefore, there is hope! The eternal purpose
   goes forth in all the majesty of its might, therefore will we go to
   every creature, testifying in the name of Jesus--and believing that as
   many as the Father gives Him, shall come to Him.

   Moreover, the Lord put aside the fears of Ananias by telling him that
   He had chosen this man to a great purpose. "He is a chosen vessel unto
   Me, to bear My name among the Gentiles." A great sinner is to be made a
   great saint! A great op-poser is to become a great laborer. Who knows
   how largely God may use the sinner whom we seek to save? Who knows what
   may be in any man, or in any child? You, dear teachers in the school,
   may be teaching Luthers, or Melancthons! You may be instructing, in
   those young girls, holy women who shall serve the Lord abundantly! You
   are handling choice materials, therefore be not careless in your
   service. To you is given not gold, nor silver, nor precious stones, to
   fashion, but immortal spirits that shall glorify Christ on earth and in
   Heaven!

   And then, to remove all difficulty from the mind of Ananias, the Lord
   told him that He would go with him--"For I will show him how great
   things he must suffer for My name's sake." You are bid to teach the
   Gospel to an individual who has been very hardened--and you fear that
   you have no strength for such an undertaking and, therefore, you cry--
   "Lord, I cannot show this man the Truth!" The Lord replies, "/ will
   show him." "But," you say, "he is so ignorant!" "I will show him."
   "Alas, he is blind and prejudiced!" "I will show him." You are,
   "laborers together with God." When we lift our trowel upon this wall,
   we may know that a Divine arm is moving at the same moment--and the
   stone which we seek to place in its course shall be laid there by an
   Omnipotent hand which works effectually!

   Therefore, give yourselves up to your Lord's work, whatever that work
   may be. "Behold I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having
   teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall
   make the hills as chaff. You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry
   them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and you shall rejoice
   in the Lord, and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel."

   VI. I must ask your attention for a minute or two to the sixth point,
   and that is, Ananias' difficulties being graciously taken away. Observe
   HIS OBEDIENCE to his Master's orders.

   It was prompt obedience--"Ananias went his way and entered into the
   house." No longer hesitating nor delaying, he went his way with all
   speed. His obedience was exact--he entered into the house and, putting
   his hands on Saul, said, "Brother Saul." He did as he had been told.
   There is a great point in that. Mind that what you preach is the Gospel
   of the Lord Jesus and that what you do is by order from the Throne of
   God and that it is carried out in the Spirit's power, for you cannot
   expect the Lord to bless your message if you alter it. If my servant
   goes to the door and amends the mes-

   sage which I have sent by him, why then, he must bear the
   responsibility of doing so and also run the risk of dismissal! But if
   I, as Christ's servant, deliver my Lord's message to the best of my
   knowledge, just as He gave it to me, then my Lord is responsible for
   the success of it and not myself! Be prompt, therefore, and be exact.

   Then, see how loving he was. "Brother Saul," he said. Saul of Tarsus
   would not have made two bites of Ananias a little time before, if he
   had fallen into his power, but now the words, "Brother Saul," are sweet
   to his ears. Love is the method of Grace. You cannot win souls by
   putting on a morose countenance and repelling all approaches--it must
   be, "Brother Saul." Do not be afraid to call the individual, "Brother,"
   but take care that you mean it. Though he may be a greater and wiser
   man than yourself, still come close to him with confident affection,
   for if he is, indeed, a Brother, he will accept the salutation. And, if
   not, your peace will return to you. Ananias did not use the term as a
   cant expression, but his spirit and feeling were brotherly. The love of
   his speech betrayed his deep affection and intense sympathy. He was as
   pleased with Saul as a mother with a newborn child! He shared, with
   angels, the joy over the returning prodigal!

   See, also, how wisely he spoke. It was given him, in the same hour,
   what he should speak. He did not pompously say, "I am an ordained
   official and, therefore, speak with great dignity." No, he began, "The
   Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto you in the way as you came, has
   sent me." It was wise thus to sink himself in His authority. He speaks
   most wisely all through and speaks precisely the right words. When he
   alludes to Paul's former course, he only gives a hint of it--"The Lord
   that appeared to you in the way as you came." He does not say, "as you
   came to persecute us," but he allowed conscience to do its own work. He
   gives the items of his errand--"Jesus has sent me that you might
   receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." I have not time
   to indicate all the points which show the prudence of the Lord's
   messenger. May we, also, be made wise to win souls!

   Notice how thoroughly faithful Ananias was. He said, "Arise, and be
   baptized, and wash away your sins." The tendency with many good
   Evangelists is to say nothing upon that point. The main thing is to get
   this man to be a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, but to say, "Arise,
   and be baptized"--is not that far less important? Brothers, we have
   nothing to do with altering Christ's message--we are bound to deliver
   it as a whole--without addition or diminution. The tendency everywhere
   is to say, "Baptism should not be mentioned--it is sectarian." Who said
   so? If our Lord commanded it, who dares to call it sectarian? We are
   not commanded to preach a part of the Gospel, but the whole of the
   Gospel-- and Ananias did this. Is it not written, "He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved"? Why omit one clause? I question whether
   God's blessing has not been withheld from some teachers and preachers
   because they have failed to repeat their message in its entirety.

   A Brother will write to me next week and say, "I am sorry that I cannot
   circulate your sermon because you allude to Baptism." My dear Brother,
   if you cannot circulate the sermon, I must be content without your kind
   help--but I cannot amend the Lord's Word to please the best man upon
   earth! What prominence is given to Baptism here! We would greatly err
   if we believed in baptismal regeneration, or even in the efficacy of
   washing in water for the removal of sin--but, on the other hand--we are
   not to place in the background an ordinance which, by the language of
   Scripture, is placed in the forefront! Ananias said to Paul, "Arise and
   be baptized, and wash away your sins." And this tallies with that other
   text, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." In both of
   these passages the Lord puts a special honor upon Baptism and it would
   be evil for us to neglect that which He so evidently esteems!

   Do not make any mistake and imagine that immersion in water can wash
   away sin--but do remember that if the Lord puts this outward
   profession, side by side, with the washing away of sins, it is not a
   trifling matter! Remember that other text, "With the heart man believes
   unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
   salvation"? Faith must be followed by obedience, or it cannot be
   sincere--do, then, what Jesus bids you. That is not, however, my point.
   I want to urge upon you that you should always speak the Lord's Word
   faithfully and be true to that which the Lord reveals to you, even to
   the jots and tittles. In these days there is much talk about,
   "undenominationalism," and in that talk there is much to be admired.
   But the danger is lest we should, on all hands, begin to pare away a
   little from the Word of God for the sake of an imaginary unity.

   The suggestion is that one is to give up this--and another is to give
   up that. But I say to you--give up nothing which your Lord commands! In
   all charity, believe that your Brother desires to hold only Christ's
   Truth, but make sure that you hold it yourself, whether he holds it or
   not. This is the best "undenominationalism" in the world--every man to

   be faithful to his convictions and true to his Master out and out--and
   then to give his Brother in Christ credit for doing the same! In this
   way we may expect the Master's blessing.

   VII. Lastly, observe the RESULT of what Ananias said. The results were
   IMMEDIATE, for Paul received his sight at once, was comforted at once
   and baptized at once! But the results were most extensive, for this
   Paul became a preacher of the Gospel to every land! As the Apostle of
   the Gentiles, he brought multitudes to Jesus! It was a splendid work
   that Ananias did that morning, for to this day, the testimony of Paul
   to the Cross of Christ is ringing over Europe and throughout the whole
   world! Where would we have been as a nation if it had not been for the
   Apostle of the Gentiles? Our Lord Jesus Christ was pleased to raise up,
   in Paul, an especially useful instrument of blessing to the sons of
   men. I might almost say that, among those that are born of woman, there
   has not been a greater than the Apostle Paul! It was necessary that
   Ananias should link him to the Church of God by instructing him in the
   faith and initiating him by Baptism.

   Go you, then, my Brothers and Sisters, wherever God sends you, for you
   know not what may be within a man, a woman, or a child whom you shall
   bring to Jesus! Everybody is not a Paul, but yet you may find a Paul
   among your converts. The pearl fisher standing on the rock plunges deep
   into the sea--he does not know whether or not he shall bring up a pearl
   that will decorate an emperor's diadem. But he searches the deeps in
   that hope and why should he not bring up such a treasure as well as
   anybody else? No matter though the fisherman, himself, may be coarse,
   ragged and rugged, yet he may light upon a priceless pearl!

   And you, whoever you may be, I charge you, in the name of the Eternal
   God, plunge yourself into your work with whole-hearted devotion and you
   shall yet discover some hidden jewel which shall adorn Immanuel's
   diadem! So may it be with you, dear Friends, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Delight in the Almighty

   (No. 1839)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 3, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For then shall you have your delight in the Almighty, and shall lift
   up your face unto God." Job 22:26.

   THE Lord said to Eliphaz and his friends, "you have not spoken of Me
   the thing that is right, as My servant Job has." And, therefore, we
   must always regard what they said with careful discrimination. They
   were wise men according to their light, but they were quite at sea in
   their judgment of Job. However, in this particular verse, Eliphaz
   declared that which is taught in many other parts of Holy Scripture and
   we may profit by his utterance. God grant that by His Spirit we may
   fully experience the joys described in the words before us.

   Eliphaz and his friends had judged Job from their own point of view,
   making their own experience to be the standard. They, themselves, had
   prospered and, therefore, they inferred that if a man served God, he
   must necessarily prosper in worldly things--and that if he did not
   succeed as they had done, he must have been guilty of great crimes.
   Though they could not discover any actual fault in Job, they concluded,
   without further evidence, that he must have been a hypocrite and have
   acted oppressively to his servants, or have been unmindful of the
   claims of the poor, or in some other way have brought upon himself the
   wrath of God. It never entered their mind that so terrible a sickness
   and such a list of dreadful calamities could have befallen any man
   except as a punishment for special sin. They inferred virtue from
   prosperity, and sin from adversity. Unrighteous and cruel logic! At
   once false and brutal! It renders men at once false witnesses and
   Pharisees, condemning the innocent because of their sorrows, and
   flattering themselves because of their ease.

   To judge according to outward circumstances has been the tendency of
   men in all times--even David could not understand how it was that the
   wicked were so free from troubles while all day long he was, himself,
   plagued and chastened every morning. A right principle lay at the
   bottom of this wonder for, indeed, the Lord will reward the good and
   will punish the wicked, but a great mistake is made when we suppose
   that this life is the time for meting out rewards and punishments. God
   will, undoubtedly, when the time shall have fully come, discharge the
   full vials of His wrath upon the ungodly, but the present is a period
   of long-suffering, where the wicked spread themselves like a green bay
   tree. Unless God's mercy shall lead them to repentance, they are in the
   same wretched condition as bullocks which are being fattened for the
   slaughter! Who envies them? Many of the ungodly have their portion in
   this life--they increase in riches--their eyes stand out with fatness,
   they have more than heart can wish.

   As for the children of God, it often happens that gall and wormwood are
   mingled with their drink--waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
   We must not judge according to the sight of the eyes, or according to
   present conditions, or we shall make gross mistakes. The richest may be
   the most wicked and the poorest may be the most gracious. Those who
   suffer least may deserve to suffer most and those who are most
   afflicted in this life may have the highest glory in the life to come.

   I suspect that Eliphaz and his friends had enjoyed smooth sailing. How
   could they judge the man who had done business amid tempests? Their
   mental life was not disturbed by great conflicts. They had not gone
   deeply into things, nor searched to the bottom of spiritual
   matters--they had no knowledge of their own hidden corruptions and had
   endured but little of the rod of chastisement and, consequently, they
   had been at ease. Their mistake was that they sat in judgment upon
   another who was more tried than themselves--and condemned him for being
   in sore distress. Their own serenity led them to judge the troubled one
   very harshly. This ought not to be. If any of us are inclined, thus, to
   judge and condemn, it is time that we put this mischievous spirit far
   from us. If we judge others, others will judge us. Two can always play
   at that evil game!

   I remember a company of terribly despondent Believers who were, for
   years, a severe scourge to their happier Brethren. Having a deep sense
   of their inward corruptions, being sorely tempted of the devil and
   having only a weak and trembling faith, they tyrannized over others who
   were more happy than themselves. They judged that those who were not as
   much tempted as themselves did not exhibit the spot of God's children.
   None were more bitter than these humble people in denouncing those who
   had not been as much humbled as themselves. Those who did not sit in
   the dust and groan to the same tunes as themselves, they judged to be
   very dubious Christians--and took care to scald them with that kind of
   hot pity which is not much different from contempt! This was as wrong
   as wrong can be. It is not to be endured that the sick should make
   themselves the standard of health; that dwarfs should set up to be the
   models of manhood! These worthy people set up a standard marked in very
   black ink and those who did not come up to so much grief and so much
   unbelief, they set aside as very questionable members of the Divine
   family.

   This is manifestly vicious, but it is equally evil when judgments are
   pronounced from the other side. For persons in good health, whose
   livers act well, who have abundance of this world's good and very
   little care and trial--who have not often had to stand by the grave and
   weep because the arrows of death have struck their dearest ones, who
   have never known what it is to be wounded in spirit--for these to set
   up their standard and condemn the weak and the sad, is a crime against
   the Lord! To say, "If you do not believe as firmly as we do. If you do
   not rejoice as we do; if you are not as sensible of sanctification as
   we are--you are not in Christ at all," is a piece of arrogance very
   grievous to the Spirit of the Lord.

   Oh, my strong Brother, listen to one who knows by experience the
   heaviness of a child of sorrow! Who made you a ruler in Israel? God's
   children always play the fool when they play the judge--they are never
   in order when they act as if they were the head of the family of Grace.
   The Father knows all His children. All who observe carefully will also
   know that while some are strong in the Lord and in the power of His
   might, others are weak in faith and mere babes in Grace. These little
   ones are not one jot the less precious in the sight of the great Father
   than the more fully grown ones! Let none of the strong cattle push the
   weak cattle with horn and with shoulder, for when the weak ones
   complain unto God, He will regard them and will avenge them upon the
   proud. If you are strong, God keep you so, and make you stronger-- but
   use not your strength for treading down the weak! If you are weak, the
   Lord strengthen you, and deliver you from this malady, but do not envy
   the strong and begin to speak lightly of those who excel you. The more
   of light, the more of joy, the more of holy confidence, the more of
   faith--the more glory to God--therefore covet these things earnestly as
   among the best gifts. May the Holy Spirit help us to attain the highest
   degree of Grace, but may He always prevent us from judging our
   Brethren! Here was the fault of Eliphaz. He was right in many of his
   statements, but he was wrong in his ungenerous application of them to
   holy Job.

   I want, this morning, as God shall help me, to lead you up to the
   pastures on the hilltops. I pray that I may help you to a higher and
   joyful experience in the things of God, while I shall speak, first, of
   a desired position towards God-- "Then shall you have your delight in
   the Almighty, and shall lift up your face unto God." And secondly, upon
   the question--when can this happy experience be realized? "Then," says
   the text and, therefore, there is such a time when we can have delight
   in the Almighty and lift up our face unto God.

   I. First, here IS A DESIRED POSITION TOWARDS GOD.

   Many men forget God--He is no object of delight to them, for they
   ignore His existence and they would even think it a great relief if it
   could be proven that there were no God--no God to observe them, no God
   to record their misdeeds, no God to call them to judgment, no God to
   punish them for their iniquities. Let us pity the multitudes who claim
   to be happy without God, for it is the extreme of depravity when,
   blotting out God from his soul, a man obtains a wretched comfort as the
   consequence of his folly. To be without God is to be without rest in
   the present and without hope for the future.

   Great numbers of men go a stage further--they believe in God, they
   cannot doubt that there is a Most High God who judges the children of
   men-- but their only thought towards Him is that of dread and dislike.
   They do not want to hear of Him! If the things of God are forced upon
   their attention, they are soon weary of such distasteful themes, for
   they only look upon God as a just and terrible Judge who will certainly
   punish them for their transgressions. It is woe to them even to think
   of the great God. Though this dread of God and this neglect of God
   cannot deliver them out of His hands, yet they find a kind of comfort
   in it. As we are told of the ostrich, (I know not whether it is true or
   not), that when it

   cannot escape the hunter, it buries its head in the sand so as not to
   see its pursuer--so these foolish persons blind their own eyes and thus
   produce a foolish security of heart! They think of God with dread,
   dismay, despondency and despair.

   I am grieved to add that this principle even tinctures the thoughts of
   true friends of God, for when they bow before God it is not only with
   the reverence of a loving child, but with the terror of a slave! They
   are afraid of Him who should be their exceeding joy. Their view of God
   is incorrect, for it is not such as the Spirit of Adoption would give
   them. They are really trusting in Him and in the great Propitiation
   which He has set forth, but they have not come to know Him under that
   blessed term which our Savior puts into our mouth when He bids us say,
   "Our Father, which are in Heaven." Such trembling ones are still under
   the spirit of bondage which causes them to fear, as condemned persons
   dread the executioner. They stand like Israel trembling at the foot of
   Sinai--they have not come unto Mount Zion and to the blood of
   sprinkling, which speaks better things than that of Abel. God is still,
   to them, exceedingly terrible, so that they fear and quake. Even though
   they are His children, they are not able to lift up their faces unto
   their own Father. They haunt the outer courts of the sanctuary, but
   into the Most Holy Place they do not dare to enter--they see the smoke
   of the burnt offering, but they have not learned to feed upon it and so
   to have happy communion with God. These people may be safe, but they
   are not happy! They may be saved from sin, but not from sorrow! Faith,
   if it were stronger, would, effectually slay and bury servile fear.

   Let us meditate upon what is here meant by delighting in the Almighty.
   The man who experiences this delight is glad that there is a God. That
   atheistic philosophy which makes the whole world to be a chance
   production which grew of itself, or developed itself by some innate
   force, is a very dreary piece of fiction to the man who delights
   himself in the Almighty. I tremble at any teaching, religious or
   scientific, which seems to place God further off than we have believed
   Him to be. To draw Him nearer to me and, myself nearer to Him, is the
   innermost longing of my soul! Do you not feel the same? I know you do
   if you have a child-like spirit towards Him. We delight to see God in
   the shadow of every passing cloud, in the coloring of every opening
   flower, in the glitter of every dewdrop, in the twinkle of every star!
   The Lord is personally at work in all the processes of Nature and
   natural laws are simply the Lord's usual method of operation. Our God
   is so near us that in Him we live and move and have our being! At this
   spring tide, in the fragrance of the flowers and the song of birds, we
   perceive God everywhere present, renewing the face of the year.
   Beloved, the thought of God is to the souls of those who know and love
   Him the most delightful that can cross the mind! To put God away from
   us is injury to our happiness, as well as treason to our duty--but to
   get nearer and clearer views of His Omnipresence, His Omniscience, His
   Omnipotence, is to increase the joy of our heart.

   To go a step further, the delight of the Believer in his God is a
   delight in God as He really is, for there are, in the world, many false
   gods of men's own imagination. Remember that your own thoughts of what
   God is are far from being correct unless they are drawn from His own
   Revelation. This sacred Book is infallible, but not our thoughts--and
   where we differ from God as He has revealed Himself, we differ from the
   Truth of God. It is as easy to make an idol out of your own thought as
   it is for the Hindu to make a god of the mud of the Ganges. There is
   but one God revealed in Holy Scripture, in Nature and in
   Providence--His name is Jehovah--the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of
   Jacob and who has still further declared Himself as the God and Father
   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! He is God in undivided unity of
   Essence, in the trinity of His Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

   With all our souls we worship and adore Him! Just as God appears in
   Holy Scripture, we are to delight in Him, regarding Him as love, as
   mercy, as long-suffering, as justice, as power, as purity, as all
   goodness and greatness in one! The characteristic which seems to cause
   most delight to perfect saints in Heaven is not love, alone, nor mercy,
   alone, but that which comprehends Grace and mercy, and much more--I
   mean holiness. This is the perpetual cry of the seraphim, "Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God of Sabaoth." The holiness of God, or, if you will, the
   wholeness of God, the completeness of God, the perfection of God is the
   delight of all Believers. We would not tone down a single attribute. We
   would not disturb the equilibrium of the Divine perfections, but we
   delight in God in all those aspects of His Character which are
   mentioned in His Holy Word.

   Further, he that delights in God delights not only in God as He is, but
   in all that God does--and this is a higher attainment than some have
   reached. "It is the Lord," said one of old, "let Him do what seems good
   to Him." Too many would call God to their bar and hold a trial upon
   what He does with men in this life, and with the wicked in the world to
   come. Far other was the spirit of the Apostle when he said, "No, but, O
   man, who are you that replies against God? Shall

   the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why have You made me thus?"
   Concerning any event we simply ask--Has God done it? Then we bow before
   His decree and say no more, for what He has done must be right and
   wise. When the Lord afflicts us and hides the reason from our eyes, let
   us not contend with Him. And if we cannot go further, let us be silent
   before Him, even as was the afflicted man of God of whom we read,
   "Aaron held his peace." Better, still, will it be if we can complete
   our confidence and say with Job, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
   away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." He that delights in the
   Almighty will delight in Him even though he smarts beneath His hand,
   and will bless Him even when His dispensations are killing ones--as
   said the Patriarch of Uz, "though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."

   Practically put, this delight in the Almighty shows itself in the
   Christian when nothing else remains to him. If he is stripped of
   everything, he cries, "The Lord is my portion!" When the cupboard is
   bare and the garments are worn out-- and poverty stares the man in the
   face--he says, "My God is such a satisfactory and all-sufficient
   portion that I am rich and increased in goods while possessing nothing
   but my God." The same is true when such a man is surrounded with every
   earthly comfort, for he still feels, "The Lord is my portion." The
   saint begs vehemently of his God that he may not have his portion in
   this life. If God were to multiply his stores beyond his power to count
   them, he would be dissatisfied unless in all these he saw his Father's
   covenant love. One saint, who suddenly became poor, was still as happy
   as ever, for he said, "When I had abundance, I saw God in all things
   and now that I have lost my property I see all things in God." These
   are equally blessed states of mind!

   It were well to combine them and see God in all things, and all things
   in God at the same time! So it should be with the Believer. "Why," he
   says, "these earthly comforts never were my delights--these were not my
   daily manna, but only little snacks for the time--sips of sweetness
   while I pass through the barren wilderness." The Lord was and is my
   chief portion, my well of comfort, the rock of my salvation. If we make
   props of our outward joys, we shall fall when they are taken away, but
   it we rest wholly upon the foundation of Divine Love, altogether apart
   from external things, we shall never be moved. Happy is the Christian
   who can practically enjoy delight in the Almighty by making Him to be
   his All in All--all the day and every day!

   You will see this delight in God exhibiting itself in frequent
   meditations upon God. Such a man has pleasure in being alone with God
   and his sweetest occupation is meditation upon the years of the right
   hand of the Most High. He finds, in holy contemplation, pastures large
   and green in which his soul does feed and lie down--

   "My God, You are mine, what a comfort Divine! What a blessing to know
   my Jesus is mine." These happy meditations very soon show themselves in
   words. The man that delights in the Almighty delights to speak about
   Him. That which is in the well will, before long, come up in the
   bucket--and that which is in the heart will soon display itself in the
   tongue. Is there any conversation more elevating, more consoling, more
   strengthening than conversation about the Lord our God? And when you go
   home from such society, do you not feel it sweet to fall asleep with
   the savor of it upon your lips? Is not holy converse infinitely better
   than all the mirth and merriment of the world's amusements? Here is
   something to feed upon, something solid, something real--saints delight
   to contribute to such conversation and to receive instruction from it.

   "Delight yourself in the Lord." This will give you pleasure in the
   midst of pain. Do you know what it is to have many aches, sufferings
   and, perhaps, a throbbing head--and yet to feel that you have another
   self which has no pain because it dwells in God, where all is calm and
   quiet? You felt that it would be a great mercy to be released from this
   painful life and yet you have not raised the question with your God,
   but have waited His good pleasure. Faith has made you feel, "wherever I
   am, whatever I feel, so long as God is near me and His sweet love fills
   my bosom, I will greatly rejoice and triumph in the God of my
   salvation."

   This will show itself in your life, for it will be a pleasure to do
   anything to exalt the name of God. It will gild your ordinary
   conversation with heavenly splendor if, in it, you adorn the doctrine
   of God your Savior in all things. You will march to Heaven beneath the
   spell of celestial music and the bliss of the glorified will stimulate
   your spirits when you can feel that all is for God, and that God is All
   in All to you. This is to delight yourself in the Almighty. God give us
   to get into that state and to stay there till we leap to Heaven and are
   in that state!

   I call your attention to the special name by which Eliphaz describes
   the ever-blessed God. He says, "Delight yourself in the Almighty." Is
   it not singular that he should choose a term descriptive of Omnipotence
   as the paramount cause of the Believer's delight? God is Love and I can
   readily understand how one might delight himself in God under that
   aspect. But the Believer is taught to delight himself in God as strong
   and mighty. What a mercy it is that there is a power that makes for
   righteousness!--that at the back of all these wars and confusions and
   behind all sin and false doctrine--there is an infinitely powerful God!
   During the last few weeks you have felt an intense joy in the
   Omnipotence of God. You have whispered to your forebodings--"It is all
   right. The Almighty is not paralyzed, His arm is not shortened: the
   Lord reigns." Brothers and Sisters, the pendulum swings to and fro,
   advancing and retreating, but yet there is a real progress made--you
   cannot see it by watching the pendulum, but up higher on the face of
   the clock there is evidence of an onward march and of a coming hour!

   The Kingdom of God is coming--righteousness shall prevail! Delight,
   also, in the fact that Jehovah is almighty in mercy--mighty to save. He
   can forgive the greatest sin. He can change the hardest heart. He can
   help us to fight out unto victory the sternest of our battles against
   unrighteousness! He is stronger than sin and Satan, for all power
   dwells with Him. When you look at this phase of it and think of His
   dear Son exalted on high to give repentance and remission of sins, you
   may, indeed, delight in the Almighty Redeemer, as "able to save them to
   the uttermost that come unto God by Him." Surely, when you see
   Omnipotence linked with righteousness and mercy, you will delight
   yourself in the Almighty!

   Think, also, of the Lord's almightiness in the matter of the keeping,
   preserving, defending and perfecting of all His people. The sheep of
   His pasture shall not perish, for the Good Shepherd is Omnipotent to
   smite the roaring lion who would devour them. None that trust in Him
   shall ever be ashamed or confounded, world without end. All the elect
   are well secured within the fold of Jesus, neither shall any pluck them
   out of His hand. Delight yourselves in the Almighty, for all the power
   of God is enlisted on the side of the Believer. To me, I confess, it is
   an intense joy that He is almighty to carry out every one of His
   eternal purposes. Jesus shall not fail nor be discouraged! That which
   Jehovah has willed shall be--in the unfolding of the great roll of
   history it shall be found that it tallies exactly with the Divine
   purposes and immutable decrees! He that sits on the flood reigns King
   forever and ever. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Let our hearts
   delight that the Lord God Omnipotent already reigns and let us pray
   that in yet, a further sense, His Kingdom may come, as come it will.
   Let us delight ourselves in the Almighty, linking that word to every
   other attribute and rejoicing that He has almighty love and Omnipotent
   Grace. Again, let us say "Hallelujah!"

   Now, let us turn with intense satisfaction to the other expression used
   by Eliphaz--"You shall lift up your face unto God." What does it mean?
   Does it not mean, first, joy in God? When a man hangs his head down, he
   is unhappy--it is the attitude of misery. But oh, when our thoughts of
   God are changed, and our relationship to God is different, we lift up
   our faces and sun our countenances in the light of God's favor! The
   face of God in His Anointed is toward the Believer and, therefore, the
   Believer's face is toward the Most High. He has said, "Seek you My
   face," and how can we seek His face but with our own faces? "Look unto
   Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth," is the Divine
   call--and the Believer looks to God with intense joy, knowing that in
   Him is his salvation!

   Does it not signify, also, that this man is reconciled to God and clear
   before Him? How can he, who is guilty, look up? Guilt makes a man hang
   his head. "Conscience makes cowards of us all." But oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, when the atoning Sacrifice has come with all its power to
   us--when we are washed in the blood of the Lamb and we are clean every
   whit--then we lift up our face unto God! In that tremendous day when
   Heaven and earth shall flee before the face of the Judge, we shall be
   bravely calm, fearing no word of doom because we are cleansed by the
   atoning Sacrifice, and justified by the righteousness in which we put
   our trust! What a blessed thing to lift up one's face unto God in
   confidence towards Him through Christ Jesus!

   Does not our text indicate fearlessness? Fear covers her face and would
   gladly hide herself, altogether, even though to accomplish concealment,
   the rocks must fall upon her. That sacred bravery which the Holy Spirit
   breathes into the child of God makes him cry, "Abba, Father," and, in
   the spirit of adoption, he lifts up his face unto God!

   May it not also signify expectation? "I will lift up my eyes unto the
   hills, from where comes my help." "My expectation is from Him," says
   David. Oh, to lift one's face toward God, looking for deliverance,
   safety and rest--and expecting both Grace and glory from His right
   hand!

   Brethren, I am talking very simply of things well known to me, and yet
   I cannot convey to you a sense of the joy of a face uplifted unto God.
   You must feel it for yourselves, by lifting up your own faces. Some of
   you poor creatures cannot lift up your faces unto God by reason of
   despondency, but we pray that you may yet do so. If you have ever
   looked unto the Lord through the glass of the Atonement, you will then
   be able to lift up your faces towards Him with a calm delight. As for
   you who are God's own people and yet go through the world in bondage, I
   charge you, cry unto the Lord to change your condition and fill you
   with His joy--for then your faces will shine in the light of His face!

   I am sure that he who has this delight in God and this lifting up of
   the face towards God, is a man that has wonderful peace with regard to
   the past. The past is forgiven, its iniquity covered, for the Lord has
   looked in love upon him. The man who walks in happy communion with God
   has a wonderful peace with regard to the present. Is it well with you?
   "Exceedingly well! God loves me, and I love Him. I am brought into
   fellowship with Him by Christ Jesus, my Lord, and we are friends, with
   a friendship which is secured by mutual delight and sealed by Covenant
   engagements, so that it can never cease to be."

   Such a man has peace with regard to the future. He has no fear of evil
   tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. He is not afraid of
   coming dangers in life, nor of the pangs of death, nor the terrors of
   judgment. When you delight in the Lord, nothing can disturb the
   unbroken current of your joy! The sublime serenity of the heavens which
   arch above your head enters into your own spirit when the Lord, who
   made the heavens, dwells in your heart! Strive after this sacred peace!
   Delight in the Almighty and lift up your faces unto God.

   II. I must close by noticing our second point, and that is, WHEN CAN WE
   REALIZE THIS? I have not confidence enough in Eliphaz to make his
   answer to the question the only one that I shall give you. I must give
   you something fuller and better than was known to him.

   First, a man can realize all this when he knows that he is reconciled
   to God. What is God's way of effecting reconciliation between a sinner
   and Himself? Every sinner is under the curse of the broken Law, for it
   is written, "Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which
   are written in the Book of the Law, to do them." No one of us has
   continued in the perfect observance of the whole Law and, therefore,
   God's righteous verdict is against us! The only way of escape from the
   curse is through the glorious Son of God who took our nature and was
   made a curse for us, as it is written, "Cursed is every one that hangs
   on a tree." He stood in our place, bore the punishment due to our guilt
   and thus became a curse on our behalf. All the sacrifices of the Jews
   were types of this--they were fingers of light pointing to the one,
   all-sufficient Sacrifice. That Sacrifice the Lord has accepted for men
   and He has set forth the Lord Jesus to be the Propitiation for our
   sins, and not for ours, only, but for the sins of the whole world, so
   that whoever believes in Jesus Christ, God's appointed Sacrifice, is
   set free from sin. And being set free from sin, he can then delight in
   the Almighty and lift up his face unto God!

   Yet even this could not effect our delight in God unless there was
   something else. So there must be, in the next place, a renewed nature.
   Our old nature will never delight in God. The carnal mind is enmity
   against God! It is not reconciled to God, neither, indeed, can be. It
   is an alien from the life of God and an alien it will always be. So,
   then, you must be born again--and when a man is born again of the
   Spirit of God and receives a new nature--that new nature delights in
   the Almighty! There is an old nature in us which still fights against
   God, but the new nature, which is of Divine origin, cries after God as
   a child after its mother. It lives in God as fish live in the sea! God
   is its element, its life, its All in All. So, Beloved, if you have been
   both reconciled and renewed. If you have felt the power of the blood of
   Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit begetting in you a new
   nature--then you can delight yourselves in God!

   In addition to this, you will delight in God much more fully when the
   Spirit bears witness with your spirit that you are born of God. The
   spirit of sonship is the spirit of delight in God. What son is afraid
   to behold his father's face? A loving child suns himself in his
   father's smile! How I have seen little children clambering up their
   father's knees looking into his face and saying, "What a dear face it
   is!" This is a faint picture of our joy in God through Jesus Christ, by
   whom, also, we have received the Atonement. What would some of you give
   to see the dear face of that dear father who was taken from you years
   ago! I can understand Cowper saying of his mother's picture--

   "Oh, that those lips had language!" Oh, that our departed ones could
   speak to us, again! But our heavenly Father always lives, so never let
   it be said that we dare not lift up our faces unto Him! We look up and
   say in our darkest moments--

   "For yet I kno w I shall Him praise, Who graciously gave to me, The
   health of my countenance, Yes, my own God is He."

   I cannot tell you the inexpressible sweetness of that last line to my
   soul. Thousands of times it has fallen from my lips. If I have nothing
   else, I have a God, and my soul lays hold on Him as Jacob grasped the
   angel. I will not let Him go! Whether He blesses me or does not bless
   me, I still will cling to Him with desperate resolve and cry, "my Lord
   and my God." This God is our God forever and ever! He shall be our God
   even unto death.

   To come back to Eliphaz and to conclude with him. We shall delight
   ourselves in God and lift up our face when we do as Eliphaz, here,
   tells us. First, when we live in communion with Him. "Acquaint, now,
   yourself with Him, and be at peace." If we do not know God, how can we
   delight in Him? What delight can there be in an unknown God? Brothers
   and Sisters, you are not half as happy as you might be because you do
   not study this Book, where, as in a glass, you may see the face of
   Jehovah your God! Oh, that you knew more of His dear Son, for he that
   has seen Him has seen the Father! Take God for your daily company.
   "Acquaint now yourself with Him." Great as He is, dare to be free with
   Him. Though you are but dust and ashes, yet, like Abraham, speak with
   Him as a man speaks with his friend, for as you know your God so shall
   you delight in Him and lift up your face unto Him.

   Then, further, we must, if we are to know this delight, lay up God's
   words in our hearts--(v. 22). "Receive, I pray you, the Law from His
   mouth and lay up His words in your heart." Your neglected Bibles hide
   your God! When dust falls on the Scriptures, dust falls on the eyes of
   those who have neglected them--and then they cannot behold the Glory of
   the Lord God. The more of Scripture is understood, fed upon and
   received into the inward parts, the more will be your delight in God!
   You can have no pleasure in the Speaker if you despise the Word
   spoken--let it be to you as marrow and fatness.

   There must be added to this delight in the Word of God a constant
   cleansing of the way. "If you return to the Almighty, you shall be
   built up, you shall put away iniquity far from your tabernacles." God
   cannot manifest Himself to us if we continue in sin. If you professing
   Christian people are as greedy and hard as other people in your dealing
   with the world--and if in your families you are as quarrelsome and
   untruthful as the ungodly--God cannot come to your tabernacles. There
   must be purification of life, or there cannot be fellowship with the
   Lord. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Impurity
   of heart will cause blindness of the eyes as to spiritual things.
   Careful walking will bring joyful walking, but if you lose your purity,
   you will lose your peace. If you are a child of God, you cannot sin
   without feeling the rod--you must obey the Lord in order to enjoy the
   Lord. Walk in the footsteps of Christ, who did always the things which
   pleased the Father, and you will receive the joyful witness--"This is
   My beloved son!" Put away sin wherever you perceive it and ask for
   Grace to be helped to detect it in all its lurking places. Seek out the
   Babylonian garment and the wedge of gold which Achan has hidden, or
   else the Lord cannot abide with you. Get rid of your idols!--

   "So shall your walk be close with God,

   Calm and serene your frame.

   So purer light shall mark the road

   That leads you to the Lamb."

   In addition to this, there must be a constant trust. "Yes, the Almighty
   shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver." (See v.
   25). He who does not trust God cannot delight in Him. You cannot lift
   up your face to Him while you think Him untrue. A childlike confidence
   is essential to a holy joy. Let us throw ourselves upon God, as a
   swimmer casts himself upon the water, that it may bear him up! Let us
   trust in God as a child trusts its mother, without the shadow of a
   question. We sometimes know a great deal too much of what we ought not
   to know. I see some of God's children very anxious to feed upon the
   tree of the knowledge of good and evil--but as for me, I am content
   with the tree of life! The old serpent still persuades men to pluck
   forbidden fruit from that evil tree!

   I know children of God who hold their hands to their heads and cry,
   "Would God we had never read that skeptical book and never learned how
   to distrust the Lord!" Let the times past suffice for the feeding of
   doubt. Let us eat no more carrion, but feed upon the salted meat of the
   Word of God! Let us quit the garlic of Egypt and feed on the manna of
   Heaven! We do not need to know what the world believes or does not
   believe, for the world lies in the Wicked One. We do not care what may
   be the spirit of the age, for the spirit of the world in all ages is
   the Prince of the power of the air,

   the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience! Be it yours
   and mine to come to Christ, to live on Him and to believe on Him with
   unstaggering faith--so shall we delight ourselves in God and lift up
   our faces to Him.

   Lastly, let us abide in continual prayer. Verse 27--"You shall make
   your prayer unto Him, and He shall hear you, and you shall pay your
   vows." Lack of prayer is a great lack, indeed! Slackness at the Mercy
   Seat will soon take away the spring and elasticity of our spiritual
   walk. If we are to have a closer walk with God, we must have closer
   communion with God in supplication.

   Now, dear children of God, I have set all this before you, but what
   power can be in my words unless the Holy Spirit blesses them? I have
   watered this sermon with strong desires for the spiritual benefit of
   you all and now I am mourning over the many who do not know anything at
   all about it! They are still devoid of the knowledge of God and of all
   desire for Him. I am very, very sorry for you. My heart pities you. We
   have heard of "the Bitter Cry" from the slums of London, and a bitter
   cry it well may be, but there is a poverty, compared with which mere
   lack of bread is riches! There is a degradation, compared with which
   the low estate of the pauper is nobility itself! To live without your
   God--how terrible a death! You know not what joy means! You have not
   begun to spell the word, "delight," until you have begun with God. True
   joy comes only from a true knowledge of the true God.

   Oh, Sirs, if I had to die like a dog, I should wish to be a Christian,
   for the sake of the bird in the hand of present delight! If there were
   no hereafter, the immediate peace and joy of trusting my God are an
   overflowing reward. But there is a hereafter and what will you ungodly
   ones do when that hereafter dawns upon you? You have done without God
   all your days and God will do without you all eternity! What terror
   lies in that fact! He will say, "Depart!" because you always did
   depart. He will decree your continuance in the path which you chose and
   bid you keep on going away from Him forever.

   He will say, "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still," and what
   more dreadful doom can fall upon any one of you? O, you immortal
   spirits, you need an immortal God! O, you that cannot cease to be, you
   need the Highest of all Beings in whom you may hide yourselves from
   ceaseless anguish! Trust in God and then shall you be filled with
   infinite happiness, but not till then. God bring you to Himself, that
   He may bring you to delight! May the uplifted Savior draw you and
   uplift you! May you begin the life of Heaven by an immediate delight in
   the Almighty--and from that delight may you never cease! To Him be
   glory forever and ever. Amen.

The Bond of the Covenant

   (No. 1840)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 10, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of
   the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an
   outstretched arm, and with fury poured out. And I will bring you into
   the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to
   face. Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land
   of Egypt, so willIplead with you, says the Lord God. And I will cause
   you topass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the
   Covenant: And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
   transgress against Me: I will bring them forth out of the country where
   they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you
   shall know that I am the Lord." Ezekiel 20:34-38.

   THIS striking utterance was given forth by that renowned Seer, Ezekiel,
   at the time when the Israelites, scattered in every country, had begun
   to forget their nationality. They judged it prudent and wise, as much
   as possible, to disguise their distinctive character and melt their
   race into the Babylonian or Chaldean--and become like the heathen. But
   God, who chose His people of old, would not have it so, and He
   interposed with this striking passage--"And that which comes into your
   mind shall not be at all, that you say, we will be as the heathen, as
   the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone." The Lord tells
   them that He had them for a people and He meant to hold them for a
   people. Whether they delighted in it or not, He would not let them go!
   He pronounced a solemn oath concerning them--"As I live, says the Lord
   God, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with
   fury poured out, will I rule over you."

   They shall no more become Babylonians than of old He would suffer them
   to become Egyptians. This passage, which I have taken for a text, may
   very truthfully be regarded as a threat of terrible judgment upon
   erring Israel--as much as if the Lord had said, "You of the house of
   Israel, whom I have made to be the type of My spiritual people, you
   shall be Mine. And if you wander from Me, I will distinguish you by
   special punishments. Therefore I now threaten you with special
   judgments. If you will attempt to mix yourselves up with the Gentiles,
   I will deal with you with a startling severity, such as I have never
   shown unto the heathen. Your sins are greater, your privileges greater
   and so shall your chastisements be greater. You, only, have I known of
   all the nations of the earth, therefore I will punish you for your
   iniquities."

   Dear Friends, it is a dreadful thing to profess to belong to the people
   of God! It is a matter of great privilege if it is true, but if it is a
   lie, it is an awful thing involving sevenfold judgment! God will cause
   His professing people to be distinguished from other men and they that
   come in among them, who are not truly of them, shall be so dealt with
   that both the ears of him that hears thereof shall tingle! Special
   severities will overtake apostate professors--therefore they had better
   know what they are doing. You cannot trifle with the Christian faith!
   You cannot be a traitor and quietly glide away--you shall be marked as
   the son of perdition! You shall be known like Judas, as one for whom it
   would have been better that he had never been born! A profession of
   Christianity, without the real possession of it, will turn out to be a
   mantle of fire to him who puts it on! Such is the run of this passage.

   But at the same time, reading between the lines and considering the
   verses very carefully, another reading is sug-gested--God, if He does
   not show distinguishing judgment, will display distinguishing Grace.
   Without twisting the passage at all, I will use the whole of it as
   setting forth that peculiar favor which God intends to exhibit towards
   His own chosen and of which they shall be the subjects, to the praise
   of the glory of His Grace. I see within this threatening black cloud, a
   bright light of infinite mercy, a silver lining of love! A golden
   thread of Grace runs through these threatening

   verses, for the Lord speaks of taking away the rebels from among His
   people but, all along, when He addresses the remnant of His people, His
   tone is that of Grace.

   He solemnly threatens judgments, but these are preparations for mercy.
   He preaches to them, by the Prophet, concerning mercy and judgment
   blended in effectual working for salvation. Lovingkindness underlies
   and overlays His wrath. He puts on a frown in order to smile. He deals
   harshly with His chosen, that He may deal safely with them-- killing
   them, that He may make them alive--piercing them with the arrows of
   conviction, that He may pour in the wine and oil of His healing
   comforts! The central part of my text is this--"I will bring you into
   the bond of the Covenant." I want briefly to explain what that means.
   Our second subject shall be the method which God often pursues with men
   when He is bringing them into this bond of the Covenant. By terrible
   things in righteousness He saves those whom He determines to bring to
   Himself!

   When we have spoken upon that matter, our third point will be the
   ultimate design of it all--of His severity in leading them by so stern
   a way and of His love in bringing them into the bond of the
   Covenant--the design is, "You shall know that I am Jehovah." Judgment
   and mercy are both intended to make men know, in their inmost souls,
   that He who thus deals with them is, indeed, the living God.

   I. First, then, the MEANING OF BRINGING MEN INTO THE BOND OF THE
   COVENANT. If we take the passage as referring to the work of Grace, it
   signifies that they shall know under what Covenant they stand. Beloved,
   there is scarcely a more important question for all of us than
   this--under which Covenant do we live? Are we under Law or under Grace?
   By the very fact of our creation, we are under bonds to our Maker to
   love and serve Him--and this is a form of the Covenant of Works. In
   serving God, we should have found happiness. In rebelling against Him,
   we have found sorrow. Thus the Covenant which was bound up with the
   very nature of things had its sanctions of reward and penalty.

   Without being strictly defined in words, the foundation of it was laid
   from the first. But God put it into words when He dealt with us in
   Adam, our first Covenant-head. He was forbidden to eat of the fruit of
   one special tree and he was warned that in the day in which he should
   eat of it, he would surely die. This Covenant was speedily broken--man
   being in honor, continued not. Our whole race in Adam broke the
   Covenant and fell from its high estate. There we lie by nature,
   condemned under the Covenant of Works. Set forth, as that Covenant is,
   in the Ten Commandments of the Law, it is as terrible as it is pure.
   The commandment is holy, just and good, but we constantly violate it.
   The perfect Law has been broken by all of us--by some it has been
   violated openly by wanton, willful acts of rebellion--by all of us it
   has been broken in heart and will. He that breaks one link has broken
   the chain. He that is guilty of one command is guilty of the whole
   Law--for it is one and indivisible.

   Now, you that are under the Law, hoping to be saved by your own works,
   see where you are--as many as are of the works of the Law are under the
   curse, for, "cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which
   are written in the book of the Law, to do them." Whatever excellencies
   you may have--and you have many in the sight of men--yet if you are
   under that Covenant of Works, your comeliness is turned into
   corruption! "This do and you shall live," is no promise to you now,
   seeing you have failed to do! It becomes to you a curse because of your
   transgressions. But there is another and a better Covenant, which is
   not a Covenant of Works at all, but of free, rich, Sovereign Grace. It
   was made of old with Christ, the second Adam, our better Covenant-Head.
   Its tenor was on this wise--He shall obey the Father's will-- actively
   and passively He shall do and suffer the will of the Most High. And, in
   doing so, He shall save those whom the Father has given Him! A great
   multitude inherit the reward of Christ's perfect obedience for, being
   chosen by God and having the Lord Jesus to be their Representative,
   they are made to live by His fulfilling and honoring of the Law.

   The great question for each one is--Am I under that New Covenant? Am I
   under that Covenant of Grace and peace?--that Covenant "ordered in all
   things and sure"? You can answer that question by this one--Are you in
   Christ Jesus? Are you resting wholly on Him, alone? If so, mark
   this--the Lord has said, by His servant Isaiah, "I have given Him for a
   Covenant to the people." If you have Christ, you are in the Covenant of
   Grace! If you are trusting in Him, God has made an everlasting Covenant
   with you, ordered in all things and sure, concerning which we read in
   your hearing, just now, both in Jeremiah 31 and in Ezekiel 36. Dwell on
   those Covenant promises! "A new heart, also, will I give you, and a new
   spirit will I put within you." And again, "And I will make an
   everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to
   do them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall
   not depart from Me."

   Oh, the blessedness of being under such a sure Covenant! This is what
   is aimed at, that God may bring His own from under the Law and place
   them under the Covenant of Grace. Though as yet they care nothing about
   it, He will bring them to know and realize that they are standing in
   the Covenant of Grace, with Christ as their Covenant-Head. The drift of
   the inward work is to lead them to accept the gift of God and so to
   come "into the bond of the Covenant."

   They shall, secondly, be led to see how this Covenant binds them to
   God. If you are in this Covenant, you belong to God and He will have
   you, for the Christ will not shed His blood in vain, nor pay a ransom
   price for that which He will not possess. He will keep to Himself the
   spoil which He has taken from the hand of the mighty--and His Father
   will give Him to see of the travail of His soul and to be satisfied. If
   you are in this Covenant, you belong to the Lord forever and neither
   shall it be possible for you to be your own, or to be the devil's. You
   are "the sheep of His pasture and the people of His hand"--and He will
   keep you as the apple of His eye and preserve you as the jewels of His
   crown. You are bound to Him if you are in the Covenant of Grace--do you
   wish to break this Covenant? Do you wish to depart from the solemn
   obligations which that Covenant of love casts upon you?

   Though this Covenant is not of works, it produces more works than the
   Covenant of Works ever could, for, being saved by Grace, it is written,
   "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the Law,
   but under Grace." Grace, and the gratitude which comes of it, form a
   firmer bond to hold the soul from straying than the hope of reward can
   possibly do! It is stronger than the fear of Hell. O, mighty Grace, you
   hold us with the cords of a man from which we never desire to escape!
   We are the Lord's people and He is our God! He holds us and we hold to
   Him. He is our Husband and our hearts are knit to Him. The bond of the
   Covenant unites us to the thrice holy God and none shall break the
   sacred union.

   To come under the bond of the Covenant means, also, to come under the
   discipline of the Covenant, for they that are in gracious Covenant with
   God will find that He deals with them as with sons and, inasmuch as He
   loves them, they shall know the truth of that Word of God--"As many as
   I love I rebuke and chasten." "If they break My Covenant," He says, "I
   will chasten them with the rod of a man." And again, "You, only, have I
   known of all the nations of the earth, therefore I will punish you for
   your iniquities." If you enter into Covenant with God and you turn
   aside, even in little matters, you shall soon discover that the Lord is
   a jealous God! If you disobey God, He will make sin bitter to you. He
   will not let you transgress as other men do-- goats may wander with
   impunity, but the sheep may not! God reserves the ungodly unto the day
   of judgment, but judgment begins even now at the house of God! His fan
   is in His hand and He will thoroughly purge His floor if He purges
   nothing else! You cannot be in Covenant with God and yet be left alone
   in your transgressions, for it is to the reprobate that He says "Let
   him alone, he is given unto idols."

   The mark of God's people is that if they sin they smart--and if they
   wander they are whipped back. Despondency, sickness, bereavement, loss
   and even temporal death may fall upon the chosen as visitations of God
   to deliver them from the power of Satan! So, you see, it is God's
   design to bring His people to know their Covenant standing, to see how
   the Covenant binds them to their God and to feel that this holds them
   under a holy discipline such as God does not exercise upon the mass of
   mankind, but only upon "a people near unto Him."

   Further, this coming under the bond of the Covenant means, surely, that
   they yield to its restraint. I do not know how to give a better
   expression to what I mean than by quoting the lines we often sing--

   "Oh to Grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be! Let that
   Grace, now, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee." Can Grace
   ever be a fetter? Oh, yes--it is the most blessed of all fetters, for
   it holds us fast--and yet never violates our liberty! It binds the very
   heart in willing captivity. This is the bond of the Covenant. "Oh,"
   says one, "I do not want to be under any bond." Then, in all
   probability, you are bound by the chains of self-will. In Grace you can
   be under bonds, yet not in bondage. I am in the bonds of wedlock, but I
   feel no bondage--on the contrary, it is a joy to be so bound! The bonds
   of love and the cords of a man cause no chaffing. The bond of Grace is
   a marriage bond, inviting us to Him whom we love above all, even the
   altogether lovely Bridegroom of our souls! It is our joy to look up to
   our Covenant-Head and obey Him in all things!

   This bond holds us back from doing what it would be to our injury to
   do. It restrains us from sinning against God. Instead of wishing to be
   free of this bond, we desire to realize it in its most stringent
   form--by being crucified with

   Christ--nailed up hands and feet so as to be incapable of following the
   wandering wishes of the unregenerate nature! O, that we were utterly
   incapable of sin! Would God we were bound to holiness as with belts of
   steel! I hope many of you feel the blessed restraint of Covenant
   relationship, so that you cry with Joseph, "How can I do this great
   wickedness and sin against God?" The love of Christ both restrains and
   impels us because we thus judge that if One died for all, then all
   died, and that He died for all that they which live might not
   henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them and
   rose again! Blessed bond of the Covenant! Oh, to wear its easy yoke and
   bow before its gentle scepter! The heart is never so free as when it is
   brought into complete captivity to the love of God. The true freedom of
   the will is freedom from sin. O, Lord, truly I am Your servant! You
   have loosed my bonds; and now I cry, "Bind the sacrifice with cords,
   even to the horns of the altar!"

   But surely, it means, also, the security of the Covenant--"I will bring
   you under the bond of the Covenant," must mean, "I will bind you to the
   Lord Jesus, your Surety and Bondsman, and He shall secure you forever."
   This Covenant is everlasting, a Covenant of Salt, hence we sing--

   "This bond shall never break,

   Though earth's old columns bow!

   Our sure foundations never shake,

   We're one with Jesus now!"

   One with Jesus we shall always be, for who shall separate us? That is a
   blessed phrase which speaks of our soul being bound up in the bundle of
   life with the soul of the Lord our God. This is what the Covenant has
   done for us--it has made us so one with Christ and in Christ; so one
   with the eternal Father, that it is written, "I will never leave you
   nor forsake you." Bound by everlasting bonds, who shall separate us
   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord? I cannot linger
   longer over this precious Truth of God, but surely it is an unspeakable
   privilege to be brought into such a Covenant bond! I trust many of you
   know by experience what it means.

   How earnestly do I pray that some who have been strangers to this
   matter may begin to spell it out this morning. Oh, you whom God means
   to save, I trust He has brought you into such a condition that you
   would give your eyes to come from under the Covenant of Works, since
   there is no salvation there! You feel it must be Grace, alone, that can
   save such unworthy creatures as you are and, though you cannot, as yet,
   see spiritual truth, you are longing and looking out for some ground of
   hope in the infinite loving kindness and long-suffering of God in
   Christ Jesus. Well, be of good cheer, for I am going to talk to you,
   now, about the way in which God deals with many whom He brings under
   the bond of the Covenant!

   II. This is our second head. THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME IN COMING UNDER THE
   BOND OF THE COVENANT. I do not want to be mistaken. I believe that many
   are brought under the bond of the Covenant by very simple and gentle
   means, especially those who sweetly yield to the gentle drawings of the
   Holy Spirit. Very early in life some are brought to Jesus with little
   terror or distress of mind. Let them be very grateful for it. If you
   come to Christ, I do not care how you come, for I am sure you could not
   have come at all if the Father had not drawn you and if He has drawn
   you, there is no mistake in your method of coming! If you have tasted
   but little of the bitterness of sin because you have been kept from it
   by preventing Grace, do not raise a question on that account. Though
   you may not have been made to sit and sigh in the blackness of
   darkness, it is enough if you now see the great Light of God. The Lord,
   in great tenderness, brings many of His children to Himself early in
   the morning, so early that they enjoy a long and blessed day in His
   service--and they are strangers to those broken bones which come of a
   long sojourn in the enemy's camp.

   These Israelites to whom Ezekiel spoke had gone very far into sin, as
   far as they could go--they had been false to their promises, wicked in
   their lives and rebellious in heart against their God. With many of
   this character, the Lord deals with a singular severity of love. He
   strikes them with a sword, for only so can their sins be slain. Of
   those processes of Grace we will now speak.

   To begin, will you follow me in the text at the 34th verse? Here were a
   people whom God had chosen to be His own, but they had ignored that
   choice and had said to themselves that they would be like the families
   of the countries, to serve gods of wood and stone. Many among those
   whom the Lord has chosen in His secret purposes are saying to
   themselves, "We will never belong to those religious people; we will
   never be called cants, hypocrites, Methodists, or Presbyterians." They
   have a perfect horror of being ridiculed for Christ's sake! These
   persons are, for the present, perfectly satisfied to

   take their lot with the multitude--distinguishing Grace has no charms
   for them. Hear, then, what God will do with such if He means to bring
   them under the bond of the Covenant!

   First, He will cause them to come out from their present company. "I
   will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the
   countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an
   outstretched arm, and with fury poured out." You do not mean to leave
   your present settlement, but you shall come out of it once and for all.
   You shall feel yourself to be as a speckled bird among your former
   associates. The Lord will make you to loathe the amusements which are
   now your delight--and the lusts of the flesh--which you now follow
   after as the fish hastens to the bait, shall become abominations to
   you! You shall find in your old sins such death and corruption that you
   shall turn from them as a man turns from a rotting carcass. God can
   readily enough accomplish this by ways known to Himself. Your old
   friends will not miss you and, what is more, they will not desire you
   to return to them! You shall be so miserable that they will be glad to
   be rid of you! As the wounded stag retires into the depths of the
   forest to bleed and die, alone, because those which are not wounded
   roughly push at it with their horns, so it shall be with you--you shall
   prefer solitude to the galling words of the ungodly.

   If the Lord has chosen you and you have chosen sin, He will deal with
   you with a strong hand and an outstretched arm--and make you know His
   fury against evil. His love to you shall show itself in wrath against
   your sin. You shall come to think of God as angry with the wicked every
   day, for so He is. You shall hear that sentence sounding in your ears,
   "If he turns not, He will whet His sword. He has bent His bow and made
   it ready." What is more, you shall not only read the words, but you
   shall feel the arrows of vengeance sticking fast in you, till you long
   to escape from your transgressions.

   The Israelites in Egypt, for a time, were glad to dwell there and they
   began to worship the gods of Egypt. But presently God put it into
   Pharaoh's heart to oppress them--and he did so most grievously--Israel
   had to make bricks without straw till their bondage grew unbearable and
   they cried unto the Lord their God. He will make it so with you, if you
   are one of His, for out of the Egypt of the world you shall come. You
   may get the flavor of the leeks and the garlic and the onions of Egypt
   upon your palate and delight in then, but you shall yet be made to
   nauseate that in which you de-light--and long for heavenly manna which
   you now despise! The Lord Jesus will seek out His own sheep and
   separate them from all other flocks.

   Note, next, that God said He would bring them into distress and
   loneliness--"And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people."
   It was not to be a wilderness like the wilderness of sin where there
   were no inhabitants, but, "I will bring you into the wilderness of the
   people." This is, indeed, a terrible wilderness, for you walk in the
   midst of crowds and yet you are perfectly alone--you mingle with the
   great congregation and yet feel that none can enter into your secret.
   How wretched to sit here and feel that there is not another man like
   you in all this vast assembly! You have come into a howling wilderness
   where there is no water of joy, or track of hope. Where now your mirth
   and giddiness? Where now your comrades in iniquity? The Lord can soon
   make the gay worldling into the desponding solitary. I have seen Him
   touch proud young men and they have been brought to deep humiliation of
   spirit, so as to be glad to sit down like little children and learn the
   way of the Kingdom of God! Oh, you stiff-necked, hard-hearted
   sinners--if God's almighty love goes forth, He will soon turn your
   hearts of stone into flesh till you become ready to weep yourselves
   away because you have grieved your Savior!

   Many here can remember when they were in that condition--when the
   ministry seemed a wilderness! They went up to hear the Word of God
   preached and, while others were converted, they were not! The Bible,
   itself, seemed to be a wilderness--when they read it they found no
   comfort. The Book appeared to thunder at them! Great pieces of ordnance
   were fired against their consciences out of its Law. They turned to
   Christian friends and, sometimes, to unchristian friends--but from
   neither the one nor the other could they obtain any help! No man
   understood them--they did not understand themselves! "They wandered in
   the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in." Like
   the Jews in Babylon, they sat down and wept. Then was fulfilled in them
   this Word of God--"I will bring you into the wilderness of the people."
   This is God's way of bringing men to Himself. He digs them up by the
   roots, that He may remove them and plant them by the rivers of waters
   in the garden of the Lord.

   Read on. What does He say next?--"And there will I plead with you face
   to face." Brothers and Sisters, you that know what this means by
   experience must help me out, for I cannot describe it in words. When
   the Lord becomes so realized to

   the guilty conscience that there seems to be nothing anywhere except
   God and that poor sinner, face to face with one another, then there is
   a time of fear and trembling, indeed! For God to stand face to face
   with an unpardoned sinner and plead with Him is a matter of deep
   solemnity. Do you know it? The sinner then cries out with Job, "I have
   heard of You by the hearing of the ear: but now my eyes see You. Why, I
   abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." If the Lord does but let
   loose His terrors upon men's minds and deals with them hand to hand,
   then their beauty is consumed like the moth! The poor preacher tried
   often to touch their proud hearts, but he could not reach them. But
   when God comes, by His Holy Spirit, as a spirit of bondage and begins
   to plead with them face to face, they are right speedily low in the
   dust! They know not how to answer the Lord for one of a thousand of the
   sins which He presses upon their consciences! When He lays judgment to
   the line and righteousness to the plummet, the hail soon sweeps away
   their refuges of lies! If I could have been saved by finding one excuse
   for my sin when I was under conviction, I could not have discovered it.
   I was without excuse. I knew that I was guilty and I wondered that I
   was not sent to Hell then and there! When once God pleaded with me,
   "face to face," there was no help for it but to plead guilty at once.

   The Lord further declares He will plead with them as He pleaded with
   their fathers in the wilderness. How did He do that? Why, very terribly
   indeed! Certain men had rebelled against God and against Moses--and God
   said, "Hang up their heads in the face of the sun." At another time
   when certain of them rebelled against Aaron, the earth opened and
   swallowed them up--and Korah, Dathan, and Abiram went down alive into
   the Pit. Once the Lord pleaded with them by sending fiery serpents
   among them--and multitudes were bitten and died. At another time the
   pestilence multiplied graves at each resting place. He brought them
   very low by these terrible pleadings! Had not Moses stood in the gap,
   as mediator, and had not Aaron intervened as a faithful High Priest,
   they had been utterly consumed! Truly the Lord pleaded with them by
   terrible things in righteousness!

   Beloved, broken-hearted Hearer, are you passing through that stage? Is
   God pleading with you in that fashion? Does He bring judgment after
   judgment upon you? Do His threats follow each other like peals of
   thunder? Has He burned up all your comfort? Has He scorched and
   withered all your confidence? Are you brought unto the dust of death?
   Do you cry out, "My soul chooses strangling rather than life! Day and
   night Your hand is heavy upon me. My moisture is turned into the
   drought of summer"? Believe me, you are not alone in such a dread
   experience--many of God's dear children have traversed this valley of
   death shade and, by this road, they have been brought under the bond of
   the Covenant! It is not that God loves to treat us thus, for He does
   not afflict willingly, but, like a wise father He will not spare the
   rod and spoil the child. Self-confidence must be killed! Carnal
   confidences must be destroyed! Self-righteousness must be slain. The
   Lord will turn your sweetness into bitterness and your light into
   darkness, that you may be fully weaned from your own ways and may be
   made willing to be saved by Sovereign Grace.

   What more does God do? Well, it is said, "And I will cause you to pass
   under the rod." What is this passing under the rod? I have frequently
   seen sheep, when the shepherd has required to count them--he makes them
   pass through a half-opened gate and there he numbers them. They would
   all come rushing through, but the shepherd blocks the way and, as they
   come out, one by one, he touches them with his staff and so counts
   them. The Lord makes His chosen to pass through a narrow place, even a
   strait gate, where only one can come at a time--and then and there He
   counts them and causes them to give an account of themselves
   individually. You have been hidden away among the thousands, but now
   you shall be made to appear as a separate individual and so you shall
   come under the rod of the Lord and be numbered with His flock. Perhaps
   you are frightened, as the sheep are when the shepherd counts them, for
   they think they are all going to be killed--but there is far more room
   for comfort than for dismay--for that which God counts, He values, and
   if He visits you with special chastisement it is because He has special
   designs of Grace towards you which you shall understand, by-and-by!

   Then mark this--as the shepherd, by counting his own sheep, declares
   and exercises his right of possession, so the Lord, when He wakes up
   our minds to feel our personality, causes us to recognize that we are
   not our own, but are bought with a price. What a blessed knowledge that
   is when we discover that we are not our own, for in it lies the
   brightest hope for us! If I had been my own, I would have been lost! It
   is because I am the Lord's that I shall not be lost, for He will not
   lose the Father's gift, or His own purchase. They are kept by the power
   of God, through faith, unto salvation, even as Jesus says, "I give unto
   My sheep eternal life and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of My hand." This is to come under the rod--to be
   counted one by one--and to be accounted to belong to God alone.

   Moreover, we come under the rod of rulership, for a rod, in the old
   time, was the usual scepter of kings. What a blessed thing it is when a
   man comes under the rulership of Christ--when he cries--

   "I yield--by Sovereign Grace subdued; Who can resist its charms? And
   throw myself, by wrath pursued Into my Sa vior's arms!"

   "I will bring you under the rod." That is, "I will make you to yield
   willing obedience to My Law and Word." It means, also, the rod of
   chastisement. "Happy is the man whom God corrects." Let the afflicted
   rejoice in his adversities instead of being cast down by them, for,
   "whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He
   receives."--

   "The path of sorrow, and that path alone,

   Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown."

   "I will bring you under the rod."

   Now, have I been describing the experience of any person here? I feel
   sure I have! Thousands who will read these words will leap for joy as
   they exclaim, "This is precisely where I am! I said, 'Surely He is
   going to destroy me,' but if this is the way in which the Lord brings
   me under the bond of the Covenant, I will forever bless His name!" May
   the Holy Spirit apply these, my words, to all the prisoners of hope!

   III. But time fails me, so I must close by noticing THE ULTIMATE DESIGN
   OF ALL THIS. This bringing them under the bond of the Covenant has a
   grand intent in it.

   The first design is evident in the text--it is to bind them to God. We
   would have gone astray long ago and entirely left our God, if it had
   not been for our bitter experience when the Lord was making Himself
   known to us. In later life, all the better crops come in from having a
   deep plowing before the seed is sown. I bear the scars of my terrible
   convictions about me to this day--and they prevent my trifling with
   sin. When I came to Christ, my soul was stripped to the skin-- not a
   rag of my own righteousness or of my own strength remained upon me. I
   was worse than a beggar! I was utterly destitute and did not even know
   how to beg.

   It seems to me that some of my Brothers and Sisters came to Christ with
   a good coat on and have never ceased to wear it under their Grace-given
   robes. Too many are unable to say, "Grace," without stuttering. But
   when a man's mouth has been washed out with the wormwood of
   self-humiliation, it is a fine thing for his pronunciation--he can say,
   "Grace," I will guarantee you--and give it a full emphatic sound! If
   anybody had said to me, "You are a saved soul and the Lord has put away
   your sin, but your salvation is the result of a good, natural
   disposition," I am afraid I would have proved the reverse by calling
   him a liar to his face! It would have angered me to hear such a
   falsehood! Grace, alone, has made me to differ and saved me through
   faith in Christ Jesus. I cannot go any further, my Brothers and
   Sisters. My highly-intelligent, cultured Brethren may go where they
   like, but I must abide with the Doctrines of Grace! The march of proud
   human intellect will end with the devil, but I am bound, in all
   sincerity, to continue where I began, namely, with Free Grace.

   Where else can I go? Nowhere else is there for me a beam of light, or a
   ray of comfort. Rock of Ages, I am secure on You! But once off that
   foundation, I sink in quicksand. Much of our smarting experience in
   coming home to God is meant to bring us under the bond of the Covenant
   so that we shall never leave it again. We have had such a drilling and
   dressing that the very thought of any other salvation but that which is
   of Grace is detestable to us.

   The next design of God is that He may entirely separate His people from
   the world. "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
   transgress against Me." When God makes His servants to bitterly know
   the evil fruit of sin, then they no longer hunger for that forbidden
   fruit. "Oh, you are straight-laced," says one. Indeed, we are, where
   sin is concerned! A boy climbed into a neighbor's garden and stole
   unripe plums and, after eating them, he became very ill and was forced
   to drink pints of horrible medicine to save his life. When he was
   better, his school fellows said to him, "Come with us and steal some
   plums," but they seemed to be mocking him. The boy is very
   straight-laced, is he not? He remembers the gripes and the pains which
   those plums brought him and he will have no more of them! The burnt
   child dreads the fire. Thus the Lord often brings His people away from
   their sins by giving them sharp and cutting experiences of what evil
   will do for them. If such is the present consequences of sin, they
   begin to guess what sin will bring them when they come into judgment
   and condemnation on account of it.

   Furthermore, the Lord chastens His people, thus, that He may bring them
   into their own land of promise into the rest of His love. Whereas this
   text tells us of the rebels--that they shall not enter into the land of
   Israel--it is implied that those who obey the Divine command shall
   enter into the land of promise and peace. Blessed be God for the land
   of promise into which we enter by faith! What a subject! I wish I had a
   week in which to preach upon it! When you quit the desert of Sinai, or
   the Covenant of Works, you enter into the land of promise, or the
   Covenant of Grace--and then you plead the precious promises of God and
   realize the riches of His Grace to the delight of your soul! Then is it
   true, "so shall you dwell in the land and verily you shall be fed." But
   no man ever gets to live upon the promise of God until, first of all,
   he is weaned from all self-reliance and all self-glorying. When God has
   stamped self with the seal of death and we have seen destruction
   written upon all carnal confidence, then we are glad to accept as a
   gift that which we can never win as a reward!

   The table of Covenant-Grace is loaded when, in all the land of human
   merit, there remains not a morsel of bread! None so joyfully enter into
   the land of Grace as those who are weary of the wilderness and can find
   no rest in their own doings. As the way to Canaan was across a desert,
   so the way to the Covenant is often by a bitter experience. And as the
   land that flows with milk and honey was all the lovelier because of the
   howling wilderness, so is Grace all the more precious because of the
   utter failure of self!

   Last of all, the great end of all is that we may know the Lord. I speak
   thoughtfully when I say I fear that large numbers of professors do not
   know the Lord. That is to say, the Lord Jehovah--as known to Ezekiel,
   is not known by many who profess to believe in the true God. Jehovah,
   the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--is the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. But He is not the god of the 19th Century. This
   generation has made a god of its own. The effeminate deity of the
   modern school is no more the true God than Dagon or Baal. I know him
   not, neither do I reverence him! Jehovah is the true God--He is the God
   of Love--but He is also robed in Justice. He is the God of forgiveness,
   but He is also the God of Atonement. He is the God of Heaven, but He is
   also the God who sends the wicked down to Hell. We, of course, are
   thought to be harsh, narrow-minded and bigoted--nevertheless, this God
   is our God forever and ever. There has been no change in Jehovah! He
   has revealed Himself more clearly in Christ Jesus, but He is the same
   God as in the Old Testament--and as such we worship Him.

   When a man has smarted because of his sin and has been made to feel the
   burning coals of anguish in his own spirit. When the Lord has set him
   up as a target and shot at him with arrows which drink up his life.
   And, when afterwards he has been saved and the splendor of infinite
   love has shone upon him, then he knows Jehovah! When God has brought
   the contrite man into the place of security, comfort, joy and delight
   in Christ Jesus, then he knows the Lord! The full-orbed Deity is beheld
   by the broken and contrite in the day of his deliverance--neither does
   he know which to adore and admire most--the power, the wisdom, the
   justice, or the Grace of God! We love everything that is in God when we
   are brought under the bond of the Covenant. May God bless this word to
   many sorrowing spirits, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

Divine Forgiveness Admired and Imitated

   (No. 1841)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 17, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a
   quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you."
   Colossians 3:13.

   To whom is this exhortation addressed? The Apostle told us in the 12th
   verse--"Elect of God, holy and beloved." Here are three particulars.
   They are, first of all, "elect of God," that is to say, chosen
   according to His eternal purpose. They are made choice ones by being
   thus chosen. Next, they are sanctified by the Spirit of God and are,
   therefore, called "holy"--this holiness appertaining to their persons
   and their pursuits, their calling and their conversation. When the
   Spirit of God has fully done His work, He sheds abroad in their hearts
   the love of God, so that experimentally they feel themselves to be
   "beloved." To abide in the love of God is the fruit of election and the
   result of holiness. If any of you can, with humble confidence, claim
   these three titles, "elect of God, holy and beloved," you are among the
   most favored of all mankind! The Father has made of you a special
   choice! In you His Holy Spirit has worked a special work and you
   possess, within your souls, the special joy of living in the love of
   God! "Elect of God, holy and beloved"--it is as you enjoy these three
   things that you will find it easy to carry out the precept which is now
   set before you, "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if
   anyone has a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also
   do you."

   Note in our text, before we proceed to the full discussion of it, what
   an honor this Scripture puts upon our Lord Jesus Christ. In Ephesians
   4:32 a similar precept is placed in a rather different form, for it
   runs thus--"Even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you." Here, as
   if to show the true and proper equality of the Christ with God, it is
   written, "Even as Christ forgave you." In the Revised Version they
   read, "even as the Lord forgave you," but they place in the margin,
   "Many ancient authorities read Christ." In that case we see that Lord
   and Christ were interchangeable terms when those ancient authorities
   were alive. None can forgive sins but God. He alone forgives against
   whom the sin is committed. Sin, therefore, being against Christ and
   Christ being able to forgive it, we see that He is exalted on high to
   give remission of sins. He shares in the high and royal prerogative of
   God, seeing He is able to forgive sin.

   Does not this expression seem to say that albeit the Apostle and other
   inspired writers had many things to write of, yet one thing was always
   upon their hearts, namely, to honor their Lord? Is not this a proof of
   how thoroughly they were under the influence of the Spirit of God, of
   whom Jesus said, "He shall glorify Me"? Whatever He is teaching,
   whatever duty He is enforcing, whatever promise He is delivering, the
   Holy Spirit takes care to do it so that the Lord Jesus Christ is
   exalted in the hearts of His people! Let us, in our hearts, adore the
   Anointed One, Christ Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God--and never let
   us hesitate to honor the Son even as we honor the Father. Let us, as
   penitents, adore the pardoning Savior, seeing He has power to forgive
   sins and has cleansed the myriads of His redeemed from all their
   iniquities.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, while this gives glory to Christ, what a
   weight is lent to the precept, since it is supported by the example and
   the authority of our Divine Lord--"Even as Christ forgave you, so also
   do you." What a model is set before us! How perfect is that spirit of
   love which we are to manifest! Even as Christ forgave us, we are bid to
   forgive others. What nobler pattern could have been chosen? Surely He
   that trifles with this precept, or thinks it one that is left to our
   option--to obey or to neglect--cannot rightly know the dignity of the
   Christ in whose pierced hands this Law is held forth before our eyes!
   Depend upon it, this command, so wondrously linked with the Person of
   the pardoning Christ, is of no common importance. If the Law given by
   Moses was so solemnly binding, what shall we say of this Law which is
   embodied in the life of the Lord Jesus?

   Surely I shall scarcely need to plead with you, who are His disciples,
   that you give your heart's best attention to such teaching! Your Lord,
   Himself, stands before you! You remember how He forgave you all your
   trespasses? Then I am sure you will give earnest heed to His
   exhortation to forgive. May the dove-like Spirit now brood over this
   assembly and create love in all our bosoms.

   Two things are to be done. First, let us study the pattern of
   forgiveness here set before us. And then, secondly, let us copy it for
   ourselves in our forgiveness of those who trespass against us.

   I. Carefully STUDY THE PATTERN OF FORGIVENESS set before us in the
   text. "Even as Christ forgave you, so also do you." What is this
   forgiveness of Christ? You know how He exhibited it in His daily life.
   He was much tried, but He was never provoked to wrath. Both by friends
   and by enemies He was made to suffer, yet He neither accused the one
   nor the other to His great Father. He never reviled those who reviled
   Him, but patiently yielded to their malice, giving His back to the
   smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. His disciples
   He gently rebuked, but He never spoke to them in anger. A life of
   forgiveness was crowned by His dying prayer for His persecutors,
   "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." He loved His
   enemies. He lived for His enemies. He died for His enemies. He was
   Incarnate gentleness, the mirror and paragon of forgiveness.

   Observe, also, that He forgave offenses most great and grievous. It was
   a horrible thing that when the Lord Jesus came into the world, moved by
   pure love, He was not welcomed, but Herod sought to slay the young
   Child. Afterwards, when He appeared publicly among men, the Jews took
   up stones to stone Him. He was treated with contumely. His miracles
   were ascribed to the devil and His holy and unspotted Character was
   traduced by His being called a drunk and a winebibber. He was the
   firstborn of the Lord of the vineyard, but when the husbandmen saw Him,
   they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill Him and the inheritance
   shall be ours." You know with what scornful cruelty they treated Him in
   the hour of His passion. What could the malice of Hell have invented
   more contemptuous and cruel than that which men used towards the
   Well-Beloved? Had He been the basest of beings, His sufferings would
   have been too cruel. Men did all they could against Him.

   Say not that you have never thus transgressed. Oh, Sirs, we, also, have
   crucified Him, for our sins were laid upon Him by Jehovah. We, also,
   must confess, "He was despised and we esteemed Him not." There was a
   time when we, who are now His followers, once "hid, as it were, our
   faces from Him." He called us, but we gave Him no answer! He wooed us,
   but we were blind to His beauties! We can never remember this without
   deep emotions of regret. We used no other friend so evilly. We
   crucified Him and slew Him, as far as we were able to do it, by our
   rejection of His love. And yet He has forgiven us! He is ready to
   forgive all such as seek His face. Oh, the splendor of that love which
   blots out sins like ours! What a flood of Grace is this which rises
   above the tops of the mountains of our sins and covers them forever!

   It matters not how black or crimson our transgressions may have been,
   the moment we come to Jesus He makes us whiter than snow! He puts away
   the most horrible of offenses, the most glaring of transgressions in a
   moment! He says, "I forgive you. Go and sin no more"--and we, then and
   there--receive a perfect pardon! I would that all of you who have never
   sought that Grace would be induced by this blessed fact to come with
   all your sins and receive immediate absolution from the hand of your
   Lord!

   Remember, also, to increase your wonderment at His forgiveness, that
   these offenses which were committed against Christ were altogether
   wanton and unprovoked. He could demand of His adversaries, "For which
   of those works do you stone Me?" Towards no man had He acted unjustly
   or even harshly. He had been all tenderness and lowliness in every
   place towards all sorts of men--and yet certain men became incensed
   against Him because of His goodness! Did they refuse to love Him
   because He was altogether lovely? Did they despise Him because He was
   so truly great? Such is the depravity of the human heart, that the very
   virtues of Christ provoked the hostility of men! What has my Lord
   Christ ever done against any of you? Why do you refuse Him?

   I have heard many a man say, "If I had done anything whatever to
   provoke this ill-will, I could account for it, but they persecute me
   wrongfully." It was pre-eminently so in the case of our Lord, who says
   in the Psalm, "They hated Me without a cause." Yet He forgave this
   wanton malice! He continues to forgive such causeless wrong. With His
   own blood, He blots out horrible insults against Himself, His people,
   His Gospel and His love. Even you who oppose His Kingdom and refuse His
   service shall be, at once, forgiven, if you will bow your hearts before
   Him and accept that rich mercy which

   His hand is so ready to bestow! See what a pattern is here of the
   passing-by of the greatest and most malicious offenses! How can hatred
   live in the Presence of such love?

   Christ has shown this pardon to the most unworthy persons. Of all whom
   He forgave when He was here below, none deserved such kindness. In
   fact, to talk of deserving forgiveness is a contradiction in terms!
   Certainly in me--and I have no doubt in you, my Brothers and
   Sisters--who have tasted of His infinite mercy, there was no presence
   of claim to His mercy in our cases. If He had left us in our sin. If He
   had passed by us and allowed us to perish, what complaint could we have
   brought against Him? Since He loved us and forgave us, it must have
   been because of something within Himself--it could not have been from
   anything in us! We are unworthy, but He is gracious--and herein He
   teaches us to pardon the most provoking and worthless of those who
   trespass against us.

   Be it never forgotten that He always had the power to have executed
   vengeance upon any one of us if He had been pleased to do so. Some men
   pardon because they cannot punish--they are too weak to execute
   vengeance and, therefore, they refrain from it. Half the forgiveness in
   the world comes from a feeble hand rather than from a forgiving heart.
   But the Christ could have crushed His adversaries in a moment if He had
   willed it, and yet He freely forgave! When they said, "Come down from
   the Cross"--suppose He had instantly loosed the nails and leaped among
   them--where had they been, then? They would have begged the rocks to
   fall upon them and the mountains to cover them from His face if He had
   but manifested the glory of His power! But He was not provoked to leave
   the Cross, or to break the silence of His passion by so much as a
   rebuke. Mercy was stored like honey in His heart and pardon dropped its
   sweetness from His lips.

   The Lord has been greatly long-suffering with ourselves when a breath
   might have destroyed us. We might easily have been destroyed in
   accidents which befell us, or we might have died in our various
   sicknesses and so have sunk to the lowest Hell. But instead of slaying
   us, our Lord even interposed to spare us--to spare us when our life was
   rebellion! When He could so easily have blotted out our lives, He did
   not do so, but in boundless mercy blotted out our sins. Let us magnify
   His amazing Grace and imitate it in our lives.

   I want you, for a moment, to consider the question, How did He forgive?
   The manner of our Lord's forgiveness is as noteworthy as the pardon,
   itself. The Lord Jesus came and pardoned us when that act of Grace was
   unsolicited! Before we had thought of mercy, He had thoughts of mercy
   toward us! I remember reading in one of our magazines a story of a city
   missionary who discovered a poor girl who had wandered from the ways of
   virtue. He had sought to restore her to a better life. He spoke with
   her till she became somewhat tender of heart. He enquired about her
   family and learned that she had once enjoyed a happy home and had known
   a tender father's love. "But he would never look at me now," she said.
   "I am sure he never would--I am such a degraded creature that I could
   not venture near his door." "Have you never written to him?" "No, I
   could not write to him. It would be of no use. I could not expect him
   to send me an answer and it would break my heart to be refused."

   "We will try," said the good man, "we will write to him." He wrote to
   the father and the next post brought back an answer, with the word,
   "Immediate," written upon the envelope. The sum of the letter enclosed
   within was, "Ready to forgive." She was taken to her father. She was
   soon locked in his embrace. All was forgiven--the wanderer was
   restored! Notice that her father had been praying for her, night and
   day, ever since she left his roof--and he had longed to receive her to
   his home again. Her seeking his forgiveness did not cause it--it was in
   his heart long before--and no doubt it was because of his cries and
   tears that God, in mercy, touched his girl's heart and brought her
   home. O Sinner, before you think of Christ, He has thoughts of love
   towards you! He says, "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
   transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return unto Me; for I have
   redeemed you." The forgiveness is first and the returning to the Lord
   is urged as a consequence of that forgiveness! Pardon is not first in
   the matter of our personal experience, but it is first as matter of
   fact with God. Oh! the mercy of the Lord Christ, that before we know
   our sin, He has made atonement for it by His own precious blood!

   The Lord Jesus Christ is to be held up as an example of pardoning love
   for the true and hearty way in which He forgives sin. Forgiveness, when
   it comes from human lips in measured, studied phrases, is not worth
   having, for the heart is not in it, or it would be more free and
   joyful. The Lord Jesus Christ absolves sinners with all His heart. He
   never acts in a cold, formal manner. Never does He outwardly forgive
   and in secret retain His wrath--but wholly, entirely, joyfully, He puts
   away the sin of those whom He forgives--and puts it away forever! When
   He forgives, He forgives the whole of our faults, follies, failures and
   offenses. There is a certain solidarity about sin, so that it makes up
   one lump. I read the other

   day of a certain theologian speaking of Christ having put away original
   sin while He left actual sin. Nonsense! Sin is one and indivisible!
   Iniquity is not to be done up in separate parcels. The sin, the
   iniquity of men, is spoken of in the Bible as one thing. Although we
   sin multitudes of times, the various streams all flow into one sea of
   evil--when sin is forgiven, all sin is put away--not a shred, nor
   fragment, nor particle remains! The Lord Jesus drowns all the hosts of
   sin in the depths of the sea and the whole of our guilt is swallowed up
   forever. This is great forgiveness, indeed! Glory be to Him who gives
   it! Let us follow Him in His truth and heartiness.

   This forgiveness, again, is given by the Lord Jesus Christ in the most
   complete possible manner. He keeps no back reckonings. He retains no
   reserves of anger. He so forgives that He forgets. That is the wonder
   of it! He says, "I will not remember your sins." He casts them behind
   His back--they are wholly and completely gone from His observation or
   regard. Alas, such is poor human nature that even fathers, when they
   have forgiven a wayward child, will, perhaps, throw the offense in his
   teeth years after when he again offends. But it is never so with
   Christ. He says, "Your sins shall not be mentioned against you any
   more, forever." He has done with the sins of His people in so effectual
   a way that not a whisper concerning them shall ever come from His mouth
   so as to grieve them. They will, themselves, remember their sins with
   deep repentance, but the Lord will never challenge them on account of
   their past rebellions. Blessed be the name of Christ for such complete
   forgiveness as this!

   The Lord Jesus Christ forgives His people in a continuous manner. He
   forgave us long ago--He still forgives us. He does not forgive and
   afterwards accuse. His forgiveness is eternal. It is not a reprieve He
   gives to you, believing ones, but a free pardon, under the King's hand
   and seal, which shall effectually protect you from accusation and
   punishment. "In those days, and in that time, says the Lord, the
   iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
   the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them
   whom I reserve." He has finished transgression, made an end of sin and
   brought in everlasting righteousness. Send to Hell a pardoned sinner?!
   It were a contradiction to the very nature of God! Condemn those for
   whom Jesus died?! Why, the Apostle mentions that death as a conclusive
   answer to the challenge, "Who is he that condemns? It is Christ who
   died, yes, who is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,
   who also makes intercession for us." How shall He intercede for us and
   yet accuse us? It is impossible for Christ to be both Redeemer and
   Condemner to the same persons. So perfect is His pardon that our sin
   has ceased to be! He has put away sin forever by the sacrifice of
   Himself.

   Greatly do I admire the very gracious way in which that pardon is
   given. Some people offer forgiveness in an ungracious way. They make it
   appear that they are coming down from such awful heights when they
   forgive a fellow mortal. In great dignity they march down in state from
   their own splendid innocence to the poor Brother who has done them a
   wrong--as good as saying, "I will condescend to do this, though it is
   an awful stoop for such an angelic being as I am." You never feel that
   about the Christ, for He places His pardon down so low that He seems to
   say, "Receive My mercy, I beg you to receive it." He speaks as if He
   were favored by a sinner's accepting His forgiveness! He humbles
   Himself and never scalds a sinner with scornful pity.

   Though the Christ condescends more than all the condescensions of all
   men put together, "for worms were never raised so high above their
   meanest fellow worms," yet the condescension is so real and royal that
   there is no ostentation in it! He is born to the manner--He condescends
   naturally, like condescension's own self. Some are most proud when they
   stoop, but Jesus graciously seems to put Himself on a level with us,
   yes, and even to go lower than we are, that He may lift us up! Admire
   as much the way in which Christ forgives as the forgiveness which He
   bestows. It breaks my heart to think what a loving Christ He was to me
   when I sought His forgiveness. Truly, "He gives liberally and upbraids
   not"--He frowned and thundered when I looked to my own
   righteousness--but when I turned to His Gospel of Free Grace, I had
   from Him not even a hard word--He was all love and tenderness to me,
   the chief of sinners!

   Above all, the greatness of His forgiveness is seen in the fact that
   the offense had brought great trouble into the world and He bore that
   trouble. The sinner, by his wrong doing, had subjected himself to great
   loss and calamity. Now, when we forgive a person who has done us a
   wrong, we say, "I freely forgive you, but you have involved yourself in
   certain consequences which you will have to bear, and out of these I
   cannot help you." Our blessed Master seemed to say, Sinner, you have
   sinned yourself under the curse of God. You have sinned yourself into
   misery and into death--and as the proof that I do freely forgive you--I
   will take all this suffering and this death upon Myself. You have done
   the wrong wantonly and wickedly, but I will bear the consequences. You
   have knotted the whips, but they shall scourge My shoul-

   ders. You have sharpened the nails, but they shall pierce My hands and
   feet. You have put yourself under curse and penalty, but I will bear
   the curse of death that you may be free."

   Was there ever mercy like this? Do not all who know this love accept it
   gladly? Sinner, do you not know this? Have you never heard about it?
   Know you not that the Lord, even Jesus, the Son of God, is able to
   forgive you all your tres-passes--that it will be a joy to His heart to
   do so--and to do it at once? Oh, that before that clock shall strike
   again you may be able to say, "There is, therefore, now no
   condemnation, for Christ has put away my sin." This is not according to
   the manner of men--it is Godlike! It is a sure proof that Jesus is the
   Son of God, for who could act like this but One who is Himself the Son
   of God?

   Thus have I set before you, in my poor way, this great forgiveness and
   the manner of it. I trust you have had an experience of it. Assuredly
   we all need such forgiveness--do any of you deny it? May the Holy
   Spirit open your blind eyes and melt your hard hearts. According to the
   text, those who have received pardon know that they have it, for Paul
   speaks positively--"Even as Christ forgave you"--as if it were a matter
   of fact well known among the people of God. There is a theory abroad
   that we may be forgiven and not know it--that Jesus may forgive and we
   may never discover it until we come to our dying moments. That is a
   wretched kind of Gospel! By the true Gospel we may know we are forgiven
   and be sure of it--surer than if we saw, written by the autograph of
   Christ, the words--"I have forgiven you." The eyes may deceive, but the
   witness of the Spirit of God within the heart can never delude us! If
   you believe that Jesus is the Christ and if you are resting, alone, on
   Him, your sins, which are many, are forgiven you, "for the blood of
   Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin." In knowing that we
   are forgiven by Christ, let us be clear and decided in our forgiveness
   of others--not only in word--but in deed and in truth let us exhibit a
   forbearing spirit.

   II. You see your example. Our second word is, COPY IT FOR YOURSELVES.
   If the Holy Spirit enables you to write according to this copy, you
   will have the approval of the Lord resting upon you. See how large and
   clear the letters are! It will be no small success if you can reproduce
   them. "Even as Christ forgave you"--the imitation should be as exact as
   possible. Mark the, "even," and the, "so," and endeavor to keep up with
   your gracious Lord.

   Notice, however, in the text, that this precept concerning the
   imitation of Christ in forgiveness is universally applicable. The text
   is not long, but see how unqualified is its range. "Forbearing one
   another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a quarrel against
   any." You see it is not put that superiors are to forgive inferiors,
   or, on the other hand, that the less are to forgive the greater--but
   the circle of the command includes the whole! It is, "forbearing one
   another." The rich are to be forbearing to the poor. The poor are to be
   forbearing to the rich. The elderly man is to forgive the junior for
   his imprudence. The junior is to bear with the petulance and slowness
   of the elder. It is an all-round business, implying that one of these
   days I shall have to forgive you and you will have to forgive me!

   Personally, I tax your forbearance to put up with me and I need not say
   that, sometimes, I have need to exercise forbearance towards one and
   another in so large a Church! We have all our own angles and edges and
   these are apt to come into contact with others. We are all pieces of
   one puzzle and shall fit in with each other one day and make a complete
   whole. But just now we seem misshapen and unfitting. Our corners need
   to be rounded. Sometimes they are chipped off by collision with
   somebody else and that is not comfortable for the person with whom we
   collide. Like pebbles in the river of the Water of Life, we are wearing
   each other round and smooth as the living current brings us into
   commun-ion--everybody is polishing and being polished--and in the
   process it is inevitable that some present inconvenience should be
   sustained. But nobody must mind it, for it is part of a great process
   by which we shall all come into proper shape and be made meet for
   endless fellowship.

   "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another"--you see it has two
   sides. "Ah," says one, "I cannot understand it. People ought to be far
   more forbearing to me." Just so, but the first point is that you should
   be forgiving towards them. What numbers of Church members think that
   the duties of a Church are all one-sided. "I was ill and nobody came to
   see me." "Did you send for anybody to see you?" "No, I did not."
   Brother, before you find fault, remember your own fault--you have
   violated the command, "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the
   elders of the Church." "But nobody exhibits Christian love," says one.
   Is that true ofyourself? I have noticed that the man who says that love
   is dead is usually rather short of love, himself. How very different
   the Church looks to different eyes--one sees a thousand virtues to
   admire--and another a world of evil to expose! One gratefully cries,
   "When I was ill, the dear Brethren came to see me so often that I had
   to ask them not to stay very long." Another grumbles, "I might have
   laid there a month and

   nobody would ever have come near me." We understand the reason for this
   difference--the tone of the speech is the key to the riddle. As a rule,
   with what measure we mete, it is measured to us. I do not find Christ's
   people to be one half so faulty as I am, myself. I meet with many
   Christians whom I think it an honor to know and commune with--and those
   of another sort are useful to me as warnings and as fields for
   exercising my Graces. The forgiveness and the forbearance are needed
   all round and we must both give and take. By the sweet love of Jesus,
   let us not fail in this business.

   Let me say, here, that this matter is an absolutely essential one--this
   forbearance and this forgiveness are vital. Be not deceived, God is not
   mocked! No man is a child of God who has not a likeness to God and no
   man is forgiven who will not, himself, forgive. In the Middle Ages a
   certain baron had a feud with another nobleman and determined to avenge
   himself for some insult, real or imaginary. His enemy was to pass by
   the castle with a small retinue and, therefore, the baron determined to
   waylay him and kill him, or, at least, to punish him severely and exact
   a ransom. A holy man who lived in the castle begged and entreated the
   baron to forbear from bloodshed and make peace. But, for some time, he
   pleaded in vain. The baron would not be appeased, but swore that he
   would be avenged of his adversary. So this godly man begged one favor
   of him, namely, that he would come with him into the chapel and offer
   prayer before he sallied

   forth.

   They knelt together in prayer and before they rose the saintly man
   said, "My lord, repeat after me the Lord's Prayer." He went on saying,
   word by word, as the other did, till he came to that, "Forgive us our
   trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us." There the
   good man stopped and said, "I charge you not to say this unless you
   really mean it! Do not mock the Lord! You may not go out and fight if
   you thus speak with God. You will have to appear before God and be
   judged for your sins, for you will not be forgiven if you do not
   forgive. Choose, then, either to utter this prayer and forgive and be
   saved, or to refuse the prayer and go forth to battle and be lost." The
   baron paused and bit his lips but, at last his better spirit prevailed
   and he cried, "I cannot renounce my hope of Heaven! I cannot renounce
   my hope of forgiveness! Therefore my enemy shall pass by my castle in
   safety and I will say, 'Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them
   that trespass against us.'"

   Do not attempt to deceive God! If you must lie and cheat, practice your
   impositions upon your fellow men, but do not imagine that you can
   flatter your Maker or deceive the Omniscient One! If you will not
   forgive, say so, and expect eternal perdition! But if you profess to be
   a Christian, obey this great and essential precept and forgive as
   Christ forgave you! Be honest, be straight with God, for He will be
   honest and straight with you. But if you cannot and will not forgive,
   then look forward to a portion with the tormentors, for even the loving
   Jesus says, "Neither shall My heavenly Father forgive you."

   In urging you to this copying of Christ, let me notice that this
   forgiveness of those who offend against us is gloriously ennobling. We
   are not asked to perform a duty which will, in the least, degrade us.
   Revenge is paltry--forgiveness is great-minded. Was not David
   infinitely greater than Saul when he spared his life in the cave and
   when he would not kill him as he lay asleep on the battlefield? Did not
   the king humble himself before David when he perceived David's
   forbearance? If you would be the greatest among men, bear injuries with
   the greatest gentleness! If you would win the noblest of conquests,
   subdue yourself! To win a battle is a little thing if it is fought out
   with sword and gun. But to win it in God's way, with no weapons but
   love, patience and forgiveness--this is the most glorious of victories!
   Blessed is that man who is more than a conqueror because he inflicts no
   wounds in the conflict, but overcomes evil with good! In the process of
   such a conquest the warrior is, himself, a gainer.

   A nation in fighting, even if it wins the campaign, has to suffer great
   expense and loss of life. But he that overcomes by love is the better
   and stronger man through what he has done. He comes out of the conflict
   not only victor over his adversary, but victor over sin within
   himself--and all the readier for future war against evil. He glorifies
   God and, he, himself, becomes strong in Divine Grace. Nothing is more
   glorious than love! Your Master, who is King of kings, set you an
   example of gaining glory by enduring wrong. If you would be knights of
   His company, imitate His graciousness.

   Notice that this imitation of Christ is logically appropriate to you
   all. Brothers and Sisters, if Christ has forgiven you, the parable we
   read just now shows that it is imperative that you should forgive your
   fellows. If our Lord has forgiven us our 10,000 talents, how can we
   take our brother by the throat for the 100 pence and say, "Pay me what
   you owe"? If we are, indeed, members of Christ, should we not be like
   our Head? If we profess to be His servants, are we to pretend to a

   dignity greater than our Master, who washed His disciples' feet? If He
   forgave so freely, how dare we call ourselves His brethren if our
   spirit is hard and malice lingers within us?

   I say, to conclude, that this copying of Christ is most forcibly
   sustained by the example given in the text. We are to forbear and to
   forgive. "Even as Christ forgave you, so also do you." I have heard it
   said, "If you pass by every wanton offense and take no notice of it,
   you will come to be despised and regarded as a person of mean
   spirit--your honor demands vindication." When Christ forgave you, did
   His honor suffer by that forgiveness? You transgressed most wickedly
   and yet He forgave you--do you regard Him as less honorable because of
   that readiness to pass by offenses? Far from it--it is His Glory to
   forgive! The hallelujahs of saints and the songs of angels are sent up
   to His Throne the more heartily because of the richness of His Grace
   and the freeness of His mercy! Dishonor, indeed! What pride it is on
   the part of such poor creatures as we are to talk about our honor!
   Where is the honor of revenge? It is a dishonorable thing to put
   yourself on the level of him who injures you.

   A heathen philosopher used to say, "If an ass kicks you, is it
   necessary for the maintenance of your honor to kick that ass, also?"
   That speech looks like a noble one, but yet it is too much flavored
   with contempt. When you speak, or even think of another who has wronged
   you as though he were only worthy to be regarded as a beast, you are
   not right in spirit--a degree of evil remains in your heart. Think of
   the offender without contempt as well as without resentment! Believe
   that he is a brother worth winning. Say, "If he does me an injury, for
   that very reason I will do him a double service. My only vengeance
   shall be double love. I will not allow myself to even think harshly of
   him. I will put the best possible construction on all that he does and
   thus show that the spirit of Christ is in me, conquering the spirit of
   fallen humanity both in me and in him."

   Says one, "If we always overlook offenses, other people may also be
   tempted to do us wrong." Our text furnishes us with a ready answer to
   this. The Lord Jesus Christ forgave you. Have you met anybody who has
   been tempted to do wrong because the Lord has forgiven you? He has
   freely forgiven myriads of poor unworthy sinners and has that promoted
   sin? No. Is it not the very groundwork and case of holiness in the
   world, that Jesus is so gracious as to pardon sin? Why, then, should
   your forbearance do harm? Do not pretend to be so very wise, for
   therein you censure your Master! You are not the ruler of the world. It
   is not for you to be refraining from good for fear that evil may come
   of it--attend to your own ways--forgive everyone his brother his
   trespasses and leave consequences with God.

   "Oh, but," says one, "I know several pious persons who are very
   unforgiving." You do not know any really good man who is of that
   character! I make bold to say that no man is really good if he has not
   a forgiving spirit. Unwillingness to forgive is a grievous flaw in
   anyone's character. But if there were such good people, what have you
   to do with them? Is the servant to imitate his fellow servant,
   especially in his faults? The example set before you is, "Even as
   Christ forgave you." You have nothing to do with either saints or
   sinners in this matter! Your Lord says to you, "What is that to you?
   Follow Me." Perhaps you do not know all the story which you think
   proves that a good man has been unforgiving--and if you do know it, you
   are no judge of others. Mind your own business and even "as Christ
   forgave you, so also do you."

   Bur I hear another one saying, "These persons would not have forgiven
   me." Just so, but then you are a child of God--you are, "elect, holy
   and beloved." You are not to lower your standard to that of publicans
   and sinners. Does not Christ continually say, "What do you more than
   others? Do not even the publicans and the sinners the same?" "If you
   love them that love you, what thanks have you?" But if you love them
   that despitefully use you, then blessed are you when men shall
   persecute you! In that case you have an opportunity of showing your
   love to your Lord. When Dr. Duff first read to some young Brahmins in
   the Government school the precept, "Love your enemies, bless them that
   curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
   despitefully use you," one of the Brahmins cried out with delight,
   "Beautiful! Beautiful! This must have come from the true God. I have
   been told to love those that love me and I have not always done
   that--but to love my enemies is a Divine thought." That young man
   became a Christian under the influence of that precept. Do not darken
   this Light of God , but be sure to display it in your life, that many
   may be attracted to Christ by its luster. Let your goodwill go forth
   even to the worst of men, for Christ's sake. Forget their evil as you
   behold His goodness.

   "Well," says one, "I would forgive the fellow, but he does not deserve
   it." That is why you are to forgive him! If he deserved it, you would
   be bound to do him the justice which he could claim. But, as he does
   not deserve it, you have, here, an appeal to your Christian love. Does
   not your heavenly Father give good things to the unthankful and to the
   evil? Did

   not Jesus forgive the undeserving when He forgave you? Does He not
   overlook our wretched characters when He has mercy upon us?

   I hear one say, "I cannot forgive!" That is a terrible confession. The
   Apostle of the Gentiles said, "I can do all things through Christ which
   strengthens me." Is not the same strength available for you? Some
   persons find forgiving and forgetting to be hard work, but, as you are
   bound to do it, or stay out of Heaven, you must cry to God for help and
   set about it with determination. If you are, indeed, a child of God,
   you will soon find the difficulty gone. Indeed, forgiveness will become
   easy to you! To be forgiven is such sweetness that honey is tasteless
   in comparison with it! But there is one thing still sweeter--and that
   is to forgive. As it is more blessed to give than to receive, so to
   forgive rises a stage higher in experience than to be forgiven. To be
   forgiven is, as it were, the root--to forgive is the flower. That
   Divine Spirit, who bears witness with our spirit when He breathes peace
   into us because we are pardoned, bears yet a higher witness with us
   when He enables us to truly pardon all manner of trespasses against
   ourselves!

   Let it never be said, in a Christian Church, that members bear a grudge
   against one another. I do not know that it is so in your
   case--assuredly it should not be so anywhere. Let it not be said of any
   Christian man that he is unloving, ready to take offense, apt to bear
   malice, or quick to anger. Cultivate forbearance till your heart yields
   a fine crop of it. Pray for a short memory as to all unkindnesses. I
   bless God that I know a man who finds it easy to forgive and to forget
   all offenses against himself. He takes no credit for so doing, for no
   one ever offends him in a way which is worth remembering. That man has
   been reminded again and again of the misbehavior of unreasonable and
   unkind men, but he has honestly said, "I had quite forgotten it." He
   does not claim this forgetfulness as a virtue, for as a matter of fact
   his memory has become weak in that direction and he has no desire to
   strengthen it. He has never tried to recollect unkindnesses and now, by
   long disuse, his memory happily fails him upon such matters! That man
   has often enjoyed exquisite pleasure in doing good to those who have
   injured him--and he can truly say that, at this moment, he bears no
   ill-will to any soul upon this earth.

   He does not think this to be any singular attainment, for his belief is
   that every follower of Jesus should be of the same mind. Do you not
   think the same? I am sure I do. I heard this man once say of another,
   "He spoke against me that which was false, but if he had known more
   about me, he might have said something far worse and have been nearer
   the truth. Perhaps my false accuser believed what he said and thought
   he was doing a right thing in protesting against what he thought was my
   fault. At any rate, no one can harm my character, unless I do so
   myself." It is a wise thing to profit by every accusation, whether true
   or false, by trying to be better!

   Let us so live as to be able to say, "I am as much at peace with all
   men as a new-born child." Thus shall we wear the mark of the Spirit of
   God. In a word, my Brothers and Sisters--"Even us Christ forgave you,
   so also do you." Amen.

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 24, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that loves Me not keeps not My sayings: and the Word which you hear
   is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me. These things have I spoken
   unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the
   Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you
   all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, Whatever I have
   said unto you." John 14:24-26.

   ALL through this thrice-blessed chapter, man cuts a very sorry figure.
   Whoever it is that speaks, whether it is Philip, or Judas, or Thomas,
   each one displays his own ignorance, either by asking an unwise
   question or by making a mistaken request. Yet, Brothers and Sisters,
   these Apostolic men were, by no means, inferior persons, but so
   superior that we sink into insignificance in comparison with them!
   Jesus made them heralds of His Gospel, master-builders of His Church
   and, if they displayed such ignorance, even when the Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself, had personally spoken to them, we must not wonder that we are
   apt to blunder. Neither should we despair if we find ourselves dull and
   slow. If those fathers of the Church so greatly needed to be taught of
   the Holy Spirit, how much more do we? If they could receive nothing
   except by the Spirit of God, how can we hope to be wise apart from His
   instructions? Our position should be sitting with Mary at the Master's
   feet, varied with bowing into the dust before the Lord under a humble
   sense of our folly. The chapter before us is well watered with streams
   of comfort, but I confess it is always a valley of humiliation to me,
   as I see what poor creatures even the chief of saints are when left to
   themselves.

   But, at the same time, how wonderfully, throughout this passage, do we
   see the loving kindness of our God in condescending to the weaknesses
   of His people. In one verse of our text, the 26th, we have the whole
   Trinity at work upon the Believer--"The Comforter, which is the Holy
   Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name." There we have the Holy
   Spirit, the Father and the Son, uniting Their sacred energies for the
   illumination of the chosen! Each Divine Person seeks to make the Other
   to be more fully known--the Son speaking what He hears from the
   Father--and the Spirit taking the things of the Son and revealing them
   to us! The whole Trinity working in us to will and to do according to
   the Divine pleasure. What we are, my Brothers and Sisters, is of small
   consequence compared with what He is who works all our works in us!

   What if we are nothing but clay? The great Potter knows how to fashion
   us to His praise. The great item is not what the clay is, but what the
   Potter can make out of it. Let us not despond because of what we are by
   nature, but let us rejoice as we remember the wisdom and power of God
   who has begun a good work in us and will not cease from His working
   till He has perfected His design! We must comfort one another with
   these thoughts. Lie low and be more and more teach-able--but be
   hopeful, for you shall be taught. Confess your own ignorance, but
   confide in the Lord's power to teach you. Rest assured that even for
   you there is a noble destiny--God shall reveal Himself to you and in
   you--and you shall not only know for yourself, but shall declare to
   principalities and powers in the heavenly places the manifold wisdom of

   God!

   In handling my text at this time, I desire to be entirely under the
   power of the Spirit of God. Not with enticing words of man's wisdom
   would I preach. Not with the garnishing of oratory would I foolishly
   dream of lending power to the Omnipotent Word of God, but with all
   simplicity I would speak plainly that which the Holy Spirit teaches by
   our text.

   It appears to me that there are three things, here, worthy of patient
   observation. One is, the test of a true Believer-- "He that loves Me
   not keeps not My sayings." A second is, the need of a true Believer--he
   needs to be taught of the Holy

   Spirit and to have his memory refreshed by the same gracious
   Spirit--"He shall bring all things to your remembrance." The best
   disciple needs help in his understanding and in his memory. Thirdly,
   let us think of the privilege of a true Be-liever--"The Comforter,
   which is the Holy Spirit, shall teach you all things, and bring all
   things to your remembrance, whatever I have said unto you."

   I. Let us begin with THE TEST OF A TRUE BELIEVER and let each one
   consent to be tested. Let each man put himself into the scale that he
   may know his weight, for the Lord ponders the heart. He who never
   judges himself will perish in the judgment of the Last Great Day.

   I would draw your attention to the fact that in this passage and
   elsewhere in Scripture, men are divided into two classes and not a word
   is said of a neutral or intermediate class. The 21st verse says, "He
   that has My commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves Me." And
   the 24th verse says negatively, "He that loves Me not keeps not My
   sayings." Evidently there are two sorts of persons in that part of the
   world which is visited by the Gospel--he that loves Christ and he that
   loves Him not. If you once hear the Gospel, you can never be
   indifferent to it. You must either be its friend or its foe, its
   disciple or its opposer. If once the Lord Jesus Christ crosses the
   orbit of your life, you can never, again, be neutral. You must either
   reject Him or receive Him--believe Him or call Him a liar. I would urge
   home upon each of you that simple but solemn Truth of God, lest any
   person should think himself omitted from the range of my discourse. I
   would so spread the net that no fish may remain outside its meshes!

   The Gospel must, in the nature of things, be to you who hear it, either
   a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. By this Gospel you
   shall be judged and it shall either bring you where there is no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, or it shall leave you
   where you are condemned, already, because you have not believed upon
   the Son of God! Do not, therefore, hope to live and die as if there
   were no Christ! Attempt not to say, "He is nothing to me." Though you
   pass by the Cross and refuse to look on Christ, yet the Crucified One
   looks on you and casts His shadow on your path. His blood will be upon
   you, either to cry out against you, as a murderer of the Son of God, or
   else to be your cleansing from all sin! As to the Person of your Lord,
   it is evident that you either love Him or do not love Him--one of the
   two it must be. What is your condition at this hour? Sitting among the
   people of God in this house on this Sabbath, are you lovers of the Lord
   Jesus, or are you His enemies?

   May God bless that stroke of the winnowing fan, so that by it the chaff
   may be separated from the wheat. But the test is this, the loving of
   Christ. Loving Christ is not the way of salvation--that can only be
   ascribed to faith, as it is written, "He that believes on Me has
   everlasting life." But the flower which comes out of the seed of faith
   is love. And faith is not true faith unless it works by love and so
   purifies the heart.

   Observe that the love is personal--"He that loves Me not." He speaks
   not, here, of love to doctrine, but of love to Himself--"He that loves
   Me." There is a personal Christ and He is to be loved by each one of us
   individually. Do not think of Christ as an historic person who came and
   went away, whose memory may be dear, but who cannot personally be the
   object of a present love. If you are truly His disciple and a partaker
   of His salvation, you love Him. You realize Him as a living Person--as
   much so as your own self, as your dear wife or your near friend--and
   your heart, in deed and in truth, is bound to Him. The tendrils of your
   affection must lay hold on Jesus, climbing upwards toward God by laying
   hold upon His Son. You may not always be able to say that you are sure
   that you love Him because your agony to be right may create in you a
   painful anxiety and even a morbid jealousy as to your own
   sincerity--but you do love Him if you are called by His Grace. But if
   you do not love Him, you have never tasted of His power to save.

   When I read those words just now, "He that loves Me not," I felt as if
   I must repeat the words of Paul and say, "Let him be Anathema
   Maranatha"--cursed at the coming of the Lord--for is it not an awful
   thing for any heart to refuse to love Jesus? The most lovable of all
   beings is Jesus! It is unnatural not to love One so amiable. As streams
   of water naturally flow into the lowest part of the valley, so one
   would have thought that the condescension of Jesus for our sakes made
   it natural for the love of men to run towards Him and concentrate
   itself within Him! Alas, our nature is now unnatural and it is only as
   the Spirit of God creates a new love in the heart that we yield our
   love to the ever-blessed Savior! If we are not lovers of the Lord
   Jesus, the Spirit of all Grace has not made us to know and trust
   Christ, for if we knew Jesus and trusted Him, our heart must be wedded
   to Him. Christ trusted must be Christ loved! We must love God when once
   the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.

   Judge yourselves, then--do you love Jesus truly and supremely? He says,
   "He that loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me." He
   claims the first place in the hearts of His people. He is an
   all-engrossing Savior who will never be satisfied till He has
   monopolized all our affections and carried our hearts away to abide
   with Him in the treasury above. Let it be a matter, then, of personal
   trial with each one of you. Hear your risen Lord saying, "Do you love
   Me?" Not to Simon, alone, but to you, John, and to you, Mary, He says,
   "Do you love Me?" He stands here this morning, as once He stood by the
   lake of Galilee, and He puts this loving enquiry to each disciple, "Do
   you love Me?" Is His adorable Person the object of your intense regard?
   Can you fall at His feet and say, "Lord, You know all things. You know
   that I love You. Show me what You would have me to do."

   Furthermore, as we look at this text, we observe that, inasmuch as it
   is not always possible to gauge the emotions and the affections, a
   further test is given us--"He that loves Me not keeps not My sayings."
   I may know, therefore, whether I love the Lord Jesus Christ by
   answering this further question, Do I keep His sayings? What does this
   mean? It means, first, have we a reverent regard for all the teachings
   of the Lord Jesus Christ? Do we receive them as being our standard of
   doctrine and our rule of life? Remember that, in effect, all that is in
   the Old Testament as well as in the New must be considered to be the
   sayings of Christ, for He says that He came not to destroy the Law, but
   to establish it. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but not one tittle
   of the Law shall fail. The whole record of Inspiration is endorsed by
   Christ and may be said to be His sayings.

   Now, do you accept these sacred Scriptures as your Infallible guide?
   Remember, the sayings of Jesus are the Word of the Father. Mark how
   Jesus says, "The Word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who
   sent Me." I tremble as I see, in this day, such a trifling with the
   Word of God--such a haste to criticize this and question that! There
   are degrees of inspiration, so we are told, and if that is so, we can
   be sure of nothing, since we have, first, to decide some subtle
   question as to the measure of the inspiration! As well have no Bible as
   such a Bible! Brothers and Sisters, the Word of the Lord shall have no
   such treatment from me and I trust it will not be so served by any of
   you, for if so, you will rob yourselves of comfort and offer grievous
   disrespect to your Divine Lord! I hope we can declare concerning all
   His sayings-- "Your Word was found and I did eat it, and it was unto me
   as my necessary food." More to be desired are these sayings than gold,
   yes, than much fine gold--they are sweeter, also, than honey and the
   honeycomb. Did a saying come from Christ? Has Jesus set forth a Truth
   in these Scriptures? Then it is not ours to judge, not ours to doubt,
   but ours to accept with implicit faith! The authority of Jesus stands
   to us in the place of reasoning. We so reverence Him that we reverence
   His sayings as being the Truth of God, themselves.

   To keep His sayings means, further, to make careful storage of them in
   the memory. To keep these sayings must mean to lay them up in the
   heart. The blessed Virgin "kept all these things, and pondered them in
   her heart," and so does every Christian. "Your Word have I hid in my
   heart that I might not sin against You." It is a blessed thing when we
   are not content to hear God's Word on the Lord's-Day, only, but listen
   to its echoes every day in the week. We constantly chew the cud by
   meditation and so we are nourished. We delight to know the meaning of
   the Word by keeping it continually before our minds. We keep the
   heavenly object long before the sensitive plate of our mind till it is
   perfectly photographed there and we, ourselves, are changed by it from
   glory to glory as by the image of the Lord. Oh, Brothers and Sisters,
   unless we reverence the Word and hoard it up as the choicest of
   treasures, we have no proof that we love Christ!

   Further than this, to keep Christ's sayings must mean that, having
   learned them and retained them in the memory, we also further keep them
   in the mind by frequent contemplation. There is a great failure in this
   respect, I am afraid, among many professors. But those who fervently
   love Jesus and are sanctified to His service delight to be much engaged
   in meditating upon the sayings of Jesus. Our earthly cares are our
   burden, but our heavenly thoughts are our rest. What are human sciences
   but glimpses at transient and shadowy things? But spiritual meditation
   yields us views of eternal and substantial Truths of God! As I walk
   through my house and rejoice in the comforts of my home, I say to
   myself, "These are only mine for a little while. God has prolonged my
   life, but at any moment these visible things may melt away and I may be
   where things are real, though they are now invisible."

   Everything that has to do with this world is a vain show! But as for
   the world to come, he that has a possession therein has true riches!
   Should not our thoughts go most after that which is most? Should we not
   give the best of our consideration to that which is best? The most of
   our time to that which is not of time, but of eternity? I am sure he
   that

   loves Jesus delights to think upon the choice Words which fell from His
   lips. We sit down under His shadow, for He is to us the Tree of Life
   and not a single leaf of His shall wither, nor the least of His sayings
   fall to the ground.

   Still, I have no doubt that the main meaning of keeping Christ's
   sayings is found in obeying Him. Dear Friends, I do not want to say
   anything that will be severe, but yet I shall put to you a question
   which ought to alarm many professors. Did you ever spend a whole day,
   from morning to night, in distinctly and resolutely doing that which
   would honor Christ? I do not mean did you give up your business? Did
   you quit your family? Such strange conduct would not honor Jesus, but
   would do the reverse! But have you, day after day, thought and acted as
   if Jesus were your Master and you His servant? Is it habitual with you
   to say, "I will only do that which Christ would do if He were in my
   place? His example shall be my Law. I will not be ruled by the hope of
   personal advantage or selfish comfort--to me the supreme rule shall
   be--"What would Jesus do? What would Jesus have me to do?"

   I am afraid certain professors fancy that to hold a sound creed, to
   attend a faithful ministry and to subscribe, now and then, to
   charitable works, is about the whole of religion. But you utterly miss
   the mark if you judge such matters to be the chief items of godliness.
   The chief matter is to love Christ so that we live for Him and honor
   Him by obedience to Him! We cannot serve Christ by following our own
   whims. He who follows his own vagaries is a vagrant--only he who obeys
   Jesus is His follower. By doing what Jesus bids us--by catching His
   Spirit, by seeing things in His way of seeing them and by acting both
   towards man and towards God in His way of acting--we may make men see
   what a glorious Savior we have! We ought to so display the sweet fruit
   of the Holy Spirit in our lives that men may be filled with admiration
   of our Lord! May God help us to do this, for if we do not keep our
   Lord's sayings by our holy living, we have no proof that we love
   Christ--and if we do not love Him, then we are not His disciples!

   I beg you, my fellow Brothers and Sisters, to apply this text to
   yourselves! Is the Lord Jesus reverenced by you as your Teacher? Do you
   bow before the authority of His Word? Do you turn to the Bible and say
   of it--

   "This is the judge that ends the strife, Where wit and reason fail"?

   Have you subjected your intellect to His teaching? The loose thinkers
   of the present day imagine that they may believe what they like and
   think what they please. But it is not so. They do as good as say, "Our
   minds are our own. God shall never rule over us." But this becomes not
   a saint. Our Lord Jesus will be King of our entire nature, or of none
   of it! I claim the province of the understanding for my Lord, for it is
   a part of His empire which He will not leave in the hands of the enemy!
   We are as responsible for our beliefs as for our acts! We are never in
   full subordination to our Lord till we yield ourselves devoutly and
   reverently to His instruction, calling Him Master and Lord, because so
   He is!

   Brethren, do you yield your whole lives to Jesus? Do you aim at perfect
   obedience? Do you repent your failures? Do you cry to Him daily, "My
   Master, mold me to Your will, for to bear Your image is my ambition. I
   would re-live Your life and be Your representative on earth, even as
   You are my Representative in Heaven. Oh, that I could say of Your
   Father and my Father, 'I do always the things which please Him!'"

   II. So much for the test of discipleship. Now, in the second place, I
   beg you to follow me while I speak for a minute or two upon THE NEEDS
   OF A TRUE BELIEVER.

   The Believer, though he truly loves his Lord is, nevertheless, a most
   necessitous person and sadly full of needs. He does not need any better
   Gospel--the Lord Jesus Christ taught us the best Gospel that could be
   and, indeed, there can be no other. When Paul spoke of "another
   Gospel," he added, "which is not another; but there are some that
   trouble you." We desire nothing wiser, fuller, or better than the
   doctrine which our Lord once delivered to the saints. I heard of a
   mother speaking to her boy the other day words of truth and soberness.
   Her hopeful and eager son was tempted to run after certain loyalties of
   doctrine and practice and she said to him, "What we have heard from our
   minister is enough for me, for it is according to Scripture. Your
   father and mother have lived on this Gospel and it has helped them
   through a thousand troubles, even to this day. And your dear old
   grandfather and grandmother lived on the same Gospel and died upon it
   triumphantly! Therefore, hold fast by it. We have tried it and proved
   it, therefore do not depart from it."

   That was common-sense talk. I am afraid of the new gospel. I have not
   proved it, but what I have seen of its results in others makes me
   tremble! Let those who will, go to sea in ships of reed or of
   cardboard--heart-of-oak suffices for me! Such vessels have carried men
   to the ends of the world and home again for many years and in these,
   alone, will I cross the ocean. Those who seek after the novelties of
   this conceited century seek to push their Lord from His place, that a
   philoso-

   pher may fill His Throne! They seem to say, "Stand back, You Galilean!
   You were good enough for the dark ages, but we need a brighter light
   for these brighter times." I return to what I said before--we need no
   better Gospel than that which God Himself has set forth in the Person
   of His Son Jesus Christ.

   These disciples to whom our Lord spoke did not need any better
   Preacher--they could not imagine a better. "Never man spoke like this
   Man." What power and authority there was in Him and what an unction of
   the Holy One was upon Him! I cannot say that of you, for you, beloved
   Friends, might often sigh for an abler preacher and it may be that in
   some places where you live, your Sabbaths are a bondage to you because
   the pure Gospel is not declared and the sheep are not fed. But in the
   case of these Apostles, they could not have had a better Preacher and
   yet, for all that, because the Holy Spirit was not yet fully given and
   was not dwelling in them, they had really learned very little. You see
   the Lord Jesus Christ says of Himself, "These things have I spoken unto
   you." He does not say that He had actually taught them. The last Words
   of my text are, "All things whatever I have said unto you." All that
   Jesus had done, if we view Him merely as a Preacher, was to speak and
   to say. But He could not teach the heart, apart from the Holy Spirit!
   Between Christ on earth and His disciples what a distance there was! In
   His condescension He came very near to them, yet you always perceive a
   gulf between the wise Master and the foolish disciples. Now the Holy
   Spirit annihilates that distance by dwelling in us!

   The best instructed of the Apostles failed to understand his Lord while
   He merely spoke to them. Often the disciples ran away with the words
   which He had uttered and dwelt upon their letter, altogether missing
   their spiritual meaning. Frequently when they obtained a glimpse of the
   spiritual meaning, they beclouded it with some prejudice or tradition
   of their own, which, like smoke, obscured their vision. As to memory,
   they displayed but little of that faculty towards spiritual
   things--they were constantly forgetting what the Lord had told
   them--and acting in a manner directly the opposite of His precept and
   example.

   Externally, all was provided--outward ministries of the noblest order
   were vouchsafed. But they needed something within them--an inward and
   effectual Teacher, a secret and powerful Remembrancer! Yes, more, they
   required to be caused to enjoy what they knew and remembered--they
   needed the Comforter to extract for them the honey of consolation from
   the honeycomb of doctrine! Their Lord had taught them all manner of
   comfortable Truths and yet He had to say to them, "Let not your heart
   be troubled." He had supplied them with the best arguments for courage
   and yet they were afraid. They required a Helper who would make them
   understand the Truth, remember the Truth and enjoy the Truth. And this
   is just what you and I stand in need of every hour, for we may sit
   under the most edifying preacher and remain unedified if we look to his
   words, only. We may hear the best doctrine and yet be unable to get at
   it so as to receive it and feel the power of it. Truth without the
   Spirit of God profits not the soul.

   Even if you understand, you may forget. I dare say you have often to
   lament that the good Word of God slips away from you and this is a
   great evil. Why do we forget? Is it not largely through ignorance and
   lack of understanding? When a child does not understand his lesson, he
   soon forgets it. He who does not obtain a clear view of the Truth of
   God will fail to remember it, just as you soon forget a person whom you
   have only seen casually for a few moments and in a dim light. We cannot
   easily hold in the memory that which we have not firmly grasped with
   the mind. Again, we forget heavenly things because we are so occupied
   with worldly things--our cares, our joys, our pleasures, our pursuits
   often crowd the things of God into a corner and even tread them down
   with heedless fury! We forget our eternal prospects because we are
   thinking of our immediate interests. Our circumstances compel us to
   think of lower objects, but we need Divine help to abide in communion
   with the higher matters. We need Someone to bring these things to our
   remembrance and to elevate us to a superior region of mind and heart.

   At times we forget our Lord's sayings and become bewildered by many
   afflictions. Trouble follows trouble--we go from darkness to deeper
   darkness in our experiences--and we are so worried that we forget. When
   we most need the promise, we are most apt to forget it. There are good
   solid steps all through the Slough of Despond--but when a man is
   passing through that horrible place, he is usually so hurried and
   confused that he cannot see the steppingstones, but slips into the deep
   mire where there is no standing. It is ill for us to be in a storm and
   our anchor at home. The promise is admired when we do not require it,
   but how often is it forgotten when it would be of the utmost service!
   We need a Prompter, a Friend out of sight to suggest the proper word,
   or else we blunder and flounder and do not act our parts aright. It is
   the work of the Holy Spirit to refresh our memories.

   Sometimes, I am afraid, our memories fail us because we are not
   particularly anxious to remember. Certain precepts are so contrary to
   the carnal mind that if we can forget them we are sure to do so. You
   know how easy it is, in your family reading, to omit parts of God's
   Word which are too close and personal. We are afraid of the razor which
   cuts too close to the skin. Have you not felt, in the morning, when
   your servants have been gathered together, that you could not well read
   a certain passage because you had been out of temper, or unkind, or in
   some other way out of proper form? You feared that they would say, "Our
   master and the Bible do not agree." In your own private thoughts, a
   precept occurs to you, but you feel it convenient to ignore it because
   it would stand in the way of a design which you are cherishing. You
   intend to go through with your purpose and, therefore, you shut your
   eyes to an inconvenient text.

   But if we are under the guidance of the Spirit of God, He will bring to
   our remembrance the duty in its proper time and we shall bring forth
   our fruit in its season. It is extremely easy to be wise after folly
   and to be calm after the danger is over. We find the candle when the
   night is ended. We cry, "Dear me, if I had felt, yesterday, what I feel
   today, how differently I would have acted!" We are so often a little
   behind the market. We lock the door after the horse is stolen. Fruit
   out of season is always deficient in flavor--never are the scent and
   the taste so perfect as in the middle of the season. Oh, that we may
   bring forth our fruit in its due season--patience in tribulation,
   courage in danger, holiness in life and hope in death! We fail to do
   this because that evil nature which is in us makes us forget at the
   precise moment what we ought to remember. It is the office of the Holy
   Spirit to bring before us the sayings of Christ in their due order and
   time. Do you not need this?

   III. Hoping to retain your prayerful attention, I proceed to notice THE
   PRIVILEGE OF THE TRUE BELIEVER. It is the true disciple's privilege to
   possess, in the Holy Spirit, a private Tutor, a Prompter and a
   Comforter.

   The Lord Jesus says, "The Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the
   Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things." Christ, in
   His sayings, gave us our class book, complete and Infallible, but
   through our dullness, we need more. That young man has gone to college.
   He has with him all necessary books and in them is to be found all that
   he will need to learn. Even thus the Lord Jesus has given us, in His
   sayings, all that we need to know. But the young man's father wishes
   him to become a learned man and, therefore, he engages a private tutor
   for him--one who will teach him what the books contain. With his
   tutor's help, his books are of far greater use to him than before. If
   any passage is difficult, the tutor explains it. He puts the youth into
   the way of reading his books so as to get the full value of them.
   Spiritually, this is the office of the Holy Spirit--He finds us the key
   wherewith to open up the mystery which otherwise would be out of our
   reach.

   He really teaches us. To teach you is a very different thing from
   speaking to you. A person may speak to a company of young people and
   yet teach them nothing. If I am anxious to instruct a Brother on any
   point, I do not merely speak to him, but I go over the ground
   carefully, set out each point distinctly, repeat my statements
   deliberately and illustrate them appropriately. The Spirit of God, when
   He takes the child of God out of the company and speaks privately to
   his heart, goes over the Truth of God with him till it is made clear
   and happily apprehended. We need to have the Truth of God opened up to
   the understanding, impressed upon the heart, made real to the
   apprehension, applied to the mind, worked into the affections and
   endeared to the soul. It is one thing to hear the Word of God, but it
   is another thing to learn the Word of God--it is one thing to be told,
   but quite another thing to be taught.

   The Spirit teaches the saints, either at once or by degrees, all the
   Truths of Christ. Some parts of that whole you will never learn, except
   upon a sick bed, or in deep depression of spirit, or in bereavement and
   adversity--while other Truths will only be learned on the bright
   mountains of assurance and communion with God. It is the Spirit's
   province to burn Truth into the soul, to engrave it upon the renewed
   heart and make the mind sure and certain as to what it knows. No
   knowledge is so sure as that which the Holy Spirit communicates to our
   spirit. Inward teaching is effectual teaching. A man taught of God
   knows and cannot be made to question what he knows. Time was, whenever
   I heard a skeptical remark, I felt wounded and somewhat shaken. I am no
   longer shaken by these wandering winds. There are certain things of
   which I am as sure of as my own existence! I have seen, tasted and
   handled them--and I am past being argued out of them by those who know
   nothing about them.

   I am a lost man if the old, old Gospel is not true! There is no way of
   salvation for me if it is not of Grace through faith in the atoning
   Sacrifice! And as I know that I am not lost, but am surely a saved man,
   I know that the Word which has saved me is the Truth of God! Those who
   are familiar with spiritual realities defy denial--they set their
   inward con-

   sciousness against 10,000 skepticisms--if they cannot convince others,
   they are convinced themselves. We must be taught by the Spirit of God
   in a secret, personal, unquestionable, effectual manner! We must be
   made to feel the power of the Truth of God by a spiritual inoculation
   with it, so that it enters into our very life and becomes part and
   parcel of ourselves.

   It is promised us that the Comforter will teach us all things--that is,
   all the things which Jesus said and did. Have we realized this
   far-reaching privilege? There is a great variety in the knowledge of
   Christ. Nobody need think that he will exhaust it. There is, moreover,
   a proportion in the things of Christ, and we need to know all that our
   Lord has set forth. Jesus does not teach only doctrine, though some
   professors crave doctrine and doctrine, alone. Jesus does not teach all
   practice--He teaches practice wondrously--but He also declares
   doctrine! Our Lord does not teach either doctrine or practice without
   experience, but He makes a perfect blend to our edification. The way
   with some of God's people is either to have nothing but doctrine, or
   else nothing but practice, or else nothing but experience--and this
   warps and spoils them. Give yourself up to the Spirit of God and He
   will teach you all things--here a little and there a little--here a
   little of what you should know, there a little of what you should feel
   and then, again, a little of what you should do.

   Remember that especially in the doing part of it, the Spirit of God
   must be your Teacher. A lad is put apprentice to a handicraft. How does
   he learn it? Why, by seeing how his master does it and by doing it,
   himself! At first he spoils the material and his master needs to have
   much patience with him--but, at last, practice makes perfect and the
   apprentice becomes a journeyman. The Spirit of God, with wonderful
   condescension, puts us to practice a little patience. We soon get weary
   of that task. When He gives us an opportunity of producing love--love
   to some poor wretched waif on life's rough sea--we are apt to grow
   chilled by his ingratitude and wearied with our non-success. The Holy
   Spirit drills us in heavenly marching till we keep step with our Lord
   and men take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus and have
   learned of Him.

   Brothers and Sisters, you are to keep your Lord's sayings and never go
   beyond them, but to do this will need the private tutoring of the Holy
   Spirit--and you must not be satisfied unless He wakens you morning by
   morning and opens your ears to hear what He has to say, bringing home
   to your heart and conscience the things that make you wise unto
   salvation.

   As we need something beside this, it is a mercy that we have it. We
   require that our memories be strengthened. What wretched memories we
   have as to Divine things! As I have already said, we recollect when it
   is too late and thus our memories serve, rather, to minister to our
   regret than to our improvement. It should not be so and if we will put
   ourselves under the teaching of the Spirit of God it shall not remain
   so. He will strengthen our memories spiritually. He often brings the
   Truth of God to our minds--do you not find it so? While you are sitting
   here, this morning, flashes of the Light of God have been around you.
   Branch roads have opened up as we have proceeded. Vistas of the Truth
   of God have rejoiced your vision. You have cried with wonder, "I never
   saw that before!" That is the Spirit of God! Frequently a doctrine
   comes home to you with the force of a new discovery--you had heard the
   Truth, before, but you had never seen it--but the Spirit brings it to
   your remembrance with singular vivacity and force!

   He refreshes the mind by vivid recollections. He refreshes the heart by
   melting gratitude. I have known times when my memory of the love of
   Christ has made me sit down and weep for very joy! Oh, what gratitude
   wells up in the heart when the Holy Spirit brings all that Christ did
   to remembrance and we hear Him say from His Cross, "I did all this for
   you--what have you done for Me?" It is the Spirit's work to refresh the
   memory of the heart as well as the memory of the mind. Often He
   refreshes the memory of the conscience--not quite so pleasant an
   operation. I have been doing, for years, wrong things without knowing
   them to be wrong. I have been neglecting a manifest duty for a long
   time, but all of a sudden that duty has been brought to my remembrance
   as one of the things which Jesus told me. I bless the Holy Spirit for
   thus sanctifying me by giving me a higher standard of holiness and
   making me more particular about things which I glossed over with but
   slight attention This is a part of the work of the Holy Spirit of God,
   to bring all things to your remembrance, whatever He has told you.

   I am sure the Spirit of God often blesses us by bringing things to the
   memory of our hope. Perhaps this is an odd way of putting it, for how
   can hope have a memory? But I mean this, that hope seems to forget that
   the Lord has said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you," Hope
   seems to forget that--

   "There is a land of pure delight,

   Where saints immortal reign."

   And sometimes the Spirit of God brings all that glorious revelation of
   the world to come before our minds. Have you never felt Glory begun
   below? Have not the pearly gates seemed to stand, not ajar, but wide
   open--and have you not, in spirit, walked down the streets of gold and
   worn your crown--and cast it at your Savior's feet? Then you have said
   to yourself, "I can bear this pain. I can put up with these depressions
   and these inconveniences, for I know that there is laid up for me, in
   Heaven, a crown of life that fades not." The Spirit of God thus brings
   all things to our remembrance!

   I shall say no more, but pray the Spirit of God to come upon you this
   very day and bring to your remembrance all things that Christ has ever
   said to you. There will be a mixture of sunny memories and sorrowing
   memories, but they will be blessed memories, all of them! I thought,
   when I was trying to prepare a subject for this morning, "All that I
   have preached for these many years is taken from me and printed, so
   that I cannot repeat it--what shall I do?" And then this Truth of God
   came to me, "He shall teach you." "He shall teach you," and I begged
   Him to teach me that I might teach you. I thought, "Alas, I have had
   many bright and sparkling thoughts at times, but they do not come just
   now." I sat still, waiting--and then the fact came to me that the Holy
   Spirit would bring all things to my remembrance whatever the Lord Jesus
   had said. I find my natural memory to be less powerful than it used to
   be in the days of my youth. Shall I, therefore, be allowed to forget
   when I am teaching? No, "He shall teach you, and bring all things to
   your remembrance." How beautiful!

   I have noticed old people whose memories have been sadly feeble. I knew
   one who forgot his children. But I never knew an old saint, yet, who
   forgot the name of the Savior, or failed to remember His love!
   Sometimes the Holy Spirit bears such witness in the heart that the
   memory is very strong about Divine things even when it fails about
   spiritual things. So, my dear old Friend, you that the youngsters
   sometimes amuse themselves with because your memory has got to be like
   an old sieve that lets everything through--it will not let your Lord
   through--you will always feel the music of His name! You will never
   forget your Well-Beloved if you live to be as old as Methuselah!
   Memory, though it leaves no other name, shall leave that name recorded
   there! Christ's love is not hung upon us like a garland on a tree, but
   it is cut into us and, as the tree grows, the letters grow deeper and
   broader every day! The Holy Spirit, who is the life of Believers,
   writes more and more clearly upon that life the glorious and blessed
   name of Jesus!

   I wish that any here who do not know Christ would cry for the Spirit of
   God to teach Him to them. If you long to be saved, pray that by His
   Spirit the Lord Jesus may bring you into the bond of the Covenant, for
   His love's sake. Amen.

                          A Question for a Questioner

   A Sermon

   (No. 1843)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, May 31st, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [11]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"--Psalm 77:9.

   ASAPH was very grievously troubled in spirit. The deep waters were not
   only around his barque, but they had come in even unto his soul. When
   the spirit of a man is wounded, then is he wounded indeed; and such was
   the case with this man of God. In the time of his trouble he was
   attacked with doubts and fears; so that he was made to question the
   very foundations of things. Had he not taken to continual prayer he had
   perished in his affliction; but he cried unto God with his voice, and
   the Lord gave ear unto him. Nor did he only pray, but he used the
   fittest means for escaping from his despondency. Very wisely this good
   man argued with himself, and sought to cure his unbelief. He treated
   himself homoeopathically, meeting like with like. As he was attacked by
   the disease of questioning, he gave himself questions as a medicine.
   Observe how he kills one question with another, as men fight fire with
   fire. Here we have six questions, one after another, each one striking
   at the very heart of unbelief. "Will the Lord cast off for over? Will
   he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his
   promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he
   in anger shut up his tender mercies?" If questions are raised at all
   let us go through with them; and as the Saviour answered one question
   of his opponents by another, so may we also silence the questions of
   unbelief by further questions which shall strip our doubt of all
   disguises.

   The question which makes our text is meant to end other questions. You
   may carry truth as far as ever you like, and it will always be truth.
   Truth is like those crystals which, when split up into the smallest
   possible fragments, still retain their natural form. You may break
   truth in pieces, you may do what you like with it, and it is truth
   throughout; but error is diverse within itself, and evermore bears its
   own death within itself. You can see its falsehood even in its own
   light. Bring it forward, strip it of its disguises, behold it in its
   naked form, and its deformity at once appears. Carry unbelief to its
   proper consequences, and you will revolt from it, and be driven by the
   grace of God to faith. Sometimes our doubts assume appearances which
   are not their own, and so are hard to deal with; but if we make them
   take their own natural shapes, we shall easily destroy them. The
   question before us is what the logician would call a reductio ad
   absurdum; it reduces doubt to an absurdity; it puts into plain and
   truthful words the thought of an unbelieving mind, and at once it is
   seen to be a horrible notion. "Is his mercy clean gone for ever?" One
   might smile while reading a suggestion so absurd, and yet there is
   grave cause for trembling in the profanity of such a question. "Hath
   God forgotten?" We stumble at the first word. How can God forget? "Hath
   God forgotten to be?" We snap the question at that point, and it is
   blasphemous. It is no better when we give it as a whole,--"Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious?" The bare idea is both ridiculous and
   blasphemous. Again, I say, it is wise when we are vexed with evil
   questioning to put down the questions in black and white, and expose
   them to the daylight. Drive the wretched things out of their holes;
   hunt them in the open; and they will soon be destroyed. Let the light
   of God into the dark cellar of your despondency, and you will soon quit
   the den in sheer disgust at your own folly. Make a thought appear to be
   absurd and you have gone a long way towards conquering it.

   The question now before us is one of very wide application. I shall not
   attempt to suggest all the ways in which it may be employed, but I am
   going to turn it to three uses this morning. The first is for the man
   of God in distress. Let him take this question, and put it to his own
   reason and common sense, and especially to his own faith, "Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious?" When we have handled the question in that
   way, we will pass it over to the seeking sinner who is despondent, and
   we will ask him whether he really believes that God hath forgotten to
   be gracious. When this is done, we may have a moment or two left for
   the Christian worker who is dispirited, who cannot do his work as he
   would wish to do, and who mourns over the little result coming from it.
   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Will you be allowed to go forth
   weeping, bearing precious seed, and will you never come again
   rejoicing, bringing your sheaves with you? We shall have quite enough
   matter to fill up our time, and many fragments remaining when the feast
   is over. May God the Holy Spirit bless the word!

   I. TO THE MAN OF GOD IN DISTRESS, this question is commended, "Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious?"

   What kind of distress is that which suggests such a question? Where had
   Asaph been? In what darkness had he wandered? In what tangled wood had
   he lost himself? How came he to get such a thought into his mind?

   I answer, first, this good man had been troubled by unanswered prayers.
   "In the day of my trouble," he says,--"In the day of my trouble I
   sought the Lord"; and he seems to say that though he sought the Lord
   his griefs were not removed. He was burdened, and he cried unto God
   beneath the burden, but the burden was not lightened. He was in
   darkness, and he craved for light, but not a star shone forth. Nothing
   is more grievous to the sincere pleader than to feel that his petitions
   are not heeded by his God. It is a sad business to have gone up, like
   Elijah's servant, seven times, and yet to have seen no cloud upon the
   sky in answer to your importunity. It tries a man to spend all night in
   wrestling, and to have won no blessing from the covenant angel. To ask,
   and not to receive; to seek, and not to find; to knock, and to see no
   open door,--these are serious trials to the heart, and tend to extort
   the question, "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Unanswered prayer is
   very staggering even to strong faith; but the weak faith of a tried
   believer is hard put to it by long delays and threatened denials. When
   the mercy-seat itself ceases to yield us aid, what can we do? You will
   not wonder, then, considering your own tendency to doubt, that this man
   of God, when his prayers did not bring him deliverance, cried out,
   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"

   Besides that, he was enduring continued suffering. Our text says, "My
   sore ran in the night." His wound was bleeding ever: there was no
   cessation to his pain. At night he woke up and wished it were morning,
   and when the daylight came he wished for night again, if, perchance, he
   might obtain relief; but none came. Pain of body, when it is continuous
   and severe, is exceedingly trying to our feeble spirits; but agony of
   soul is worse still. Give me the rack sooner than despair. Do you know
   what it is to have a keen thought working like an auger into your
   brain? Has Satan seemed to pierce and gimlet your mind with a sharp,
   cutting thought that would not be put aside? It is torment indeed to
   have a worm gnawing at your heart, a fire consuming your spirit: yet a
   true child of God may be thus tormented. When Asaph had prayed for
   relief, and the relief did not come, the temptation came to him to ask,
   "Am I always to suffer? Will the Lord never relieve me? It is written,
   'He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds'; has he
   ceased from that sacred surgery? 'Hath God forgotten to be gracious?'"

   In addition to this, the man of God was in a state of mind in which his
   depression had become inveterate. He says, "My soul refused to be
   comforted." Many plasters were at hand, but he could not lay them upon
   the wound; many cordials offered themselves, but he could not receive
   them--his throat seemed closed. The meadows were green, but the gate
   was nailed up, and the sheep could not get in; the brooks flowed
   softly, but he could not reach their margin to lie down and drink.
   Asaph was lying at the pool of Bethesda, and he saw others step in to
   be healed, but he had no man to put him into the pool when the waters
   were troubled. His mind had become confirmed in its despondency, and
   his soul refused to be comforted.

   More than that, there seemed to be a failure of the means of grace for
   him. "I remembered God, and was troubled." Some of God's people go up
   to the house of the Lord where they were accustomed to unite in worship
   with delight, but they have no delight now; they even go to the
   communion-table, and eat the bread and drink the wine, but they do not
   receive the body and blood of Christ to the joy of their faith. Anon
   they get them to their chambers, and open their Bibles, and bow their
   knees, and remember God; but every verse seems to condemn them; their
   prayers accuse them, and God himself seems turned to be their enemy;
   and then it is little wonder that unbelief exclaims, "Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious?"

   At the back of all this there was another trouble for Asaph, namely,
   that he could not sleep. He says, "Thou holdest mine eyes waking." It
   seemed as if the Lord himself held up his eyelids, and would not let
   them close in sleep. Others on their beds were refreshed with "kind
   nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep"; but when Asaph sought his couch
   he was more unrestful there than when he was engaged in the business of
   the day. We may speak of sleeplessness very lightly, but among
   afflictions it is one of the worst that can happen to men. When the
   chamber of repose becomes a furnace of anguish it goes hard with a man.
   When the Psalmist could not find even a transient respite in sleep, his
   weakness and misery drove him to say, "Hath God forgotten to be
   gracious?"

   Moreover, there was one thing more: he lost the faculty of telling out
   his grief: "I am so troubled that I cannot speak." There are some
   people to whom we would not tell our trouble, for we know they would
   not understand it, for they have never been in deep waters themselves;
   there are others to whom we could not tell our trouble, though they
   might help us, because we feel ashamed to do so. To be compelled to
   silence is a terrible increase to anguish: the torrent is swollen when
   its free course is prevented. A dumb sorrow is sorrow indeed. The grief
   that can talk will soon pass away; that misery which is wordless is
   endless. The brook that ripples and prattles as it flows is shallow;
   but deep waters are silent in their flow. When a man falls under the
   power of a dumb spirit it needs Christ himself to come and cast the
   devil out of him, for he is brought into a very grievous captivity. We
   who know what a poor thing human nature is when it is brought into
   affliction, are not surprised that the man of God said in such a case,
   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"

   Having thus, you see, put the doubt in the most apologetic style, and
   mentioned the excuses which mitigate the sin of the question, I am now
   going to expose its unreasonableness and sinfulness, by considering
   what answers we may give to such a question? I shall endeavour to
   answer it by making it answer itself--

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Answer: Hath God forgotten
   anything? If he could forget, could he be God? Is it not absurd to
   speak of him as short of memory, of whose understanding there is no
   searching? Shall we speak of him as forgetting, when to his mind all
   things are present, and the past and the future are ever before him as
   in a map which lies open before the beholder's eye? Oh child of God,
   why doest thou talk thus? Oh troubled heart, wilt thou insult thy God,
   wilt thou narrow the infinity of his mind? Can God forget? Thou art
   forgetful. Perhaps thou canst scarce remember from hour to hour thine
   own words and thine own promises; but is the Lord such an one as thou
   art? Not even the least thing is passed over by him. He hath not
   forgotten the young ravens in their nests, but he heareth when they
   cry. He hath not forgotten a single blade of grass, but giveth to each
   its own drop of dew. He hath not forgotten the sea monsters down deep
   in the caverns of ocean. He hath not forgotten a worm that hides itself
   away beneath the sod; therefore banish the thought once for all, that
   thy God hath forgotten anything, much less that he hath forgotten to be
   gracious.

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Then hath he forgotten an old,
   long, ancient, aye, eternal habit of his heart. Hast thou not heard
   that his mercy endureth for ever? Did he not light up the lamps of
   heaven because of his mercy? Do we not sing, "To him that made great
   lights: for his mercy endureth for ever. The sun to rule by day, and
   the moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever"?
   Since the creation hath he not in providence always been gracious? Is
   it not his rule to open his hand, and supply the want of every living
   thing? Did he not give his Son to redeem mankind? Hath he not sent his
   Spirit to turn men from darkness to light? After having been gracious
   all these myriads of ages, after having manifested his love and his
   grace at such a costly rate, hath he forgotten it? Thou, O man, takest
   up a practice, and thou layest it down; thou doest a thing now and
   then, and then thou ceasest from thy way, but shall the eternal God who
   has always been gracious forget to be gracious? Oh, Lord, forgive the
   thought.

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Why, then, he must have forgotten
   his purpose! Hath thou not heard that or ever the earth was he purposed
   to redeem unto himself a people who should be his own chosen, his
   children, his peculiar treasure, a people near unto him? Before he made
   the heavens and the earth, had he not planned in his own mind that he
   would manifest the fulness of his grace toward his people in Christ
   Jesus, and dost thou think that he has turned from his eternal purpose,
   and rent up his divine decrees, and burned the book of life, and
   changed the whole course of his operations among the sons of men? Dost
   thou know what thou art at to talk so? Doth he not say, "I am the Lord,
   I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed"? Hath he
   said, and will he not do it? Hath he purposed, and shall it not come to
   pass? Banish, then, the thought of his forgetting to be gracious.

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Then he must have forgotten his
   own covenant; for what was the purport of his covenant with Jesus
   Christ, the second Adam, on the behalf of his people? Is it not called
   a covenant of grace? Is not grace the spirit and tenor and object of
   it? Of old he said, "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and
   will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy"; and in his covenant he
   ordains to show this grace to as many as are in Christ Jesus. Now, if a
   man's covenant be confirmed it stands fast. Nothing that occurs after a
   covenant has been made can alter it; and God having once made a
   covenant turneth not from his promise and his oath. The law which was
   four hundred and thirty years after the covenant made with Abraham
   could not change the promises which the Lord had made to the believing
   seed, neither can any accident or unforeseen circumstance make the
   covenant of grace null and void; indeed, there are no accidents with
   God, nor any unforeseen circumstances with him. He hath lifted his hand
   to heaven and hath sworn; he hath declared, "If my covenant be not with
   day and night, then will I cast away the seed of Jacob." The Lord hath
   not forgotten his covenant with day and night, neither will he cast off
   his believing people. He cannot, therefore, forget to be gracious.

   More than that, when thou sayest, "Has God forgotten to be gracious?"
   dost thou not forget that in such a case he must have forgotten his own
   glory? for the main of his glory lies in his grace. In that which he
   does out of free favour and love to undeserving, ill-deserving,
   hell-deserving men, he displays the meridian splendour of his glory.
   His power, his wisdom, and his immutability praise him; but in the
   forefront of all shines out his grace. This is his darling attribute;
   by this he is illustrious on earth and in heaven above. Hath God
   forgotten his own glory? Doth a man forget his honour? Doth a man turn
   aside from his own name and fame? He may do so in a moment of madness;
   but the thrice holy God hath not forgotten the glory of his name, nor
   forgotten to be gracious.

   Listen, and let unbelief stand rebuked. If God hath forgotten to be
   gracious, then he must have forgotten his own Son, he must have
   forgotten Calvary and the expiatory sacrifice offered there; he must
   have forgotten him that is ever with him at his right hand, making
   intercession for transgressors; he must have forgotten his pledge to
   him that he shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied.
   Canst thou conceive that? It is verging upon blasphemy to suppose such
   a thing; yet it must be that he has forgotten his own Son if he hath
   forgotten to be gracious.

   Once more; if this were the case, the Lord must have forgotten his own
   self; for grace is of the essence of his nature, since God is love. We
   forget ourselves and disgrace ourselves, but God cannot do so. Oh
   beloved, it is part and parcel of God's own nature that he should show
   mercy to the guilty and be gracious to those who trust in him. Hast
   thou forgotten as a father thy children? Can a woman forget her sucking
   child that she should not have compassion upon the son of her womb?
   These things are barely possible, but it is utterly impossible that the
   great Father should forget himself by forgetting his children; that the
   great Lord who hath taken us to be his peculiar heritage and his jewels
   should cease to value us and forget to be gracious to us.

   I think I hear some one say, "I do not think God hath forgotten to be
   gracious except to me." Doth God make any exceptions? Doth he not speak
   universally when he addresses his children? Remember, if God forgot to
   be gracious to one of his believing people he might forget to be
   gracious to them all. If there were one instance found in which his
   love failed, then the foundations would be removed, and what could the
   righteous do? The Good Shepherd doth not preserve some of his sheep,
   but all of them; and it is not concerning the strong ones of his flock
   that he saith, "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never
   perish;" but he has said it of all the sheep, aye, and of the smallest
   lamb of all the flock, of the most scabbed and wounded, of all that he
   has purchased with his blood. The Lord hath not forgotten himself in
   any one instance; but he is faithful to all believers.

   Now, let us attend to the amendment of the question. Shall I tell thee,
   friend, thou who hast put this question, what the true question is
   which thou oughtest to ask thyself? It is not, "Hath God forgotten to
   be gracious?" but "Hast thou forgotten to be grateful?" Why, thou
   enjoyest many mercies even now. It is grace which allows thee to live
   after having asked such a vile question. Grace is all around thee, if
   thou wilt but open thine eyes, or thine ears. Thou hadst not been
   spared after so much sin if God had forgotten to be gracious.

   Listen: Hast thou not forgotten to be believing? God's word is true,
   why dost thou doubt it? Is he a liar? Has he ever played thee false?
   Which promise of his has failed? Time was when thou didst trust him;
   then thou knewest he was gracious; but thou art doubting now without
   just cause; thou art permitting an evil heart of unbelief to draw thee
   aside from the living God. Know this, and repent of it, and trust thy
   best Friend.

   Hast thou not also forgotten to be reverent? Else how couldst thou ask
   such a question? Should a man say of God that he has forgotten to be
   gracious? Should he imagine such a thing? Should the keenest grief
   drive to such profanity? Shall a living man complain, a man for the
   punishment of his sins? Shall anyone of us begin to doubt that grace,
   which has kept us out of the bottomless pit, and spared us to this
   hour? Oh, heir of glory, favoured as thou hast been to bathe thy
   forehead in the sunlight of heaven full often, and then to lean thy
   head on the Saviour's bosom,--is it out of thy mouth that this question
   comes,--"Hath God forgotten to be gracious"? Call it back and bow thine
   head unto the dust, and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon thy servant,
   that he hath even thought thus for an instant."

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Why, surely thou hast forgotten
   thyself, or thou wouldest not talk so: thou hast forgotten that thou
   owest everything to thy Lord, and art indebted to him even for the
   breath in thy nostrils. Thou hast forgotten the precious blood of
   Jesus; thou hast forgotten the mercy-seat; thou hast forgotten
   providence; thou hast forgotten the Holy Spirit; thou hast forgotten
   all that the Lord has done for thee: surely, thou hast forgotten all
   good things, or thou wouldest not speak thus. Shake thyself from the
   dust; arise, and leave the dunghill of thy despair, and sing, "His
   mercy endureth for ever." Say in thy soul,--"Though he slay me, yet
   will I trust in him."

   Thus much to the child of God. May the Holy Spirit, the Comforter,
   apply it to every troubled heart.

   II. Furthermore, I desire to talk a little with THE SEEKING SINNER IN
   DESPONDENCY. You have not yet found joy and peace through believing,
   and therefore I will first describe your case, and what it is that has
   made you say, "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"

   You labour under a sense of guilt; you know that you have transgressed
   against God, and you feel that this is a terrible thing, involving
   wrath to the uttermost. The arrows of God are sticking in your soul,
   and rankling there. You cannot trifle with sin as you once did; it
   burns like a fiery poison in your veins! You have been praying to get
   rid of that sense of sin, but it deepens. The case I am stating is very
   clear to every child of God; but it is not at all clear to the man who
   is enduring it. He cries, "The more I pray, the more I go to hear the
   word, the more I read the Bible, the blacker sinner I seem to be. 'Hath
   God forgotten to be gracious?'"

   Moreover, a sense of weakness is increasing upon you. You thought that
   you could pray; but now you cannot pray. You thought it the easiest
   thing in the world to believe; but now the grappling-irons will not lay
   hold upon the promise, and you find no rest. You cannot now perform
   those holy acts which you once thought to be so easy. Your power is
   dried up, your glory is withered. Now you groan out, "I would but I
   can't repent, then all would easy be. Alas, I have no hope, no
   strength; I am reduced to utter weakness." We understand all this, but
   you do not; and we do not wonder at your crying,--"Hath God forgotten
   to be gracious." "Oh, but sir, I have been crying to God that he would
   be pleased to deliver me from sin, and the more I try to be holy the
   more I am tempted; I never knew such horrible thoughts before, nor
   discovered such filthiness in my nature before. When I get up in the
   morning I resolve that I will go straight all the day, and before long
   I am more crooked than ever. I feel worse rather than better. The world
   tempts me, the devil tempts me, the flesh tempts me, everything goes
   wrong with me. 'Hath God forgotten to be gracious'? I have prayed the
   Lord to give me peace, and he promises to give rest; but I am more
   uneasy than ever, and cannot rest where I used to do. I used to be very
   happy when I was at chapel on Sunday; I thought I was doing well to be
   at public worship; but now I fear that I only go as a formalist, and
   therefore I mock God, and make matters worse. I rested once in being a
   teetotaller, in being a hard-working, honest, sober man; but now I see
   that I must be born again. I used to rest once in the idea that I was
   becoming quite religious; but now it seems to me that my betterness is
   a hollow sham, and all my old nests are pulled down.

   My friend, I perfectly understand your case, and think well of it; for
   the like has happened to many of us. You must be divorced from self
   before you can be married to Christ; and that divorce must be made most
   clear and plain, or Jesus will never make a match with you. You must
   come clear away from self-righteousness, self-trust, self-hope, or else
   one of these days, when Jesus has saved you, there might be a doubt as
   to whether he is to have all the glory, or to go halves with self. He
   makes you nothing that he may be all in all to you. He grinds you to
   the dust that he may lift you out of it for ever. Meanwhile, I do not
   wonder that the question crosses your mind, "Hath God forgotten to be
   gracious?"

   Let me show how wrong the question is. "Hath God forgotten to be
   gracious?" If he has, he has forgotten what he used to know right well.
   David was foul with his adultery--remember that fifty-first Psalm--but
   how sweet was the prophet's message to the penitent king: "The Lord
   hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die!" "Wash me, and I shall be
   whiter than snow," was a prayer most graciously answered in that royal
   sinner's case. Remember Jonah, and how he went down to the bottom of
   the mountains in the whale's belly, and was brought even to hell's
   door; yet he lived to sing "Salvation is of the Lord," and was brought
   out of the depths of the sea. Remember Manasseh, who shed innocent
   blood very much, and yet the grace of God brought him among thorns, and
   made him a humble servant of the Lord. Remember Peter, how he denied
   his Master, but his Master forgave him, and bade him feed his sheep.
   Forget not the dying thief, and how in the extremity of death, filled
   with all the agonies of crucifixion, he looked to the Lord, and the
   Lord looked on him, and that day he was with the King in paradise.
   Think also of Saul of Tarsus, that chief of sinners, who breathed out
   threatenings against the people of God, and yet was struck down, and,
   before long was in mercy raised up again, and ordained to be a chosen
   vessel to bear the gospel among the heathen. If God has forgotten to be
   gracious, he has forgotten a line of things in which he has wrought
   great wonders, and in which his heart delighted from of old. It cannot
   be that he will turn away from that which is so dear to him.

   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Then why are all the old
   arrangements for grace still standing? There is the mercy-seat; surely
   that would have been taken away if God had forgotten to be gracious.
   The gospel is preached to you, and this is its assurance, "Whosoever
   believeth in him is not condemned." If the Lord had forgotten to be
   gracious he would not have mocked you with empty words.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ himself is still living, and still stands as a
   priest to make intercession for transgressors. Would that be the case
   if God had forgotten to be gracious? The Holy Spirit is still at work
   convincing and converting; would that be so if God had forgotten to be
   gracious? Oh brothers, while Calvary is still a fact, and the Christ
   has gone into the glory bearing his wounds with him, there is a
   fountain still filled with blood wherein the guilty may wash. While
   there is an atoning sacrifice there must be grace for sinners. I cannot
   enlarge on these points, for time flies so rapidly; but the continuance
   of the divine arrangements, the continuance of the Son of God as living
   and pleading, and the mission of the Holy Spirit as striving,
   regenerating, comforting--all this proves that God hath not forgotten
   to be gracious.

   Remember that God himself must according to nature be ever gracious so
   long as men will put their trust in the great sacrifice. He has
   promised to be gracious to all who confess their sins and forsake them
   and look to Christ; and he cannot forget that word without a change
   which we dare not impute to him. God might sooner forget to be than
   forget to be gracious to those to whom he has promised his grace. He
   has promised to every poor, guilty, confessing soul that will come and
   put his trust in Christ that he will be gracious in pardoning sin, and
   so it must be.

   I shall come to close quarters with you. I know your despair has driven
   you to the question, "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" and I would
   silence it by putting other questions to you. Is it not you that have
   forgotten to believe in Christ? "I have been praying," says one. That
   is all very well, but the gospel is, "He that believeth and is baptized
   shall be saved," not "he that prays." "I have been trying to come to
   Christ." I know that, but I read nothing about this trying in Holy
   Scripture, and I fear your trying is that which keeps you from Jesus.
   You are told to believe in Christ, not to try to believe. A minister in
   America, some time ago, was going up the aisle of his church during a
   revival, when a young man earnestly cried to him, "Sir, can you tell me
   the way to Christ?" "No," was the answer, very deliberately given; "I
   cannot tell you the way to Christ." The young man answered, "I beg
   pardon; I thought you were a minister of the gospel." "So I am," was
   the reply. "How is it that you cannot tell me the way to Christ?" "My
   friend," said the minister, "there is no way to Christ. He is himself
   the way. All that believe in him are justified from all things. There
   is no way to Christ; Christ is here." O! my hearer, Christ himself is
   the way of salvation, and that way comes right down to your foot, and
   then leads right up to heaven. You have not to make a way to the Way,
   but at once to run in the way which lies before you. The way begins
   where you now are; enter it. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ now, and
   you are saved; and then you will no more ask the question, "Is his
   mercy clean gone for ever?"

   "Oh," says one, "but I have been looking to reform myself and grow
   better, and I have done a good deal in that way." That is not the
   gospel; it is all very right and proper, but the gospel is, "He that
   believeth in him is not condemned." The other day I saw my bees
   swarming; they hung on a branch of a tree in a living mass; the
   difficulty was to get them into a hive. My man went with his veil over
   his face and began to put them into the skep; and I noticed that he was
   particularly anxious to get the queen bee into it; for if he once had
   her in the hive the rest would be sure to follow, and remain with her.
   Now, faith is the queen bee. You may get temperance, love, hope, and
   all those other bees into the hive; but the main thing is to get simple
   faith in Christ, and all the rest will come afterwards. Get the queen
   bee of faith, and all the other virtues will attend her.

   "Alas!" cries one, "I have been listening to the gospel for years."
   That is quite right, for "faith cometh by hearing"; but recollect, we
   are not saved by mere listening, nor even by knowing, unless we advance
   to believing. The letter of the word is not life; it is the spirit of
   it which saves. When tea was first introduced into this country a
   person favoured a friend with a pound of it. It was exceedingly
   expensive, and when he met his friend next, he enquired, "Have you
   tried the tea?" "Yes, but I did not like it at all." "How was that?
   Everybody else is enraptured with it." "Why," said the other, "we
   boiled it in a saucepan, threw away the water, and brought the leaves
   to table; but they were very hard, and nobody cared for them." Thus
   many people keep the leaves of form, and throw away the spiritual
   meaning. They listen to our doctrines, but fail to come to Christ. They
   throw away the true essence of the gospel, which is faith in Jesus. I
   pray you, do not act thus with what I preach. Do not bury yourself in
   my words, or even in the words of Scripture; but pass onward to the
   life and soul of their meaning, which is Christ Jesus, the sinner's
   hope. All the aroma of the gospel is in Christ; all the essence of the
   gospel is in Christ, and you have only to trust him to enjoy eternal
   life. You guilty, worthless sinner, you at the gates of hell, you who
   have nothing to recommend you, you who have no good works or good
   feelings, simply trust the merits of Christ, and accept the atonement
   made by his death, and you shall be saved, your sin shall be forgiven,
   your nature shall be changed, you shall become a new creature in Christ
   Jesus, and you shall never say again, "Hath God forgotten to be
   gracious?"

   III. The time has gone; therefore THE DISAPPOINTED WORKER must be
   content with a few crumbs. You have been working for Christ, dear
   brother, and have fallen in to a very low state of heart, so that you
   cry, "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" I know what state you are in.
   You say, "I do not feel as if I could preach; the matter does not flow.
   I do not feel as if I could teach; I search for instruction, and the
   more I pull the more I cannot get it." "Hath God forgotten to be
   gracious?" Can he not fill thine empty vessel again? Can he not give
   thee stores of thought, emotion, and language? He has used thee; can he
   not do so again? "Ah, but my friends have gone; I am in a village from
   which the people remove to London, and I lose my best helpers." Or,
   perhaps you say, "I work in a back street, and everybody is moving out
   into the suburbs." You have lost your friends, and they have forgotten
   you; but, "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" You can succeed so long
   as the Lord is with you. Be of good courage; your best friend is left.
   He who made a speech in the Academy found that all his hearers had gone
   except Plato; but as Plato remained, the orator finished his address.
   They asked him how he could continue under the circumstances, and he
   replied that Plato was enough for an audience. So, if God be pleased
   with you, go on; the divine pleasure is more than sufficient. "The Lord
   of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge." Did not Wesley
   say when he was dying, "The best of all is, God is with us"? Therefore
   fear not the failure of friends.

   "But, sir, the sinners I have to deal with are such tough ones: they
   reject my testimony; they grow worse instead of better; I do not think
   I can ever preach to them again." "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"
   You cannot save them, but he can. "But I work in such a depraved
   neighbourhood, the people are sunk in poverty and drunkenness." "Hath
   God forgotten to be gracious?" Does not he know the way to save
   drunkards? Does not he know how to rescue the harlot and the
   whoremonger, and make them clean and chaste?

   "Ah, but the church in which I labour is in a wretched state; the
   members are worldly, lukewarm, and divided. I have no brethren around
   me to pray for me, as you have; they are always squabbling and finding
   fault with one another." That is a horrible business, but "Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious?" Cannot God put you right, and your church
   right? If he begins with you by strengthening your faith, may you not
   be the means of healing all these divisions, and bringing these poor
   people into a better state of mind, and then converting the sinners
   round about you? "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?"

   "Ah, well," saith one, "I am ready to give it all up." I hope you will
   not do so. If you have made up your mind to speak no more in the name
   of the Lord, I hope that word will be like fire in your bones; for if
   God has not forgotten to be gracious, provoked as he has been, how can
   you forget to be patient? Is it possible while God's sun shines on you
   that you will refuse to shine on the fallen? If God continues to be
   gracious, you ought not to grow weary in well-doing.

   Perhaps I speak to some dear brother who is very old and infirm; he can
   hardly hear, and scarcely see, so that he reads his Bible with
   difficulty. He gets to the service now, but he knows that soon he will
   be confined to his chamber, and then to his bed. His mind is sadly
   failing him; he is quite a wreck. Take this home with you, my aged
   brother, and keep it for your comfort if you never come out again:
   "Hath God forgotten to be gracious?" Oh, no; the Lord hath said, "Even
   to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I
   have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you."
   Having loved his own which were in the world, the Lord Jesus loved them
   unto the end; and he will love you to the end. When the last scene
   comes, and you close your eyes in death, blessed be his name, you shall
   know that he has not forgotten you. "I will never leave thee, nor
   forsake thee," is the Lord's promise, and his people's sheet-anchor.
   Therefore, let us not fear when our frail tabernacles are taken down,
   but let us rejoice that God hath not forgotten to be gracious. Though
   our bodies will sink into the dust, they will ere long rise again, and
   we shall be in glory for ever with the Lord. Blessed be his name. Amen.

                     Israel And Britain. A Note of Warning

   A Sermon

   (No. 1844)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, June 7th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [12]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed
   not on him: that the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,
   which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath
   the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe,
   because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and
   hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
   understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
   These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
   him."--John 12:37-41.

   THE BLINDNESS of Israel concerning our Lord was sadly remarkable. It
   was a blindness of the eyes, for they saw his many miracles, and yet
   believed not: their ears also seemed to be stopped, for they heard his
   words and did not understand them; and their hearts also were heavy,
   for they did not relent under the plaintive admonitions of a Saviour's
   love. Their hearts were cruel towards the Messiah; they hated him
   without a cause. No door was open to the heart of Israel; they had
   hardened their heart, they had shut their eyes, they had stopped their
   ears, and even he that spake as never man spake gained no access to
   their souls. They went so far as to crucify him, and cried as they did
   so, "His blood be on us, and our children,"--words so sadly verified
   when Jerusalem was destroyed, and her children slaughtered, sold as
   slaves, or scattered to the four corners of the earth. It was indeed, a
   terrible blindness which happened unto Israel.

   Her rejection of the Lord Jesus is the more amazing because Isaiah gave
   so clear an account of the Messiah, and so clearly pictured Jesus of
   Nazareth. Descriptions of him could not have been more explicit than
   were the prophecies of Isaiah. It would be very easy to construct an
   entire life of Christ out of the book of Isaiah, beginning with "a
   virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name
   Immanuel," and ending with "he made his grave with the wicked and with
   the rich in his death." Isaiah spake of John the Baptist as the "voice
   crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight
   in the desert a highway for our God," and he foretold our Lord's
   ministry by the way of the sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the
   Gentiles, where the people who sat in darkness saw great light. The
   prophecy portrayed his Lord as "despised and rejected of men, a man of
   sorrows and acquainted with grief." Clearest of all is he upon his
   vicarious sufferings, concerning which he uses a variety of most
   definite expressions, such as,--"The chastisement of our peace was upon
   him; and with his stripes we are healed." Isaiah saw so clearly the day
   of our Lord Jesus that he spake rather as an evangelist than as a
   prophet; as an eyewitness, rather than as one foretelling a far-off
   event. Yet all this clearness was lost upon the men of his generation,
   and upon those who followed after. The nation had so long been fickle
   towards God, and had trifled so long with God's truth, that it was at
   length given up to a judicial hardness of heart, so that it could not
   understand or perceive. They refused the plainest messages of grace,
   and were so confirmed in unbelief that all their prophets cried with
   one plaintive voice, "Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the
   arm of the Lord revealed?"

   Nor was it alone grievous that Israel sinned against the light which
   shone in Isaiah's testimony; but, alas, she closed her eyes against the
   meridian splendour of our Lord's own life. Jesus bore his own witness
   in his person, teachings, works, and gifts. A sad wonder lies in the
   fact, that they did not know the Lord of glory although they saw his
   miracles, which were sure witnesses to his claims. He wrought among
   them works which none other man did. There is about our Lord a likeness
   to God: in all that he does the Godhead shines forth. He is so pure
   that he can say, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" How like to him
   who is saluted as "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts!" His teaching
   is so full of tenderness and gentleness that since God is love, we
   conclude that Christ is God. His many miracles touch upon every point
   in the great circle of omnipotence. What is there that God can do which
   the Christ did not do? Was he not multiform and multitudinous in his
   works of power and grace? Herein lay the wonder, that though he did so
   many miracles before them, not in secret but actually before their
   eyes; though he fed them with bread which they could see, and handle,
   and eat; though he healed the sick and raised the dead, they yet
   believed not on him. How sadly far can men go in unbelief, prejudice,
   and hardness of heart! How dim can human eyes become when men refuse to
   see! How darkened the understanding when men are unwilling to
   comprehend! Let us tremble at this, lest ourselves by imitating the
   chosen people in their unbelief should fall into like bondage to
   prejudice and ignorance, lest we by tampering with truth should come at
   last to be incapable of perceiving it, lest we also by rejecting the
   testimony of God should be given up to our own willfulness, to believe
   a lie and refuse the truth. Such, then, as Isaiah had foreseen, was the
   state of Israel in our Lord's day: never clearer evidence, and never
   more obstinate refusal to see it; never truth more plain, and never
   rejection so determined. Woe to those who close their ears; for the day
   cometh when they shall no longer hear! Woe to those who shut their eyes
   to the light, for they shall ere long be made blind! Isaiah was
   informed that such would be the outcome of his ministry: the Lord bade
   him say to the people, "Hear ye indeed, but underststand not; and see
   ye indeed, but perceive not." This must have been a very sad business
   for so generous and tender-hearted a man of God. It was painful to him
   to be so clear and yet to be so little understood. He was the Paul of
   the Old Testament; to him belonged fulness of knowledge, clearness of
   vision, plainness of speech, and faithfulness of spirit, and yet none
   of these things could make the people understand his message and
   receive it into their hearts. He was sublime in thought, attractive in
   word, and affectionate in spirit, and yet they did not believe his
   testimony; so that he must often have been astonished and heart-broken
   as he spake in vain to a people who were determined that they would not
   hear.

   This morning I shall draw certain lessons for ourselves from the great
   evangelical prophet, his ministry, and the people to whom he ministered
   so vainly. Our first meditation shall be concerning Isaiah and his
   ministry: and our second shall be concerning the people to whom he
   spake. Alas! I fear that we who speak in the name of the Lord in these
   last days have also to deal with hearts that are gross, ears that are
   heavy, and eyes that are dimmed. Upon this generation also there is
   falling a measure of judicial withdrawal of light and discernment; and
   we also have to cry, "Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the
   arm of the Lord revealed?"

   I. First, then, let me speak with you CONCERNING ISAIAH AND HIS
   MINISTRY. Oh, that the Spirit of God may speak with power through me.
   Our text says two things of Isaiah: first, that "he saw his glory," and
   secondly, that "he spake of him."

   The first statement is that Isaiah saw. Isaiah was a great seer: his
   prophesy begins thus,--"The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he
   saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem." All prophets were more or less
   seers, and saw what they foretold; but Isaiah above others was endowed
   with the seeing and foreseeing faculty. He had the clearest sight, and
   for that reason he had the clearest speech. When a man speaks so that
   you cannot understand him, the usual reason is that he does not
   understand himself; and when a man speaks so as to be readily
   comprehended, it is because the thought in his own mind is well
   defined. He that would speak well must see well. Mark the two things in
   the text--"When Isaiah saw his glory, and spake of him."

   In what sense is Isaiah said to have seen that which he spake? Does it
   not mean that he realized his thoughts? that they stood out vividly, so
   as to make a deep impression upon his own mind? Things to come were
   already come in his apprehension: he beheld what he believed, he felt
   what he foretold. He was not a dreamy person, maundering about
   half-fashioned, undeveloped thoughts; but he was a person who knew, and
   perceived, and felt what he preached. He saw with his soul what he set
   forth with his lips.

   But what did he see? It is a most important thing that in these days
   you and I should see the same, for the same work lies before us among a
   people who are a repetition of that disobedient and gainsaying nation.
   Read, then, with care the sixth chapter of Isaiah. Open your Bibles and
   refer to the passage verse by verse.

   First, what Isaiah saw was the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and
   lifted up. When the prophet went abroad among the people he heard them
   speaking against the Lord God; some contending for our deity and some
   for another; some leaning upon an arm of flesh, and others despising
   the promise of Jehovah the God of Israel. All this, I say, he saw out
   of doors, and he was troubled. But when he went into the sanctuary of
   God he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne : still reigning, still
   glorious, undisturbed by opposition. He must then have felt like David
   when he said, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
   thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
   counsel together against the Lord, and against his anointed. He that
   sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
   derision. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." As David
   saw Christ upon the throne amid the strirvings of the people, so did
   Isaiah see the Lord Jesus, not only upon the lowly mercy-seat, but upon
   a throne high and lifted up. I pray you, brethren, settle this in your
   hearts: our Lord is highly exalted as Lord of all. When you see evil
   occurrent, do not imagine that it defeats the eternal purposes of
   Jehovah: when you hear blasphemy and your blood runs cold, do not think
   that Christ has lost his glory: when men riot in sin, do not dream that
   the reins of affairs are out of Jesus' hands; for still he is "God over
   all, blessed for ever." My heart exalts this day, as, by undoubting
   faith, I am assured that he who died on Calvary is now exalted on high,
   far above all principalities and powers. "Thou art the King of glory, O
   Christ!" To thee our spirits ascribe infinite honour, world without
   end. Though the earth be removed, and the mountains be carried into the
   midst of the sea, yet the Lord reigneth. He that died upon the tree is
   crowned with majesty, and all the angels of God worship him. "He must
   reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet." Let us have no
   question about this; for if we have, we shall not be prepared to speak
   in the Lord's name with this evil generation. Amid the anarchy of the
   ages we see the glorious high throne of our redeeming Lord unmoved,
   unmovable: this is the rock of our refuge when the unsettled times rage
   about us like the waters of the troubled sea. We cannot be afraid, for
   Christ is on the throne.

   Observe that in Isaiah's vision he not only saw the Lord "upon a throne
   high and lifted up," but he saw that "his train filled the temple." so
   that in that temple there was room for no one else. The robes of this
   great King filled all the holy place; and neither priests nor offerers
   could there find standing room. It is a great thing to see how Jesus
   fills the heavenly places; in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
   Godhead. Let it be acknowledged to be so in heaven, for the glory of
   our Redeemer fills every street of the upper city, every mansion of the
   Father's house. In the church below, which is also his temple, among
   his spiritual people, the glory of the Lord Jesus engages and occupies
   every heart. They feel that there is none other in whom they can trust,
   none other whose words they will receive, none other in whom they
   glory; the Lord Christ is all in all to us, and we know no other Master
   or Saviour. His train fills the temple. I trust it is so among us. From
   Sabbath to Sabbath the one glory of this Tabernacle is the person and
   work of Jesus. What a glory hath God put upon the Only Begotten Son,
   whom he hath raised from the dead that he should be head over all
   things to his church, which he fills with his life, light, and love.
   Nor may we forget that all the things that exist are in a sense his
   temple, and the whole universe is filled with his train; for "he hath
   ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things." Glory
   be unto our ascended and reigning Lord.

   In this vision Isaiah saw the flaming spirits that wait upon Christ of
   God. He calls them "seraphims." The best interpretation we can give is
   "burning ones:" they burn in the sense of consuming. They burn up that
   which ought to be consumed, namely, all kinds of evil. There are powers
   around our Lord which will destroy evil. You ask me to tell you
   something about these seraphim; how can I? They have covered their
   faces, and covered their feet. Since nothing is to be seen, what can I
   tell you? Neither would it be right for us to speak concerning them,
   for manifestly it is their desire to be hidden. Who will violate their
   wish to be concealed? They covered their faces, they covered their
   feet, and therein they did as good as they say, "Look not on us, but
   look on him who sits upon the throne, whose attendants we are." This
   much is all we know,--exalted intelligences are in waiting upon our
   Lord, and are able to fly swiftly at his bidding. Tremble not
   concerning this error, or that, it shall be burnt up by those agencies
   which are at the command of our exalted Lord. Spirits from God shall
   run to and fro, and smite, as with the fire of God, those powers of
   darkness which now oppress our race. God himself is a consuming fire:
   who can dwell with him but those that are like him? He maketh his
   ministers a flame of fire. Around our Lord are the chariots of God,
   which are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels. His power knows no
   limit. His word runneth very swiftly; he speaks, and it is done; he
   commands, and it stands fast. Glory be unto thee, O Christ! We will not
   fear nor be discouraged, since these thy servants are ready to flame
   forth at thy bidding. Truly thou art Jehovah of hosts.

   This vision of the body-guard of the Prince of peace was enough to
   strengthen Isaiah: thus comforted, he would calmly confront that
   rebellious generation. If the prophet, when he opened the young man's
   eyes strengthened his heart by making him see horses and chariots of
   fire round about Elisha, shall not we be comforted as we behold legions
   of burning ones surrounding our King, and standing ready to fulfil his
   decrees?

   Further, we find that Isaiah saw in that vision the perpetual adoration
   which is rendered unto Christ concerning his holiness. Those bright
   spirits had never tasted of his mercy, for they had never sinned: they
   understood nothing of his grace, for they had not been guilty; but
   being pure in heart they gazed on the Lord with opened eye and adored
   his holiness. Their whole souls were filled with the contemplation of
   that one all-embracing attribute; and in responsive song they said each
   one to his fellow, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts." They
   emphasized their words by repeating them three times; and perhaps they
   alluded also to the Trinity in Unity as they cried, "Holy, holy, holy."
   This is the supreme glory of Christ, that in him is seen the holiness
   of God. Oh my friends, let us be like these seraphim, ravished with the
   holiness of the atonement, awe-struck with the justice of God in the
   great sacrifice. Reflect with reverence that God when he willed to save
   his elect would not commit a breach upon his laws; though he would
   redeem them from going down into the pit, yet he would not violate his
   word, nor change that most righteous penalty of death, which is the due
   desert of sin. Rather than stain his holiness he spared not his own
   Son, but freely delivered him up for us all. Consider the great love of
   holiness which must have been in the heart of the Father, that he would
   give up his Son to bleed sooner than his law should be dishonoured; and
   think of the great holiness of Christ, that he would rather give his
   back to the smiters and his cheeks to them that pluck off the hair,
   yea, rather stretch out his hands to the nails and expire forsaken of
   his God, than suffer sin to go unpunished. God would not even for
   mercy's sake issue an unjust pardon to the souls he loved.

   As I stand here this morning I also have visions of God, and the cross
   seems to me transformed into a burning throne, whereon justice is high
   and lifted up to the uttermost, as I see God himself in Christ Jesus
   bowing his head to death, that he might be just, and yet the Justifier
   of him that believeth. Around that cross I see troops of angels
   gathering, and I hear one crying unto another and saying, "Holy, holy,
   holy, is Jehovah Jesus, the great sacrifice for sin." Do you not unite
   in their reverent homage? If you do you will go forth and tell of
   pardon bought with blood, and of the atonement finished once for all.
   With hallowed confidence you will tell it out among the people that the
   holy Lord reigneth from the tree, until all creatures fall down and
   worship him that was slain, because his holiness was thereby revealed
   in noonday splendour.

   This was not all that was revealed to the prophet; for he heard the
   seraphim say, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth
   is full of his glory." Even when men rejected Christ, even when hearts
   were fat, and eyes were dim, and ears were heavy, even then the whole
   earth was full of the glory of Christ. When scientists tell us that
   they cannot see God, I am amazed. To me it is impossible not to see
   him. Though I cannot pry with the scalpel into the anatomy of the human
   frame, yet when I look upon the mere skin of the human countenance I
   see the handiwork of God. Though I cannot dig into the lower strata of
   the earth and disentomb the fossil and decipher its stone preserved
   memorial, yet to me rock, and clay, and sand, and relic of the past,
   bear the sure hieroglyph of God. Though I cannot inform you of all the
   interesting details of insect life, or descant upon the secrets of
   botany, yet to me bees bring honeyed thoughts of God, and flowers
   breathe the perfume of his love. Where is God? Say rather, Where is he
   not? Not with these grosser senses, but by higher faculties I see and
   hear my God; yea, he doth surround me, and my faith embraceth him. I am
   no fool for this; the best authority declares that he is the fool who
   saith in his heart "There is no God." Yes, the whole earth is full of
   the glory of Christ, and above the earth in every cloud it is seen, and
   above the cloud every star shines out concerning him. Alas, for the
   blind-eyes that cannot see that which is evidently set forth in every
   place. Alas for the ears which cannot hear when earth, and sea, and
   heaven, and hell, are all echoing to the tread of the Omnipotent Christ
   of God. Oh brethren, have you ever seen this vision, have you ever seen
   God's glory filling the whole earth? If so, you are prepared for the
   times that are and are to be times of gloom, and darkness, and sin, and
   blasphemy--and yet your heart does not tremble for the ark of the Lord.

   When all this was seen of the prophet, he noted that the posts of the
   doors moved. If I am rightly informed, there were two huge columns
   before the temple called Jachin and Boaz. These were made with singular
   skill, and were the wonder of the age. They were of brass, cast by
   Solomon; but in the course of ages they had no doubt mellowed into
   bronze, and there they stood, two tremendous erections, upbearing
   massive doors. We are told, I know not whether it be correct, that the
   gates that swung upon these columns required at least twenty men either
   to open or to shut them; but as the prophet saw that vision he noticed
   that these massive columns trembled, and thus did obeisance to the God
   who was within their gates. Our Revised Version reads it, "The
   foundations of the thresholds were moved." Even to its foundations the
   house trembled with solemn awe of the divine presence. Brethren,
   heaven, and earth, and hell, and all created things reflect the glory
   of the Lord, and thus adore him. Oh Lord Jesus, thou art worthy of all
   honour. "All the earth doth worship thee." If it was so with posts and
   doors, shall not our hearts rejoice with trembling? shall not our souls
   be moved in the presence of the Most High? and will we not fall down
   before the glorified Christ, as John did, who wrote, "When I saw him I
   fell at his feet as dead?" Everything is filled with awe in his
   majestic presence, save only man, the impious rebel who dares defy his
   God.

   Then came the best part of the vision for Isaiah. At the glorious
   sight, he felt, "Woe is me, for I am undone, I am stricken dumb. I can
   never speak again, for my lips are unclean, and I dwell among an
   unclean people." Then, swift as lightning flew a seraph, bringing a
   coal more burning than himself from off the altar of sacrifice,
   wherewith he touched the prophet's lip. Beloved, this is what we need.
   We need to feel the atonement laid home to us, to feel the power of the
   great sacrifice of Christ, to hear a voice saying within our spirit,
   "Thine iniquity is put away, and thy sin is purged." Though that live
   coal must have blistered the lip which it covered, yet it made it
   eloquent. Common fire would destroy the organs of speech, but the fire
   of sacrifice does not so, but it unlooses a grateful tongue, and helps
   a grateful heart to tell the love immense, unsearchable, which offered
   itself upon the altar of sacrifice, that holiness and love might save
   the sinner. Our peace comes from the Holy, Holy, Holy One, who is just,
   and yet forgives his people's sin. Brother, if you are to proclaim the
   glory of your Lord, you must feel the sacrificial coal applied to the
   place where your impurity is most seen, even to your lips; you must
   know that you are forgiven; for your conviction that you are clean
   before God will give you confidence in telling out to others the story
   of the cross. This is what Isaiah saw.

   Listen for a minute to that further word that follows:--Isaiah when he
   saw his glory "spake of him." He that hath seen this sight must speak.

   He spake in deep humility. Never braver man than Isaiah, but never one
   who walked in lowlier reverence before his God. He never forgot to his
   dying day that "woe is me! for I have seen the King, the Lord of
   hosts."

   Yet, observe that he spake with very willing obedience. "Here am I," he
   said, "send me." He offers himself to be God's mouth to the people,
   whatever the message may be. He seems to say, "Here am I in the
   entirety of my being, purchased to thee by thy great pardoning love;
   use me as thou wilt, and send me where thou wilt." He continued to
   report his Lord's message under constant rebuffs, and despite the
   ceaseless obduracy of Israel. Though he cried, "Who hath believed our
   report?" yet he continued that report. That chapter which begins with
   his complaint, has in it not only a continuation of the report, but a
   fuller version of it than he had ever given before. He was sad but
   resolute, grieved yet persevering, broken in heart, but not broken down
   in constancy. Brethren, it needs great grace to go upon a fruitless
   errand. One had need see the glory of the Lord to be enabled to fight a
   losing battle. I am sometimes afraid that I have to do this myself; but
   if it be so, it is not ours to bargain for success, but to yield
   implicit obedience. It is ours to abide faithful to our commission,
   whether men will hear or whether they will forbear. Brethren, be it
   ours to serve the Lord gladly, and testify to what we have seen, even
   though no man should receive our witness.

   But then it is said of Isaiah that he "spake of him," that is, of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. In all that Isaiah said he had an eye to Christ. It
   was all his business among men to speak of the glories of the coming
   Son of God. May the Lord give us such a sight of Christ in his glory
   that from this day forth we shall be absorbed in glorifying him. May
   our life be a perpetual ministry concerning Christ. Remember that word
   concerning John the Baptist, "John did no miracle, but all things that
   John spake of this man were true." If we can do no miracle and achieve
   no success, let us at least cry without ceasing. "Behold the Lamb of
   God." Though we decrease, it matters not so long as he doth increase;
   we are glad to disappear, as the morning star is lost at the rising of
   the sun. It is our delight to imitate the seraphim, and with veiled
   face and covered feet to attend about the throne of Jehovah Jesus our
   Lord.

   II. I now ask your kind attention to the second part of my subject,
   which is a very painful one, CONCERNING THE NATION TO WHICH ISAIAH
   SPAKE. Their terrible sin lay in this, that they were willingly blinded
   by the light which ought to have been to them a help to see Christ, and
   they were hardened by those very truths which ought to have melted
   them. They became more and more adverse to Christ through beholding in
   him such a character as ought to have won their hearts. To the
   prophet's teaching they were entirely dead. A specimen of this we find
   in the succeeding chapters of Isaiah. Israel and Syria attacked Ahaz,
   whose reign followed those of Uzziah and Jotham. The prophet came and
   said to Ahaz, "Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither fainthearted
   for the two tails of these smoking firebrands." Ahaz was assured that
   God would help him if he would but trust in him; but instead of doing
   so, the king determined to petition for the help of the great king of
   Assyria, with the result in the long run that "the king of Assyria came
   unto him and distressed him, but helped him not." Isaiah, to confirm
   his message, bade the king choose any sign either in the depth or in
   the height above; but the infidel king replied, "I will not ask,
   neither will I test Jehovah." He had so defiantly cast off allegiance
   to the true God that he would not even accept a sign, though it was
   left to his own choice. Thus Isaiah's message was rejected though put
   in the most winning form, for the hearts of the people were blinded and
   hardened so as to choose the way of destruction. Ultimately, as you
   know, the Assyrians carried the whole people away; for they had
   rejected God's message willfully, and wrath came upon them. What a
   grievous task to be called to preach to such a people!

   They went on from bad to worse as a nation; they turned aside
   grievously, but not in heart, so that when Christ came they were unable
   to discern him, for had they known him they would not have crucified
   the Lord of glory. This blindness was in part a punishment for their
   long rebellion. If men willfully shut their eyes, do you wonder that
   they become blind? If men will not hear, do you wonder that they grow
   deaf? He that perverts truth shall soon be incapable of knowing the
   true from the false. If you persist in wearing glasses that distort,
   everything will be distorted to you.

   "Hear the just law, the judgment of the skies!

   He that hates truth shall be the dupe of lies."

   But although this blindness was a punishment for former sin, it was
   itself a sin. They willfully rejected the testimony of God against
   themselves; they refused the self-evident Christ who would so greatly
   have blessed them. This wilful rejection was carried out so effectually
   that it became impossible to convert and heal them; they could not be
   instructed, or reformed, and therefore they were given over to
   destruction. Nothing remained but to allow the Romans to burn the
   temple and plough the site of the city. It was a dreadful thing that
   they should deliberately choose destruction, and obstinately involve
   themselves in the most tremendous of woes. Poor Israel, we pity thee!
   It was sad indeed to fall from so great a height! Yet we are bound to
   admit that God dealt with thee justly, for thou didst choose thine own
   delusions. The Lord cries, "Oh that my people had harkened unto me."
   Our Saviour weeps and cries, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I
   have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
   chickens under her wings, but ye would not! Behold, your house is left
   unto you desolate."

   What I have to say this morning is this--that I am growingly fearful
   lest our own country should furnish a parallel to all this. Read the
   story of England, beginning where you will, and see how gracious God
   has been to us. Note well our great deliverances, from the destruction
   of the Spanish Armada to the overthrow of Napoleon. Do not forget how
   often this little country has been made victorious in wars against
   great peoples, who thought to swallow her up. Then reflect how God sent
   the light to us; how the gospel spread all over England, and how it has
   in many ways been rejected. How often since the days of Cromwell Rome
   has been allowed to dim the light of our Protestantism, and how it
   labours to do so still! See how this people have received the truth of
   heaven, but again and again have proved false to it, turning at one
   time to superstition and at another time to infidelity. At this moment
   we are rich, and despite depression in business, we are less tried by
   it than any other nation. And what comes of all this mercy but
   increased sin? Why, at this moment we have sin rampant among us almost
   beyond precedent. Think how the poor are oppressed and ground down with
   awful poverty in many parts of this great city. Shall not God avenge
   the cry of starving women? Worse still, if worse can be: those who dare
   walk our streets after sundown tell us that Sodom, in its most putrid
   days, could scarce exceed this metropolis for open vice. To our
   infinite disgust and horror, the names of certain of the greatest in
   the land are at this hour openly mentioned in connection with the
   filthiest debauchery. This is not the place for details, nor can I
   mention the matter, or even think of it without feeling my very soul on
   fire. Faithfulness requires plain speech; but it is a hideous evil that
   the dregs of vice should be the chosen luxury of certain of our
   hereditary legislators and rulers. Woe unto thee, Oh land, when thy
   great ones love the harlot's house! Deep is our shame when we know that
   our judges are not clear in this matter, but social purity has been put
   to the blush by magistrates of no mean degree; yea, it is said that the
   courts of justice have lent themselves to the covering and hushing up
   of the iniquities of the great. Shall not God be grieved by such a
   nation as this? He who has read a certain story, which is but too-well
   known, must have felt his ears tingle and his heart tremble. What is
   coming over us? What horrible clouds are darkening our skies? There
   were judges once who would not have suffered the laws to be trampled on
   by the great, but would have dealt out equal justice to rich and poor:
   I cannot persuade myself that it will be otherwise now, and yet I fear
   the worst. O God, have mercy upon the land whose judgment-seats and
   palaces are defiled with vice.

   This is not all: a general indifference to all religion is creeping
   over the country; at least over this vast metropolis. Ask those who
   visit from door to door among our crowded populations, and they will
   tell you that never before in their life-time were there so few persons
   attendant upon the means of grace. Street after street of this city
   scarcely possesses more than one regular attendant upon the preaching
   of the word. The Sabbath is no longer a day of worship with millions.
   What continual efforts are made to rob us of the Sabbath-day; to
   degrade it into a common work-day, and to make a slave of the
   working-man. To-day the revelation of God is treated with indifference,
   or talked of as if it deserved no reverence or credit. Unbelief has
   sapped the foundations of the social fabric. Worst of all,--I must not
   hold back the charge, many of the avowed ministers of Christ are no
   ministers of faith at all, but promoters of unbelief. The modern pulpit
   has taught men to be infidels. What truth is there which has not been
   doubted by divines, questioned by doctors of divinity, and at length
   been denounced by the priests of "modern thought?" Nothing remains upon
   which a certain school of preachers have not spit their scepticism. The
   experience of the unbelief of Germany is being repeated here. Among
   those who are ordained to be the preachers of the gospel of Christ,
   there are many who preach not faith but doubt, and hence they are
   servants of the devil rather than of the Lord. Think not that I am
   aiming at the Church of England. With all my objection to a
   state-church, I am not so unjust as to conceal my belief, that I see in
   the Episcopal Church at this time less of unbelief than among certain
   Dissenters: in fact, Nonconformity in certain quarters is eaten through
   and through with a covert Unitarianism, less tolerable than
   Unitarianism itself. So frequently are the fundamental doctrines of the
   gospel assailed, that it becomes needful, before you cross the
   threshold of many a chapel, to ask the question, "Shall I hear the
   gospel here to-day, or shall I come out hardly knowing whether the
   Bible is inspired or not? Shall I not be made to doubt the atonement,
   the work of the Holy Ghost, the immortality of the soul, the punishment
   of the wicked, or the deity of Christ?"

   I know I shall stir a hornet's nest by these honest rebukes but I
   cannot help it. I am burdened and distressed with the state of
   religion; a pest is in the air; no truth is safe from its withering
   infection. No signs can be more alarming than the growing infidelity
   and worldliness which I see among those who call themselves Christians.
   Does this nation really intend to cast off the fear of God and the
   doctrines of Holy Scripture to follow the vain imaginings of the
   sophists and the fashionable follies of the great? Are we to see again
   unbelief and luxurious sin walking hand in hand? If so, there be some
   of us who mean to take up our sorrowful parable, and speak as plainly
   as we can for truth and holiness, whether we offend or please. Be it
   ours still to thunder out the law of God, and proclaim with trumpet
   clearness the gospel of Jesus, not bating one jot of firm belief in the
   revelation of God, nor winking at sin, nor toning down truth, even
   though we fear that the only result will be to make this people's
   hearts gross, and their ears heavy, and their eyes blind. If it must be
   so, my soul shall weep in secret; but still, Oh Lord, here am I, send
   me. Be of good courage, Oh my heart, for the faithful have not ceased
   from among men; other voices will cry aloud and spare not, if haply our
   land may be purged of its present defilement.

   Hearken yet again while I press this subject personally home to you.
   Has not this word a personal bearing upon some of you? Certain of you
   have heard the gospel preached plainly and honestly, and yet you have
   never received it: is there not creeping over you a fatal indifference?
   Are not your hearts turning to stone? Possibly you are professors of
   religion, and yet you do not feel the power of it; what does this mean?
   If you are not a praying people, nor a holy people, and yet you are a
   professing people, what an awful doom awaits you! Shall my ministry be
   a savour of death unto you? It may be that my voice grows stale to you,
   and what I say seems common-place: but is this to be the reason for
   your refusing Christ and his salvation, refusing the power of his word,
   refusing holiness which we would work in you? Oh, shall it be so? Will
   you die? Dear hearers, I should not like to meet one of you at that day
   of judgment and have to feel that I preached you into a greater
   blindness than you might have known. Oh, be converted! Turn ye, turn
   ye, why will ye die? May God in infinite mercy speak to you that you
   may believe in Jesus now, lest that should come upon you which is
   spoken of by the prophet, "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and
   perish!"

   Ere I have done, hear the sweet whisper which closes the sixth of
   Isaiah. Notwithstanding all the terrible work that Isaiah had to do he
   was not left without comfort; the Lord said to him, "In it there shall
   be a tenth." You know how the prophet cried, "Except the Lord of hosts
   had left us a seed we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
   Gomorrah." The Lord has his sacred tithe and these he will not lose.
   The tree has lost its leaves, for it is winter time; but still it is
   alive, and the sap will flow again, for its substance is in it! The
   tree is leveled by the axe; but weep not despairing tears, for it shall
   sprout again, for life is still in it. Even so the Church must live;
   truth must be victorious; purity must conquer, the Christ must reign.
   Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him. Reject
   Christ if you will to-day, Oh ye who think yourselves so exceeding
   wise, but there is a people who love him, a secret people who cling to
   him; and when he comes, as come he must ere long, they will welcome him
   and partake in his glory. As for you that refuse him this day, how will
   you stand when he appeareth? Whither will you flee? You shall ask the
   hills to cover you, but they will refuse. You shall bid the mountains
   hide you, but they will not yield a cavern for your shelter. Be wise
   now, therefore, and no more resist your Lord. "Kiss the Son lest he be
   angry, and ye perish from the way while his wrath is kindled but a
   little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him!" May you and
   I and all of us be of that blessed number. Amen and Amen.

The Pity of the Lord--the Comfort of the Afflicted

   (No. 1845)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 14, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON BEHALF OF THE LONDON
   HOSPITALS.

   "Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the
   patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
   full of pity, and of tender mercy." James 5:11.

   WE are far too apt to entertain hard thoughts of God. The horrible
   atheism of our depraved nature continually quarrels with the Most High
   and, when we are under His afflicting hand and things go cross to our
   will, the evil of our nature becomes sadly evident. When sorely
   distressed, we are too apt to think and to speak as we ought not to do
   concerning the Most High. Let us never forget that our hard speeches
   have all been false speeches and that our suspicions of our God have
   always been libels upon Him. When we have not thought and spoken well
   of His name, we have thought and spoken amiss! Looking back, we desire,
   if possible, to blot out every murmuring thought with our tears and we
   would cancel every complaining word with humble sorrow. We would eat
   our bitter words--they were all unwarranted and, therefore, with deep
   repentance we call them back. On taking a survey of our whole life, we
   see that the kindness of God has run all through it like a silver
   thread. Goodness and mercy have followed us all our days, always
   pursuing us even when we have wickedly fled from them.

   Even our apparent ills have been real blessings. As I said in prayer,
   so I say now--I do not know for which I would bless God most--for my
   sorrows or for my joys. The best piece of furniture I have ever had in
   my house is the cross of affliction! Adversity is the richest field in
   all the farm of life. We have never reaped such a harvest from any seed
   as from that which fell from our hands while tears were falling from
   our eyes. When we have gone forth weeping, bearing precious seed, we
   have invariably come, again, rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with us! O
   Sufferer, when your bed grew hard beneath you and your pain was
   exceedingly great, it may be that your groans and complaints were not
   altogether those of sorrow, but a measure of rebellion mingled with
   them! For this, be ashamed and confounded! Confess those rebellions!
   Acknowledge that your hard thoughts were all founded upon error and ask
   for Grace to be forever at one with your Lord. You who have suffered
   the loss of property or the loss of beloved friends, you, too, perhaps,
   have thought of God foolishly--remember those thoughts with shame and
   be all the more eager, at once, to bear willing testimony that the Lord
   is good and that His mercy endures forever. It is true, however
   circumstances may look otherwise, that "the Lord is full of pity, and
   of tender mercy." Whatever may or may not be, the Lord must be good!
   Set your seal to that Truth of God. Hold up your head and your hand as
   one who can speak well of His name and say, "I will bless the Lord at
   all times! His praise shall continually be in my mouth!"

   Let each restored man say, "He heals all my diseases." Let each tried
   one now say, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord
   delivers him out of them all." Let the aged man bring the spoils of his
   experience and lay them down at the feet of the Lord who, up to now,
   has helped him. Our desire, this morning, will be to help one another
   to avoid future murmuring. We have really nothing to complain
   about--even our disappointments will yet be causes for praise! O, may
   the Spirit of God now make us wise to avoid such hasty blunders in the
   future and teach us to know the Lord so well that we may henceforth be
   at peace with Him, whatever He may do! O that we may never bear false
   witness against our God! The Apostle James, in this passage, aims at
   setting us right in our judgments of the Lord's dealings that patience
   may become an easier lesson.

   Will you notice that the Apostle, first, in this verse, sites an
   instructive instance of the tender pity of God--"Behold, we count them
   happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have
   seen the end of the Lord." Then,

   secondly, he makes a consoling statement and lays it down as a matter
   of doctrine that "the Lord is full of pity, and of tender mercy." When
   we have talked upon those two matters, we shall close by observing the
   precious lessons which we ought to gather from them, as bees fetch
   honey from the flowers.

   I. Notice that when James is exhorting us to full confidence in God in
   the hour of trial, he gives us AN INSTRUCTIVE INSTANCE. He quotes the
   story of Job. In these days everything is doubted and a new theory is
   sure to run like fire among stubble, for this fickle age delights, like
   the Athenians, in anything new, however absurd it may be! Hence no part
   of Scripture has been left alone and, of the Book of Job, it has been
   said that it is a drama, a fiction, a fine piece of Oriental
   imagination. But see how the New Testament protects the Old! How can
   Job be an imaginary character? Does the Spirit of God quote for our
   guidance a fictitious person? Does He set Job before us as an example
   when Job never existed? The thing is too absurd to contemplate for a
   single moment! There was such a person as Job and possibly the present
   passage may confirm us in the belief that the Patriarch lived in the
   earliest ages, since this Apostle, when mentioning the Prophets, places
   Job in the forefront of them and quotes his case in preference to any
   other.

   "Take, my brethren, the Prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
   Lord, for an example of suffering, affliction and of patience...You
   have heard of the patience of Job." He might have mentioned Jacob, or
   Moses, or David as examples of heroic endurance, but he cites Job--in
   all probability as being first in order of time and in degree of trial.
   I conceive him to have been one of the earliest of those gracious
   persons who walked with God through much tribulation-- and endured as
   seeing Him who is invisible.

   At any rate, we are certain that James does not bring before us the
   imaginary actor in an Oriental tale as an argument for patience, for
   when men are suffering, they have no patience with fiction--they are in
   no humor for amuse-ment--and suffering men will only endure to be
   comforted by the story of real persons who have literally known the
   sufferings of life. Should you try to stimulate the afflicted to
   patience by a piece of fiction, they would turn upon you with
   indignation and say--"Yes, you demand a patience of me which was never
   found in mortal man. You ask me to display a virtue which was never
   actually exemplified in history and so you are driven to invent a
   person for my imitation!" It is too absurd!

   Observe, that when this Apostle introduces Job, it is with the view of
   pointing out the tender mercy of God in his case. He begins by saying,
   "Behold, we count them happy which endure." The pity and tender mercy
   of God are to be seen in the happiness of those who are called to
   suffer. "We count them happy which endure." Who counts them happy? It
   is a counting which is not general. This arithmetic is only known to
   faith and must be learned of the Lord Jesus. "We," that is, the Church
   of God, count them happy who are counted worthy to suffer for Christ's
   sake. We do not deem those to be happy who sport their lives away and
   end a wasted life of luxury by a dreadful death in unbelief. We do not
   count those to be happy who are fattened like the beasts in the
   pasture, but shall soon be brought to the slaughter--such are all
   around us--we sorrow because of them! We are not so foolish as to count
   those happy who spread themselves like a green bay tree, only to be the
   sooner laid low by the axe of doom!

   We count those happy who endure because our Savior has taught us so to
   reckon. Did He not say, "Blessed are you, when men shall revile you and
   persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely,
   for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward
   in Heaven, for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you"?
   Did He not also say, "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be
   comforted"? This is the verdict of the Savior and the true disciple
   must not dream of disputing with His Master! It is ours to believe that
   those who endure the will of God are among the happiest of the race,
   for the inspired Psalmist has said, "Blessed is the man whom You
   chasten, O Lord."

   I may venture to say that the more sensible part of mankind, in some
   measure, concur with the people of God in this accounting. We count
   that man happy who has passed through trial and hardship with a brave
   endurance. Such life is of an interesting and manly kind. But life
   without struggle and difficulty is thin and tasteless. How can a noble
   life be constructed if there is no difficulty to overcome, no suffering
   to bear? What was there about Dives--his fine linen and sumptuous
   fare--to make life of? Who envies him? Studying the lives of eminent
   men, we come to the conclusion that on the whole, it is good for a man
   to bear the yoke; good for a man to breast the billows; good for a man
   to pass through fire and through water--and so to learn sublime
   lessons. When we see what poor, paltry things those are who are nursed
   in the lap of luxury and, consequently, never come to a real manhood,
   "we count them happy that endure." No wise man would seek to be
   exempted from the healthy discipline of trouble any more than an
   intelligent child would wish to be

   excused from school and to be allowed to play all day and every day in
   the meadows. No--we are not butterflies that flit from flower to
   flower--life is real, life is earnest and the tonic of sorrow braces
   and strengthens us to make it so! As a matter of faith and even as a
   matter of reasonable judgment, "we count them happy which endure."

   This counting is not mere fancy, but it is a correct estimate--there is
   a happiness in affliction which none will doubt who have tasted it.
   Within the rough shell of sorrow, we find a sweet kernel. When we look
   to the end of affliction; when we see all its comfortable fruit; when
   we mark what it corrects and observe what it produces, we judge that it
   is no mean blessing! Happy is the man who has been enabled to endure!
   He rises from the deeps of woe like a pearl-finder from the sea, rich
   beyond comparison. He has gained more than he has lost, even though he
   has lost everything, if he has gained contentment, conformity to the
   will of God, a deep experience and a surer hope. Beloved, those of us
   who have done business upon great waters and have endured abundant
   pain, count them happy that endure, even while they are enduring! The
   people of God find themselves more buoyant in the most salty seas of
   sorrow than in other waters. The cross does, in very deed, raise us
   nearer to Christ when it is fully sanctified! It could not do so if it
   were not sanctified by the Holy Spirit to that noble end--but under His
   hand it works out our lasting good. Rare gems glisten in the mines of
   adversity.

   I believe that the child of God seldom trusts God so simply at other
   times as he does when he is in great trouble. Then the second causes
   are all knocked away like dog-shores from a new-built vessel and the
   soul glides like a ship from the stocks into the waters of Grace which
   are her element. Creatures too often come between us and the
   Creator--and when they are removed, we see Him more distinctly, whom to
   see is joy and peace! We never get so near to the source of all
   heavenly consolation as when earthly comfort is removed far away. God
   seems never so much a husband to any as to the widow and never so much
   a father as to the fatherless! Our Lord Jesus assures us that the rich
   man seldom enters His Kingdom--the general Truth of God which lies
   within that fact is this--the wealth which we possess, be it of what
   kind it may, impoverishes us by making faith more difficult. And it is
   only by faith that we enter the Kingdom of God. It is hard to learn
   swimming on dry land, but he that is in the water is driven to strike
   out. Our troubles are such "waters to swim in." We are obliged--strange
   that we should need such forcing to it--we are obliged, I say, to cast
   ourselves on God when other helpers fail! It is written, "Blessed is he
   that trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." Thus you see how
   sorrow compels us to the trust which makes us blessed and thus you see
   why, "we count them happy which endure."

   Endurance also works in the child of God a close clinging to God which
   produces near and dear communion with Him. Have you not, in time of
   trouble, found yourself admitted to inner chambers which, before, had
   been closed to you? Oh, the rare fellowship of tried saints! Sorrows
   reveal to us the Man of Sorrows! Griefs waft us to the bosom of our
   God! See the little chicks in the sunshine--they are running all over
   the yard to gather what they can. But a hawk is in the sky and the
   mother calls them with a sharp alarm. They perceive the danger and now
   they thrust themselves into her feathers and are hidden beneath her
   wings. He was a much afflicted man who wrote, "He shall cover you with
   His feathers and under His wings shall you trust." The most delicious
   of sensations outside of Heaven is to faint away upon the bosom of the
   Lord! We find strength in helplessness, joy in submission, rest in
   resignation, Heaven in a full surrender!

   It is delightful to look up to a stripping and chastening God and to
   say to Him, "My soul is even as a weaned child. Do what You will, for
   Your will is my will. I submit myself to the withdrawal of what has so
   long seemed the only source of my comfort and the fountain of my
   life--for You are better to me than all the breasts of consolation. I
   am sorely wounded, but You have done it and You always do well.
   Therefore, I will take pleasure in the grief You send." Beloved, that
   suffering which gives new life to prayer and opens to us the palace
   gates through which we pass into Divine fellowship is so great a gift
   that, "we count them happy which endure."

   Besides, the Lord has a choice way of manifesting Himself unto His
   servants in their times of weakness. I speak what I know, for I have
   trod "that path which no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon's
   eye seen it"--the path upon which shines the inward personal revelation
   of God! He draws the curtain about the bed of His chosen sufferer and,
   at the same time, He withdraws another curtain which before concealed
   His Glory! He takes away the delights of health and vigor and then He
   implants energy of another and a higher order, so that the inner man
   waxes mighty while the outer man decays. So wondrously does Grace work
   beyond Nature that it transfigures bodily sickness into spiritual
   health! Men of

   God have been known to cry, "Take me back to the furnace, for there One
   like unto the Son of God was evidently with

   me!"

   When they have had solace in the creature, they have somewhat missed
   the sweetness of the Creator, and have sighed amid their earthly
   comforts for the loneliness which afforded them the nearer company of
   Jesus. I have never known more blissful seasons than those which my
   Lord vouchsafed me when I was abused by men and had to fight a weary
   battle. After all, there is no place in all our pilgrim ways which,
   taken for all in all, has all the charms of the Valley of Humiliation!
   The tops of the Delectable Mountains are royal spots--from them we
   sometimes see the Golden City! But these are heights too steep for our
   trembling feet to continually stand upon--the lowly valley suits us
   better, though flesh and blood find it hard to go downhill. Here the
   herb, called heart's-ease, grows luxuriantly and he that wears it is
   happier than the courtier in silk and velvet! Delightful is that
   well-shaded valley where the shepherd's boy sits and sings among his
   father's sheep--

   "He that is down need fear no fall; He that is low, no pride; He that
   is humble ever shall Have God to be His guide."

   Bunyan truly says, "The Valley of Humiliation is, of itself, as
   fruitful a place as any the crow flies over." It is chiefly so because
   in its wildernesses the Lord speaks to our hearts. To His child, when
   passing through the glens of tribulation, the Lord says, "Certainly I
   will be with you." In the furnace of affliction, the Lord manifests
   Himself to His chosen as He does not to the world--yes, as He does not
   even to those of His people who are basking in prosperity! Therefore,
   "we count them happy which endure." Brothers and Sisters, do you not
   see how this changes the face of affliction? This brightens everything,
   for if it is, in the judgment of those who have experienced it, a happy
   thing to endure! Then it is true that "the Lord is full of pity, and of
   tender mercy."

   Further, the Apostle gives us a hint of another matter. He adds, "you
   have heard of the patience of Job." Now, notice here, the notability--I
   had almost said the nobility--of endurance. As one truly says, Job's
   bones had lain, this day, in the common morgue of oblivion if it had
   not been for his suffering and his patience. "You have heard of the
   patience of Job." Who has not? But you would have never heard of Job if
   he had always been prosperous! His flocks and his herds, his gold and
   his silver, his children and their banquets would, none of them, have
   earned immortality for his name. But his poverty and his sickness have
   done it! He had been simply an Oriental sheik, honored in his own day,
   but forgotten like his fellows, had not the malice of Satan and the
   Grace of God forced him into notice. He was knighted on the
   battlefield. The stream of time has rolled over every other prince of
   his age and we have never heard of them but, "you have heard of the
   patience of Job"! Who gets a patent of nobility from the Throne of God
   unless it is by endurance? The names of the heroes of the Cross are
   written in black ink with a heavy pen!

   Even in worldly histories it is by enduring hardness that men build
   their memorials. Who that has read the classics has not heard of Mutius
   Scaevola? And why? He was a valiant man, but he did not win his name by
   a common deed in battle. His fights are unrecorded, but you have heard
   of his laying his right hand upon the burning coals of an altar--to let
   Porsenna see how a Roman could endure pain without shrinking. When he
   suffered his right hand to burn, he was writing his name in his
   country's annals. A thousand instances prove that only by endurance can
   names be engraved in the brass of history! To make a man a man--to
   bring his manhood forward and to make other men see it--there must be
   endurance! Read the lives of any who have become the leaders of our
   race--read the stories of any that are written in the beadroll of
   fame--and you shall find that not without trial did they come to be
   renowned.

   Poor tailors, husbandmen and apprentices live in the story of the
   Church of God because they counted not their lives dear to them for
   Christ's sake. Simple maids and wives, unlettered and poor, are heard
   of, to this day, and shall be heard of in eternity because they were
   burned as martyrs for the Truth of God! Who would have heard of Ann
   Askew if it were not that she was put upon the rack and, when every
   bone was out of joint and all her body was in exquisite torture, she
   baffled her tormentors! Well did she say--

   "I am not she that list My anchor to let fall For every drizzling mist.
   My ship's substantial."

   She that could suffer and sing gained high rank among "the ladies of
   the Covenant." He who is content to go down to a dishonorable grave may
   choose the bastard's portion and escape the rod--but the true-born
   child of God has no such desire! You may, if you please, enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season, but if God intends to honor you, you
   will choose to suffer affliction with the people of God! If you would
   reign in Christ's Kingdom, you must drink of His cup and be baptized
   with His baptism. Do not, therefore, look down upon those who suffer,
   but rather look up to them as among the higher classes of our race. The
   trials of Job elevated him into the peerage of the saints and,
   therefore, we gather from this honorable result of endurance, "that the
   Lord is full of pity, and of tender mercy," when He sends afflictions
   to His beloved ones.

   Once again, in order to see the pity of God in sorrow, we must see the
   Lord's end in it, for, says the Apostle, "You have seen the end of the
   Lord." God's end in affliction is that which proves that He is full of
   pity and of tender mercy. Does it not strike you as rather a singular
   thing that when James wants to show us that the Lord is full of pity
   and of tender mercy, he points us to Job on a dunghill with all his
   property gone, with his children dead, with his wife ill-advising him,
   with his friends provoking him and he covered with sores from head to
   foot? Who can see the pity and tender mercy of God there? Nobody who is
   blind, but he who has had his eyes opened by the Spirit of God can see
   it because he does not look so much at the process as at the result--he
   stays not with the crucible and the furnace, but joyously gazes upon
   the pure gold which comes from the refining pot! We see not so much how
   Grace works as what it works. The design of the Lord is more to be
   noted than the method He pursues!

   First, remember that the Lord's end in sending affliction to His people
   is corrective. Sanctified sorrow is a sharp frost which kills the germs
   of spiritual disease. Our griefs, like a hailstorm, break off the buds
   from the branches of sin so that they do not produce the black,
   accursed fruit of actual transgression! How much we owe to the knife
   which cuts out the canker and the gangrene! Christ's vines would soon
   be in an evil case if it were not for the Pruner. Let us bless God that
   though, before we were afflicted, we went astray, yet now, by the
   sanctifying processes of His Providence and Grace, we have learned to
   keep His Word! Look at the corrective influence of sorrow and you will
   not quarrel with the rod in a father's hands.

   Moreover, affliction is sent for the display of Grace. Our graces lie
   asleep within us like slumbering soldiers until affliction strikes its
   terrible drum and awakens them. You shall not know that there is a bird
   in the woods if you are quiet. But if you break a branch, they will
   become visible, and thus affliction, passing through our soul, startles
   all our graces and we perceive them--and God is honored thereby. You
   cannot see the stars while the sun shines! Wait till it is dark and
   then you shall behold them! Many a Christian Grace is quite
   imperceptible until the time of trial--and then it shines out with
   great luster. All this supposes that Grace is there, but if it is
   lacking, trial discovers the lack. You know not what spirit you are of
   till you have been under tribulation. You count yourself rich, but in
   the fire your gold is tested. You reckon that your house is well built,
   but the flames find out the wood, hay and stubble. Self-knowledge is
   never sure if it come not of tests and temptations. Therefore, we count
   them happy who endure because they are less likely to be deceived. God
   is to be praised for the discovery of our graces, for thus affliction
   becomes a blessing without disguise.

   Further, our trials are an education for the future. I do not think Job
   was fit to have any more substance until his heart had been enlarged by
   trouble. Then he could bear twice as much as before. A man of God is
   not prepared to enjoy success till he has tasted defeat. Many an heir
   of Heaven will never be fit for Heaven till, first of all, he has been
   brought near to the gates of Hell. You have been strengthened and
   prepared and made ready for a nobler future by your late experience of
   grief. A traveler said to me, yesterday, speaking of the heat, how
   different it is from cold, for the more you suffer heat, the less you
   can endure it. But the more you are tried with cold, the more you can
   bear it, for it hardens you. I am sure it is so as to the influences of
   prosperity and adversity. Prosperity softens and renders us unfit for
   more of itself. But adversity braces the soul and hardens it to
   patience.

   Beloved, I would not have you forget that "the end of the Lord" is
   always with His tried people to give them greater happiness as the
   result of it. Job's double portion was an instructive type of what God
   does with His children in some form, or other, after trial. "You have
   seen the end of the Lord." Job came to the end of his words with great
   bitterness and sorrow of heart--but God's end was not yet--and when it
   came, it was glorious and full of joy for His servant! Make note in Job
   31:40, it is written, "The words of Job are ended"--ended amid thistles
   and cockle--but the end of

   the Lord was very different, for He loaded His servant with pieces of
   money, earrings of gold and blessed his latter end more than his
   beginning! Your end, O you that are tossed with tempest and not
   comforted, shall come forth from your God when He shall lay your stones
   with fair colors and your foundations with sapphire! He will restore
   your soul even in this life and give you joy and rest out of your
   sorrow!

   As for the life to come, how little do we take it into our estimate! It
   is as the main ocean and this life is no better than the village brook!
   The sorrows of time are a mere pin's prick, at the most, if we contrast
   them with the joy eternal! What shall we think of these temporary
   inconveniences when we reach eternal happiness? We shall look back upon
   our passing grief with wonder that we ever made so much of it! When the
   sunshine bursts upon us, we shall smile to think of the flying clouds.
   We shall laugh to think that we were so depressed by our light
   affliction which is but for a moment! The far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of Glory will cause us to despise the trivial trials of
   our mortal life. All this makes me say and makes you see that the end
   of the Lord is LOVE--and that, in the trouble which He sends He is
   still--"full of pity, and of tender mercy."

   II. Secondly, OUR APOSTLE MAKES A CONSOLING STATEMENT--"the Lord is
   full of pity, and of tender mercy." Observe that this is the teaching
   of God's Holy Word and, therefore, if we have, at this moment, no
   evidence of it perceptible to sight or sense, we are bound to believe
   it all the same. I ask the child of God to settle this in his mind.
   "Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart."
   Though as for me, "my feet were almost gone; my steps had well near
   slipped," yet surely God is good to His own people. Whatever appears to
   conflict with this, nothing can possibly shake the certainty of this
   fact that, "the Lord is full of pity, and of tender mercy." O weeping
   heir of Heaven, though your Father scourges you, believe this, for He
   scourges every son whom He receives! And this also is true, that He
   receives every son whom He scourges! Rest your heart upon this. Do not
   be persuaded by man or devil to think ill of your God. He has a
   father's heart even when He makes you feel the strokes of His hand.
   Your God cannot be unkind to you. He cannot forsake you. Has He not
   said, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet will I not
   forget you"?--

   "Such pity as a father has

   Unto his children dear

   Like pity shows the Lord to such

   As worship Him in fear."

   Do you believe this?

   But, further, the text tells us that this truth may be seen. And though
   it is a matter of faith, yet it may be also a matter of sight. "You
   have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of pity." This is
   so plain that you can see it! See, then, the pity of God in upholding
   His people under trouble. He presses down with one hand, but He lifts
   up with the other. "Though He cause grief, yet will He have
   compassion." His dealings with us are of the nature of the raindrop and
   the sunbeam--these are united in fashioning the Covenant rainbow.
   Beloved, it is true, the Lord has burdened you. Is it not also true
   that He has sustained you? Above is the billow, but, "underneath are
   the everlasting arms." See the pity of God in this!

   How often the mercy of God is seen in sickness and suffering by His
   mitigating the pain and loss! One ounce more and the back had broken,
   but that ounce never came. One breath more and the ship, that even then
   staggered before the gale, would have been driven to the bottom of the
   sea, but that breath of wind did not come. There is always a
   restraining of affliction, even in the hour of severest trial. Those
   who are washed in the blood of Jesus shall never be drowned in the sea
   of sorrow.

   Observe, also, the tender pity of God in forgiving the sin of His
   suffering people. I bless the Lord that He has not taken notice of what
   I have thought and said when I have been greatly depressed and
   distracted by pain. Our Lord knows that the spirit is willing, even
   when the flesh is weak, and He thinks still kindly of us. If He did
   mark my foolish despondencies, what could I say but, "Lord, have mercy
   upon Your foolish child"? When your child has a fever, it may be he is
   fretful and begins to talk foolishly. Maybe he says unkind things
   against those very persons whom, in his heart, he loves best. Do you
   ever say to the child, afterwards, "John, I am very grieved that you
   said such shocking things about me and about your mother"? Far from it!
   You say, "Poor dear, he does not know what he is saying--he is
   wandering in his mind." So does God deal with our naughtiness when we
   are under His hand--when He sees that it is rather weakness than
   willfulness. He is full of pity and full of compassion and blots out
   the transgressions of His people

   See how the tenderness and pity of God are also seen in the revelations
   He makes to His saints--but of that I have spoken, though I would not
   have you forget it.

   So, also, in the overruling of our sorrows, His love is conspicuous. He
   often sends a great sorrow that we may not be compelled to bear a
   greater one. By fire He prevents conflagration. By pain He kills a
   greater pain. If you had not endured a certain trouble you might have
   been visited by seven troubles, each one more terrible than your
   present one. Thank God for the preventive operations of His Providence!
   Bless Him, above all, for the sweet rewards that come to His tried
   people when, afterwards, they bear the comfortable fruits of
   righteousness and especially when He comes to them in the riches of His
   Grace and turns their midnight into everlasting day.

   In closing the second head I should like to say I wish we could all
   read the original Greek, for this word, "The Lord is full of pity," is
   a specially remarkable one. It means literally that the Lord has "many
   bowels," or a great heart, and so it indicates great tenderness. The
   god in whom some believe is unable to feel--they lay it down in their
   theology as an axiom that God cannot feel. This, however, I take leave
   to deny. God is able to do all things. I cannot regard Him as though He
   were a block of wood, or a mass of iron unable to feel. On the
   contrary, He is represented to us as greatly feeling--the God of a
   great heart! You know how a sensitive person is affected at the sight
   of suffering. Some persons cannot bear to see a creature in pain--they
   are unmanned, thereby, and begin to weep like children. Our God is not
   only full of pity, but very full of pity--not only of mercy, but of
   tender mercy. Our Lord Jesus Christ, when He was here on earth, was the
   image of the Father and we often read of Him that, "He was moved with
   compassion." After this sort are we to think of the great God who is
   full of pity towards suffering men.

   The other word is the complement of the first--"and of tender mercy."
   There is, then, you see, in these two words, pity for misery and mercy
   for sin. There is inward pity in the heart of God and outward action in
   the mercy of God. There is sympathy for suffering and Grace for guilt.
   These two things make up what we need. That God should pity our griefs
   and forget out sins--that God should think kindly of us and act
   helpfully towards us--these are our greatest needs. What a sea of
   goodness is in my text--"full of pity, and of tender mercy!" Believe
   you, then, of God, and see it to be true that for the woes of man He
   has a tender heart!

   Forget not that word, "In all their afflictions He was afflicted, and
   the angel of His Presence saved them." Our God is not cold and hard,
   but full of pity! He is infinitely just and will assuredly punish
   sin--but side by side with His justice stands His love! He is as full
   of pity as if He had forgotten to be righteous. Indeed, He is much more
   so, for were He less righteous, He would be less kind. If you would see
   His goodness and His justice blended, behold the Son of God upon the
   tree, dying in our place. Never doubt His tenderness who gave His
   Only-Begotten Son, "that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life."

   III. Now I have to close with THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED out of the
   whole subject. I will but hint at them.

   The first is be patient. The whole context teaches us patience. Read
   the chapter at home and see how James continues to say, "Be patient."
   Be patient for this reason, that God "is full of pity, and of tender
   mercy." A person going to a surgeon will bear sharp pain when he is
   convinced that by such pain his cure will be worked. If a man proposes
   to gash me with a lance, I decline his offer. But if I know that I
   shall die unless the incision is made and, if I believe that an
   intolerable pain will thus be the result, I say, "Welcome the knife."
   Let him cut without mercy, if, by it he intends mercy. It might be
   unmerciful to stay the hand in such a case.

   Such knowledge should make us patient under Divine chastisement. The
   Lord never grieves us because He likes to grieve us. "He does not
   afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men." There is a
   necessity for every sorrow. Though now, for a season, we are in
   heaviness, there is a necessity for it. Do not kick against the goad,
   lest it prick you all the more. Be silent before God, lest He rebukes
   you for your foolish speech. When the sheep is being shorn, if it
   kicks, it will be cut with the shears. But if it will lie quite still,
   the shearer will take off all the wool and never harm the flesh. Lie
   still, Brothers and Sisters--let the Good Shepherd clip as He pleases!
   Though He may cut very close to the skin, He is full of pity and will
   only rid you of that which would harm you.

   The next lesson is, be penitent. You unconverted ones here, today, if
   you are suffering and sorrowful, I want you to feel that God is sending
   this sorrow in love to your souls. He smites you that you may turn to
   Him in repentance. He chastens you that He may bring you to Himself,
   that you may not perish forever. He "is full of pity." His hand is
   strong to smite, but it is also strong to save. Return to your Father,
   O you prodigal! Though you have spent your substance,

   though you have brought yourself to rags, return to your Father--there
   is bread enough in His house and, better still, there is love enough in
   His heart to welcome even you! See, He hastens to meet you as soon as
   your face is toward Him, for He is ready to forgive! Oh, you that have
   been hardened by your distresses, repent of this wickedness, lest, like
   Pharaoh, you are plagued even to destruction! Seek the Lord while He
   may be found! Call upon Him while He is near. He welcomes all who
   repent. He is eager to forgive! Delay no longer. O Spirit of the Lord,
   hasten the returning sinner!

   The last lesson is, be full of pity. If God is full of pity and of
   tender mercy, children of God, you are to imitate Him and to be full of
   pity, too. This Truth of God is to be remembered at all times. And,
   just now, you have an opportunity of showing your pity towards the poor
   and sick of this great city. When you relieve the needs of a man in
   health, you may possibly assist him in his vices, but in helping the
   sick poor you can do no wrong. The door of a hospital is open for good
   and only for good. I am concerned to know that there are many beds
   unoccupied and many suffering persons kept out of the hospitals from
   lack of funds. Whole wards are rendered useless for lack of income. In
   some cases the authorities are compelled to use those wards for persons
   who can pay for attendance and though this is a good thing, yet I
   cannot forget that those who cannot pay are thus deprived of what they
   need so much more than others.

   You that have been sick, yourselves, should give liberally, today, out
   of sympathy. You that have never been sick ought to give twice as much
   out of gratitude. Yet I must correct myself--those who have been
   afflicted and healed should feel both sympathy and gratitude--and so
   should give the double of those from whom I have asked double
   liberality. Let us try to give to this fourfold degree! When the box is
   passed round, be full of pity and of tender mercy, like your Father and
   your God--and then the hospitals will be largely helped this day.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Psalm 103.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Purging of the Conscience

   (No. 1846)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 21, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: how
   much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
   works to serve the living God?" Hebrews 9:13,14.

   SOME of you may remember that six years ago I preached from this text,
   principally dwelling upon the type of the red heifer. "The Red Heifer,"
   No. 1481, Vol. 25. We then tried to show how, in these ashes of the
   heifer, laid by in store and applied to the unclean with water, God
   gave to His people in the wilderness a purification of the flesh
   whenever they had defiled themselves by touching any dead thing. This
   was the great instrument by which they were delivered from a ceremonial
   quarantine under which they were kept apart till they had been
   purified. I am not going to enlarge upon that type today. I felt, when
   preaching upon it, that I had not reserved due space for the latter and
   more important part of the text--it is my purpose to make amends this
   morning. May we be helped by the Spirit of God to yield our earnest
   attention to the deeply important subject now before us. The red cow
   may roam out of notice and the Christ of God shall, alone, be seen!

   "To serve the living God" is necessary to the happiness of a living
   man--for this end were we made--and we miss the design of our making if
   we do not honor our Maker. "Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy
   Him forever." If we miss that end, we are terrible losers. The service
   of God is the element in which, alone, we can fully live. If you had a
   fish here upon dry land, supposing it possible that it could exist, yet
   it would lead a very unhappy life--it would scarcely be a fish at all!
   You could not tell of what it was capable. It would be deprived of the
   opportunity of developing its true self. It is not until you put it
   into the stream that the fish becomes really a fish and enjoys its
   existence.

   It is just so with man--he does exist without God, but we may not
   venture to call that existence, "life," for--"He shall not see life;
   but the wrath of God abides on him." If he lives in pleasure, yet he is
   dead while he lives. He is so constituted that to develop his manhood,
   perfectly, as God would have it to be, he must addict himself to
   fellowship with God and to the service of God! Many ways have been
   tried by men to make themselves perfectly content, but they cannot find
   satisfaction out of God. When a man gets to serve God and, in
   proportion as he thoroughly does so, he is peaceful, restful and happy.
   Man is a fallen star till he is right with Heaven! He is out of order
   with himself and all around him till he occupies his true place in
   relation to God. When he serves God, he has reached that point where he
   serves himself best and enjoys himself most. It is man's honor, it is
   man's joy, it is man's Heaven to live unto God!

   God's idea of what a nation should be was set forth in the camp in the
   wilderness. If God's command had been fully carried out, the desert
   would have exhibited a scene of highest blessedness. We would have seen
   a holy people surrounding the central abode of the Holy God--a people,
   everyone of whom was a servant of God and a priest for His worship-- a
   people whose ordinary everyday life was sanctified by the Presence of
   God. We would have seen a people whose shadow by day was God in the
   cloud and whose light by night was God in the pillar of fire--a people
   to whom God was Leader, for whom God was the vanguard and for whom God
   brought up the rear. There would have been a people who lived upon the
   Bread of Heaven--a people who drank of water which leaped by Divine
   power from the Rock--a people having God to be their glory and their
   defense. Happy had they been if they could have carried out the Divine
   ideal! It would have been well with them in the highest degree.

   Alas, they were always seeking to be as the evil nations around them!
   They could not rest till they had descended to the level of the common
   mass of mankind! If only they could have risen to God's intent, so that
   the Divine purpose of love had been fully carried out in them, they
   would have been the happiest of all the sons of men! We, ourselves, as
   a Church, if we can fulfill the type--if we live with God in the midst
   of us, if He is our dwelling place throughout all generations, if we
   fetch our supplies from Him, if we move only at His bidding, if we
   intensely love Him--we shall be a people to be envied by all who know
   us!

   But, alas, a great difficulty comes in the way--and of that I am going
   to speak this morning--in order to the removal of it. Our text very
   plainly points out the sad hindrance in the way of our service--we need
   that our conscience be purged from dead works or else we cannot serve
   the living God. Secondly, our text leads us to consider the true
   purgation from this evil--if the blood of bulls and of goats purged the
   flesh of men so that they could draw near to the visible Tabernacle of
   God, much more shall the blood of Christ purge our conscience from all
   that spiritual defilement which prevents our heart-worship of God! When
   these two things are spoken of, I shall ask you, in the last place, if
   time does not fail us, to consider the kind of service which we ought
   to render if we have been cleansed by such a costly purification and
   purged from all conscience of dead works. Oh, living Spirit, help us,
   now, to think living thoughts and so to carry on the worship of the
   living God while we are hearing Your Word!

   I. First, then, let us briefly consider THE SAD HINDRANCE WHICH LIES IN
   THE WAY OF THE SERVICE OF GOD. In the camp in the wilderness, the Law
   was that if a man touched a dead body, he was made unclean by that
   touch. No, if he only stepped upon a dead bone in his daily walks, he
   was polluted by his accidental contact with death. If any person died
   in his tent, all the family and the tent, itself, became at once
   defiled--and they must undergo purgation before the inhabitants could
   mingle with the rest of the congregation, much less could go up to the
   holy place of assembly. My Brothers and Sisters, we are all under the
   ban by coming into contact with spiritual death. The Apostle does not
   say, purge your conscience from evil works, because he wanted to turn
   our minds to the type of defilement by death and, therefore, he said,
   "dead works." I think he had a further motive, for he was not
   altogether indicating willful transgressions of the Law, but those acts
   which are faulty because they are not performed as the result of
   spiritual life. I see a difference between sinful works and dead works
   which we may, perhaps, be able to bring into light as we go on. Suffice
   it to say, for the moment, that sin is the corruption which follows
   necessarily upon spiritual death. First, the work is dead, and soon it
   rots into actual sin.

   Upon our consciences there rests, first of all, a sense of past sin.
   Even if a man wishes to serve God, until his conscience is purged, he
   feels a dread and terror of God which prevent his doing so. He has
   sinned and God is just and, therefore, he is ill at ease. The Law is
   not to be trifled with--it is sent into the world armed with terrible
   sanctions--and the conscience, when awakened, makes us know that we
   cannot sin with impunity. "God is angry with the wicked every day, if
   he turns not, He will whet His sword; He has bent His bow and made it
   ready." The sinner, knowing this, asks, "How can I serve this terrible
   God?" He is alarmed when he thinks of the Judge of all the earth, for
   it is before that Judge that he will soon have to take his trial. He is
   as a man in chains, reserved unto the hour of terrible execution--how
   can we serve this dreadful God?

   We tremble in the Presence of an angry God, for that anger threatens us
   with destruction! Sin, like a dark cloud, darkens our spirit and shuts
   us out from joy. It is impossible for any man to rightly serve God with
   a living, loving worship while he is conscious of guilt. Therefore,
   Brothers and Sisters, we need the atoning Sacrifice of Christ to purge
   the conscience, for the Lord will not be served by convicted criminals,
   neither can condemned rebels wish to serve Him. He cannot look upon the
   rebellious with any pleasure till their iniquity is put away and their
   sin is covered. You see, then, that the first hindrance to holy service
   is our sense of guilt and from this we must be wholly delivered--we
   must receive a new consciousness--a consciousness of perfect pardon and
   complete reconciliation, or else we cannot serve the living

   God.

   On the back of this comes the consciousness that we, ourselves, are
   sinful and inclined to evil. We say, and say rightly, "Who shall bring
   a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one." How can we, whose will is
   obstinate, whose judgment is darkened, whose affections are depraved,
   whose desires are selfish, whose thoughts are evil--how can we stand in
   the Presence of Him before whom angels veil their faces as they cry,
   "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty"? Men who know that they are
   forgiven, are yet, nevertheless, seized with trembling in the Presence
   of the Divine purity. They cry,

   "Woe is me! For I am a man of unclean lips!" How shall we bear the
   vessels of the Lord if we are not clean? And we are not clean by
   nature. "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand
   in His Holy Place?"

   We feel that we have not that perfect purity of heart and cleanness of
   hands which would fit us for the Holy Place. Nor can we ever be saved
   from this fear so as to take up our heavenly priesthood and serve God
   till the precious blood of Christ shall be applied to the
   conscience--nor until we feel that in Christ we are accounted
   righteous. Happy are we if we are Believers in Jesus, for He has washed
   us and we are clean every whit! Even our feet, though travel-stained,
   are now made clean because He has taken the ewer and the basin and has
   washed our feet and has said to us, "you are clean." We may now enter
   into the Most Holy Place without the slightest fear, since the Great
   High Priest of our profession has, Himself, purified us! We are
   accepted in the Beloved--"Christ is made of God unto us righteousness."

   But, besides this consciousness of sin and sinfulness, we are conscious
   of a measure of deficient life. About us there is a body of death. Dead
   works are the things we most require to be purged from. Dead works need
   not be, in themselves, works of willful sin. As the renowned Dr. John
   Owen has said, there were many things that the Jews would have to do
   about the dead which could not be censured, but, on the contrary, were
   to be praised--and yet, even these acts brought ceremonial defilement.
   A person is dead. Someone must lay out the corpse. Someone must array
   it for the funeral. Someone must lift it into the coffin. Someone must
   dig the grave and cover up the poor clay with its fellow clay. These
   last offices must be attended to, yet they defiled all who performed
   them! Although they were works of humanity and of necessity, yet,
   according to the Law, all who performed them were, thereby, rendered
   unclean.

   Without going into what the world calls actual sin, you and I may come
   into contact with spiritual death, no, we carry death about us, from
   which we daily cry to be delivered! For instance, in prayer. Our
   prayer, in its form and fashion, may be right enough, but if it lacks
   earnestness and importunity, it will be a dead work. A sermon may be
   orthodox and correct, but if it is devoid of that holy passion, that
   Divine inspiration without which sermons are but mere pomp-- it is a
   dead work! An alms given to the poor is good as a work of humanity, but
   it will be only a dead work if a desire to be seen of men is found at
   the bottom of it. Like the almsgiving of the Pharisee, it will be a
   mockery of God! Without a spiritual motive, the best work is dead! I
   confess that I never appear before you without a fear that my preaching
   may be a dead work among you. It must be so, as it comes from
   myself--its life must depend upon the spiritual power with which the
   Lord clothes it.

   Do you not think that very much of common Christian conversation is
   dead, or very near to it? You stand and sing, but your hearts do not
   sing! You bow your heads in prayer, but you are not praying! You read
   the Scripture, but it is not inspired to you, so as to breathe its own
   life into you! Even our meditations and thoughts about God's work may
   be mere intellectual exercises and so may be devoid of that power
   which, alone, can make them living works, fit for the service of the
   living God. Beloved Friends, we need the precious blood of Christ to
   purge our consciences from this death and its working--and to lift us
   into holy and heavenly life! God is not the God of the dead, but of the
   living! God accepts not the dead sacrifice, but the living sacrifice.
   Even of old there were no fish presented on His altar because they
   could not come there, alive--the victim must be brought alive to the
   horns of the altar, or God could not receive it. We must not bring our
   dead faith or our dead words as an offering to God! Our prayers without
   emotion; our praises without gratitude; our testimonies without
   sincerity; our gifts without love--all these will be dead and,
   consequently, unacceptable. We must present a living sacrifice to the
   living God, or we cannot hope to be accepted--and for this reason we
   greatly need the blood of Christ to purge our conscience from dead
   works.

   Do you not, sometimes, fear concerning your services that they have
   been altogether dead? When we are lukewarm, we hold the golden cup to
   our God, but He receives it not when our service is dead and chill.
   Indeed, He says of us when we are lukewarm, "I will spue you out of My
   mouth." The Lord cannot endure a worship which is half dead! All
   worship must be presented at blood heat--the warmth of life must be
   there. Do you not fear that even when, as a whole, it is alive, large
   parts of our service may be dead? Even in the living body of our
   prayers, may there not be a dead bone? Even in the living body of our
   praise, may there not be mortification in parts? God help us! What poor
   creatures we are! Is there one good thing about us? Are we not
   imperfect in our best works? Are not the sins of our holy things
   glaring before our consciences this day? Unless we are purged of this,
   by the blood of Christ, who offered up Himself without spot to God, how
   can we serve this living God and be as priests and kings unto Him?

   Once more--I told you that the Israelites were defiled by even touching
   a dead bone--and this teaches us the easiness of being polluted. We
   have to come into contact with evil in our daily dealings with ungodly
   men. Can we think of them, can we speak to them, can we trade with them
   without incurring defilement? Even if we grow indignant with evil
   practices, may there not be sin in our indignation? And when we reprove
   the custom of the trade, may we not become Pharisees in that very act?
   We are seldom exactly right. In avoiding one sin we drop into
   another--we flee from the lion and a bear meets us! To keep the middle
   path of perfect holiness is difficult!

   No, I go farther--do we, as Christian men and women washed by Christ,
   ever associate with one another without a measure of defilement? Can we
   meet together at our homes and feel, when we separate, that everything
   we have said was seasoned with salt and ministered to edification? Is
   there not some taint about our purest friends and does not the touch of
   that corruption which still remains, even in the regenerate, tend to
   defile us? Can we walk through such a morgue as this world without
   being defiled, even unconsciously? Remember, under the Jewish Law, the
   man who was defiled and knew it not was still under penalty! And when
   he did discover it, he was made to bring his sacrifice. He needed the
   blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer even for his sin
   of ignorance. If we have heard an evil thing, or read an evil thing, it
   has probably left some stain upon us though we perceive it not. All the
   more surely it may be so because we do not see it, for that may but
   prove that the judgment has been depraved and the heart infected. The
   water of purification and the blood of Atonement are needed day by day.
   Without these, we cannot hope to minister before the Lord our God with
   acceptance.

   II. Now, I want to show, in the second place, WHAT IS THE TRUE
   PURGATION FROM THIS EVIL. Under the

   Law there were several methods of purification, but the Apostle was not
   of a mind, on this occasion, to speak particularly of any one of them
   and, therefore, he summed them all up in these words--"The blood of
   bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean,
   sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh." These things did purify the
   flesh, so that the man who had formerly contracted impurity might mix
   with his fellow men in the congregation of the Lord. Now, if these
   matters were so effectual for the purifying of the flesh, well does the
   Apostle ask, "How much more shall the blood of Christ purge our
   conscience from dead works?" Why does he say, "How much more?"

   First, because it is more truly purifying. There was not really and
   truly anything of purification about the blood of bulls and of goats.
   Speaking very literally, the blood of bulls and of goats might defile a
   person! Falling upon any man, it splattered his garments. Who cared to
   have a smear of blood upon his brow, or on his hands? It was not, in
   itself, a thing that could actually purify. All the prescribed
   purifications were types and shadows of the true Propitiation for sin.
   Now, when the Lord Jesus Christ took upon Himself our human nature and
   lived a life of perfection--and then made an offering of Himself in
   death, as the Just for the unjust--then there was a real Sacrifice made
   unto the Most High God. When the Lord Jesus gave His body, soul and
   spirit. When, in His entire Nature, He made Himself a Sacrifice for
   sin, "being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is everyone
   that hangs on a tree"--then in that deed there was a real Atonement
   made--a true and effectual Expiation was offered. Therefore James says,
   "How much more?" If the shadow cleansed the flesh, how much more shall
   the Substance cleanse the spirit?

   Moreover, our Lord Christ offered a much greater Sacrifice. Why does
   the text, here, show the term, "Christ"? The Apostle Paul uses the name
   of our Lord with considerable variety. It is sometimes, "Christ,"
   sometimes, "Jesus," sometimes, "our Lord Jesus," sometimes, "our Lord
   Jesus Christ," sometimes, "Christ Jesus." But there is a reason for the
   use of each name wherever it occurs. It would be an instructive study
   for you to try to find out why, in such a place, our Lord is called,
   "Christ," and not, "Jesus," or, "Jesus," and not, "Christ." In this
   passage the name used is, "Christ." One reason why the precious blood
   has such power to put away sin is because it is the blood of Christ,
   that is, of God's Anointed--God's Messiah--the Sent One of the Most
   High. Our Lord came not as an amateur, but He came with a commission.
   He came with an appointment and unction from the Holy One! If,
   therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is offered as a Sacrifice for us, He
   is appointed to that end by God Himself and, therefore, He must be
   accepted of God. There is no will worship about Christ. He says, "Lo, I
   come to do Your will." He did not come to do His own will, but the will
   of Him who sent Him and, therefore, there is a peculiar purifying power
   about all that He did because He did it as Christ, the Anointed of God.

   Notice, it is not put concerning Christ that His life is purifying,
   though it had a wonderful relation thereto--nor is it said that His
   prayers are purifying, albeit everything is ascribable unto the
   intercession of our risen Lord--nor is it

   said that His Resurrection is purifying. The whole stress is laid upon
   "the blood of Christ," signifying thereby death-- death with pain,
   death as a victim, death with reference to sin. "The blood is the life
   thereof" and, "without shedding of blood there is no remission." It is
   by the blood of Christ that you and I have our consciences purged from
   dead works! Rejoice in Christ in Glory, but put your trust in Christ
   Crucified! Look with longing hope to His Second Coming, but for your
   purification, rest upon His first coming! See in His agony and His
   death your joy and life! It is the blood of Christ that, alone, can
   make you fit to serve the living and true God!

   Note what it was that Christ offered and be sure that you lay great
   stress upon it. "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
   the Eternal Spirit offered Himself!" What a splendid word that is! Did
   He offer His blood? Yes,

   but He offered "Himself." Did He offer His life? Yes, but He specially
   offered "Himself." Now, what is "Christ"? The

   "Anointed of God." In His wondrous complex Nature, He is God and Man.
   He is Prophet, Priest and King. He is--but time would fail me to tell
   you what He is--whatever He is, He offered Himself. The entire Christ
   was offered by Christ! "He offered Himself" You cannot put it so
   strongly by the use of any other word. "He, His own Self, bore our sins
   in His own body on the tree." "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself
   for it." Not His life on earth; not His life in Heaven; nor His
   abilities and His thoughts and His works--but He gave Himself. This is
   the alabaster box which was broken, the precious ointment of which
   perfumes both Heaven and earth and makes the saints sweet unto the Lord
   their God--who smells upon them a sweet savor of rest in the offering
   up of Christ. He offered "Himself"! Dwell much upon that word.

   It is said in our text that this offering of Himself was "without
   spot." The sacrificial act by which He presented Himself was a
   faultless one, without spot. There was nothing in what Christ was,
   Himself, and nothing in the way in which He offered Himself that could
   be objectionable to of God--it was "without spot." Now you see,
   Brothers and Sisters, why it is that it has such purifying power for
   us. God sent the Christ--this Christ offered up Himself--and He offered
   Himself without spot. And so we, for whom this wondrous Christ was
   sent, for whom He made this matchless offering, for whom He made that
   offering without spot, we, I say, are accepted in the Beloved made
   perfect in His perfection!

   Further, it is added that He did this, "by the Eternal Spirit." This
   does not refer to the Holy Spirit, otherwise the Apostle would have
   said, "by the Holy Spirit." It says, "By the Eternal Spirit"--and the
   meaning is this--that His eternal Godhead gave to His offering of
   Himself an extreme value which otherwise could not have been attached
   to it. He, by the power of His Godhead, offered up Himself without
   spot!

   Observe, then, the Sacrifice was a spiritual one. You must never look
   at Christ's Sacrifice in a carnal way, as though the mere drops of
   literal blood, as a material substance, could have virtue in them for
   the purging of sin. Do not know Christ after the flesh. Be no longer
   children, but understand spiritual things. It is true that our Lord had
   a material body and poured forth material blood, but the essence of His
   Sacrifice lay in His will, intent, motive and spirit. I once heard a
   dissertation upon what became of those drops of blood which fell to the
   ground on Calvary. I felt that it was foolish talk! By the blood of
   Christ, we mean His suffering unto death, the obedience which made Him
   yield His life--and especially the will of His soul to suffer--and the
   object of His mind in suffering. When the bullock was brought up, its
   blood was poured out. But the bullock could not be a sacrifice in
   spirit--the bullock had no intention to die and no understanding of the
   reason of its death. The bullock was not willing to die and, therefore,
   it presented no sacrifice by the spirit. But Christ knew what He was
   and why He was there--and why He must die. And He gave His willing
   assent. He entered with His whole heart into the Substitution which
   involved obedience unto death. "For the joy that was set before Him, He
   endured the Cross." It was by His spirit that He offered up a true and
   real sacrifice, for He says, "I delight to do Your will, O My God; yes,
   Your Law is within My heart."

   But then you must not forget that this spirit was Divine--"by the
   Eternal Spirit." The spirit of Christ was an Eternal Spirit, for it was
   the Godhead. There was, conjoined with His Deity, the natural life of a
   perfect Man, but the Eternal Spirit was His highest Self. His Godhead
   willed that He should die and concurred in the death of the Manhood, so
   that, by the Eternal Spirit, He offered Himself. The blood which He
   shed was the blood of God, for thus we read--"Feed the Church of God,
   which He has purchased with His own blood." Of course, "blood," as a
   physical, material thing cannot be the blood of God. But viewing it as
   what it means--His suffering, His grief, His woe--these were consented
   to by the Divine Spirit of Christ and so, by the Eternal Spirit, He
   offered Himself to God.

   Because He is the Second Person of the adorable Trinity in Unity, the
   suffering and death of His humanity had in them a potency of purgation
   by which He cleanses our conscience from dead works to serve the living
   God. Brothers and

   Sisters, I never feel it hard to trust my sinful soul with the great
   Sacrifice of Christ. I feel, on the contrary, that if I had all your
   souls within my body and all your sins heaped upon me--and all the sins
   of all the redeemed blackening my con-science--I could now readily
   trust to that Divine Sacrifice for the taking away of all that guilt!
   What limit can you set to the merit of One who, by the Eternal Spirit,
   offered up Himself? What limits can there be to a Divine Sacrifice? You
   can no more set a limit to our Lord's Sacrifice than to the Godhead,
   itself!

   Once more, I must call to your notice the use of that word,
   "eternal"--"who by the Eternal Spirit"--for it gives to the offering of
   Christ an endless value. It can never cease to operate, for He offered
   up Himself by the "Eternal Spirit." There is as much purging power in
   the death of our Lord, today, as in that hour when, for the first time,
   He appeared in the Presence of God for us. The blood of the bullock was
   a temporary thing. The "ashes of an heifer" could not last forever. But
   the merits of Christ are the merits of One who always lives! His merits
   always abide, for they are the merits of an Eternal Person who, by His
   own Spirit, offered Himself up as a Sacrifice for sin.

   Now, all this tends to make us feel how clean they are who are purged
   by this Sacrifice which our Lord offered once and for all to God. Need
   I call your attention to the fact that He offered Himself, "to God"?
   Yes, I must, for of late some have blasphemously said that the
   Sacrifice was made to the devil! To mention such profanity is to
   condemn it!

   Once more upon this point--as I have shown you that the Sacrifice of
   Christ was more real and greater, so I want you to notice that it was
   better applied, for the ashes of an heifer mixed with water were
   sprinkled on the bodies of the unclean and the blood of bulls and of
   goats was sprinkled upon the flesh--but neither of them could reach the
   heart. It is not possible for a material thing to touch that which is
   immaterial! But the sufferings of Christ, as I have explained them,
   offered up through His Eternal Spirit, were not only of a corporeal but
   of a spiritual kind--and they reach, therefore, to the cleansing of our
   spirit!

   That precious blood comes home to us in this way. First, we understand
   somewhat of it. The Israelite, when he was purged by the ashes of the
   red cow, could only say to himself, "I am made clean by these ashes
   because God has appointed that I shall be, but I do not know why." But
   you and I can say that we are made clean through the blood of Christ
   because there is, in that blood, an inherent efficacy--there is in the
   vicarious suffering of Christ on our behalf, an inherent power to honor
   the Law of God and to put away sin. Because we can somewhat understand
   the cleansing given us in Christ, it has a greater power upon our
   conscience--and that better prepares us to serve God.

   Then again, we appreciate and approve of this way of cleansing. The
   Israelite could not tell why the ashes of a red heifer purified him. He
   did not object to it, but he could not express any great appreciation
   of the method. We, as we see our Lord suffering in our place, fall at
   His feet in reverent wonder. We love the method of salvation by
   Substitution! We approve of expiation by the Mediator. No Truth of God
   charms my own spirit like the Truth of Atonement by vicarious
   suffering, that suffering presented together with His death by our Lord
   Jesus Christ. I feel my conscience is quieted by every drop of that
   blood! The method of Federal Headship commends itself to me! I see
   righteousness and Grace commingled in it and thus I am helped to serve
   the living God.

   Further, Brothers and Sisters, it comes home to us this way--we read in
   the Word of God that, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life,"
   and we say to ourselves, "Then we have everlasting life, for we have
   believed in Him!" We read, "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
   us from all sin," and our conscience whispers, "We are cleansed from
   all sin!" Conscience finds rest and peace and our whole consciousness
   becomes that of a forgiven and accepted person with whom God is well
   pleased! Our conscience, instead of condemning us, perceives the
   justice of the way by which we are absolved and leads up our peace of
   heart into full assurance of faith. So you see, Brothers and Sisters,
   that what the blood of bulls and of goats could not do, the blood of
   Christ has done! It has passed beyond the flesh, which, indeed, it has
   never touched in our case--and it has sanctified the heart and calmed
   the spirit--thus preparing us to serve the Lord. The blood of Christ
   has purified us to the center! It has purged the core of the heart! It
   has cleansed our spirit, our mind, our memory, our thought, our
   intellect, our affections--and we are clean! And, therefore, we are
   meet to exercise a holy priesthood before the living God!

   III. This brings me to my last head, which is this--consider THE KIND
   OF SERVICE WHICH WE NOW RENDER. After so much preparing, how shall we
   behave ourselves in the House of God?

   I am not speaking to you who have never been purged from dead works by
   the application of the precious blood of Christ, for you cannot serve
   God--you are forbidden to come into His Presence or to stand among His
   saints. You are in

   quarantine, even as lepers put forth from the camp. Go home and set a
   red cross upon your door and write over it, "Lord have mercy upon us."
   That would best befit your unclean condition! As Joshua said to Israel,
   even so say I unto you, "You cannot serve the Lord: for He is an holy
   God; He is a jealous God." You must be born again before you can be
   acceptable unto Him, for as you are, an infection is upon all your
   works and you may not hope that He will accept anything at your hands.

   But to you who have had that blood applied to your conscience by the
   Spirit of God, to you I speak. You should present unto the Lord the
   constant worship of living men. You see it is written, "Purge your
   conscience from dead works to serve the living God." You are not, at
   this day, likely to die in order to prove your love to God. But if you
   are ever called to it, you must be prepared to lose your lives for
   Christ's sake! But what you have to do is to "present your bodies a
   living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God." Now, a living sacrifice
   is much more difficult of presentation than a slain one. I believe
   there are thousands of men who could go to the stake and die, or lay
   their necks on the block to perish with a stroke, for Christ, who,
   nevertheless, find it hard work to live a holy, consecrated life. The
   act of one moment, however painful, must be much easier than that
   service which is to run through a series of years until life, itself,
   shall close. But if the Lord Jesus gave Himself for you, will you not
   give yourselves for Him? If He died for you by His Eternal Spirit, will
   you not live for Him by that new Spirit with which He has quickened
   you? Are you not under bonds to serve Him? From this time, forth, you
   should not have a pulse that does not beat to His praise, nor a hair on
   your head that is unconse-crated to His name, nor a single moment of
   your time which is not used for His Glory! Yes, Brothers, Sisters, it
   must be a lifelong sacrifice that we now present unto Him that lives
   forever!

   Should not our service be rendered in the full strength of our new
   life? Let us have no more dead works, no more dead singing, no more
   dead praying, no more dead preaching, no more dead hearing! "Oh," said
   one, when he heard a sermon, "it was very good, if it had been alive."
   Dead-and-alive Christianity is poor stuff! No dish ever comes to table
   which is so nauseous as cold religion! Put it away! Neither God nor man
   can endure it! Let us have cakes hot from the oven, manna fresh from
   Heaven, Living Waters leaping from the Rock! Stale godliness is
   ungodliness. Let our religion be as warm, constant and natural as the
   flow of the blood in our veins. A living God must be served in a living
   way.

   Are we, therefore, to be excited,? Yes, if need be. What can excite a
   man like the grand sublimities of eternity? But if you are not excited
   with any carnal excitement--if principle rules rather than passion--it
   will be so much the better. Yet let it be living principle--principle
   alive with love. There is such a thing as an excitement which is
   spiritually dead. The fury of the flesh is not the life of God. Energy
   of mind is a distinct thing from being strong in the Lord. We need a
   steady, healthy pulsation of spiritual life to keep us to such service
   of the Lord as becomes saints and is worthy of our high calling. This
   comes only from having our conscience purged from dead works.

   And, dear Friends, keep in mind that you are, henceforth, to "serve the
   living God." You that are acquainted with the Greek will find that the
   kind of service here mentioned is not that which the slave or servant
   renders to his master, but a worshipful service such as priests render
   unto God. We that have been purged by Christ are to render to God the
   worship of a royal priesthood! It is ours to present prayers,
   thanksgivings and sacrifices. It is ours to offer the incense of
   intercession. It is ours to light the lamp of testimony and furnish the
   table of showbread. You that are the sons of God are all the sons of
   Levi this day--yes, you are the true seed of Aaron! The priesthood is
   with you, even with you who worship God in the spirit and have no
   confidence in the flesh. You that believe in Christ and are made pure
   by His blood, it is for you to live as if you wore the snow-white robes
   of the priests of the house of Aaron--your garments should be vestments
   and your conversation a perpetual priesthood unto God!

   I close by noticing how this precious blood of Christ will work all
   this in us. It will operate upon us thus--when our conscience is
   perfectly pure from sin and we know that we are forgiven and accepted
   in the Beloved, then how happy we shall be! And there is no service so
   acceptable to God as that which is joyfully rendered. When it is a joy
   to us to serve Him, then it is a joy to Him to be served! When it is a
   delight to us to honor God, then God delights in such honor. He seeks
   not slaves to grace His Throne! When we know that we are perfectly
   forgiven, then we are full of gratitude--we then feel that we must
   serve God, not because of anything we are to get for it, but because we
   long to do so. This unselfish service He gladly accepts! To give play
   to our emotions, we feel that we must glorify Him--then we truly serve
   God, for that which is born of love is living! Loving works are living
   works! When His glorious name is honey in the mouth and music in the
   ear--and Heaven in the heart--then we worship Him in the manner which
   He accepts, even in the same

   manner as the angels in Glory who see His face and do His commandments.
   It is the cleansing blood which brings us near enough to do this.

   This precious blood of Christ has now given us perfect peace with God
   and, therefore, we can serve Him without fear. You cannot serve an
   enemy--while you hate him, you cannot please him. But our enmity to God
   is slain--He is our Friend, our Father and our God. His will is our
   will, His designs are our designs. As far as the little can keep pace
   with the great and the minute with the infinite, we run parallel with
   God! And if we ever quit the lines, for a moment, we are in misery till
   we get back again! What the Lord aims at we aim at. What He desires we
   desire. Is Christ's coming God's ultimatum? So it is ours and we cry,
   "Even so, come Lord Jesus!" Shall "the kingdoms of this world become
   the Kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ"? It is our last, best,
   highest prayer! Thus are we truly serving the Lord.

   See you not, then, how the washing of the precious blood has made us
   partakers of the service of Heaven? How close it has brought us to God!
   In what amity and accord we walk with Him! With what sympathy we enter
   into all that He does! With what intense delight we joy in Him through
   our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we also have received the Atonement! How
   I wish that every soul here believed in Jesus! O that you would do so
   at once. Amen.

Before Sermon, At Sermon and After Sermon

   (No. 1847)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 28, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore lay aside all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and
   receive with meekness the engrafted Word, which is able to save your
   souls. But be you doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving
   yourselves." James 1:21,22.

   BRETHREN, it is a good thing to be under the sound of the Word of God.
   Even if the very lowest motive should induce persons to come to hear
   the Gospel, it is, nevertheless, a good thing that they should come. We
   have heard of some who have even come to steal--and yet the Word of God
   has stolen into their hearts. In many cases, in olden times, spies were
   sent to hear the Protestant divines who preached the Gospel--and these
   took notes of all that was said, with a view to accuse them of false
   doctrine that they might be punished--yet in several cases, the spies,
   themselves, were converted! Such is the power of the Gospel of Christ,
   that it woos and wins, even, its greatest enemies. He that comes near
   to its fire, even with the intent to quench it, may find himself
   overcome by its heat.

   Master Hugh Latimer, in his quaint manner, when exhorting people to go
   to church, tells of a woman who could not sleep for many nights,
   notwithstanding that drugs had been given to her. She said that if they
   would take her to her parish church she could sleep, there, for she had
   often enjoyed a quiet slumber under the sermon. And he goes the length
   of saying that if people even come to the sermon to sleep, it is better
   than not to come at all for, he adds, in his fine old Saxon, "they may
   be caught napping." It is even so. A sick man does well to live where
   there are physicians, for one day he may be healed. If men are in the
   heat of a battle, they may be wounded--if they come where Gospel arrows
   are shot, they may fall under them. Plants that grow in the open are
   likely to be watered when the shower falls. We dare not say to any man
   who wills to enter the House of Prayer, "You must not come because your
   motive is gross and low." No, you are welcome, anyway! Who knows but
   that, being in the way, God may meet with you. Being where His Truth is
   preached, you may hear it--and "faith comes by hearing, and hearing by
   the Word of God."

   Yet it will strike you at once that though it is well to come to the
   hearing of the Word of God in any case, yet it is better to come in a
   better way. We should endeavor to gather the most we can from the means
   of Grace and not pluck at them at random. A farmer may feel that there
   will be sure to be some crop upon his land if he does but seed it, but,
   if he is a wise man, he is not satisfied with a bare crop--he
   fertilizes his land heavily and tills it well so that it may bring
   forth a large return to him--for in these times, the largest harvest is
   no more than he needs. So, my Brothers, let us so use the holy
   ordinance of preaching that we may extract the largest possible amount
   of gold from the ore. Let us so come into the solemn assembly that we
   may hope to meet with God, there, for this is the chief end of our
   gathering together. And let us so behave ourselves before the coming,
   in the coming and after the coming, to the sanctuary, that we may gain
   the greatest possible profit by our coming together. To hear the Word
   of the Lord is often made, of the Spirit of God, to be life to dead
   souls and the most eminent means of further quickening to those who are
   already alive unto God. Let us not lose a grain of the blessing through
   our own fault. The Word of the Lord is precious in these days--let us
   not trifle with it.

   This morning I shall handle my text with the earnest design of teaching
   you how to hear. Oh, that the Spirit of God may graciously help me!
   First, let us note what to do before the sermon--"Lay aside all
   filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness." Secondly, let us learn how
   to behave during the sermon--"Receive with meekness the engrafted Word,
   which is able to save your souls." And thirdly, here is the instruction
   for after the sermon--"Be you doers of the Word, and not hearers only,
   deceiving yourselves."

   I. Let us consider the fit and proper preparation for listening to the
   Gospel, or what is to be done BEFORE HEARING. It will strike every man
   who thinks about it, that there should be some preparation of the heart
   in coming to the worship of God and to the hearing of the Gospel.
   Consider who He is, in whose name we gather, and surely we cannot rush
   together without thought! Consider whom we profess to worship and we
   shall not hurry into His Presence as men run to a fire. Moses, the man
   of God, was warned to take off his shoes when God only revealed Himself
   in a bush--how should we prepare ourselves when we come to Him who
   reveals Himself in Christ Jesus, His dear Son? There should be no
   stumbling into the place of worship half-asleep; no roaming there as if
   it were no more than going to the theater. We cannot expect to profit
   much if we bring with us a swarm of idle thoughts and a heart crammed
   with vanity. If we are full of folly, we may shut out the Truth of God
   from our minds. We should make ready to receive what God is so ready to
   bestow. If he was condemned, who came to the wedding feast not having
   on a wedding garment, what shall we say of those who habitually come
   into the festivals of our Lord and never think of being meet to be
   partakers of His royal dainties? What shall we say of those who defile
   the temple of God by never seeking to have their souls washed from the
   filthiness of their sin? Certainly there should be a serious
   preparation when a sinful creature draws near to the most holy God!

   Brothers and Sisters, when I think of our engagements throughout the
   week, who of us can feel fit to come into the holy place of the
   tabernacles of the Most High? I mean not into these tabernacles made
   with hands, but into the inner spiritual temple of communion with God.
   How shall we come unto God until we are washed? After traveling so miry
   a road as that which runs through this foul world, can we come unto God
   without shaking the dust from off our feet? Can we be busy with earthly
   cares all the six days of the week and be ready for the holy Sabbath
   without a thought? I think not! Even in the heathen temples before the
   solemn mysteries began, the herald cried, "Far hence, you profane! Far
   hence, you profane!" And should not some herald cry to our wandering
   thoughts, "Far hence, vain thoughts, for God is

   here!"

   When the hour is come for drawing near unto the glorious Lord before
   whom angels veil their faces as they cry, "Holy, holy, holy," it
   becomes us to be devout and humble, holy and earnest. Yes, Brothers and
   Sisters, if we were always occupied with Divine worship; if we never
   knew thought or care except for His Glory; if we were altogether
   dissociated from the entanglements and defilements of the world, I
   should not be so earnest to speak of preparation before hearing the
   Word of God! But, alas, it is not so! We are men of unclean lips and we
   dwell among a people of unclean lips! We have not yet come into the
   holy country where everyone that salutes us is either saint or angel.
   We have not yet cut off all the Canaanites--we still have need to watch
   against them daily. Because of the sin which dwells in us and around
   us, we have need to wash ourselves in the laver at the tabernacle door
   before we may come near unto the Most High.

   There is a common consent among mankind that there should be some
   preparation for worship. I see the visible signs of it here, today.
   Before the Sabbath dawned, you began to prepare clean linen and
   brighter garments than those of common days. It is but an outward and
   common matter, but still, within the shell there lies a kernel. Man
   puts off his ordinary weekday garments and puts on his best apparel for
   the Sabbath because, by instinct, he feels that he should pay some
   reverence to his God. I fear this change of clothing full often
   degenerates into a wish to look good before your fellows, but the
   underlying meaning should be this--"I am going up, this day, to the
   worship of my God. I will not go, therefore, either in uncleanness of
   body or of apparel, but will put on the best raiment, that I may show
   respect to my God and to the assemblies of His house."

   My counsel to you is cleanse your hearts rather than your garments! Go
   before God in newness of spirit rather than in newness of clothing. If
   of old the Prophet said, "Rend your heart, and not your garments," so
   may I say, today, Put on the garments of righteousness and holiness by
   the Grace of Christ Jesus our Lord, rather than external garments which
   do but adorn the flesh. Yet, I say, even in that change of raiment
   there is an admission that there should be God and to worship His holy
   name. God grant that we may not be forgetful of some kind of special
   preparation when we go up to hear the Word.

   In making this preparation, our text tells us that there are some
   things to be laid aside. What does it say? "Therefore lay aside all
   filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness." Some things must be removed
   before the Word of God can be received. And what are these things? The
   text mentions all filthiness. Now sin of every kind is filthiness. It
   does not strike the most of men so--they call it pleasure! I have even
   known them to think it an ornament. But in the judgment of the Spirit
   of God, who speaks here by His servant, James, every sin is filthiness.
   In the sight of every renewed man, all sin is

   filthiness and nothing better. Ever since the day when the Spirit of
   God took the scales from his eyes, the godly man sees sin to be a foul
   thing--abominable in the sight of a holy God. Sin in the thoughts is
   filthiness of the thoughts! Sin in words is filthiness of speech! Sin
   in action is filthiness in life! Everywhere, the transgression of the
   Law is a foul and polluting thing, which neither God nor good men can
   bear.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, in coming before God, by the help of His
   Spirit, every sin must be confessed, forsaken, and hated. By faith in
   the precious blood of Jesus, it must be washed out, for we cannot come
   before God with acceptance while iniquity is indulged. We must remain
   apart from God till we are apart from filthiness. Filth, you know, is a
   debasing thing, meet only for beggars and thieves--and such is sin.
   Filth is offensive to all clean persons. We cannot bear close contact
   with a person who neglects the washing of his body or of his clothes,
   so as to become a living dunghill. However poor a man is, he might be
   clean. And when he is not, he becomes a common nuisance to those who
   speak with him, or sit near him. If bodily filthiness is horrible to
   us, what must the filthiness of sin be to the pure and holy God?! I
   cannot attempt to express the abomination of sin to God! He hates it
   with all His soul. If we are to be acceptable before God, there must be
   no keeping of favorite sins, no sparing of darling lusts, no providing
   for secret iniquities--our service will be filthiness before God if our
   hearts go after our sins. He says, "Be you clean, that bear the vessels
   of the Lord." He would not have the vessels of His sanctuary touched
   with filthy fingers.

   Have we well considered this? Lay aside, then, all filthiness unless
   you wish to arouse the wrath of God. If we are offensive to God, all we
   do becomes offensive to Him. Remember how it is written that, "the Lord
   had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his
   offering, He had not respect." The Lord's acceptance is, first, to the
   person and, then, to the sacrifice--to Abel, first, and to his offering
   afterwards. If God has no delight in a man's person, then has He no
   delight in his services. Think not, you unclean, that your hymns and
   praises, however sweetly they are sung, can be music in His ears! Think
   not that your forms of prayer can ever ascend like sweet perfume before
   Him--they are a stench to Him--and an abomination, so long as you,
   yourselves, are not washed from your filthiness! The filthiness of sin
   is to be put aside if we would hear the Word aright.

   Moreover, sin is not only offensive, but it is dangerous. We have
   learned at last, I hope, though some are still ignorant of the fact,
   that filthiness means disease. Men begin to see that unless we are
   clean we cannot be healthy. He who harbors filth is making a hot-bed
   for the germs of disease and thus he is the enemy of his family and of
   his neighborhood. The filthy man is a public poisoner, a suicide and a
   murderer! Sin is the greatest conceivable danger to a man's own
   soul--it makes a man to be dead while he lives--yes, corrupt before he
   is dead. Sin is a mortal disease and he that bears it about him is not
   far from Hell--while he continues to love it, he can never enter
   Heaven. Will you come before God and tread His courts with this leprosy
   upon your foreheads? Will you bring your infectious diseases into His
   Temple? They must be laid aside. Oh, for Grace to do this!

   There are at least three sins that are intended, here, and one is
   covetousness. Hence the desire of unholy gain is called filthy lucre
   because it leads men to do dirty deeds which otherwise they would not
   think of. If the lust of wealth enters into the heart, it rots it to
   the core! The Apostle cries, "Your gold and your silver are cankered!"
   Truly, the man becomes full of cancer and cankered, too. Now, when a
   man's heart is full of filth, when the desire to get gain and to get it
   anyway he can is strong on a man, he is in a very unfit condition to
   profit by hearing the Gospel. You cannot get the Gospel into him--a
   golden bolt fastens the door. He is somewhat in the condition of the
   sea captain I have heard of who went out after whales and when he
   landed and heard the Gospel preached, he said to the man of God, "Sir,
   it was of no use your preaching to me, for all the while I was thinking
   about where I should find a whale. There is no room for anything else
   in my mind but whales. I must have whales and, for the time, I can
   think of nothing else but whales." So it must be with the man who is
   hot for gain--his farm and his merchandise are in his heart --crowding
   out everything else. He who has a stall in Vanity Fair is in an unfit
   state to buy the Truth of God since his merchandise is vanity. A
   covetous man is an idolater and cannot receive the gift of God till he
   has mastered his bosom sin. He is too foul to draw near to the Lord!
   God help him to escape from the idolatry of riches.

   Then, with peculiar correctness, lustfulness may be spoken of as
   filthiness. I need not enlarge. Does not Nature, itself, teach us that
   the indulgence of our animal passions, whatever form that indulgence
   may take, whether of drunkenness or lewdness, is a condition that makes
   a man unfit for the reception of the pure Word of God? How should
   spotless purity come and dwell with that man whose life is brutish
   indulgence? How should the thrice Holy Spirit come and dwell

   in that heart which is a den of unclean desires? Did the men of Sodom
   profit by the teaching of Lot? Shall a man come from the chamber of
   lust to the house of the Lord? No, Brothers and Sisters. We must lay
   apart all filthiness if we are to worship God in spirit and in truth.

   But in the connection of my text, the filthiness meant is especially
   anger. Read it and you will see. "The wrath of man works not the
   righteousness of God; therefore lay aside all filthiness." Some
   persons, when they are angry, will say things that never ought to be
   repeated, or even said for the first time. It was so, no doubt, in
   James's day even more than in our own--then angry men let fly horrible
   epithets and abominable insinuations which were, indeed, a superfluity
   of naughtiness. Now, the child of God is to subdue his anger, wrath and
   malice. How can you accept the Word of Peace while you are at enmity
   with your brother? How can you hope to find forgiveness under the
   hearing of the Word of God when you forgive not those who have
   trespassed against you? We would have you pray before you come into
   this house on the Sabbath morning or evening--and see to it that you
   come in the spirit of gentleness and meekness! Only thus will you
   receive the engrafted Word. The wrath of man is so filthy a thing that
   it cannot work the righteousness of God! Nor is it likely that the
   righteousness of God will be worked in the heart that is hot like an
   oven with passion and malice. A revengeful, bitter and malicious spirit
   is little likely to imbibe the sweet forgiving spirit of the Gospel.
   God help us, then, to lay aside all filthiness and especially all
   enmity.

   But it is added, "and superfluity of naughtiness." What does that mean?
   Any kind of naughtiness in a child of God is superfluous--iniquity
   ought not to be within him! "Superfluity of naughtiness," or the
   outpouring of evil, is unnecessary. It is an excrescence upon a child
   of God. The phrase here used differs not in meaning from the first
   epithet of the text--it gives another view of the same thing. You have
   seen a rose bush which, perhaps, was bearing very few roses, and you
   half wondered why. It was a good bush and planted in good soil, but its
   flowers were scanty. You looked around it and, by-and-by, you perceived
   that suckers were growing up from its roots. Now, these suckers come
   from the old, original briar on which the rose had been grafted--and
   this rose had a superfluity of strength which it used in these suckers.
   These superfluities, or overflows, took away from the rose, the life
   which it required, so that it could not produce the full amount of
   flowers which you expected from it. These superfluities of naughtiness
   that were coming up here and there were to the injury of the bush.

   Children of God, you cannot serve the Lord if you are giving your
   strength to any form of wrong! Your naughtinesses are springing from
   the briar stock of your old nature and the best thing to do is to cut
   off those suckers and stop them as much as possible, so that all the
   strength may return into the rose--and the lovely flowers of Grace may
   abound. Oh, that God's people, when they come up here on the Sabbath,
   may first have undergone that Divine pruning which shall take away the
   superfluity of naughtiness, for there cannot be grafting without a
   measure of pruning! The gardener takes off from a certain part of the
   tree, a shoot of the old stock, and then he inserts the graft. There
   must be a removal of superfluities in order that we may receive with
   meekness the engrafted Word which is able to save our souls. This is
   what is to be put away.

   The garments spotted with the flesh and infected with disease are to be
   taken off and laid aside. We are to wear them no more if we desire to
   profit by the Word which we hear. We are not to lay up these to put
   them on again, but lay them aside among the offal of Tophet's
   fire--with the strong desire never to touch them again. To the fires we
   condemn these filthy things! What have we to do with filthiness, now
   that we have been begotten by the will of God to be the first fruits of
   His creatures? You who are the children of a holy God, what have you to
   do with naughtiness, or any such superfluity? God help you to shake off
   sin as Paul shook off the viper into the fire!

   Why is this? Why is a man, as he comes to hear the Gospel, to see to
   this? I take it because all these evil things preoccupy the mind.
   Whether it is covetousness, or lewdness, or anger, in addition to the
   pollution which these bring, they also possess the thoughts, so that
   they are not likely to be blessed while hearing the Word of God. These
   are the rocks which prevent the seed from entering the mind. These the
   birds which devour that which is sown. These are the weeds which choke
   the upspringing shoots. Therefore, lay these aside. If you bring your
   measures to this place filled to the brim with chaff, how can you
   expect to have them filled with wheat? If we come here with this
   filthiness about us, how can we expect that the pure and incorruptible
   Word of God shall be sweet to us?

   Moreover, sin prejudices against the Gospel. A man says, "I did not
   enjoy the sermon." How can you? What have you been enjoying during the
   week? What flavor did last night leave in your mouth? "I cannot stand
   that man," says one.

   And if you could, it would be an evidence that the man was not
   faithful! Can Ahab love Elijah? I remember seeing one get up and go out
   in hot indignation at what I had said, which happened to come
   personally home to him, though the man was a stranger to me. What I had
   said was the pure Truth of God and I could not be sorry that an
   ill-living man was indignant at it, since this was the only homage that
   such as he could pay to purity! Had he but known it, there was therein
   a manifestation to himself of what his nature was and in what condition
   he was. Do you think Christ's servants desire to please those who will
   not please God? "Oh," said one to a Puritan Divine, "my lord heard you,
   this morning, and he is mightily offended at your remarks upon profane
   language, for my lord is given to drop an oath, now and then, in his
   ordinary speech." What said the Puritan Divine? He answered, "Sir, if
   your lord offends my Lord, then your lord ought to be offended and I
   cannot say less than I have said."

   If any men are offended with the Gospel, it is because they offend God.
   It is almost invariably the case that when persons grow skeptical, who
   once professed to be religious, and begin picking at this and that,
   there is a secret evil in their lives which they thus try to cover from
   their own consciences. The devil tempts them to rail at the ministry
   because the Gospel presses hard upon their guilty consciences and makes
   them feel uneasy in their sins. If you are to hear God's Word with
   pleasure and profit to yourselves, you must, "lay aside all filthiness
   and superfluity of naughtiness," for these things will prejudice you
   against the Word of God and render you incapable of that lively
   appreciation of it which is so necessary to profiting thereby. God
   bless these words of mine and may many of you who have come carelessly
   here at different times, henceforth seek to come with preparedness into
   the assembly of God's people.

   II. Secondly, I will talk a little about DURING HEARING. How shall we
   act while listening to the Word? "Receive with meekness the engrafted
   Word, which is able to save your souls." The first thing, then, is
   receive. That word, "receive," is a very instructive Gospel word--it is
   the door through which God's Grace enters us. We are not saved by
   working, but by receiving--not by what we give to God, but by what God
   gives to us--and we receive from Him. In the hearing of the Word, there
   should be a receiving of it, not into the ears only, but into the
   understanding, into the heart, into the conscience, together with a
   laying-up of this good treasure in the memory and the affections. You
   must receive the Word of God, or it cannot bless you. For, Sirs, the
   Word of God is a feast, but what comes of it if a man only looks at the
   banquet? Shall he not go away as empty as he came if he does not
   receive it? The preaching of the Word of God is as a shower from
   Heaven, but what happens to the soil if the raindrops fall but none are
   absorbed into the soil? Of what use is the shower if none is drunk in
   by the thirsty furrows? A medicine may have great healing power, but if
   it is not received, it does not purge the inward parts of the body.
   There must be a receiving of any good thing before the goodness of it
   can be ours.

   I love, when I read the Bible, or hear the Word, to throw the doors of
   my soul wide open--yes, and to open all the windows of my heart. My
   soul cries, "Come in, most blessed Spirit; come in, Divine Life. You
   shall not say there is no room for You in the inn! Come, take
   possession of every chamber of this house of mine and be Master of it
   from now on and forever." I pray you, my Brothers and Sisters, do not
   block up your souls against the incoming tide of the Gospel! On the
   contrary, break down the dams and let the river flow into you till you
   are filled with it! Receive the Word of God! Many men are not profited
   by the Word because it does not penetrate them, but is like water
   flowing down a slab of marble. The Truth of God must soak into the
   heart if it is to bless the heart! May the blessed Spirit give us a
   sweet receptive-ness of the Truth, for, otherwise, it is of no use to
   hear it.

   Then it is added, "receive with meekness." Many do not receive the
   Gospel because they are not of a meek and teachable spirit. They come
   up to God's house, but the only seat they will occupy is the Judgment
   Seat. One would imagine them to be the god of God by their bold talk!
   Judge not the Word of God, I charge you! You may judge me as you like--
   small matter shall that be to me, for we are not anxious as to men's
   judgment--our judgment is with the living God. If the preacher truly
   declares the Word of God, woe unto the man who sits in judgment upon
   it--this same Word shall judge him at the Last Great Day! We stand at
   the bar to be tried by God's Word, searched and sifted--but woe unto us
   if, rejecting every presence of meekness, we ascend the tribunal and
   summon God, Himself, before us! The spirit of critics ill becomes
   sinners when they seek the Lord's mercy.

   His message must be received with teachableness of mind. When you know
   it is God's Word, it may upbraid you, but you must receive it with
   meekness. It may startle you with its denunciations, but receive it
   with meekness. It may be there is something about the Truth which, at
   the first blush, does not commend itself to your understanding. It is,
   perhaps, too

   high, too terrible, too deep--receive it with meekness. This is not the
   spirit of the present age, but it is the spirit which the living God
   requires of us. It is by receiving with meekness that we receive the
   Truth of God in the power of it and so it is able to save our souls.
   Unless you are converted and become as little children, you cannot
   enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. The door of Heaven is open to those
   who sit at Jesus' feet and learn of Him. You are not His servant unless
   He is your Master. You cannot be said to be His disciple if you
   question His teaching, for in the questioning of Christ's teaching lies
   the rejection of His Person. To doubt Jesus is treason against the
   authority He claims over every human heart. Receive with meekness if
   you would be blessed with Divine Grace.

   What is this which is to be received? "Receive with meekness the
   engrafted Word." We are not bid to receive with meekness men's words,
   for they are many, and there is little in them. But receive with
   meekness God's Word, for it is one, and there is power in each Word
   which proceeds out of His mouth. One Word of God created the heavens
   and the earth! By the Word of God, the heavens still stand! One Word of
   His shall, before long, shake not only earth but also Heaven!
   Therefore, hear with meekness that Word; that Word which testifies of
   sin and of its sure punishment; that Word which testifies of Grace most
   large and free--and of an Atonement provided by the Only-Begotten Son
   of the Father--by which sin is put away in consistency with justice and
   holiness. Receive with meekness the Word of the Lord in its entirety
   and unity. Reject no part of it, but receive the whole.

   Any little particle of God's Word, so far as we know it, is precious,
   and should be highly esteemed by us. The odds and ends, and corners and
   fragments of the Divine Word are to be received by you and by me--and
   there is a lack of meekness in us if we begin to pick and choose, and
   cut and carve the Divine Word. Who are we that we should say, "This or
   that is not essential"? Who are you, O man, that you should decide what
   is essential or otherwise? He who gave the Word did not write trifles!
   It is essential that you receive the Word of the Lord as supreme and
   perfect! And it is essential that you are lost if you do willfully
   reject any portion of that which the Most High deigns to reveal to men.
   Receive with meekness the one, only, and indivisible Word of the Lord.

   It is called "the engrafted Word." The Revised Version has "the
   implanted Word," which is, perhaps, more literal than the Authorized
   translation. And it puts in the margin, "the inborn Word," which gives
   another idea and yet conveys the same sense. I will keep to our old and
   well-beloved version and read it, "engrafted Word." When a graft is to
   be made, the first thing is to make a cut or gash. Nobody ever received
   the Word of God into his heart, to be engrafted there, without being
   cut and wounded by the Truth of God. It needs two wounds to make a
   graft--you wound the tree and you wound that better tree which is to be
   grafted in. Is it not a blessed grafting when a wounded Savior comes
   into living contact with a wounded heart? When a bleeding heart is
   engrafted with a bleeding Savior? Engrafting implies that the heart is
   wounded and opened--and then the living Word is laid in and received
   with meekness into the bleeding, wounded soul of the man. There is the
   gash and there is the space opened by it. Here comes the graft--the
   gardener must establish a union between the tree and the graft. This
   new life, this new branch, is inserted into the old stem, and they are
   to be livingly joined together.

   At first they are bound together by the gardener and clay is placed
   about the points of junction. But soon they begin to grow into one
   another and only then is the grafting effectual. This new cutting grows
   into the old and it begins to suck up the life of the old and change it
   so that it makes new fruit. That branch, though it is in the grafted
   tree, is altogether of another sort. Now, we need the Word of God to be
   brought to us in a similar fashion--our heart must be cut and
   opened--and then the Word must be laid into the gash till the two
   adhere. Then the heart begins to hold to the Word, to believe in it, to
   hope in it, to love it, to grow to it, to grow into it and to bear
   fruit accordingly! "Christ lives in me," said the Apostle. Is not that
   a wonderful thought? The daily Incarnation of Christ in the Believer,
   or, in other words, the new Eternal Life living in us and producing
   fruit after its own kind, while we live in it--and the fruit is our
   own. Christ is come in all the newness of His life and is living in me!
   Oh, blessed grafting! "Receive with meekness the engrafted Word."

   Once more, you are to receive it by faith, for you are to regard the
   word as being able. Believe in the power of God's Word--receive it as
   being fully able to save your souls from beginning to end! Two ways it
   does this--by putting away your sin as you accept the blood and
   righteousness of Christ--and by changing your nature as you accept the
   Lord Jesus to be your Master and your Lord, your life and your all.
   There is such potency in the Word of God, that if it is received into
   the heart, it will effectually save the soul! It will not merely give
   you a hope of being saved, but really save you--save

   you now, save you through life, save you to all eternity! Oh, with what
   ears ought men to listen to a Word which can save their souls! With
   what open mouths ought they to drink in this Living Water! How wisely
   might we wish to be like sponges, to suck it all up, or like Gideon's
   fleece, to be saturated with the dew of Heaven! How we ought to wish to
   be like the plowed ground which is broken up and pulverized, so that
   every drop that falls may soak into it! Oh, that the new life that is
   come to us would put out the old life of the flesh, so that our life
   should no longer be after the old fashion, but in all newness of power!
   Let us rejoice to have the Word engrafted in us.

   This is how to behave at the sermon. Oh, what need have we of the Holy
   Spirit to help us to hear the Truth as well as to prepare us before we
   hear it!

   III. Lastly, and very briefly, let us think of AFTER THE SERMON. "Be
   you doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."

   First, the command is positive--"Be you doers of the Word." Oh, dear
   Sirs, I come to this pulpit oftentimes and speak with you, but as I
   come here, my heart is more and more burdened with this desire--that
   mine may not be an unprofitable ministry to you! I shall be useless to
   you unless you are doers of the Word as well as hearers. Sirs, you have
   heard about repentance and the putting away of filthiness--repent,
   then, and let your filthiness be put away! May God the Holy Spirit lead
   you to do so--not only to hear about it--but do it. You have heard us
   preach continually concerning faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   know all about believing--but have you believed? Sirs, have you
   believed? If not, to what use is it for us to cry, "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ and you shall be saved"? We are to admonish you concerning
   all those blessed duties which spring out of that living faith which
   works by love--but it is nothing to hear about these virtues unless you
   possess them! Doing far surpasses hearing!

   I believe that with a very little knowledge and great doing of what we
   know, we may attain to a far higher degree of Grace than with great
   knowledge and little doing of what we know. The man who knows how to
   keep shop makes no profit by his knowledge if he does not keep a shop.
   The doctor who knows how to cure the sick is not, therefore, a healer
   if he never has a patient. The man who knows how to teach children, but
   never teaches them, is not an instructor of youth. If a schoolmaster
   teaches the little he does know, he may be a better teacher than a
   great philosopher who keeps all his wisdom to himself. We value clouds
   by their rain, and men by their actual doings! The world is always
   looking to the church, not so much to hear her teachings as to see her
   doings. Few ask, "What is the doctrine taught at such a meeting house?"
   The ungodly world cries, "Forget the doctrine! What good is done
   there?"

   If the people who attend there are mean, false and hypocritical, the
   world condemns the tree which yields such fruit! The bulk of men do not
   read the Bible, but they read you--and if they do not come to hear the
   minister preach the Gospel, yet they say, "These people who hear him
   are no better than other people, and why should we trouble to go and
   listen to him?" The minister gets the blame which should rightly belong
   to those who are hearers but not doers of the Word of God! Oh, may the
   Eternal Spirit work in us all to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure! There is nothing done by these Sundays. There is nothing done
   by these pulpits! There is nothing done by these pews! There is nothing
   done by these vast gatherings unless our hearers are doers of the Word
   of God! Practice is the harvest--the rest is but the plowing and the
   sowing.

   Observe that the command is put negatively. The text says, "not hearers
   only." Those who are hearers only are wasters of the Word. What poor
   creatures hearers are, for they have long ears and no hands! You have
   heard of him who, one day, was discoursing eloquently of philosophy to
   a crowd, who greatly applauded him. He thought he had made many
   disciples, but suddenly the market bell rang and not a single person
   remained! Gain was to be made and, in their opinion, no philosophy
   could be compared to personal profit! They were hearers till the market
   bell rang and then, as they had been hearers only, they quit the
   hearing, also! I fear it is so with our preaching--if the devil rings
   the bell for sin, for pleasure, for worldly amusement, or evil
   gain--our admirers leave us right speedily! The voice of the world
   drowns the voice of the Word! Those who are only hearers, are hearers
   but for a time. Some of those now before me are hearers only. We cannot
   mark your houses by putting a cross upon your doors and writing on
   them, "Lord, have mercy upon us," but if I did so, London would seem to
   be smitten with the plague!

   Oh that you would cease from this mocking of God and ruining of
   yourselves! Remember, if any man will be lost, he will most surely be
   lost who heard the Gospel and refused it! Write that word in great
   capital letters--if any soul will be lost emphatically, it is he who
   has been, for years, a hearer only, a hearer where thousands have
   believed unto eternal life!

   Over the cell of such a man write, "He knew his duty, but he did it
   not"--and that cell will be found to be built in the very center of
   Gehenna--it is the innermost prison of Hell. Willful rejection of
   Christ ensures woeful rejection from Christ! Take heed, you that deny
   Him entrance now, lest--

   "How they deserve the deepest Hell

   That slight the joys above!

   What chains of vengeance must they feel

   Who break the bonds of love!"

   The text closes with this solemn word--"deceiving yourselves."
   Whereupon says Bishop Brownrig, "To deceive is bad, to deceive
   yourselves is worse, to deceive yourselves about your souls is worst of
   all." Alas, there are many in that sad condition! A syllogism may be
   bad and yet it may look like logic--and such are the hopes which men
   fashion out of a bare hearing of the Word of God! It is very easy, when
   you get well accustomed to the Gospel, au fait at it, as they say, to
   be able to twist it so as to make it seem to favor you, though it
   condemns you. He who wills to be deceived can feign an acquittal out of
   a sentence of death! Many think it is all right with them, when it is
   all wrong with them. They always hear the Gospel--how can they be
   castaways? They sit under a thoroughly evangelical Divine--how can they
   be reprobates? They know what is what--they will not consent to hear
   false doctrine--they have a discriminating faculty and will not abide
   unorthodox teaching.

   I am very glad they will not, but they seem to make a god of this
   discernment. Alas, it is a mere idol! Hundreds believe that because
   their minister is unquestionably sound in the faith, therefore they are
   also sound. As they have the good sense to hear him, surely they are
   first-rate people and the Lord will overlook their faults! Oh, Sirs, be
   not such fools! Do not deceive yourselves in that way, for there is no
   truth in this comforting conclusion! The better that which you hear,
   the more guilty are you if you do not practice it! And the plainer and
   more straight the Gospel which is taught you, the more inexcusable are
   you if you do not receive it! When the Gospel comes to you with a heavy
   knock at the door of your heart, the more terrible your crime if you
   bolt and bar your door against it, or say, "When I have a more
   convenient season I will send for you."

   God grant to each one of us that when we go home we may attend to the
   doing of the sermon! You know the old story--I am half ashamed to
   repeat it, but it is so pat to the point. When Donald came out of
   church sooner than usual, Sandy said to him, "What? Donald, is the
   sermon all done?" "No," said Donald, "it is all said, but it is not
   begun to be done yet." Let my sermon be done in your chambers by prayer
   and in your lives by holiness! Let it be done all through the week by
   our, each one, seeking to put away all filthiness! Let us cling to the
   holy Christ, desiring to live His life and breathe His Spirit. God
   grant it may be so with you all, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--James 1.

The Looking Glass

   (No. 1848)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 5, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For if anyone is a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, he is like unto
   a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholds himself,
   and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man he was.
   But he who looks into the perfect Law of liberty, and continues in it,
   he beingnot a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall
   be blessedin his deed." James 1:23-25.

   LAST Lord's Day I tried to show the right way of hearing the Word of
   God. We spoke of how to behave before the sermon, at the sermon and
   after the sermon. May God grant that the word which I then spoke may
   continue in your minds and bring forth good fruit! At this time I shall
   draw a distinction between the true and blessed hearer of the Word and
   the person who misses the blessing because he hears to forget. You will
   forgive my coming back to this subject when I confess that I groan in
   my own heart with unutterable longings to be a channel of blessing to
   all who hear or read my discourses. To what purpose do I stand here so
   often and pour out my soul before you, if you are not the better for
   it? I am an unhappy sower if all the handfuls of seed which I scatter
   must fall upon unbroken soil, to be devoured of birds and never take
   root. Blessed be God, it is not altogether so! We, by His Grace, have
   reaped many harvests in this place. But still, our hearts ache for
   larger results!

   There remain among us, still, those who are impervious to the Truth of
   God, in whom the Divine Word has taken no lodging--will these never be
   saved? They still continue to listen and to listen with kindly respect,
   but they are not yet doers of the Word. Our lament is that of Paul,
   "They have not all obeyed the Gospel." They have heard it and, in a
   measure, appreciated it, but they have not obeyed it. It has not come
   to them with power, compelling them to yield to its commands. It will
   be a sad thing if, when I give in my account, it shall be with grief
   and not with joy--for this will be as unprofitable for you as it will
   be grievous for me. I know that I shall meet my hearers at the Judgment
   Day and I know, also, that an account will be demanded of me--much more
   searching than any through which my conscience can put me even when it
   is most awake! How will you stand in that account? It will be read in
   the seven-fold light of that Great Day for which all other days were
   made! And what will the record be?

   I earnestly desire to present you all as a chaste virgin unto Christ,
   but I fear it will not be so. Concerning some of you, I fear that I
   shall have run in vain and labored in vain. I am bowed with grief at
   such a prospect! O my Hearers, do not kill me by destroying your own
   souls! Oh, that you may now turn to our Lord Jesus and, in Him, find
   acceptance with the Lord in that day! The Lord grant it for His
   infinite mercy's sake!

   Two things are very obvious in the text--the first is the hearer of the
   Word who does not profit by it and is represented as looking into a
   glass. And then, secondly, we see the man who does profit by the Word,
   for he is represented as looking into the perfect Law. May the Holy
   Spirit help us to see these clearly!

   I. First, then, here is LOOKING INTO A GLASS. Looking into a glass is a
   trivial business. In all areas men, not to say, women, have been fond
   of seeing themselves. In the earlier days they had no reflecting
   glasses as we now have, but they used mirrors made of brass and
   different metals, highly polished. These mirrors yielded a sufficiently
   clear image of the beholder. Albeit, the children of Israel came out of
   Egypt in a great hurry, yet we find that the women carried their
   looking glasses with them into the wilderness. (See Exodus 38:8). It
   was according to their womanly nature--whatever else they forgot, they
   must have the indispensable looking glass for the purpose of their
   toilet. It is to their praise, however, that in the desert their
   devotion overcame their vanity, for when the bronze laver was to be
   made in which the

   priests should wash, it was made of the looking glasses of the
   serving-women who were accustomed to meet at the door of the
   tabernacle.

   Still, the use of the mirror must be ranked among the trifles of
   life--I see that you are half-smiling at the playfulness which glitters
   around a glass. Is not this a hint at the light in which many regard
   the hearing of the Gospel? They crowd to hear a preacher if he has some
   sort of name--not that they desire to get a blessing, but merely that
   they may say that they have heard him--or that they may gratify their
   curiosity by seeing what he is like. Truly the burden of our lives is a
   pastime to some of you! Sirs, this reminds me of the fable of the
   frogs. When the boys stoned them, the poor creatures said, "It may be
   sport to you, but it is death to us!" You may hear me, this day, with
   the most idle curiosity and judge my message with the coldest
   criticism, but if you do not receive the blessings of the Gospel, it
   strikes a chill at my heart! Your unspiritual hearing is sport to you,
   but it is death to me! A deadly shadow like a Hell-mist hovers over my
   Spirit while I suppose it possible that I am, with all my earnestness,
   ministering to your condemnation!

   Can it be that I am laboriously doing nothing? Worse than that, are my
   instructions, persuasions and entreaties to be so treated as to
   increase your responsibility and bury you under a heavier load of sin?
   As God's servant, I tremble at so dreadful a prospect! We live if you
   live unto God--but if you do not turn to God, we wish that we had never
   been born! It were better for us to plow the thankless sea than to
   utter Truth which will be a savor of death to you. O Sirs, to hear the
   Gospel will one day appear to be the most solemn of exercises! Indeed,
   it is not the trivial matter that many make of it! It is infinitely
   more than gazing into a mirror. How long will it be before you know
   this?

   Upon my first head of looking into a glass, let me say that to every
   hearer, the true Word of God is as a mirror. Certain preachers dream
   that it is their business to paint pretty pictures, but it is not so.
   We are not to design and sketch, but simply to give the reflection of
   the Truth of God. We are to hold up the mirror to nature, in a moral
   and spiritual sense, and let men see themselves. We have not even to
   make the mirror, but only to hold it up! The thoughts of God--not our
   own thoughts--are to be set before our hearers' minds--these allow a
   man to discover himself. The Word of the Lord is a revealer of
   secrets--it shows a man his life, his thoughts, his heart, his inmost
   self.

   A large proportion of hearers only look upon the surface of the
   Gospel--and to their minds, the surface, alone, is operative. Yet, even
   that surface is sufficiently effectual to reflect the natural face
   which looks upon it and this may be of lasting service if rightly
   followed up. Brethren, the chief blessing cannot come to us by surface
   work--he that would be enriched by the Gospel must dig for it--and must
   dig deep. He must sink shafts into its fathomless mines, that he may
   bring up "the much fine gold." Let not our thoughts glide over the
   surface of the Word like swift birds that touch the crests of the
   waves, but let us plunge into the depths of Scripture like
   pearl-fishers who seek for hidden treasures.

   The Scripture gives a truthful reflection of man's nature--it lets the
   man see himself, not as others see him, for others make mistakes, nor
   as he would see himself, for he is very apt to be partial to his own
   soul--but the Scripture makes him see himself as God sees him. Look at
   the Scriptural portrait of a sinner. That is you, O man! Look at the
   depraved heart, the rebellious will, the darkened understanding--that
   heart, will and understanding are yours, O my Brother! What a sight it
   is which meets the sinner's eyes when he is hearing the faithful Word!
   "I thought," he says, as he looks into the Word, "that I was much more
   comely than this. I had never dreamed of these freckles and spots! I
   was not aware that I suffered from such a twist of features, such an
   exaggeration of one and such a deficiency in another."

   The Bible does not flatter human nature, neither does the true preacher
   attempt so base a work--but in plain and downright honesty of truth the
   witness is given, "They are all gone out of the way, they are together
   become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one." When
   conscience is awakened and the man sees himself as the Revelation of
   God declares him to be, he can hardly think that this can be the same
   self with which he was upon such excellent terms! If God blesses the
   sight, he is led to abhor himself and to seek for cleansing and
   renewal! But if not, the man has at least seen himself and has had the
   opportunity of knowing his true state.

   The reflection of self in the Word is very like life. You have,
   perhaps, seen a dog so astonished at his image in the glass that he has
   barked fiercely at himself. A parrot will mistake its reflection for a
   rival. Well may the creature wonder, since every one of its movements
   is so accurately copied--it thinks itself to be mocked. Under a true
   preacher, men are often so thoroughly unearthed and laid bare that even
   the details of their lives are reported. Not only is the portrait drawn
   to the life, but it is an actually living portrait which is given in
   the mirror of the Word. There is little need to point the finger and
   say, "You are the man," for the hearer perceives on his own that he is
   spoken of. As the image in the

   glass moves and alters its countenance, and changes its appearance, so
   does the Word of the Lord set forth man in his many phases, moods and
   conditions.

   The Scripture of Truth knows all about him and it tells him what it
   knows. Many a time the hearer has said, "Somebody has told the
   preacher." Yes, somebody has told him--that which you do in your
   bedchamber the Lord has revealed unto His servant. The Holy Spirit
   "aides our hands wittingly," so that we lay them upon the right heads.
   I have sometimes said to you that people frequently wish that the
   preacher knew their experience in order that he could preach to it. But
   it is not necessary to tell God's sent servant anything about it, for
   he will speak to you with all the more power because he does not know!
   You may go in to hear the sermon--and be wearing a disguise--but even a
   blind Prophet will find you out and say, "Come in, you wife of
   Jeroboam, why do you feign yourself to be another woman? I have heavy
   tidings from the Lord for you." The Chaldean soothsayers said to King
   Nebuchadnezzar, "Tell your servants the dream and we will show the
   interpretation"--but Daniel knew the dream and the interpretation,
   also, and that marked him out as being sent of God! When the preacher's
   description of the man's heart is true to life and yet no human mouth
   has whispered it into his ears, then the man cries, "This is the finger
   of God!" A great part of the self-evidencing power of the Gospel lies
   in the way in which it discovers to our minds that which, before, lay
   within our bosoms, hidden, even, from ourselves!

   The glass of the Word is not like our ordinary looking glass, which
   merely shows us our external features, but, according to the Greek of
   our text, the man sees in it "the face of his birth," that is, the face
   of his nature. He that reads and hears the Word may see not only his
   actions, there, but his motives, his desires, his inward condition. As
   the butcher cuts down the carcass and reveals all the innards, which
   never could have been seen but for his knife, so is the Word of God
   "quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even
   to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
   The secrets of the man are opened up to himself and he is astonished to
   see his inward depravity, his carnal tendencies and his corrupt
   inclinations. As a man sees his outward self in the looking glass, so
   may he see his inward self in the Word of God. But if this is all, to
   what purpose is it?

   Secondly, many a hearer does see himself in the mirror of the Word. We
   are told so twice in the text--"He is like a man beholding his natural
   face in a glass, for he beholds himself." He really does see himself,
   for he cannot help doing so. He is not such a careless hearer as to be
   utterly blind to the Revelation of God--he beholds--he beholds himself.
   He beholds the face of his birth. He is thoughtful during the
   discourse. He spies out the application of the Truth of God to himself
   and marks his own spots and blemishes.

   Oftentimes he sees himself so plainly that he grows astonished at what
   he sees. He cries, like the woman of Samaria-- "Come, see a Man that
   told me all things that ever I did." Barbarous people, when they first
   of all see looking glasses, are quite taken aback. "How can these
   things be?" is their first question. Now, have not you, dear Hearers,
   who are unconverted, been often staggered at the home-thrusts of the
   Word? You have seen yourselves so unmistakably that you have been
   unable to escape from the truth, but have been filled with wonder at
   it. But what is the use of this if it goes no farther?

   Such observers have been known to praise the excellence of the mirror
   and speak well of its faithfulness. You may hear them say, "The man is
   a true servant of God and preaches in all honesty and courage." So far
   so good. But, alas, there are many preachers who will win no such
   praise! As I have seen glasses which have elongated my face or
   broadened it--so that it was by no means my true image--so have I known
   ministers whose description of human nature is flattering and false.
   But after all, if the face is not to be washed, to what purpose is it
   that the mirror faithfully shows the smuts and stains which are upon
   it? O my Hearers, I desire to be always faithful to you, but how will
   my faithfulness benefit you if you are not faithful to yourselves?! Why
   should I show you your blots if you do not seek the Lord Jesus to have
   them removed?

   Many of our hearers go somewhat further, for they are driven to make
   solemn resolutions after looking at themselves. Yes, they will break
   off their sins by righteousness; they will repent; they will believe on
   the Lord Jesus--and yet their firm resolves are blown away like smoke
   and come to nothing! The sight of their natural face leads to a natural
   resolve but the strength of nature suffices not to carry the resolution
   into practice. O Sirs, you must be born again! And, for lack of that
   new birth, your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew!
   Both of these soon vanish and so do

   your fine feelings and resolutions! What a multitude of dead
   resolutionss fall in this House of Prayer! The blossoms upon our fruit
   trees give great promise of a heavy crop of fruit, but, alas, the most
   of them do not knit, but drop from the tree and powder the ground as
   with snow! So the flowers of promise are upon our Hearers, but they
   come not to real soul-fruit. O Spirit of God, make it otherwise with my
   congregation! Save them from their own inconstancy! Let them not
   resolve and re-resolve and yet die in their sins!

   But what follows? Observe, "He beholds himself, and goes his way." Many
   hearers go away from what they have seen in the Word. There are two,
   "ands," in the text, following quickly one after the other, but they
   have a force which I cannot very well convey to you. They show that the
   man looks at himself hurriedly and, as it were, in passing, and so goes
   his way, straightway forgetting what manner of man he was, because his
   glance was hasty, casual and soon over. He heard the Word and that was
   the end of it--no echoes lingered in his soul. The sermon was over when
   it was over. Many a man, having seen himself in the glass of the Word,
   has no time for any further thought about himself. Tomorrow morning he
   will be over head and ears in business--the shutters will be down from
   his shop windows, but they will be put up to the windows of his soul.
   His office needs him and, therefore, his prayer closet cannot have him!
   His ledger falls like an avalanche over his Bible. The man has no time
   to seek the true riches--passing trifles monopolize his mind! Sirs, you
   call earthly things, "business," but the salvation or the damnation of
   your souls is such a biding matter that any stray hour will suffice for
   it. Is it not so? Do you not propose to put off the Lord till your last
   gasp? The Lord deliver you from this madness! Oh, that you would no
   more allow your earthly business to crush your souls!

   Others have no particular business to engross them, but, having seen
   themselves in the glass of the Word with some degree of interest, they
   go their way to their amusements. Their principal difficulty is how to
   kill time and spin the weary hours away. What will become of some of
   you who are going down to Perdition with all your time to spare? You
   will not be able to say that you went your way to your farm, or to your
   merchandise, for you have neither farm nor merchandise and do not know
   what to do with your time. And yet, for all that, you cannot spare an
   hour to think upon your souls and upon your God. Oh, that it were not
   so! May infinite mercy make men wiser than to go their way while their
   souls are going down to Hell!

   Alas, there are some who go their way to sin. It is not mere pleasure,
   or business, but it is an overt act of transgression to which they go!
   It is an awful thing, to my mind, that men go from hearing the Word of
   God to speaking the word of the devil--they go from God's House to the
   house of sin! They go straight away from the holy to the profane, from
   the pure to the foul. They go from the Mercy Seat to the seat of the
   scorner. I do not wonder that no good comes of such hearing as this!
   When a man sees his face in the glass and then goes his way to defile
   that face more and more, of what use is the glass to him? If you return
   to sin, to procrastinate, to live in willful neglect of God and
   eternity, you would derive no benefit from such hearing, though all the
   Apostles should, in turn, preach to you, or even their Master, Himself!

   This going is always followed by forgetting all they have seen. This
   forgetfulness is, indeed, very mischievous. How different is this from
   that word of David, "I will never forget Your precepts"! The wicked
   forget God, but the favored of the Lord "remember His commandments to
   do them." Forget the words of man, but be zealous to remember the Word
   of the Lord, for forgetfulness leads to inaction. Those who forget,
   forget to do! They follow not the Lord's command in the Book of
   Numbers--"Remember to do all My commandments." In Purchas' Pilgrim, we
   read of certain Spaniards of the olden time who were often pinched with
   hunger and yet immense shoals of fish passed along their shores. They
   saw the fish, but were too idle to take them! Are there not many
   Hearers of that kind? The Truth of God shines by them unappropriated,
   unused, unpracticed--and all because they take no earnest heed to make
   it their own by personal obedience to it. They say, "I go, Sir," but
   they forget to go. They see the pearl of great price, but forget to buy
   it. They are mere players with the Lord's message and never come to
   honest dealing with it.

   Forgetfulness of the Word leads to self-satisfaction. Looking in the
   glass, the man felt a little startled that he was such an ugly fellow,
   but he went his way, mingled with the crowd and forgot what manner of
   man he was and, therefore, he felt quite easy again. The sweep thinks
   he is as clean as his neighbors, for he has forgotten the soot upon his
   face. By the force of sheer ignorance a man can climb to a desperately
   false assurance of his own excellence. He can cry, "Peace, peace," when
   there is no peace, till, at last, a blast of trumpets will not alarm
   him! What can be more fatal than this? One may as well not know, as
   only learn and straightway forget!

   This forgetfulness leads to a growing carelessness. A man who has once
   looked in the glass and afterwards has not washed, is very apt to go
   and look in the glass, again, and continue in his filthiness. He who
   thinks his conscience has cried, "wolf," in mere sport, will think the
   same till he takes no heed when it cries in earnest. When men get to
   playing with the Word of God, they are near to destruction. Beware of
   hearing the Gospel as a pastime--it is the next stage to eternal ruin!
   When that which God designs to be to our salvation becomes a pastime to
   us, then, in all likelihood, that it will save us is gone. He who
   sports with Heaven and Hell will soon lose all hope of the one--and be
   hurried down to the other.

   Yes, but let me remark that this forgetfulness of the Word leads to
   increased sin, for we do not hear the Word of God without some result
   coming of it. As I am responsible for preaching, so are you for
   hearing. O unconverted Hearers, you to whom the Gospel has come as a
   revealer of yourselves, but not as a renewer of your hearts, you have
   grown harder in sin and you have sinned against more Light and against
   more knowledge--and thus your sin grows blacker!

   Thus have I sketched the hearer of the Word who is not a doer of it. I
   do not wish, personally, to apply this to anyone here, but I beg that
   every person who does not know the Lord will make a personal
   application of it to his own conscience and I pray God, the Holy
   Spirit, Himself, would now come and press these Truths upon each
   conscience. O, my dear Friends, will you not invite His sacred
   operations? You have seen your faces in the mirror of the Word--do you
   not desire to have them cleansed and beautified? You know your
   impurity--do you not wish to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus from all
   sin? Will you go your ways as if there were no Law to accuse you, no
   Gospel to invite you, no Christ to forgive you? Will you live and die
   as if there were no Heaven, no Hell, no eternity, no God? May the Lord
   deliver you from being triflers with the Word and forgetters of it,
   lest, at the end, your religion should turn out to be vain and you
   should find yourselves accursed by that which might have been a
   blessing to you!

   II. May I have your further attention while I speak upon the true and
   blessed hearer? He does not look into the glass, but he is represented
   as LOOKING INTO THE LAW--"Who looks into the perfect Law of liberty,
   and continues in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
   work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."

   The picture I have in my mind's eye at this moment is that of the
   cherubim upon the Mercy Seat--these are models for us. Their standing
   is upon the golden Mercy Seat and our standing is the Propitiation of
   our Lord--there is the resting place of our feet and, like the cherubs,
   we are joined there and, therefore, continue therein. They stand with
   their eyes looking downward upon the Mercy Seat, as if they desired to
   look into the perfect Law of God which was treasured within the ark.
   Even so do we look through the Atonement of our Lord Jesus, which is,
   to us, as pure gold like unto transparent glass, and we behold the Law,
   as a perfect Law of liberty, in the Person of our Mediator. Like the
   cherubim, we are in happy company and, like they, we look towards each
   other by mutual love. Our common standing is the Atonement; our common
   study is the Law in the Person of Christ and our common posture is that
   of angels with outstretched wings prepared to fly at the Master's
   bidding. Oh, that we might, in this sense, be as the cherubim and like
   they, abide in the secret place of the Most High, where the light is
   the Light of God and the Glory is the Divine Presence! We are not to
   look casually at the Word as though it were a mere looking glass, but
   we are to gaze earnestly upon it as our law under the New Covenant. As
   the Apostles stooped down and looked into the sepulcher, so are we to
   search diligently into the blessed Law of the Lord and delight in it
   after the inner man.

   Note well that the Law of God is worth looking into. I understand by
   the, "Law," here, not merely the Law of the Ten Commandments, but the
   Law as it is condensed, fulfilled and exhibited in Christ Jesus. The
   Gospel Law, the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, that Gospel
   which we are called upon to obey, is worthy of deep meditation! I mean
   that holy Law which the Lord has promised to put into our inward parts
   and write upon our hearts--the Law of faith and not of
   self-righteousness--even the command of Grace which bids us believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ and obey His commands. A law is always worth
   considering, for we may break the law unwittingly, and involve
   ourselves in penalties which we might have avoided. An unknown law is a
   pitfall into which a man may fall without knowing it. It is the duty of
   all loyal subjects to learn the law, that they may obey it.

   Better still, it is a perfect Law. All human laws are imperfect, but
   the Law of the Lord is perfect. The Law in the hand of Christ is
   perfect in itself, having no excess and no deficiency. And it is a Law
   which makes those perfect who obey it. It is a Law which is set forth
   in the Person of the perfect Christ and worked in us by the perfect
   Spirit. It is a Law

   which touches our whole nature and works it unto perfect beauty. Who
   would not wish to look into a Law which, like its Author, is love and
   purity itself?

   It is called the "perfect Law of liberty." Now, the Law under the Old
   Covenant genders to bondage, but the Law in the hand of Christ is
   liberty. We never walk in liberty till we walk in the Lord's commands!
   He that wears the yoke of Christ is the Lord's free man. Oh, Brothers
   and Sisters, I do trust our eyes will be turned to the "perfect Law of
   liberty," for freedom is a jewel and none have it but those who are
   conformed to the mind and will of our God!

   The true hearer looks into this perfect Law of liberty with all his
   soul, heart and understanding till he knows it and feels the force of
   it in his own character. He is the prince of hearers, who delights to
   know what God's will is and finds his joy in acting out the same. He
   sees the Law in its height of purity, breadth of comprehensiveness and
   depth of spirituality. And the more he sees, the more he admires. He
   cannot have too much of it, but meditates on it both day and night and,
   therefore, he cries, "Oh, how I love Your Law! It is my meditation all
   the day." His most frequent prayer is that he may be conformed unto
   that perfect Law in all respects. And in proportion as his prayer is
   heard, he enters into perfect rest. I pause and ask you whether you
   belong to the blessed company who look into the crystal glass of the
   Law. If you can answer that you are such, then please follow me for a
   minute or two.

   As I stand here, I look into the mirror of the Word and see myself. But
   this is not enough for me--I will look till I see more. I continue
   looking into the mystic glass until, to my great surprise, I see
   another form appearing. Evidently some mysterious Person is reflected
   in this mirror. How beautiful and majestic is the Stranger's visage! I
   look till the image of my countenance melts into the reflection of His
   countenance and He, alone, is seen. I only appear in Him. Is He not
   lovely? Indeed, He is the Chief among ten thousand! Now I see the
   meaning of that word, "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass
   the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
   glory, even as by the Spirit of the

   Lord."--

   "This is the thankful glass, That mends the looker's eyes; This is the
   well That washes what it shows."

   Surely this is the mirror that Mercy, in "The Pilgrim's Progress,"
   longed for! Does not Master Bunyan say of it, "Now the glass was one of
   a thousand. It would present a man one way, with his own features
   exactly, but turning it another way, it would show one the very face
   and similitude of the Prince of Pilgrims, Himself. Yes, I have talked
   with them that can tell and they have said that they have seen the very
   crown of thorns upon His head by looking in that glass. They have
   therein also seen the holes in His hands, in His feet and His side"?

   A man looks into the Law of liberty and he sees all perfection in
   Christ--he looks and looks till, by a strange miracle of Grace, his own
   image dissolves into the image of Jesus! Surely this is a thing worth
   looking into and infinitely superior to any looking into a glass merely
   to see yourselves! We are compelled to say, "Come, see a Word which
   tells me all things that I ever did: did not this come from God? "No,
   more! We said this at first, but now we see Jesus and we cry, "Come,
   see a Man that told me all things that I ever did: is not this the
   Christ?"

   He that looks into the perfect Law of liberty will not only see Christ,
   but he will begin to see the Eternal Spirit of God bearing witness with
   that Law of liberty and operating by that witness upon his own soul.
   "Oh," says he, "this is a blessed Law, indeed, now, for I have it
   written upon the prepared tablets of my heart!" What a sight is that
   which lets us see the Holy Spirit working in us to will and to do of
   His own good pleasure--and making us conformable to the Law of His own
   declaring!

   Yes, and he that looks into that perfect Law will, by-and-by, see God
   the Father--for the pure in heart shall see God. Those who love and
   live the Law of God become like unto God--they are "imitators of God as
   dear children." They that are familiar with God's will, love it and
   study it, gradually receive the likeness of God their Father till they
   are called the children of God! Thus the sacred Trinity are seen and
   known by those who do the will of the Father in Heaven. Is not this a
   joy, to have our fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus
   Christ? Oh, to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will
   of God!

   Dear Friends, I cannot speak to you as I should like to this
   morning--my theme masters me. I cannot make you see all that I see,
   myself, but you must look into it for yourselves in the Light of God.
   Look, and look again, till what you see

   in the Word is also to be seen in yourself. Transformation of character
   will follow upon meditation upon the Truth of God, by the blessing of
   the Holy Spirit.

   Note carefully that our text says, "He continues"--"who looks into the
   perfect Law of liberty and continues." Our translators insert the word,
   "therein," but it is not in the Greek text. "And continues"--that is,
   he continues to meditate in the Law and he continues to own his
   allegiance to it. The Law of the Lord is always Law to him. He also
   continues to practice it--he does not begin and then turn aside, but he
   continues to make advances in holy living and gracious conformity to
   the Lord's statutes--and he continues by a final perseverance to follow
   on. This is the hearer that shall win the blessing--not you who make a
   profession one day and then disgrace it the next! Not you who are all
   hot for Christ today and lukewarm tomorrow. The man who obtains the
   blessing of the Lord is, by God's Grace, made to continue in it! I have
   heard of a famous King of Poland who did brave deeds in his day and
   confessed that he owed his excellent character to a secret habit which
   he had formed. He was the son of a noble father and he carried with him
   a miniature portrait of his father and often looked upon it. Whenever
   he went to battle, he would look upon the picture of his father and
   nerve himself to valor, When he sat in the council chamber, he would
   secretly look upon the image of his father and behave himself right
   royally, for, he said, "I will do nothing that can dishonor my father's
   name."

   Now, this is the grand thing for a Christian to do, to carry with him
   the will of God in his heart, and then in every action to consult that
   will. We ought to ask--What shall I do, as a child of God? What course
   shall I follow as a man of God, bought with the precious blood of Jesus
   Christ? It is thought, by some, that you cannot always continue in the
   will of God--they dream that you are to hear a sermon and then be very
   pious--or go to a Prayer Meeting and then be very devout. But they
   think that this piety and devotion cannot remain with us all day.
   Brothers and Sisters, we must continue in the Law of the Lord or we
   have no true religion! Living godliness is for the shop, for the
   kitchen, for the parlor and for the street--it is a continuous struggle
   for holiness. Looking at the perfect will of God is for every day and
   all day! We are to believe for holiness; looking to the Lord to become
   like the Lord. I would gladly have my Savior's image painted on my
   eyeballs so that I could not see except I saw everything through Him!
   It is well to have Christ's portrait hung up in every chamber of your
   soul--I do not say of your house--that might lead to idolatry, but in
   every chamber of your mind and heart!

   I once saw a room so covered with mirrors, that when I looked, I saw
   myself some 15 times, certainly, to my taste, 14 times too often. But
   oh, I would have my whole being to be such, that whenever Jesus comes
   into it, He may see Himself everywhere--above, below, to the right, to
   the left and on all sides! Oh, to have Him shining even into the
   innermost closet of our nature so as to have no dark part! Oh, to
   become new editions of the life of Christ! We would not only look into
   the mirror, but we would be our mirrors reflecting the beauties of the
   holy Lord Jesus! But remember, this must not be occasional, but
   continual, for the true heart continues looking into the perfect Law of
   liberty.

   To conclude--you notice how it says, "this man shall be blessed in his
   deed." Mark--"this man," "this man." These demonstrative pronouns act
   like fingers. A man has gone up to the Temple to pray. What a fine
   gentleman he is! He wears a striking phylactery between his eyes and he
   boasts a broad blue hem on his garment. He is a very superior person!
   You can see that at a glance. He stands in a prominent place in the
   Temple and he most pompously cries, "God, I thank You that I am not as
   other men are." Curious that the Bible does not make much account of
   him. But yonder is a poor weeping creature who does not dare to come
   into a prominent position, nor even to lift up his eyes towards Heaven.
   Every now and then he beats upon his breast as if very much depressed.
   At last he cries, "God be merciful to me, a sinner!"

   Look! The Savior points out the publican and says, "this man--this man
   went down to his house justified rather than the other." He lays His
   hand on him as one near to Him and says, "this man." In my text there
   is a person who has seen himself in the glass and he has gone his way,
   but we need not mind about him--he is of no account. But here is a man
   who has been looking into the Law and has continued to look into
   it--and the Holy Spirit has selected him from all others and marked him
   as, "this man." This man is blessed! Perhaps he does not wear the best
   broadcloth. Perhaps he is arrayed in a fustian jacket, but he is
   selected and distinguished as, "this man!" Perhaps he has received no
   elaborate edu-cation--you will not see him at the Athenaeum, or hear
   him discussing Evolution with the learned, yet he is "this man." "This
   man," says the text, "is blessed." Where is this man? Where is this
   woman? Judge whether you are the persons thus called and
   chosen--whether you are abiding in love to that Law which has won your
   heart.

   "This man shall be blessed in his deed." "Oh," says one, "I do not see
   the blessedness of true religion!" No, my Friend, you are not likely to
   see it, because you do not do it. This man is blessed "in his deed."
   "In keeping His commandments there is great reward." Much of the
   blessedness of godliness lies in the practice of godliness. Not in
   consideration of doctrine, but the blessing lies in obedience to
   precept. "This man shall be blessed in his deed." In the very act of
   serving his Lord and Master, he shall be blessed--not for it but in it.
   The doing of the obedient deed is the evidence that God has blessed the
   doer from before the foundation of the world! His practical godliness
   is the evidence of his election; his actual holiness is the evidence of
   his redemption; his keeping close to the will of God is the evidence of
   his adoption. Holiness is the witness that its possessor shall be
   blessed in the day when Christ shall glorify His people!

   You who do not get a blessing by hearing the Gospel may now see why it
   is so. You glance into a looking glass and that is all. Much good may
   it do you! After having seen your pretty selves, you go your ways into
   the world to live as you lived before and, therefore, you get no
   blessing. If you had gone to the Divine Law, that heavenly mirror of
   the will and mind of the Most High, it had been better for you. If,
   instead of making the Word a mirror to look at, you had made it a
   window to look through--and you had seen God in Christ and perfect
   holiness in Him--and had put your trust in Jesus, He would have given
   you a higher and better life, so that you would have become like Jesus!
   Then you would have been blessed in your deed!

   Behold I set before you, this morning, as they did of old upon Ebal and
   Gerizim, blessing and curse--the curse for those who peek into the
   looking glass, but do no more--the blessing for those who attentively
   look into the perfect Law of liberty and continue to do so until they
   are transformed into the image of the Lord! Which shall it be? May God
   the Eternal Spirit decide that question by leading you, now, solemnly,
   seriously, earnestly, to close in with Christ and His perfect Law of
   liberty. And to Him be glory forever and ever! Amen and amen.

                     Coming Judgment of the Secrets of Men

   A Sermon

   (No. 1849)

   Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, July 12th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [13]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "The day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
   according to my gospel."--Romans 2:16.

   IT IS impossible for any of us to tell what it cost the apostle Paul to
   write the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans. It is a shame
   even to speak of the things which are done of the vicious in secret
   places; but Paul felt it was necessary to break through his shame, and
   to speak out concerning the hideous vices of the heathen. He has left
   on record an exposure of the sins of his day which crimsons the cheek
   of the modest when they read it, and makes both the ears of him that
   heareth it to tingle. Paul knew that this chapter would be read, not in
   his age alone, but in all ages, and that it would go into the
   households of the most pure and godly as long as the world should
   stand; and yet he deliberately wrote it, and wrote it under the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit. He knew that it must be written to put to
   shame the abominations of an age which was almost past shame. Monsters
   that revel in darkness must be dragged into the open, that they may be
   withered up by the light. After Paul has thus written in anguish he
   bethought himself of his chief comfort. While his pen was black with
   the words he had written in the first chapter, he was driven to write
   of his great delight. He clings to the gospel with a greater tenacity
   than ever. As in the verse before us he needed to mention the gospel,
   he did not speak of it as "the gospel," but as "my gospel." "God shall
   judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel." He
   felt he could not live in the midst of so depraved a people without
   holding the gospel with both hands, and grasping it as his very own.
   "My gospel," saith he. Not that Paul was the author of it, not that
   Paul had an exclusive monopoly of its blessings, but that he had so
   received it from Christ himself, and regarded himself as so responsibly
   put in trust with it, that he could not disown it even for a instant.
   So fully had he taken it into himself that he could not do less than
   call it "my gospel." In another place he speaks of "our gospel;" thus
   using a possessive pronoun, to show how believers identify themselves
   with the truth which they preach. He had a gospel, a definite form of
   truth, and he believed in it beyond all doubt; and therefore he spoke
   of it as "my gospel." Herein we hear the voice of faith, which seems to
   say, "Though others reject it, I am sure of it, and allow no shade of
   mistrust to darken my mind. To me it is glad tidings of great joy: I
   hail it as 'my gospel.' If I be called a fool for holding it, I am
   content to be a fool, and to find all my wisdom in my Lord."

   "Should all the forms that men devise Assult my faith with treacherous
   art, I'd call them vanity and lies, And bind the gospel to my heart."

   Is not this word "my gospel" the voice of love? Does he not by this
   word embrace the gospel as the only love of his soul--for the sake of
   which he had suffered the loss of all things, and did count them but
   dung--for the sake of which he was willing to stand before Nero, and
   proclaim, even in Caesar's palace, the message from heaven? Though each
   word should cost him a life, he was willing to die a thousand deaths
   for the holy cause. "My gospel," saith he, with a rapture of delight,
   as he presses to his bosom the sacred deposit of truth.

   "My gospel." Does not this show his courage? As much as to say, "I am
   not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto
   salvation to every one that believeth." He says, "my gospel," as a
   soldier speaks of "my colours," or of "my king." He resolves to bear
   this banner to victory, and to serve this royal truth even to the
   death.

   "My gospel." There is a touch of discrimination about the expression.
   Paul perceives that there are other gospels, and he makes short work
   with them, for he saith, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach
   any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
   let me be accused." The apostle was of a gentle spirit; he prayed
   heartily for the Jews who persecuted him, and yielded his life for the
   conversion of the Gentiles who maltreated him; but he had no tolerance
   for false gospellers. He exhibited great breadth of mind, and to save
   souls he became all things to all men; but when he contemplated any
   alteration or adulteration of the gospel of Christ, he thundered and
   lightninged without measure. When he feared that something else might
   spring up among the philosophers, or among the Judaizers, that should
   hide a single beam of the glorious Sun of Righteousness, he used no
   measured language; but cried concerning the author of such a darkening
   influence, "Let him be accursed." Every heart that would see men
   blessed whispers an "Amen" to the apostolic malediction. No greater
   curse can come upon mankind than the obscuration of the gospel of Jesus
   Christ. Paul saith of himself and his true brethren, "We are not as
   many, which corrupt the word of God;" and he cries to those who turned
   aside from the one and only gospel, "O foolish Galatians, who hath
   bewitched you?" Of all new doctrines he speaks as of "another gospel,
   which is not another; but there be some that trouble you."

   As for myself, looking at the matter afresh, amidst all the filthiness
   which I see in the world at this day, I lay hold upon the pure and
   blessed Word of God, and call it all the more earnestly, my
   gospel,--mine in life and mine in death, mine against all comers, mine
   for ever, God helping me: with emphasis--"my gospel."

   Now let us notice what it was that brought up this expression, "My
   gospel." What was Paul preaching about? Certainly not upon any of the
   gentle and tender themes, which we are told nowadays ought to occupy
   all our time; but he is speaking of the terrors of the law, and in that
   connection he speaks of "my gospel."

   Let us come at once to our text. It will need no dividing, for it
   divides itself. First, let us consider that on a certain day God shall
   judge mankind; secondly, on that day God will judge the secrets of men;
   thirdly, when he judges the secrets of men, it will be by Jesus Christ;
   and fourthly, this is according to gospel.

   I. We begin with the solemn truth, that ON A CERTAIN DAY GOD WILL JUDGE
   MEN. A judgment is going on daily. God is continually holding court,
   and considering the doings of the sons of men. Every evil deed that
   they do is recorded in the register of doom, and each good action is
   remembered and laid up in store by God. That judgment is reflected in a
   measure in the consciences of men. Those who know the gospel, and those
   who know it not, alike, have a certain measure of light, by which they
   know right from wrong; their consciences all the while accusing or else
   excusing them. This session of the heavenly court continues from day to
   day, like that of our local magistrates; but this does not prevent but
   rather necessitates the holding of an ultimate great assize.

   As each man passes into another world, there is an immediate judgment
   passed upon him; but this is only the foreshadowing of that which will
   take place in the end of the world.

   There is a judgment also passing upon nations, for as nations will not
   exist as nations in another world, they have to be judged and punished
   in this present state. The thoughtful reader of history will not fail
   to observe, how sternly this justice had dealt with empire after
   empire, when they have become corrupt. Colossal dominions have withered
   to the ground, when sentenced by the King of kings. Go ye and ask
   to-day, "Where is the empire of Assyria? Where are the mighty cities of
   Babylon? Where are the glories of the Medes and Persians? What has
   become of the Macedonian power? Where are the Caesars and their
   palaces?" These empires were forces established by cruelty, and used
   for oppression; they fostered luxury and licentiousness, and when they
   were no longer tolerable, the earth was purged from their polluting
   existence. Ah me! what horrors of war, bloodshed, and devastation, have
   come upon men as the result of their iniquities! The world is full of
   the monuments, both of the mercy and the justice of God: in fact the
   monuments of his justice, if rightly viewed, are proofs of his
   goodness; for it is mercy on the part of God to put an end to evil
   systems when, like a nightmare, they weigh heavily upon the bosom of
   mankind. The omnipotent, Judge has not ceased from his sovereign rule
   over kingdoms, and our own country may yet have to feel his
   chastisements. We have often laughed among ourselves at the idea of the
   New Zealander sitting on the broken arch of London Bridge amid the
   ruins of this metropolis. But is it quite so ridiculous as it looks? It
   is more than possible it will be realized if our iniquities continue to
   abound. What is there about London that it should be more enduring than
   Rome? Why should the palaces of our monarches be eternal if the palaces
   of Koyunjik have fallen? The almost boundless power of the Pharaohs has
   passed away, and Egypt has become the meanest of nations; why should
   not England come under like condemnation? What are we? What is there
   about our boastful race, whether on this side of the Atlantic or the
   other, that we should monopolize the favour of God? If we rebel, and
   sin against him, he will not hold us guiltless, but will deal out
   impartial justice to an ungrateful race.

   Still, though such judgments proceed every day, yet there is to be a
   day, a period of time, in which, in a more distinct, formal, public,
   and final manner, God will judge the sons of men. We might have guessed
   this by the light of nature and of reason. Even heathen peoples have
   had a dim notion of a day of doom; but we are not left to guess it, we
   are solemnly assured of it in the Holy Scripture. Accepting this Book
   as the revelation of God, we know beyond all doubt that a day is
   appointed in which the Lord will judge the secrets of men.

   By judging is here meant all that concerns the proceedings of trial and
   award. God will judge the race of men; that is to say, first, there
   will be a session of majesty, and the appearing of a great white
   throne, surrounded with pomp of angels and glorified beings. Then a
   summons will be issued, bidding all men come to judgment, to give in
   their final account. The heralds will fly through the realms of death,
   and summon those who sleep in the dust: for the quick and the dead
   shall all appear before that judgment-seat. John says, "I saw the dead,
   small and great, stand before God;" and he adds, "The sea gave up the
   dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which
   were in them." Those that have been so long buried that their dust is
   mingled with the soil, and has undergone a thousand transmutations,
   shall nevertheless be made to put in a personal appearance before the
   judgment-seat of Christ. What an issue will that be! You and I and all
   the myriad myriads of our race shall be gathered before the throne of
   the Son of God. Then, when all are gathered, the indictment will be
   read, and each one will be examined concerning things done in the body,
   according to that he hath done. Then the books shall be opened, and
   everything recorded there shall be read before the face of heaven.
   Every sinner shall then hear the story of his life published to his
   everlasting shame. The good shall ask no concealment, and the evil
   shall find none. Angels and men shall then see the truth of things, and
   the saints shall judge the world. Then the great Judge himself shall
   give the decision: he shall pronounce sentence upon the wicked, and
   execute their punishment. No partiality shall there be seen; there
   shall be no private conferences to secure immunity for nobles, no
   hushing up of matters, that great men may escape contempt for their
   crimes. All men shall stand before the one great judgment-bar; evidence
   shall be given concerning them all, and a righteous sentence shall go
   forth from his mouth who knows not how to flatter the great.

   This will be so, and it ought to be so: God should judge the world,
   because he is the universal ruler and sovereign. There has been a day
   for sinning, there ought to be a day for punishing; a long age of
   rebellion has been endured, and there must be a time when justice shall
   assert her supremacy. We have seen an age in which reformation has been
   commanded, in which mercy has been presented, in which expostulation
   and entreaty have been used, and there ought at last to come a day in
   which God shall judge both the quick and the dead, and measure out to
   each the final result of life. It ought to be so for the sake of the
   righteous. They have been slandered; they have been despised and
   ridiculed; worse than that, they have been imprisoned and beaten, and
   put to death times without number: the best have had the worst of it,
   and there ought to be a judgment to set these things right. Besides the
   festering iniquities of each age cry out to God that he should deal
   with them. Shall such sin go unpunished? To what end is there a moral
   government at all, and how is its continuance to be secured, if there
   be not rewards and punishments and a day of account? For the display of
   his holiness, for the overwhelming of his adversaries, for the
   rewarding of those who have faithfully served him, there must be and
   shall be a day in which God will judge the world.

   Why doth it not come at once? And when will it come? The precise day we
   cannot tell. Man nor angel knoweth that day, and it is idle and profane
   to guess at it, since even the Son of man, as such, knoweth not the
   time. It is sufficient for us that the Judgment Day will surely come;
   sufficient also to believe that it is postponed on purpose to give
   breathing time for mercy, and space for repentance. Why should the
   ungodly want to know when that day will come? What is that day to you?
   To you it should be darkness, and not light. It shall be your day of
   consuming as stubble fully dry: therefore bless the Lord that he
   delayeth his coming, and reckon that his longsuffering is for your
   salvation.

   Moreover, the Lord keeps the scaffold standing till he hath built up
   the fabric of his church. Not yet are the elect all called out from
   among the guilty sons of men; not yet are all the redeemed with blood
   redeemed with power and brought forth out of the corruption of the age
   into the holiness in which they walk with God. Therefore the Lord
   waiteth for a while. But do not deceive yourselves. The great day of
   his wrath cometh on apace, and your days of reprieve are numbered. One
   day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
   day. Ye shall die, perhaps, before the appearing of the Son of man: but
   ye shall see his judgment-seat for all that, for ye shall rise again as
   surely as he rose. When the apostle addressed the Grecian sages at
   Athens he said, "God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent,
   because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world
   in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath
   given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
   dead." See ye not, O ye impenitent ones, that a risen Saviour is the
   sign of your doom. As God hath raised Jesus from the dead, so shall he
   raise your bodies, that in these you may come to judgment. Before the
   judgment-seat shall every man and woman in this house give an account
   of the things done in the body, whether they be good or whether they be
   evil. Thus saith the Lord.

   II. Now I call your attention to the fact that "GOD WILL JUDGE THE
   SECRETS OF MEN." This will happen to all men, of every nation, of every
   age, of every rank, and of every character. The Judge will, of course,
   judge their outward acts, but these may be said to have gone before
   them to judgment: their secret acts are specially mentioned, because
   these will make judgment to be the more searching.

   By "secrets of men," the Scripture means those secret crimes which hide
   themselves away by their own infamy, which are too vile to be spoken
   of, which cause a shudder to go through a nation if they be but
   dragged, as they ought to be, into the daylight. Secret offences shall
   be brought into judgment; the deeds of the night and of the closed
   room, the acts which require the finger to be laid upon the lip, and a
   conspiracy of silence to be sworn. Revolting and shameless sins which
   must never be mentioned lest the man who committed them should be
   excluded from his fellows as an outcast, abhorred even of other
   sinners--all those shall be revealed. All that you have done, any of
   you, or are doing, if you are bearing the Christian name and yet
   practising secret sin, shall be laid bare before the universal gaze. If
   you sit here amongst the people of God, and yet where no eye sees you,
   if you are living in dishonesty, untruthfulness, or uncleanness, it
   shall all be known, and shame and confusion of face shall eternally
   cover you. Contempt shall be the inheritance to which you shall awake,
   when hypocrisy shall be no more possible. Be not deceived, God is not
   mocked; but he will bring the secrets of men into judgment.

   Specially our text refers to the hidden motives of ever action; for a
   man may do that which is right from a wrong motive, and so the deed may
   be evil in the sight of God, though it seem right in the sight of men.
   Oh, think what it will be to have your motives all brought to light, to
   have it proven that you were godly for the sake of gain, that you were
   generous out of ostentation, or zealous for love of praise, that you
   were careful in public to maintain a religious reputation, but that all
   the while everything was done for self, and self only! What a strong
   light will that be which God shall turn upon our lives, when the
   darkest chambers of human desire and motive shall be as manifest as
   public acts! What a revelation will that be which makes manifest all
   thoughts, and imaginings, and lustings, and desires! All angers, and
   envies, and prides, and rebellions of the heart--what a disclosure will
   these make!

   All the sensual desires and imaginings of even the best-regulated, what
   a foulness will these appear! What a day it will be, when the secrets
   of men shall be set in the full blaze of noon!

   God will also reveal secrets, that were secrets even to the sinners
   themselves, for there is sin in us which we have never seen, and
   iniquity in us which we have never yet discovered.

   We have managed for our own comfort's sake to blind our eyes somewhat,
   and we take care to avert our gaze from things which it is inconvenient
   to see; but we shall be compelled to see all these evils in that day,
   when the Lord shall judge the secrets of men. I do not wonder that when
   a certain Rabbi read in the book of Ecclesiastes that God shall bring
   every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good,
   or whether it be evil, he wept. It is enough to make the best men
   tremble. Were it not for thee, O Jesus, whose precious blood hath
   cleansed us from all sin, where should we be! Were it not for thy
   righteousness, which shall cover those who believe in thee, who among
   us could endure the thought of that tremendous day? In thee, O Jesus,
   we are made righteous, and therefore we fear not the trial-hour; but
   were it not for thee our hearts would fail us for fear!

   Now if you ask me why God should judge, especially the secrets of
   men--since this is not done in human courts, and cannot be, for secret
   things of this kind come not under cognizance of our short-sighted
   tribunals--I answer it is because there is really nothing secret from
   God. We make a difference between secret and public sins, but he doth
   not; for all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we
   have to do. All deeds are done in the immediate presence of God, who is
   personally present everywhere. He knows and sees all things as one upon
   the spot, and every secret sin is but conceived to be secret through
   the deluded fantasy of our ignorance. God sees more of a secret sin
   than a man can see of that which is done before his face. "Can any hide
   himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord."

   The secrets of men will be judged because often the greatest of moral
   acts are done in secret. The brightest deeds that God delights in are
   those that are done by his servants when they have shut the door and
   are alone with him; when they have no motive but to please him; when
   they studiously avoid publicity, lest they should be turned aside by
   the praise of men; when the right hand knoweth not what the left hand
   doeth, and the loving, generous heart deviseth liberal things, and
   doeth it behind the screen, so that it should never be discovered how
   the deed was done. It were a pity that such deeds should be left out at
   the great audit. Thus, too, secret vices are also of the very blackest
   kind, and to exempt them were to let the worst of sinners go
   unpunished. Shall it be that these polluted things shall escape because
   they have purchased silence with their wealth? I say solemnly "God
   forbid." He does forbid it: what they have done in secret, shall be
   proclaimed upon the house-tops.

   Besides, the secret things of men enter into the very essence of their
   actions. An action is, after all, good or bad very much according to
   its motive. It may seem good, but the motive may taint it; and so, if
   God did not judge the secret part of the action he would not judge
   righteously. He will weigh our actions, and detect the design which led
   to them, and the spirit which prompted them.

   Is it not certainly true that the secret thing is the best evidence of
   the man's condition? Many a man will not do in public that which would
   bring him shame; not because he is black-hearted enough for it, but
   because he is too much of a coward. That which a man does when he
   thinks that he is entirely by himself is the best revelation of the
   man. That which thou wilt not do because it would be told of thee if
   thou didst ill, is a poor index of thy real character. That which thou
   wilt do because thou wilt be praised for doing well, is an equally
   faint test of thy heart. Such virtue is mere self-seeking, or
   mean-spirited subservience to thy fellow-man; but that which thou doest
   out of respect to no authority but thine own conscience and thy God;
   that which thou doest unobserved, without regard to what man will say
   concerning it--that it is which reveals thee, and discovers thy real
   soul. Hence God lays a special stress and emphasis upon the fact that
   he will in that day judge "the secrets" of men by Jesus Christ.

   Oh, friends, if it does not make you tremble to think of these things,
   it ought to do so. I feel the deep responsibility of preaching upon
   such matters, and I pray God of his infinite mercy to apply these
   truths to our hearts, that they may be forceful upon our lives. These
   truths ought to startle us, but I am afraid we hear them with small
   result; we have grown familiar with them, and they do not penetrate us
   as they should. We have to deal, brethren, with an omniscient God; with
   One who once knowing never forgets; with One to whom all things are
   always present; with One will conceal nothing out of fear, or favour of
   any man's person; with One who will shortly bring the splendour of his
   omniscience and the impartiality of his justice to bear upon all human
   lives. God help us, where'er we rove and where'er we rest, to remember
   that each thought, word, and act of each moment lies in that fierce
   light which beats upon all things from the throne of God.

   III. Another solemn revelation of our text lies in this fact, that "GOD
   WILL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN BY JESUS CHRIST." He that will sit upon
   the throne as the Vice-regent of God, and as a Judge, acting for God,
   will be Jesus Christ. What a name for a Judge! The
   Saviour-Anointed--Jesus Christ: he is to be the judge of all mankind.
   Our Redeemer will be the Umpire of our destiny.

   This will be, I doubt not, first for the display of his glory. What a
   difference there will be then between the babe of Bethlehem's manger,
   hunted by Herod, carried down by night into Egypt for shelter, and the
   King of kings and Lord of lords, before whom every knee must bow! What
   a difference between the weary man and full of woes, and he that shall
   then be grit with glory, sitting on a throne encircled with a rainbow!
   From the derision of men to the throne of universal judgment, what an
   ascent! I am unable to convey to you my own heart's sense of the
   contrast between the "despised and rejected of men," and the
   universally-acknowledged Lord, before whom Caesars and pontiffs shall
   bow into the dust. He who was judged at Pilate's bar, shall summon all
   to his bar. What a change from the shame and spitting, from the nails
   and the wounds, the mockery and the thirst, and the dying anguish, to
   the glory in which he shall come whose eyes are as a flame of fire, and
   out of whose mouth there goeth a two-edged sword! He shall judge the
   nations, even he whom the nations abhorred. He shall break them in
   pieces like a potter's vessel, even those who cast him out as unworthy
   to live among them. Oh, how we ought to bow before him now as he
   reveals himself in his tender sympathy, and in his generous
   humiliation! Let us kiss the Son lest he be angry; let us yield to his
   grace, that we may not be crushed by his wrath. Ye sinners, bow before
   those pierced feet, which else will tread you like clusters in the
   wine-press. Look ye up to him with weeping, and confess your
   forgetfulness of him, and put your trust in him; lest he look down on
   you in indignation. Oh, remember that he will one day say, "But those
   mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring
   hither, and slay them before me." The holding of the judgment by the
   Lord Jesus will greatly enhance his glory. It will finally settle one
   controversy which is still upheld by certain erroneous spirits: there
   will be no doubt about our Lord's deity in that day: there will be no
   question that this same Jesus who was crucified is both Lord and God.
   God himself shall judge, but he shall perform the judgment in the
   person of his Son Jesus Christ, truly man, but nevertheless most truly
   God. Being God he is divinely qualified to judge the world in
   righteousness, and the people with his truth.

   If you ask again, Why is the Son of God chosen to be the final Judge? I
   could give as a further answer that he receives this high office not
   only as a reward for all his pains, and as a manifestation of his
   glory, but also because men have been under his mediatorial sway, and
   he is their Governor and King. At the present moment we are all under
   the sway of the Prince Immanuel, God with us: we have been placed by an
   act of divine clemency, not under the immediate government of an
   offended God, but under the reconciling rule of the Prince of Peace.
   "All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth." "The Father
   judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all
   men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." We are
   commanded to preach unto the people, and "to testify that it is he
   which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead." (Acts
   10:42) Jesus is our Lord and King, and it is meet that he should
   conclude his mediatorial sovereignty by rewarding his subjects to their
   deeds.

   But I have somewhat to say unto you which ought to reach your hearts,
   even if other thoughts have not done so. I think that God hath chosen
   Christ, the man Christ Jesus, to judge the world that there may never
   be a cavil raised concerning that judgment. Men shall not be able to
   say--We were judged by a superior being who did not know our weaknesses
   and temptations, and therefore he judged us harshly, and without a
   generous consideration of our condition. No, God shall judge the
   secrets of men by Jesus Christ, who was tempted in all points like as
   we are, yet without sin. He is our brother, bone of our bone, flesh of
   our flesh, partaker of our humanity, and therefore understands and
   knows what is in men. He has shown himself to be skilful in all the
   surgery of mercy throughout the ages, and at last he will be found
   equally skilful in dissecting motives and revealing the thoughts and
   intents of the heart. Nobody shall ever be able to look back on that
   august tribunal and say that he who sat upon it was too stern, because
   he knew nothing of human weakness. It will be the loving Christ, whose
   tears, and bloody sweat, and gaping wounds, attest his brotherhood with
   mankind; and it will be clear to all intelligences that however dread
   his sentences, he could not be unmerciful. God shall judge us by Jesus
   Christ, that the judgment may be indisputable.

   But harken well--for I speak with a great weight upon my soul--this
   judgment by Jesus Christ, puts beyond possibility all hope of any
   after-interposition. If the Saviour condemns, and such a Saviour, who
   can plead for us? The owner of the vineyard was about to cut down the
   barren tree, when the dresser of the vineyard pleaded, "Let it alone
   this year also;" but what can come of that tree when that vinedresser
   himself shall say to the master, "It must fall; I myself must cut it
   down!" If your Saviour shall become your judge you will be judged
   indeed. If he shall say, "Depart, ye cursed," who can call you back? If
   he that bled to save men at last comes to this conclusion, that there
   is no more to be done, but they must be driven from his presence, then
   farewell hope. To the guilty the judgment will indeed be a

   "Great day of dread, decision, and despair."

   An infinite horror shall seize upon their spirits as the words of the
   loving Christ shall freeze their very marrow, and fix them in the ice
   of eternal despair. There is, to my mind, a climax of solemnity in the
   fact that God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.

   Does not this also show how certain the sentence will be? for this
   Christ of God is too much in earnest to play with men. If he says,
   "Come, ye blessed," he will not fail to bring them to their
   inheritance. If he be driven to say, "Depart, ye cursed," he will see
   it done, and into the everlasting punishment they must go. Even when it
   cost him his life he did not draw back from doing the will of his
   Father, nor will he shrink in that day when he shall pronounce the
   sentence of doom. Oh, how evil must sin be since it constrains the
   tender Saviour to pronounce sentence of eternal woe! I am sure that
   many of us have been driven of late to an increased hatred of sin; our
   souls have recoiled within us because of the wickedness among which we
   dwell; it has made us feel as if we would fain borrow the Almighty's
   thunderbolts with which to smite iniquity. Such haste on our part may
   not be seemly, since it implies a complaint against divine
   long-suffering; but Christ's dealing with evil will be calm and
   dispassionate, and all the more crushing. Jesus, with his pierced hand,
   that bears the attestation of his supreme love to men, shall wave the
   impenitent away; and those lips which bade the weary rest in him shall
   solemnly say to the wicked, "Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire
   prepared for the devil and his angels." To be trampled beneath the foot
   which was nailed to the cross will be to be crushed indeed: yet so it
   is, God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.

   It seems to me as if God in this intended to give a display of the
   unity of all his perfections. In this same man, Christ Jesus, the Son
   of God, you behold justice and love, mercy and righteousness, combined
   in equal measure. He turns to the right, and says, "Come, ye blessed,"
   with infinite suavity; and with the same lip, as he glances to the
   left, he says, "Depart, ye cursed." Men will then see at one glance how
   love and righteousness are one, and how they meet in equal splendour in
   the person of the Well-beloved, whom God has therefore chosen to be
   Judge of quick and dead.

   IV. I have done when you have borne with me a minute or two upon my
   next point, which is this: and ALL THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL.
   That is to say, there is nothing in the gospel contrary to the solemn
   teaching. Men gather to us, to hear us preach of infinite mercy, and
   tell of the love that blots out sin; and our task is joyful when we are
   called to deliver such a message; but oh, sirs, remember that nothing
   in our message makes light of sin. The gospel offers you no opportunity
   of going on in sin, and escaping without punishment. Its own cry is,
   "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." Jesus has not come
   into the world to make sin less terrible. Nothing in the gospel excuses
   sin; nothing in it affords toleration for lust or anger, or dishonesty,
   or falsehood. The gospel is as truly a two-edged sword against sin, as
   ever the law can be. There is grace for the man who quits his sin, but
   there is tribulation and wrath upon every man that doeth evil. "If ye
   turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it
   ready." The gospel is all tenderness to the repenting, but all terror
   to the obstinate offender. It has pardon for the very chief of sinners,
   and mercy for the vilest of the vile, if they will forsake their sins;
   but it is according to our gospel that he that goeth on in his
   iniquity, shall be cast into hell, and he that believeth not shall be
   damned. With deep love to the souls of men, I bear witness to the truth
   that he who turns not with repentance and faith to Christ, shall go
   away into punishment as everlasting as the life of the righteous. This
   is according to our gospel: indeed, we had not needed such a gospel, if
   there had not been such a judgment. The background of the cross is the
   judgment-seat of Christ. We had not needed so great an atonement, so
   vast a sacrifice, if there had not been an exceeding sinfulness in sin,
   an exceeding justice in the judgment, and an exceeding terror in the
   sure rewards of transgression.

   "According to my gospel," saith Paul; and he meant that the judgment is
   an essential part of the gospel creed. If I had to sum up the gospel I
   should have to tell you certain facts: Jesus, the Son of God, became
   man; he was born of the virgin Mary; lived a perfect life; was falsely
   accused of men; was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose
   again from the dead; he ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right
   hand of God; from whence he shall also come to judge the quick and the
   dead. This is one of the elementary truths of our gospel; we believe in
   the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment, and the life
   everlasting.

   The judgment is according to our gospel, and in times of righteous
   indignation its terrible significance seemeth a very gospel to the pure
   in heart. I mean this. I have read this and that concerning oppression,
   slavery, the treading down of the poor, and the shedding of blood, and
   I have rejoiced that there is a righteous Judge. I have read of secret
   wickednesses among the rich men of this city, and I have said within
   myself, "Thank God, there will be a judgment day." Thousands of men
   have been hanged for much less crimes than those which now disgrace
   gentlemen whose names are on the lips of rank and beauty. Ah me, how
   heavy is our heart as we think of it! It has come like a gospel to us
   that the Lord will be revealed in flaming fire, taking vengeance on
   them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. (2 Thess. 1:8) The secret wickedness of London cannot go on for
   ever. Even they that love men best, and most desire salvation for them,
   cannot but cry to God, "How long! How long! Great God, wilt thou for
   ever endure this?" God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the
   world, and we sigh and cry until it shall end the reign of wickedness,
   and give rest to the oppressed. Brethren, we must preach the coming of
   the Lord, and preach it somewhat more than we have done; because it is
   the driving power of the gospel. Too many have kept back these truths,
   and thus the bone has been taken out of the arm of the gospel. Its
   point has been broken; its edge has been blunted. The doctrine of
   judgment to come is the power by which men are to be aroused. There is
   another life; the Lord will come a second time; judgment will arrive;
   the wrath of God will be revealed. Where this is not preached, I am
   bold to say the gospel is not preached. It is absolutely necessary to
   the preaching of the gospel of Christ that men be warned as to what
   will happen if they continue in their sins. Ho, ho, sir surgeon, you
   are too delicate to tell the man that he is ill! You hope to heal the
   sick without their knowing it. You therefore flatter them; and what
   happens? They laugh at you; they dance upon their own graves. At last
   they die! Your delicacy is cruelty; your flatteries are poisons; you
   are a murderer. Shall we keep men in a fool's paradise? Shall we lull
   them into soft slumbers from which they will awake in hell? Are we to
   become helpers of their damnation by our smooth speeches? In the name
   of God we will not. It becomes every true minister of Christ to cry
   aloud and spare not, for God hath set a day in which he will "judge the
   secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel." As surely as
   Paul's gospel was true the judgment will come. Wherefore flee to Jesus
   this day, O sinners. O ye saints, come hide yourselves again beneath
   the crimson canopy of the atoning sacrifice, that you may be now ready
   to welcome your descending Lord and escort him to his judgment-seat. O
   my hearers, may God bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                               Immeasurable Love

   A Sermon

   (No. 1850)

   Intended for reading on Lord's-Day, July 26th, 1885,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [14]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,

   On the evening of June 7th, 1885

   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life."--John 3:16

   I WAS very greatly surprised the other day, in looking over the list of
   texts from which I have preached, to find that I have no record of ever
   having spoken from this verse. This is all the more singular, because I
   can truly say that it might be put in the forefront of all my volumes
   of discourses as the sole topic of my life's ministry. It has been my
   one and only business to set forth the love of God to men in Christ
   Jesus. I heard lately of an aged minister of whom it was said,
   "Whatever his text, he never failed to set forth God as love, and
   Christ as the atonement for sin." I wish that much the same may be said
   of me. My heart's desire has been to sound forth as with a trumpet the
   good news that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life."

   We are about to meet around the communion table, and I cannot preach
   from this text anything but a simple gospel sermon. Can you desire a
   better preparation for communion? We have fellowship with God and with
   one another upon the basis of the infinite love which is displayed in
   Jesus Christ our Lord. The gospel is the fair white linen cloth which
   covers the table on which the Communion Feast is set. The higher
   truths, those truths which belong to a more enlightened experience,
   those richer truths which tell of the fellowship of the higher
   life--all these are helpful to holy fellowship; but I am sure not more
   so than those elementary and foundation truths which were the means of
   our first entrance into the kingdom of God. Babes in Christ and men in
   Christ here feed upon one common food. Come, ye aged saints, be
   children again; and you that have long known your Lord, take up your
   first spelling-book, and go over your A B C again, by learning that God
   so loved the world, that he gave his Son to die, that man might live
   through him. I do not call you to an elementary lesson because you have
   forgotten your letters, but because it is a good thing to refresh the
   memory, and a blessed thing to feel young again. What the old folks
   used to call the Christ-cross Row contained nothing but the letters;
   and yet all the books in the language are made out of that line:
   therefore do I call you back to the cross, and to him who bled thereon.
   It is a good things for us all to return at times to our starting
   place, and make sure that we are in the way everlasting. The love of
   our espousals is most likely to continue if we again and again begin
   where God began with us, and where we first began with God. It is wise
   to come to him afresh, as we came in that first day when, helpless,
   needy, heavy-laden, we stood weeping at the cross, and left our burden
   at the pierced feet. There we learned to look, and live, and love; and
   there would we repeat the lesson till we rehearse it perfectly in
   glory.

   To-night, we have to talk about the love of God: "God so loved the
   world." That love of God is a very wonderful thing, especially when we
   see it set upon a lost, ruined, guilty world. What was there in the
   world that God should love it? There was nothing lovable in it. No
   fragrant flower grew in that arid desert. Enmity to him, hatred to his
   truth, disregard of his law, rebellion against his commandments; those
   were the thorns and briars which covered the waste land; but no
   desirable thing blossomed there. Yet, "God loved the world," says the
   text; "so" loved it, that even the writer of the book of John could not
   tell us how much; but so greatly, so divinely, did he love it that he
   gave his Son, his only Son, to redeem the world from perishing, and to
   gather out of it a people to his praise.

   Whence came that love? Not from anything outside of God himself. God's
   love springs from himself. He loves because it is his nature to do so.
   "God is love." As I have said already, nothing upon the face of the
   earth could have merited his love, though there was much to merit his
   displeasure. This stream of love flows from its own secret source in
   the eternal Deity, and it owes nothing to any earth-born rain or
   rivulet; it springs from beneath the everlasting throne, and fills
   itself full from the springs of the infinite. God loved because he
   would love. When we enquire why the Lord loved this man or that, we
   have to come back to our Saviour's answer to the question, "Even so,
   Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." God has such love in his
   nature that he must needs let it flow forth to a world perishing by its
   own wilful sin; and when it flowed forth it was so deep, so wide, so
   strong, that even inspiration could not compute its measure, and
   therefore the Holy Spirit gave us that great little word SO, and left
   us to attempt the measurement, according as we perceive more and more
   of love divine.

   Now, there happened to be an occasion upon which the great God could
   display his immeasurable love. The world had sadly gone astray; the
   world had lost itself; the world was tried and condemned; the world was
   given over to perish, because of its offenses; and there was need for
   help. The fall of Adam and the destruction of mankind made ample room
   and verge enough for love almighty. Amid the ruins of humanity there
   was space for showing how much Jehovah loved the sons of men; for the
   compass of his love was no less than the world, the object of it no
   less than to deliver men from going down to the pit, and the result of
   it no less than the finding of a ransom for them. The far-reaching
   purpose of that love was both negative and positive; that, believing in
   Jesus, men might not perish, but have eternal life. The desperate
   disease of man gave occasion for the introduction of that divine remedy
   which God alone could have devised and supplied. By the plan of mercy,
   and the great gift which was needed for carrying it out, the Lord found
   means to display his boundless love to guilty men. Had there been no
   fall, and no perishing, God might have shown his love to us as he does
   to the pure and perfect spirits that surround his throne; but he never
   could have commended his love to us to such an extent as he now does.
   In the gift of his only-begotten Son, God commended his love to us, in
   that while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly. The black background of sin makes the bright line of love
   shine out the more clearly. When the lightning writes the name of the
   Lord with flaming finger across the black brow of the tempest, we are
   compelled to see it; so when love inscribes the cross upon the jet
   tablet of our sin, even blind eyes must see that "herein is love."

   I might handle my text in a thousand different ways to-night; but for
   simplicity's sake, and to keep to the one point of setting forth the
   love of God, I want to make you see how great that love is by five
   different particulars.

   I. The first is the GIFT: "God so loved the world, that he gave his
   only begotten Son." Consider, then, what this gift was that God gave. I
   should have to labour for expression if I were to attempt to set forth
   to the full this priceless boon; and I will not court a failure by
   attempting the impossible. I will only invite you to think of the
   sacred Person whom the Great Father gave in order that he might prove
   his love to men. It was his only-begotten Son--his beloved Son, in whom
   he was well pleased. None of us had ever such a son to give. Ours are
   the sons of men; his was the Son of God. The Father gave his other
   self, one with himself. When the great God gave his Son he gave God
   himself, for Jesus is not in his eternal nature less than God. When God
   gave God for us he gave himself. What more could he give? God gave his
   all: he gave himself. Who can measure this love?

   Judge, ye fathers, how ye love your sons: could ye give them to die for
   your enemy? Judge, ye that have an only son, how your hearts are
   entwined about your first-born, your only-begotten. There was no higher
   proof of Abraham's love to God than when he did not withhold from God
   his son, his only son, his Isaac whom he loved; and there can certainly
   be no greater display of love than for the Eternal Father to give his
   only-begotten Son to die for us. No living thing will readily lose its
   offspring; man has peculiar grief when his son is taken; has not God
   yet more? A story has often been told of the fondness of parents for
   their children how in a famine in the East a father and mother were
   reduced to absolute starvation, and the only possibility of preserving
   the life of the family was to sell one of the children into slavery. So
   they considered it. The pinch of hunger became unbearable, and their
   children pleading for bread tugged so painfully at their heart-strings,
   that they must entertain the idea of selling one to save the lives of
   the rest. They had four sons. Who of these should be sold? It must not
   be the first: how could they spare their first-born? The second was so
   strangely like his father that he seemed a reproduction of him, and the
   mother said that she would never part with him. The third was so
   singularly like the mother that the father said he would sooner die
   than that this dear boy should go into bondage; and as for the fourth,
   he was their Benjamin, their last, their darling, and they could not
   part with him. They concluded that it were better for them all to die
   together than willingly to part with any one of their children. Do you
   not sympathize with them? I see you do. Yet God so loved us that, to
   put it very strongly, he seemed to love us better than his only Son,
   and did not spare him that he might spare us. He permitted his Son to
   perish from among men "that whosoever believeth in him might not
   perish, but have everlasting life."

   If you desire to see the love of God in this great procedure you must
   consider how he gave his Son. He did not give his Son, as you might do,
   to some profession in the pursuit of which you might still enjoy his
   company; but he gave his Son to exile among men. He sent him down to
   yonder manger, united with a perfect manhood, which at the first was in
   an infant's form. There he slept, where horned oxen fed! The Lord God
   sent the heir of all things to toil in a carpenter's shop: to drive the
   nail, and push the plane, and use the saw. He sent him down amongst
   scribes and Pharisees, whose cunning eyes watched him, and whose cruel
   tongues scourged him with base slanders. He sent him down to hunger,
   and thirst, amid poverty so dire that he had not where to lay his head.
   He sent him down to the scourging and the crowning with thorns, to the
   giving of his back to the smiters and his cheeks to those that plucked
   off the hair. At length he gave him up to death--a felon's death, the
   death of the crucified. Behold that cross and see the anguish of him
   that dies upon it, and mark how the Father has so given him, that he
   hides his face from him, and seems as if he would not own him! "Lama
   sabachthani" tells us how fully God gave his Son to ransom the souls of
   the sinful. He gave him to be made a curse for us; gave him that he
   might die "the just for the unjust, to bring us to God."

   Dear sirs, I can understand your giving up your children to go to India
   on her Majesty's service, or to go out to the Cameroons or the Congo
   upon the errands of our Lord Jesus. I can well comprehend your yielding
   them up even with the fear of a pestilential climate before you, for if
   they die they will die honourably in a glorious cause; but could you
   think of parting with them to die a felon's death, upon a gibbet,
   execrated by those whom they sought to bless, stripped naked in body
   and deserted in mind? Would not that be too much? Would you not cry, "I
   cannot part with my son for such wretches as these. Why should he be
   put to a cruel death for such abominable beings, who even wash their
   hands in the blood of their best friend"? Remember that our Lord Jesus
   died what his countrymen considered to be an accursed death. To the
   Romans it was the death of a condemned slave, a death which had all the
   elements of pain, disgrace, and scorn mingled in it to the uttermost.
   "But God commendeth his love to- ward us, in that, while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us." Oh, wondrous stretch of love, that Jesus
   Christ should die!

   Yet, I cannot leave this point till I have you notice when God gave his
   Son, for there is love in the time. "God so loved the world that he
   gave his Only Begotten Son." But when did he do that? In his eternal
   purpose he did this from before the foundation of the world. The words
   here used, "He gave his Only Begotten Son," cannot relate exclusively
   to the death of Christ, for Christ was not dead at the time of the
   utterance of this third chapter of John. Our Lord had just been
   speaking with Nicodemus, and that conversation took place at the
   beginning of his ministry. The fact is that Jesus was always the gift
   of God. The promise of Jesus was made in the garden of Eden almost as
   soon as Adam fell. On the spot where our ruin was accomplished, a
   Deliverer was bestowed whose heel should be bruised, but who should
   break the serpent's head beneath his foot.

   Throughout the ages the great Father stood to his gift. He looked upon
   his Only Begotten as man's hope, the inheritance of the chosen seed,
   who in him would possess all things. Every sacrifice was God's renewal
   of his gift of grace, a reassurance that he had bestowed the gift, and
   would never draw back therefrom. The whole system of types under the
   law betokened that in the fulness of time the Lord would in very deed
   give up his Son, to be born of a woman, to bear the iniquities of his
   people, and to die the death in their behalf. I greatly admire this
   pertinacity of love; for many a man in a moment of generous excitement
   can perform a supreme act of benevolence, and yet could not bear to
   look at it calmly, and consider it from year to year; the slow fire of
   anticipation would have been unbearable. If the Lord should take away
   yonder dear boy from his mother, she would bear the blow with some
   measure of patience, heavy as it would be to her tender heart; but
   suppose that she were credibly informed that on such a day her boy must
   die, and thus had from year to year to look upon him as one dead, would
   it not cast a cloud over every hour of her future life? Suppose also
   that she knew that he would be hanged upon a tree to die, as one
   condemned; would it not embitter her existence? If she could withdraw
   from such a trial, would she not? Assuredly she would. Yet the Lord God
   spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for us all, doing
   it in his heart from age, to age. Herein is love: love which many
   waters could not quench: love eternal, inconceivable, infinite!

   Now, as this gift refers not only to our Lord's death, but to the ages
   before it, so it includes also all the ages afterwards. God "so loved
   the world that he gave"--and still gives--"his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting
   life." The Lord is giving Christ away to-night. Oh, that thousands of
   you may gladly accept the gift unspeakable! Will anyone refuse? This
   good gift, this perfect gift,--can you decline it? Oh, that you may
   have faith to lay hold on Jesus, for thus he will be yours. He is God's
   free gift to all free receivers; a full Christ for empty sinners. If
   you can but hold out your empty willing hand, the Lord will give Christ
   to you at this moment. Nothing is freer than a gift. Nothing is more
   worth having than a gift which comes fresh from the hand of God, as
   full of effectual power as ever it was. The fountain is eternal, but
   the stream from it is as fresh as when first the fountain was opened.
   There is no exhausting this gift.

   "Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood

   Shall never lose it power

   Till all the ransomed church of God

   Be saved to sin no more."

   See, then, what is the love of God, that he gave his Son from of old,
   and has never revoked the gift. He stands to his gift, and continues
   still to give his dear Son to all who are willing to accept him. Out of
   the riches of his grace he has given, is giving, and will give the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and all the priceless gifts which are contained in him,
   to all needy sinners who will simply trust him.

   I call upon you from this first point to admire the love of God,
   because of the transcendent greatness of his gift to the world, even
   the gift of his only begotten Son.

   II. Now notice secondly, and, I think I may say, with equal admiration,
   the love of God in THE PLAN OF SALVATION. He has put it thus: "that
   whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." The way of salvation is extremely simple to understand, and
   exceedingly easy to practise, when once the heart is made willing and
   obedient. The method of the covenant of grace differs as much from that
   of the covenant of works as light from darkness. It is not said that
   God has given his Son to all who will keep his law, for that we could
   not do, and therefore the gift would have been available to none of us.
   Nor is it said that he has given his Son to all that experience
   terrible despair and bitter remorse, for that is not felt by many who
   nevertheless are the Lord's own people. But the great God has given his
   own Son, that "whosoever believeth in him" should not perish. Faith,
   however slender, saves the soul. Trust in Christ is the certain way of
   eternal happiness.

   Now, what is it to believe in Jesus? It is just this: it is to trust
   yourself with him. If your hearts are ready, though you have never
   believed in Jesus before, I trust you will believe in him now. O Holy
   Spirit graciously make it so.

   What is it to believe in Jesus?

   It is, first, to give your firm and cordial assent to the truth, that
   God did send his Son, born of a woman, to stand in the room and stead
   of guilty men, and that God did cause to meet on him the iniquities of
   us all, so that he bore the punishment due to our transgressions, being
   made a curse for us. We must heartily believe the Scripture which
   saith,--"the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
   stripes ye are healed." I ask for your assent to the grand doctrine of
   substitution, which is the marrow of the gospel. Oh, may God the Holy
   Spirit lead you to give a cordial assent to it at once; for wonderful
   as it is, it is a fact that God was in Christ reconciling the world
   unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. Oh that you may
   rejoice that this is true, and be thankful that such a blessed fact is
   revealed by God himself. Believe that the substitution of the Son of
   God is certain; cavil not at the plan, nor question its validity, or
   efficacy, as many do. Alas! they kick at God's great sacrifice, and
   count it a sorry invention. As for me, since God has ordained to save
   man by a substitutionary sacrifice, I joyfully agree to his method, and
   see no reason to do anything else but admire it and adore the Author of
   it. I joy and rejoice that such a plan should have been thought of,
   whereby the justice of God is vindicated, and his mercy is set free to
   do all that he desires. Sin is punished in the person of the Christ,
   yet mercy is extended to the guilty. In Christ mercy is sustained by
   justice, and justice satisfied by an act of mercy. The worldly wise say
   hard things about this device of infinite wisdom; but as for me, I love
   the very name of the cross, and count it to be the centre of wisdom,
   the focus of love, the heart of righteousness. This is a main point of
   faith--to give a hearty assent to the giving of Jesus to suffer in our
   place and stead, to agree with all our soul and mind to this way of
   salvation.

   The second thing is that you do accept this for yourself. In Adam's
   sin, you did not sin personally, for you were not then in existence;
   yet you fell; neither can you now complain thereof, for you have
   willingly endorsed and adopted Adam's sin by committing personal
   transgressions. You have laid your hand, as it were, upon Adam's sin,
   and made it your own, by committing personal and actual sin. Thus you
   perished by the sin of another, which you adopted and endorsed; and in
   like manner must you be saved by the righteousness of another, which
   you are to accept and appropriate. Jesus has offered an atonement, and
   that atonement becomes yours when you accept it by putting your trust
   in him. I want you now to say,

   "My faith doth lay her hand

   On that dear head of thine,

   While, like a penitent, I stand,

   And here confess my sin."

   Surely this is no very difficult matter. To say that Christ who hung
   upon the cross shall be my Christ, my surety, needs neither stretch of
   intellect, nor splendor of character; and yet it is the act which
   brings salvation to the soul.

   One thing more is needful; and that is personal trust. First comes
   assent to the truth, then acceptance of that truth for yourself, and
   then a simple trusting of yourself wholly to Christ, as a substitute.
   The essence of faith is trust, reliance, dependence. Fling away every
   other confidence of every sort, save confidence in Jesus. Do not allow
   a ghost of a shade of a shadow of a confidence in anything that you can
   do, or in anything that you can be; but look alone to him whom God has
   set forth to be the propitiation for sin. This I do at this very
   moment; will you not do the same? Oh, may the sweet Spirit of God lead
   you now to trust in Jesus!

   See, then, the love of God in putting it in so plain, so easy a way.
   Oh, thou broken, crushed and despairing sinner, thou canst not work,
   but canst thou not believe that which is true? Thou canst not sigh;
   thou canst not cry; thou canst not melt thy stony heart; but canst thou
   not believe that Jesus died for thee, and that he can change that heart
   of thine and make thee a new creature? If thou canst believe this, then
   trust in Jesus to do so, and thou art saved; for he that believes in
   him is justified. "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life." He
   is a saved man. His sins are forgiven him. Let him go his way in peace,
   and sin no more.

   I admire, first, the love of God in the great gift, and then in the
   great plan by which that gift becomes available to guilty men.

   III. Thirdly, the love of God shines forth with transcendent brightness
   in a third point, namely, in THE PERSONS FOR WHOM THIS PLAN IS
   AVAILABLE, and for whom this gift is given. They are described in these
   words--"Whosoever believeth in him." There is in the text a word which
   has no limit--"God so loved the world"; but then comes in the
   descriptive limit, which I beg you to notice with care: "He gave his
   Only Begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him might not perish."
   God did not so love the world that any man who does not believe in
   Christ shall be saved; neither did God so give his Son that any man
   shall be saved who refuses to believe in him. See how it is put--"God
   so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth in him should not perish." Here is the compass of the love:
   while every unbeliever is excluded, every believer is included.
   "Whosoever believeth in him." Suppose there be a man who has been
   guilty of all the lusts of the flesh to an infamous degree, suppose
   that he is so detestable that he is only fit to be treated like a moral
   leper, and shut up in a separate house for fear he should contaminate
   those who hear or see him; yet if that man shall believe in Jesus
   Christ, he shall at once be made clean from his defilement, and shall
   not perish because of his sin. And suppose there be another man who, in
   the pursuit of his selfish motives, has ground down the poor, has
   robbed his fellow-traders, and has even gone so far as to commit actual
   crime of which the law has taken cognisance, yet if he believes in the
   Lord Jesus Christ he shall be led to make restitution, and his sins
   shall be forgiven him. I once heard of a preacher addressing a company
   of men in chains, condemned to die for murder and other crimes. They
   were such a drove of beasts to all outward appearances that it seemed
   hopeless to preach to them; yet were I set to be chaplain to such a
   wretched company I should not hesitate to tell them that "God so loved
   the world, that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." O man, if thou
   wilt believe in Jesus as the Christ, however horrible thy past sins
   have been they shall be blotted out; thou shalt be saved from the power
   of thine evil habits; and thou shalt begin again like a child newborn,
   with a new and true life, which God shall give thee. "Whosoever
   believeth in him,"--that takes you in, my aged friend, now lingering
   within a few tottering steps of the grave. O grey-headed sinner, if you
   believe in him, you shall not perish. The text also includes you, dear
   boy, who have scarcely entered your teens as yet: if you believe in
   him, you shall not perish. That takes you in, fair maiden, and gives
   you hope and joy while yet young. That comprehends all of us, provided
   we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Neither can all the devils in hell
   find out any reason why the man that believes in Christ shall be lost,
   for it is written, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."
   Do they say, "Lord, he has been so long in coming"? The Lord
   replies,--"Has he come? Then I will not cast him out for all his
   delays." But, Lord, he went back after making a profession. "Has he at
   length come? Then I will not cast him out for all his backsliding."
   But, Lord, he was a foul-mouthed blasphemer. "Has he come to me? Then I
   will not cast him out for all his blasphemies." But, says one, "I take
   exception to the salvation of this wicked wretch. He has behaved so
   abominably that in all justice he ought to be sent to hell." Just so.
   But if he repents of his sin and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   whoever he may be, he shall not be sent there. He shall be changed in
   character, so that he shall never perish, but have eternal life.

   Now, observe, that this "whosoever" makes a grand sweep; for it
   encircles all degrees of faith. "Whosoever believeth in him." It may be
   that he has no full assurance; it may be that he has no assurance at
   all; but if he has faith, true and childlike, by it he shall be saved.
   Though his faith be so little that I must needs put on my spectacles to
   see it, yet Christ will see it and reward it. His faith is such a tiny
   grain of mustard seed that I look and look again but hardly discern it,
   and yet it brings him eternal life, and it is itself a living thing.
   The Lord can see within that mustard seed a tree among whose branches
   the birds of the air shall make their nests.

   "My faith is feeble, I confess,

   I faintly trust thy word;

   But wilt thou pity me the less?

   Be that far from thee, Lord!"

   O Lord Jesus, if I cannot take thee up in my arms as Simeon did, I will
   at least touch thy garment's hem as the poor diseased woman did to whom
   thy healing virtue flowed. It is written, "God so loveth the world that
   he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life." That means me. I cannot preach
   at length to you to-night; but I would preach with strength. Oh that
   this truth may soak into your souls. Oh you that feel yourselves
   guilty; and you that feel guilty because you do not feel guilty; you
   that are broken in heart because your heart will not break; you that
   feel that you cannot feel; it is to you that I would preach salvation
   in Christ by faith. You groan because you cannot groan; but whoever you
   may be, you are still within the range of this mighty word, that
   "whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."

   Thus have I commended God's love to you in those three points--the
   divine gift, the divine method of saving, and the divine choice of the
   persons to whom salvation comes.

   IV. Now fourthly, another beam of divine love is to be seen in the
   negative blessing here stated, namely, in THE DELIVERANCE implied in
   the words, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish."

   I understand that word to mean that whosoever believes in the Lord
   Jesus Christ shall not perish, though he is ready to perish. His sins
   would cause him to perish, but he shall never perish. At first he has a
   little hope in Christ, but its existence is feeble. It will soon die
   out, will it not? No, his faith shall not perish, for this promise
   covers it--"Whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish." The penitent
   has believed in Jesus, and therefore he has begun to be a Christian;
   "Oh," cries an enemy, "let him alone: he will soon be back among us; he
   will soon be as careless as ever." Listen. "Whosoever believeth in Him
   shall not perish," and therefore he will not return to his former
   state. This proves the final perseverance of the saints; for if the
   believer ceased to be a believer he would perish; and as he cannot
   perish, it is clear that he will continue a believer. If thou believest
   in Jesus, thou shalt never leave off believing in him; for that would
   be to perish. If thou believest in him, thou shalt never delight in
   thine old sins; for that would be to perish. If thou believest in him,
   thou shalt never lose spiritual life. How canst thou lose that which is
   everlasting? If thou wert to lose it, it would prove that it was not
   everlasting, and thou wouldst perish; and thus thou wouldst make this
   word to be of no effect. Whosoever with his heart believeth in Christ
   is a saved man, not for to-night only, but for all the nights that ever
   shall be, and for that dread night of death, and for that solemn
   eternity which draws so near. "Whosoever believeth in him shall not
   perish;" but he shall have a life that cannot die, a justification that
   cannot be disputed, an acceptance which shall never cease.

   What is it to perish? It is to lose all hope in Christ, all trust in
   God, all light in life, all peace in death, all joy, all bliss, all
   union with God. This shall never happen to thee if thou believest in
   Christ. If thou believest, thou shalt be chastened when thou dost
   wrong, for every child of God comes under discipline; and what son is
   there whom the Father chasteneth not? If thou believest, thou mayest
   doubt and fear as to thy state, as a man on board a ship may be tossed
   about; but thou hast gotten on board a ship that never can be wrecked.
   He that hath union with Christ has union with perfection, omnipotence
   and glory. He that believeth is a member of Christ: will Christ lose
   his members? How should Christ be perfect if he lost even his little
   finger? Are Christ's members to rot off, or to be cut off? Impossible.
   If thou hast faith in Christ thou are a partaker of Christ's life, and
   thou canst not perish. If men were trying to drown me, they could not
   drown my foot as long as I had my head above water; and as long as our
   Head is above water, up yonder in the eternal sunshine, the least limb
   of his body can never be destroyed. He that believeth in Jesus is
   united to him, and he must live because Jesus lives. Oh what a word is
   this, "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave
   them to me is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
   my Father's hand."

   I feel that I have a grand gospel to preach to you when I read that
   whosoever believeth in Jesus shall not perish. I would not give two
   pins for that trumpery, temporary salvation which some proclaim, which
   floats the soul for a time and then ebbs away to apostasy. I do not
   believe that the man who is once in Christ may live in sin and delight
   in it, and yet be saved. That is abominable teaching, and none of mine.
   But I believe that the man who is in Christ will not live in sin, for
   he is saved from it; nor will he return to his old sins and abide in
   them, for the grace of God will continue to save him from his sins.
   Such a change is wrought by regeneration that the newborn man cannot
   abide in sin, nor find comfort in it, but he loves holiness and makes
   progress in it. The Ethiopian may change his skin, and the leopard his
   spots, but only grace divine can work the change; and when divine grace
   has done the deed the blackamore will remain white, and the leopard's
   spots will never return. It would be as great a miracle to undo the
   work of God as to do it; and to destroy the new creation would require
   as great a power as to make it. As only God can create, so only God can
   destroy; and he will never destroy the work of his own hands. Will God
   begin to build and not finish? Will he commence a warfare and end it
   before he has won the victory? What would the devil say if Christ were
   to begin to save a soul and fail in the attempt? If there should come
   to be souls in hell that were believers in Christ, and yet did perish,
   it would cast a cloud upon the diadem of our exalted Lord. It cannot,
   shall not, be. Such is the love of God, that whosoever believeth in his
   dear Son shall not perish: in this assurance we greatly rejoice.

   V. The last commendation of his love lies in the positive--IN THE
   POSSESSION. I shall have to go in a measure over the same ground again,
   let me therefore be the shorter. God gives to every man that believes
   in Christ everlasting life. The moment thou believest there trembles
   into thy bosom a vital spark of heavenly flame which never shall be
   quenched. In that same moment when thou dost cast thyself on Christ,
   Christ comes to thee in the living and incorruptible word which liveth
   and abideth for ever. Though there should drop into thy heart but one
   drop of the heavenly water of life, remember this,--he hath said it who
   cannot lie,--"The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
   water springing up into everlasting life." When I first received
   everlasting life I had no idea what a treasure had come to me. I knew
   that I had obtained something very extraordinary, but of its
   superlative value I was not aware. I did but look to Christ in the
   little chapel, and I received eternal life. I looked to Jesus, and he
   looked on me; and we were one for ever. That moment my joy surpassed
   all bounds, just as my sorrow had aforetime driven me to an extreme of
   grief. I was perfectly at rest in Christ, satisfied with him, and my
   heart was glad; but I did not know that this grace was everlasting life
   till I began to read in the Scriptures, and to know more fully the
   value of the jewel which God had given me. The next Sunday I sent to
   the same chapel, as it was very natural that I should. But I never went
   afterwards, for this reason, that during my first week the new life
   that was in me had been compelled to fight for its existence, and a
   conflict with the old nature had been vigorously carried on. This I
   knew to be a special token of the indwelling of grace in my soul; but
   in that same chapel I heard a sermon upon "O wretched man that I am!
   who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" And the preacher
   declared that Paul was not a Christian when he had that experience.
   Babe as I was, I knew better than to believe so absurd a statement.
   What but divine grace could produce such a sighing and crying after
   deliverance from indwelling sin? I felt that a person who could talk
   such nonsense knew little of the life of a true believer. I said to
   myself, "What! am I not alive because I feel a conflict within me? I
   never felt this fight when I was an unbeliever. When I was not a
   Christian I never groaned to be set free from sin. This conflict is one
   of the surest evidences of my new birth, and yet this man cannot see
   it; he may be a good exhorter to sinners, but he cannot feed
   believers." I resolved to go into that pasture no more, for I could not
   feed therein. I find that the struggle becomes more and more intense;
   each victory over sin reveals another army of evil tendencies, and I am
   never able to sheathe my sword, nor cease from prayer and watchfulness.

   I cannot advance an inch without praying my way, nor keep the inch I
   gain without watching and standing fast. Grace alone can preserve and
   perfect me. The old nature will kill the new nature if it can; and to
   this moment the only reason why my new nature is not dead is
   this--because it cannot die. If it could have died, it would have been
   slain long ago; but Jesus said, "I give unto my sheep eternal life";
   "he that believeth on me hast everlasting life"; and therefore the
   believer cannot die. The only religion which will save you is one that
   you cannot leave, because it possesses you, and will not leave you. If
   you hold a doctrine which you can give up, give it up; but if the
   doctrines are burnt into you so that as long as you live you must hold
   them, and so that if you were burnt every ash would hold that same
   truth in it, because you are impregnated with it, then you have found
   the right thing.

   You are not a saved man unless Christ has saved you for ever. But that
   which has such a grip of you that its grasp is felt in the core of your
   being is the power of God. To have Christ living in you, and the truth
   ingrained in your very nature--O sirs, this is the thing that saves the
   soul, and nothing short of it. It is written in the text, "God so loved
   the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." What is this but
   a life that shall last through your three-score years and ten; a life
   that shall last you should you outlive a century; a life that will
   still flourish when you lie at the grave's mouth; a life that will
   abide when you have quitted the body, and left it rotting in the tomb;
   a life that will continue when your body is raised again, and you shall
   stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; a life that will outshine
   those stars and yon sun and moon; a life that shall be co-eval with the
   life of the Eternal Father? As long as there is a God, the believer
   shall not only exist, but live. As long as there is a heaven, you shall
   enjoy it; as long as there is a Christ, you shall live in his love; and
   as long as there is an eternity, you shall continue to fill it with
   delight.

   God bless you and help you to believe in Jesus.--Amen.

Ruth's Reward--or, Cheer for Converts

   (No. 1851)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE 29, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The Lord recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the
   Lord God of Israel under whose wings you are come to trust." Ruth 2:12.

   THIS was the language of Boaz, a man of substance and of note in
   Bethlehem, to a poor stranger of whom he had heard that she had left
   her kindred and the idols of her nation, that she might become a
   worshipper of the living and true God. He acted a noble part when he
   cheered her and bade her be of good courage, now that she was casting
   in her lot with Naomi and the chosen nation. Observe that he saluted
   her with words of tender encouragement, for this is precisely what I
   want all the elder Christians among you to do to those who are the
   counterparts of Ruth. You who have long been Believers in the Lord
   Jesus, who have grown rich in experience, who know the love and
   faithfulness of our Covenant God and who are strong in the Lord and in
   the power of His might, I want you to make a point of looking out for
   the young converts and speaking goodly and comfortable words to them,
   whereby they may be cheered and strengthened. There is a text, a very
   short one, which I would like to often preach from in reference to
   those who are newly saved, and I would invite you to be continually
   practicing it. That text is, "Encourage him." So many throw cold water
   upon the aspirants after holiness that I would urge others of you to
   heartily cheer them. Where spiritual life is weak, it should be
   nurtured with affectionate care. We desire to cherish, not to censure.
   That the lambs may grow, they must be shepherded. That the tender babes
   in the household may become strong members of the Divine family, they
   must be nursed and fed. If Ruth is to be happy in the land of Israel, a
   Boaz must look after her and be her true friend. Let her nearest
   kinsmen be speedy in fulfilling this duty.

   I have no doubt that much sorrow might be prevented if words of
   encouragement were more frequently spoken fitly and in season and,
   therefore, to withhold them is sin. I am afraid that many poor souls
   have remained in darkness, shut in within themselves, when two or three
   minutes' brotherly cheer might have taken down the shutters and let in
   the light of day. Many matters are real difficulties to young
   Believers, which are not difficulties to us who have been longer in the
   Way. You and I could clear up, in ten minutes' conversation, questions
   and doubts which cause our uninstructed friends months of misery. Why
   are we so reticent when a word would send our weaker Brothers and
   Sisters on their way rejoicing? Therefore I entreat all of you, whom
   God has greatly blessed, to look after those that are of low estate in
   spiritual things--try to cheer and encourage them. As you do this, God
   will bless you in return, but, if you neglect this tender duty, it may
   be that you, yourselves, will grow despondent and be in need of
   friendly succor. Encouragement is due to young converts--every Ruth
   ought to be comforted when she casts in her lot with the people of God.

   I think I can say for every Christian here that the young converts
   among us have our very best wishes. We desire for them every good and
   spiritual gift. It will be our wisdom to turn our kindly wishes into
   prayers. Wishes are lame, but prayer has legs, yes, wings, with which
   it runs and even flies, towards God! Wishes are baskets, but prayer
   fills them with bread! Wishes are clouds, but prayer is the rain! Look
   how Boaz, wishing well, as he did to the humble maiden from Moab, spoke
   with her and then spoke with God in prayer for her. I take it that my
   text is a prayer as well as a benediction--"Jehovah recompense your
   work, and a full reward be given you of Jehovah, God of Israel, under
   whose wings you are come to trust." Let us pray more than ever for the
   feeble-minded and the young! Think of them whenever the King grants you
   an audience. Search them out with kindly care, as a shepherd looks for
   his young lambs--and then lay them in the bosom of your love and carry
   them over rough places.

   We would, in all probability, see a much more rapid growth in Grace
   among our young converts if they were better nursed and watched over.
   Some of us owed much to old, experienced Christians in our younger
   days. I know I did. I shall forever respect the memory of a humble
   servant in the school where I was usher, at New Market--an old woman
   who talked with me concerning the things of the Kingdom and taught me
   the way of the Lord more perfectly. She knew the Doctrines of Grace
   better than many a doctor of divinity and she held them with the
   tenacious grasp of one who found her life in them. It was my great
   privilege to help her in her old age and but a little while ago she
   passed away to Heaven. Many things did I learn of her which, today, I
   delight to preach! Let it be said of us, when we, too, grow old, that
   those who were children when we were young were helped by us to become
   useful in their riper years. They will not forget us if we have been to
   them what Aquila and Priscilla were to Apollos, or Ananias to Paul, or
   Paul to Timothy. They will pray for us and God will bless us in answer
   to their prayers when the grasshopper becomes a burden to us and our
   infirmities are multiplied.

   Having thus introduced the text, let us notice in this model word of
   encouragement, what the convert has done that we should encourage him.
   Secondly, what that full reward is which he will receive. And, thirdly,
   following out the historical connection of the text, I should like to
   conclude by noticing what figure sets forth this full reward--a reward
   which we desire for every Ruth who has left those who were outside of
   the Covenant in Moab to come and join herself with the Israel of
   God--and the God of Israel.

   I. First, then, WHAT HAS THE YOUNG CONVERT DONE? We illustrate the
   subject by the instance of Ruth. Many young converts deserve
   encouragement because they have left all their old associates. Ruth, no
   doubt, had many friends in her native country, but she tore herself
   away to cling to Naomi and Naomi's God. Perhaps she parted from a
   mother and a father--if they were alive, she certainly left them to go
   to the Israelites' country. Possibly she bade adieu to brothers and
   sisters, certainly she left old friends and neighbors, for she resolved
   to go with Naomi and share her lot. She said, "Entreat me not to leave
   you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will
   go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people,
   and your God my God. Where you die, will I die and there will I be
   buried. The Lord do so to me and more, also, if anything but death
   parts you and me."

   The young convert is an emigrant from the world and has become, for
   Christ's sake, an alien. Possibly he had many companions--friends who
   made him merry, after their fashion--men of fascinating manners who
   could easily provoke his laughter and make the hours dance by. But,
   because he found in them no savor of Christ, he has forsaken them and
   for Christ's sake, they have forsaken him. Among his old associates he
   has become as a speckled bird and they are all against him. You may,
   perhaps, have seen a canary which has flown from its home, where it
   enjoyed the fondness of its mis-tress--you may have seen it out among
   the sparrows. They pursue it as though they would tear it to pieces and
   they give it no rest anywhere. Just so the young convert--being no
   longer of the same feather as his comrades--is the subject of their
   persecution. He endures trials of cruel mockings and these are as hot
   irons to the soul. He is now, to them, a hypocrite and a fanatic--they
   honor him with ridiculous names by which they express their scorn. In
   their hearts they crown him with a fool's cap and write him down as
   both idiot and stupid. He will need to exhibit years of holy living
   before they will be forced into respect for him--and all this because
   he is quitting their Moab to join with Israel!

   Why should he leave them? Has he grown better than they? Does he
   pretend to be a saint? Can he not drink with them as he once did? He is
   a protest against their excesses and men don't care for such protests.
   Can he not sing a jolly song as they do? Indeed, he has turned saint,
   and what is a saint but a hypocrite? He is a bit too precise and
   Puritanical and is not to be endured in their free society! According
   to the grade in life, this opposition takes one form or another, but in
   no case does Moab admire the Ruth who deserts her idols to worship the
   God of Israel.

   It is not natural that the Prince of Darkness should care to lose his
   subjects, or that the men of the world should love those who shame
   them. Is it not most meet that you older Christian people, who have
   long been separated from the world and are hardened against its jeers,
   should step in and defend the newcomers? Should you not say, "Come with
   us and we will do you good--we will be better friends to you than those
   you have left. We will accompany you on a better road than that from
   which you have turned and we will find you better joys than worldlings
   can ever know"? When our great King is represented as saying to His
   spouse, "Forget, also, your own people and your father's house," He
   adds, "so shall the King greatly desire your beauty, for He is your
   Lord." Thus He gives her new company to supply the place of that which
   she gives up.

   Let us gather a hint from this and make a society for those whom the
   world casts out. Perhaps there has come into this house, at this time,
   a man or woman who has just rushed out of the City of Destruction, only
   too glad to be outside its walls. The poor soul does not know which way
   to run, only he knows that he must run away from his former evil place,
   for he finds that the city is to be destroyed. O Brothers and Sisters,
   while such fugitives are wondering which way to go and their evil
   companions are inviting them to return, step in and show them the true
   place of shelter! Run with them to the clefts of the Rock. Lift them up
   if they stumble! Guide them if they miss their way. Fend off their
   former tempters--form a bodyguard around them--escort them till they
   are out of immediate danger! Charm them with your loving conversation
   till they forget their false friends. When Ruth had left her former
   connections, it was wise and kind for Boaz to address her in the words
   of comfort which I will again quote to you--"The Lord recompense your
   work, and a full reward be given you of the Lord God of Israel, under
   whose wings you are come to trust."

   Next, Ruth, having left her old companions, had come among strangers.
   She was not yet at home in the land of Israel, but confessed herself,
   "a stranger." She knew Naomi, but in the whole town of Bethlehem she
   knew no one else. When she came into the harvest field, the neighbors
   were gleaning, but they were no neighbors of hers--no glance of
   sympathy fell upon her from them--perhaps they looked at her with cold
   curiosity. They may have thought, "What business has this Moabitess to
   come here to take away a part of the gleaning which belongs to the poor
   of Israel?" I know that such feelings do arise among country people
   when a stranger from another parish comes gleaning in the field. Ruth
   was a foreigner and, of course, in their eyes, an intruder. She felt
   herself to be alone, though under the wings of Israel's God.

   Boaz very properly felt that she should not think that courtesy and
   kindness had died out in Israel and he made a point, though he was by
   far her superior in station, to go to her and speak a word of
   encouragement to her. Should not certain of you follow the same
   practice? May I not call you to do so at once? There will come into our
   assemblies those that have been lately impressed with a sense of their
   guilt, or have newly sought and found the Savior--should they be
   suffered to remain strangers among us? Should not recognition,
   companionship and hospitality be extended to them to make them feel at
   home with us? I would sincerely assure any that have come to this
   Tabernacle for a time and are still unnoticed, that they are singularly
   unfortunate, for, as a rule, a stranger is looked after and, in every
   case, he will be welcomed.

   If you have been overlooked, you must have been sitting in rather an
   odd part of the building, for certain of our friends give themselves to
   the work of hunting up newcomers and conversing with them--so much so
   that now and then I get complaints of their supposed intrusion! Those
   complaints much delight me, for they show that earnestness still
   survives among us! Be prudent, gentle and courteous, of course, but do
   be on the watch for any who are seeking the Lord and are desirous to
   unite with His people! I have occasionally to hear a friend say, "Sir,
   I attended your ministry for months, but those who sat with me in the
   pew never took the slightest notice of me. I often wished they would,
   for I was really desirous to be led by the hand to the Savior."

   I do not like to hear that accusation! I would infinitely rather that
   people should complain that you spoke too much of religion to them than
   that you never said a word! Your supposed intrusion might be greatly to
   your credit, but your silent indifference must be to your dishonor. Let
   us try, with all our hearts, to look upon every man that no single
   seeking soul shall feel itself deserted. Seekers should be spared the
   agony of crying, "No man cares for my soul!" Are you a Believer? Then
   you are my Brother. We are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow
   citizens with the saints and of the household of God! We would lay
   ourselves out to bring our fellow men to Jesus and to aid new converts
   in finding perfect peace at His feet. Let us learn the art of personal
   address. Do not let us be so bashful and retiring that we leave others
   in sorrow because we cannot raise up our courage to say a kind and
   tender word in the name of the Lord Jesus. Come, let us pluck up
   courage and encourage every Ruth when she is timid among strangers. Let
   us help her to feel at home in Immanuel's land!

   The new convert is like Ruth in another respect--he is very low in his
   own eyes. Ruth said to Boaz, "Why have I found grace in your eyes, that
   you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?" She said
   again, "Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have
   comforted me and because you have spoken friendly unto your handmaid,
   though I am not like one of your handmaidens." She had little
   self-esteem and, therefore, she won the esteem of others. She felt
   herself to be a very insignificant person, to whom any kindness was a
   great favor--and so do young converts, if they are real and true. We
   meet with a certain class of them who are rather pert and forward, as
   the fashion of the day is

   in certain quarters, and then we do not think so much of them as they
   do of themselves! But the genuine ones, who are truly renewed, who
   really hold out and continue to the end, are always humble.

   And frequently they are very trembling, timid and diffident. They feel
   that they are not worthy to be put among the children and they come to
   the Lord's Table with holy wonder. I remember when I first went to the
   house of God as a Christian youth who had lately come to know the Lord.
   I looked with veneration on every officer and member of the Church! I
   thought them all, if not quite angels, yet very nearly as good! At any
   rate, I had no disposition to criticize them, for I felt myself to be
   so undeserving. I do not think that I have quite so high an idea of all
   professed Christians as I had, then, for I am afraid that I could not
   truthfully entertain it. But, for all that, I think far better of them
   than many are apt to do. I believe that young people, when first
   brought to Christ, have so deep a sense of their own imperfection and
   know so little of the infirmities of others, that they look up to the
   members of the Church with a very high esteem-- and this fixes upon
   such members, officers and pastors a great responsibility. Since these
   converts are lowly in their own eyes, it is proper and safe to
   encourage them.

   Moreover, it is kind and necessary to do. Never be critical and severe
   with them, but deal tenderly with their budding gifts--a frosty
   sentence may nip them--a genial word will develop them. Our Lord bids
   you feed the lambs. Act the shepherd towards them and never overdrive
   them, lest they faint by the way. It is a lovely sight to see a
   matronly Christian cheering on her class of girls, bearing with their
   waywardness and folly, and fostering everything that is hopeful in
   them. These are the mothers in Israel to whom shall be honor! I love to
   see the advanced man of God giving a hearty grip to a youth, loving
   him, advising him--yes, and adding a word of praise when it can be
   judiciously applied. With unequal footsteps the raw recruits are trying
   to keep step with the better-trained soldiers. Let their comrades smile
   upon them and see in them the warriors of the future who shall rally to
   the standard when our warfare is ended.

   Once more, the young convert is like Ruth because he has come to trust
   under the wings of Jehovah, the God of Israel. Here is a beautiful
   metaphor. You know that the wings of a strong bird, especially, and of
   any bird relatively, is strong. It makes a kind of arch and from the
   outer side you have the architectural idea of strength. Under the
   wings, even of so feeble a creature as a hen, there is a complete and
   perfect refuge for her little chicks, judging from without. And then
   the inside of the wing is lined with soft feathers for the comfort of
   the young. The interior of the wing is arranged as though it would
   prevent any friction from the strength of the wing to the weakness of
   the little bird. I do not know of a more snug place than under the wing
   feathers of the hen. Have you ever thought of this?

   Would not the Lord have us, in time of trouble, come and cower down
   under the great wing of His Omnipotent Love, just as the chicks do
   under the mother? Here is the Scripture--"He shall cover you with His
   feathers, and under His wings shall you trust: His truth shall be your
   shield and buckler." What a warm defense! When I have seen the little
   birds stick their heads out from under the feathers of their mother's
   breast, it has looked like the perfection of happiness! And when they
   have chirped their little notes, they have seemed to tell hr how warm
   and safe they were, though there may have been a rough wind blowing
   around the hen. They could not be happier than they are! If they run a
   little way, they are soon back, again, to the wing, for it is house and
   home to them--it is their shield and succor, defense and delight !

   This is what our young converts have done. They have come, not to trust
   themselves, but to trust in Jesus. They have come to find a
   righteousness in Christ--yes, to find everything in Him--and so they
   are trusting, trusting under the wings of God! Is not this what you are
   doing? You full-grown saints--is not this your condition? I know it is!
   Very well, then, encourage the younger sort to do what you delight to
   do! Say to them, "There is no place like this. Let us joyously abide
   together under the wings of God." There is no rest, no peace, no calm,
   no perfect quiet like that of giving up all care because you cast your
   care on God, renouncing all fear because your only fear is a fear of
   offending God! Oh the bliss of knowing that sooner may the universe be
   dissolved than the great heart that beats above you cease to be full of
   tenderness and love to all those that shelter beneath it! Faith,
   however little, is a precious garden of the Lord's right hand
   planting--do not trample on it, but tend it with care and water it with
   love.

   II. But now I must come closer to the text. Having shown you what these
   converts have done to need encouragement,

   I need, in the second place, to answer the question, WHAT IS THE FULL
   REWARD OF THOSE WHO COME TO

   TRUST UNDER THE WINGS OF GOD?

   I would answer that a full reward will come to us in that day when we
   lay down these bodies of flesh and blood, that they may sleep in Jesus,
   while our unclothed spirits are absent from the body but present with
   the Lord. In the disembodied state, we shall enjoy perfect happiness of
   spirit. But a fuller reward will be ours when the Lord shall come a
   second time and our bodies shall rise from the grave to share in the
   glorious reign of the descended King! Then, in our perfect manhood, we
   shall behold the face of Him we love and shall be like He! Then shall
   come the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body and we, as body,
   soul and spirit--a trinity in unity--shall be forever with Father, Son
   and Holy Spirit--our triune God! This unspeakable bliss is the full
   reward of trusting beneath the wings of Jehovah!

   But there is a present reward and to that Boaz referred. There is, in
   this world, a present recompense for the godly, notwithstanding the
   fact that many are true afflictions of the righteous. Years ago a
   brother minister printed a book, "How to Make the Best of Both Worlds,"
   which contained much wisdom. But, at the same time, many of us objected
   to the title as dividing the pursuit of the Believer and putting the
   two worlds too much on a level. Assuredly, it would be wrong for any
   godly man to make it his objective in life to make the best of both
   worlds in the way which the title is likely to suggest. This present
   world must be subordinate to the world to come and is to be cheerfully
   sacrificed to it if necessary. Yet, be it never forgotten, if any man
   will live unto God, he will make the best of both worlds, for godliness
   has the promise of the life that now is as well as of that which is to
   come. Even in losing the present life for Christ's sake, we are saving
   it--and self-denial and taking up the Cross are but forms of
   blessedness. If we seek, first, the Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness, all other things shall be added to us!

   Do you ask me, "How shall we be rewarded for trusting in the Lord?" I
   answer, first, by the deep peace of conscience which He will grant you.
   Can any reward be better than this? When a man can say, "I have sinned,
   but I am forgiven," is not that forgiveness an unspeakable reward? My
   sins were laid on Jesus and He took them away as my Scapegoat, so that
   they are gone forever and I am consciously absolved. Is not this a
   glorious assurance? Is it not worth worlds? A calm settles down upon
   the heart which is under the power of the blood of sprinkling! A voice
   within proclaims the peace of God and the Holy Spirit seals that peace
   by His own witness--and thus all is rest. If you were to offer all that
   you have, to buy this peace, you could not purchase it! And were it
   purchasable, it were worthwhile to forego the dowry of a myriad worlds
   to have it! If you had all riches and power and honor you could not
   reach the price of the Pearl of Peace!

   The revenues of kingdoms could not purchase so much as a glance at this
   jewel. A guilty conscience is the undying worm of Hell. The torture of
   remorse is the fire that never can be quenched. He that has that worm
   gnawing at his heart and that fire burning in his bosom is already
   lost. On the other hand, he that trusts in God through Christ Jesus is
   delivered from inward Hell-pangs and the burning fever of unrest is
   cured. He may well sing for joy of soul, for Heaven is born within him
   and lies in his heart like the Christ in the manger. O harps of Glory,
   you ring out no sweeter note than that of transgression put away by the
   atoning Sacrifice!

   That, however, is only the beginning of the Believer's reward. He that
   has come to trust in God shall be "quiet from fear of evil." What a
   blessing that must be! "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his
   heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." When a man is at his very
   highest as to this world's joy, he hears the whisper of a dark spirit
   saying, "Will it last?" He peers into the morning with apprehension,
   for he knows not what may be lurking in his path. But when a man is no
   longer afraid, but is prepared to welcome whatever comes because he
   sees in it the appointment of a loving Father, why, then he is in a
   happy state! Suppose one went home tonight and found, as Job did, that
   all his estate had been burned or stolen and that his family had all
   died? What a splendid condition must he be in if he could say amid his
   natural agony, "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be
   the name of the Lord"! Such possession of the soul in patience is one
   of the full rewards of faith. He that has it wears a nobler decoration
   within his breast than all the stars that royalty could bestow!
   Deliverance from the pangs of conscience and freedom from the griefs of
   fear make up a choice favor such as only God can give!

   More than this--the man who trusts in God rests in Him with respect to
   all the supplies he now needs, or shall ever need. What happy music
   gladdens the green pastures of that 23rd Psalm! I am half inclined to
   ask you to rise and sing it, for my heart is leaping for joy while I
   rehearse the first stanza of it--

   "The Lord my Shepherd is:

   I shall be well supplied.

   Since He is mine and I am His,

   What can I need beside?"

   Usually man is made up of needs--and he must have reached the land of
   abounding wealth who boldly asks, "What can I need beside?" We are
   never quite content. It always needs a little more to fill the cup to
   the brim, but only think of singing, "What can I need beside?" Is not
   this sweet content a full reward from the Lord in whom we trust? Human
   nature has swallowed a horseleech and, therefore, it cries night and
   day, "Give, give, give!" Who but the Lord can satisfy this craving? The
   vortex of dissatisfaction threatens to suck in the main ocean and still
   to remain unfilled, but the Lord rewards faith by satisfying its mouth
   with good things and making it sing--

   "What need shall not our God supply

   From His redundant stores?

   What streams of mercy from on high

   An arm almighty pours!"

   I cannot imagine a fuller present reward than complete rest from all
   anxiety and calm confidence in a Providence which ran never fail!

   Another part of the Believer's great gain lies in the consciousness
   that all things are working together for His good. Nothing is, after
   all, able to injure us. Neither pains of body, nor sufferings of mind,
   nor losses in business, nor cruel blows of death can work us real ill.
   The thefts of robbers, the mutterings of slanderers, the changes of
   trade, the rage of the elements shall all be overruled for good! These
   many drugs and poisons, compounded in the mortar of the unerring
   Chemist, shall produce a healthy potion for our souls! "We know that
   all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
   are the called according to His purpose." It is a great joy to know
   this to be an unquestionable fact and to watch, with expectation, to
   see it repeated in our own case. It takes the sting out, at once, of
   all these wasps that otherwise would have worried us. And it transforms
   them into bees, each one gathering honey for us! Is not this a reward
   for which a man may well forego the flatteries of sin? O Faith, you
   enrich and ennoble all who entertain you!

   Then, let me tell you, they that trust in God and follow Him have
   another full reward and that is, the bliss of doing good. Can any
   happiness excel this? This joy is a diamond of the first water! Match
   me, if you can, the joy of helping the widow and the fatherless! Find
   me the equal of the delight of saving a soul from death and covering a
   multitude of sins! It were worth worlds to have faith in God, even if
   we lived here forever, if our sojourn could be filled up with doing
   good to the poor and needy and rescuing the erring and fallen. If you
   desire to taste the purest joy that ever flowed from the fountains of
   Paradise, drink of the unselfish bliss of saving a lost soul! When
   faith in God teaches you to forego self and live wholly to glorify God
   and benefit your fellow men, it puts you on the track of the Lord of
   angels and, by following it, you will come to reign with Him.

   There has lately passed away from our midst on this side of the river
   one who, in his earlier days, knew the curse of drunkenness, but was
   led, by hearing the Gospel in the street, to seek and find a Savior and
   so to escape from the bondage of an evil habit. He became a Christian
   temperance man, devoting himself--I was about to say every day in the
   week, to the cause--for I think he did so! All his spare time was spent
   for that sacred purpose. He has lately passed away, but not without
   having enjoyed a reward from his God. When I used to look into the face
   of our friend, Mr. Thorniloe, I felt that he had received a full return
   for casting himself upon the Lord, for the joy of his heart shone in
   his countenance and delight in his work caused it to be his recreation!
   O drunk, if you could become such as he was, total abstinence would be
   no trial, but a pleasure! O idle professor, if you would be as diligent
   in serving your Lord as he was, life would be music to you! He who has,
   himself, fallen into a sin, should find his chief joy in seeking to
   reclaim others from the same condemnation. And in doing so, he will
   light upon clouds of happiness and flocks of joys! As a shepherd
   rejoices most when he has found his straying sheep, so will you who
   trust in the Lord, if you will, in the future, lay yourselves out to
   pluck men from eternal ruin.

   Brothers and Sisters, there remains the singular and refined joy which
   comes of a humble perception of personal growth. Children rejoice when
   they find that they are growing more like their parents and may soon
   hope to be strong and full-grown. Most of us remember our childish
   mirth when we began to wear garments which we thought would make us
   look like men! When I first wore boots and walked through the stubble
   with my big uncle, I felt that I was somebody! That, of course, was
   childish pride--but it has its commendable analogy in the pleasure of
   gathering spiritual strength and becoming equal to higher labors and
   deeper experiences! When you find that you do not lose your temper
   under provocation, as you did a year ago, you are humbly thankful. When
   an evil lust is driven away and no longer haunts you, you are quietly
   joyful, rejoicing with trembling. When you have sustained a trial which
   once would have crushed you, the

   victory is exceedingly sweet. Every advance in holiness is an advance
   in secret happiness! To be a little more meet for Heaven is to have a
   little more of Heaven in the heart! As we mellow for the celestial
   garner, we are conscious of a more pervading sweetness which, in
   itself, is no mean reward of virtue.

   Let me tell you another splendid part of this full reward, and that is
   to have prevalence with God in prayer. Somebody called me, in print, a
   hypocrite, because I said that God had heard my prayers. This was
   evidently malicious--a man might be called fanatical for such a
   statement, but I cannot see the justice of imputing hypocrisy on that
   account! If by hypocrisy he meant a sincere conviction that the great
   God answers prayer, I will be more and more hypocritical as long as I
   live! I will glory in the name of God--the God That Hears My Prayer! If
   that writer had claimed that he prayed and had been heard, it is
   possible that he would have been guilty of hypocrisy--of that matter,
   he is personally the best informed, and I leave the question with him.
   But he has no right to measure my corn with his bushel. Certainly, I
   shall not use his bushel to measure my corn, but I shall speak what I
   know and am persuaded of! In deep sincerity I can bear testimony that
   the Lord hears prayer and that it is His desire to do so!

   Many a saint of God has but to ask and have. When such men wrestle with
   God in prayer, they always prevail like Israel of old at Jabbok, when
   he grasped the Angel and would not let Him go without a blessing. If
   you have got this power to the fullest, you will often say to yourself,
   "If I have nothing else but power at the Throne of Grace, I have more
   than enough to recompense me for every self-denial." What are the jests
   and jeers of an ungodly and ignorant world in comparison with the honor
   of being favored of the Lord to ask what we will and receive the utmost
   of our desires?

   Many other items make up the full of the reward, but perhaps the chief
   of all is communion with God--to be permitted to speak with Him as a
   man speaks with his friend--to be led by the Divine Bridegroom to sit
   down in the banqueting house while His banner over us is Love. Those
   who dwell outside the palace of Love know nothing about our secret
   ecstasies and raptures. We cannot tell them much about our spiritual
   delights, for they would only turn, again, and tear us. The delights of
   heavenly fellowship are too sacred to be commonly displayed. There is a
   joy, the clearest example of Heaven below, when the soul becomes as the
   chariot of Amminadib by the energy of the Holy Spirit! I believe,
   Brothers and Sisters, that our lot, even when we are poor and sorrowful
   and cast down, is infinitely to be preferred to that of the loftiest
   emperor who does not know the Savior!

   Oh, poor kings, poor princes, poor peers, poor gentry that do not know
   Christ! But happy paupers that know Him! Happy slaves that love Him!
   Happy dying men and women that rejoice in Him! Those have solid joy and
   lasting pleasure who have God to be their All in All. Come, then, and
   put your trust under the wings of God and you shall be blessed in your
   body and in your soul! You shall be blessed in your house and in your
   family! You shall be blessed in your basket and in your store--blessed
   in your sickness and in your health, blessed in time and in
   eternity--for the righteous are blessed of the Lord and their offspring
   with them!

   My prayer for every young convert is the benediction of Boaz, "The Lord
   recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the Lord God of
   Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust." May this benediction
   rest on each one of you forever.

   III. Finally, WHAT FIGURE SETS FORTH THIS FULL REWARD? What was the
   full reward that Ruth obtained? I do not think that Boaz knew the full
   meaning of what he said. He could not foresee all that was appointed of
   the Lord. In the light of Ruth's history, we will read the good man's
   blessing. This poor stranger, Ruth, in coming to put her trust in the
   God of Israel, was giving up everything. Yes, but she was also gaining
   everything. If she could have looked behind the veil which hides the
   future, she could not have conducted herself more to her own advantage
   than she did! She had no prospect of gain. She followed Naomi expecting
   poverty and obscurity, but, in doing that which was right, she found
   the blessing which makes rich! She lost her Moabite kindred, but she
   found a noble kinsman in Israel. She left the home of her fathers in
   the other land to find a heritage among the chosen tribes, a heritage
   redeemed by one who loved her! Ah, when you come to trust in Christ,
   you find, in the Lord Jesus Christ, One who is next of kin to you, who
   redeems your heritage and unites you to Himself! You thought that He
   was a stranger. You were afraid to approach Him, but He comes near to
   you and you find yourself near to His heart and one with Him forever.

   Yes, this is a fair picture of each convert's reward. Ruth found what
   she did not look for. She found a husband. It was exactly what was for
   her comfort and her joy, for she found rest in the house of her husband
   and she became possessed of his large estate by virtue of her marriage
   union with him. When a poor sinner trusts in God, he does not expect so

   great a reward, but, to his surprise, his heart finds a husband, a home
   and an inheritance priceless beyond all concep-tion--and all this is
   found in Christ Jesus our Lord! Then is the soul brought into loving,
   living, lasting, indissoluble union with the Well-Beloved, the
   unrivalled Lord of Love! We are one with Jesus! What a glorious mystery
   is this!

   Ruth obtained an inheritance among the chosen people of Jehovah. She
   could not have obtained it except through Boaz, who redeemed it for
   her, but thus she came into indisputable possession of it. When a poor
   soul comes to God, he thinks that he is flying to Him only for a
   refuge, but, indeed, he is coming for much more. He is coming for an
   undefiled heritage that fades not. He becomes an heir of God, a
   joint-heir with Jesus Christ!

   As I conclude, I bear this, my personal testimony, to the benefit of
   godliness for this life. Apart from the glories of Heaven, I would wish
   to live trusting in my God and resting in Him for this present life
   since I need His present aid for every day as truly as I shall need it
   at the last day. Men speak of secularism as attending to the things
   which concern our present life and I am bold to assert that the purest
   and best secularism is that which trusts itself with God for things
   immediately around us! We shall be wise to make secular things sacred
   by trusting them with God. Faith is not for eternity, alone, but for
   this fleeting hour, also--it is good for the shop and for the
   marketplace--for the field and for the domestic hearth. For the cares
   of the moment, as well as for everything else, we take refuge under the
   wings of God! There shall we be blessed, for Christ's sake. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Ruth 2:1-14; Proverbs 3

The Modern Dead Sea and the Living Waters

   (No. 1852)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 19, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The waters shall be healed." Ezekiel 47:8.

   Ezekiel is robed in dreadful tempest and his whole book is "as the
   terrible crystal" for brightness and for mystery, yet he often gives us
   visions of exceeding comfort. For instance, who can think without joy
   of that tender branch of the cedar which is to be planted by God in the
   mountain of the height of Israel--which shall grow so exceedingly that
   all fowl of every wing shall dwell in its branches? Do we not all
   rejoice that, whatever may become of the institutions of modern
   society, we have received a Kingdom which cannot be moved? The Kingdom
   of our Lord Jesus, which began as a tender slip, is yet to increase
   till it is likened to a goodly cedar "upon a high mountain and
   eminent"--is not this an unspeakable joy? Think, also, of that other
   vision, so weird and strange, of a valley full of dead bones, "very
   many" and "very dry." What an answer does that vision give to the
   question of unbelief! "Can these dry bones live?" How plainly does the
   Lord answer--"I will put My Spirit in you and you shall live"! When I
   think of that goodly cedar, I see that the Kingdom will come unto
   Christ. And when I think of the valley of dry bones, I am comforted
   concerning the masses around me. We, too, as we walk through this
   morgue of a city, may hope that life will conquer death and an
   exceedingly great army, quickened by the Spirit of our God, shall yet
   rise from these dry bones!

   The remarkable vision which lies open before us, is exceedingly
   reassuring to those who are troubled by reason of the dreadful
   condition of the times--and which of us is not? The Prophet bids us
   think of those waters, dreary and dreadful, known by the suggestive
   name of the Dead Sea! This was the "Chamber of Horrors" of the land of
   Canaan! Travelers describe it as a place of utter desolation. Lying in
   a deep hollow, some 1,300 feet below any other sea, the Dead Sea may be
   described as a deep sunken into the earth, like the mouth of the abyss.
   Masses of bitumen float upon its surface and line its shores. Sulfurous
   exhalations abound and on its banks are hot sulfuric springs. Bathing
   in its thick brine is not pleasant, for it causes the skin to tingle
   with its acrid salts long afterwards. Neither is it desirable to linger
   upon the brink of it-- there is nothing to attract you to do so. Very
   scanty is the vegetation; few are the birds and rare the living things.
   It is the domain of destruction! The sea is so salty that no fish can
   live in it and though it has been asserted that smaller organisms exist
   in it, these have seldom been found--on the contrary, the fish that
   come down into it from the Jordan die at once--and drifted shellfish
   are washed up dead upon the bank. Nothing of life loves the brine, the
   sulfur and the bitumen of the Dead Sea. The slimy lake is, at seasons,
   dangerous to health, and even to life. Travelers have, of late, crossed
   it safely at the right season--but formerly those who made a voyage
   upon it rarely returned to tell the tale, or, before long, sickened and
   died.

   The doomed lake bears dark mysteries in its bosom--down deep in its
   depths lie the drowned cities of the plain, whose infamies provoked the
   wrath of Heaven and brought upon them a fire-shower such as earth has
   never known before or since. It may be that the briny waters hide
   mysteries of sin which were better hidden--for modern crime is fertile
   enough in inventions of filthiness and needs no aid from the rottenness
   of antiquity. Thus, the Dead Sea is a place most dread and dismal--the
   bath of death, the haunt of despair, the home of desolation--and in
   these respects it is a fit picture of our fallen humanity, a truthful
   symbol of the whole world which lies in the Wicked One. The world of
   men is cursed by evils of dreadful name. "The dark places of the earth
   are full of the habitations of cruelty." There are no mysteries of love
   in this lost world, but mysteries of sin, of judgement and of the wrath
   of God are plentiful! The world is a veritable Dead Sea upon a gigantic
   scale!

   Such, also, is the city in which we live--must I call it "modern
   Sodom"? Every wave that breaks upon the shore of this human lake now
   seems to wash up remains of monstrous things unearthly, inhuman,
   beastly, devilish! Fair islands, here and there, rise out of its dark
   deeps--the bright creations of God's Grace--but all around them the
   waters cast up mire and dirt. God is at work creating new heavens and a
   new earth and, in the process, forms of beauty are developed. But to
   this day the old unrenewed city remains a reeking copy of the Hell
   which burns below. Those who have dared to look into its depths return
   with horror upon their faces to say that it were not lawful for a man
   to utter what they have seen! London is a simmering cauldron of vice
   and crime. O God, how long shall it be?

   In certain respects, such is every man's natural heart until he is
   renewed by Grace. The heart is deceitful above all things and
   desperately wicked--and may be well typified by the Sea of Death. If we
   could but look into it with such eyes as God has, what would we not
   see? When we are led to gaze on it through our tears because the Holy
   Spirit has anointed our eyes with eye salve--and we perceive things in
   their naked truth--we are distressed beyond expression. What a thing is
   human nature! Mr. Whitefield used to say that man is half beast and
   half devil. But to my mind he is all beast and all devil if God does
   not hold him in check by the restraints of fear and the fetters of Law.
   Let him alone and who can imagine what man would grow to? All manner of
   iniquities, such as lust, greed, oppression, drunkenness, falsehood,
   cruelty and murder lurk within the human heart, like wild beasts in the
   jungle! No man knows what villainy he is capable of--he only needs to
   be placed under certain circumstances and he will develop into a very
   fiend!

   Thus the world, the city, the heart are each symbolized by the Dead
   Sea. Can they ever be purified? Can these waters be healed? According
   to our text, the Lord says expressly, "the waters shall be healed." Let
   us believe His promise and take heart of hope from this good hour! Here
   is room, my Brothers and Sisters, for the faith which, like charity,
   "believes all things, hopes all things." If any of you desire to
   exercise a faith by which you can glorify God, believe that the world
   can yet be delivered from sin--believe that London can yet be made a
   holy city! Believe that your own heart, by the power of God's Spirit,
   can be purified even as Christ is pure! Even when it seems to be
   furthest off from hope; even when we are staggered at the sin which
   surrounds us, we are still to believe that the Lord shall reign forever
   and ever--and sin and Satan shall be crushed under our Redeemer's feet!

   Let us believe in God as God deserves to be believed in. Let us rely
   implicitly upon Omnipotence and trust without a doubt in that strong
   will which can never be turned from its purpose of Grace. "The waters
   shall be healed"--all the brine and bitumen of the Dead Sea shall not
   stop the Divine work. The putrid waters of London shall be made sweet
   as the well of Bethlehem! The atrocities of war and oppression shall
   cease and the reign of evil shall end, for the Lord has purposed it and
   it shall be done! The kingdoms of this world must become the kingdoms
   of our Lord and of His Christ-- London must be won for Jesus and our
   own hearts must be wholly His! "The waters shall be healed."

   Ezekiel saw in vision the means of the healing of the dreary Lake of
   Death--the method was simple, but effectual. What he saw represented
   the Gospel dispensation. The whole system of Divine Grace--the Gospel
   attended by the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Cross and all the Truths
   of God that come out of it, the message of salvation, the preaching of
   faith, the testimony of God the Father to the redeeming work of His
   Son--all this is the river which flows down into this desert world by
   its own force and is now making its way into the most horrible guilt
   and corruption, with set purpose-- that the waters may be healed!

   I want to encourage your faith, this morning, in a time when that faith
   is very sorely tried. Be of good courage, for the waters, of which we
   all loathe to drink, shall be purified! "The waters shall be healed."

   I. And, first, to encourage your faith, I bid you to CONSIDER THE
   PROMISE. The place where the promise is written, in plain black and
   white, upon the sacred page, is opened before your eyes. Put your
   finger on it and let it rest there. Thus says Jehovah, "The waters
   shall be healed."

   We feel sure that this Word of prophecy shall be accomplished to the
   letter in due time because He that made the promise is able to fulfill
   it. Apart from us and all our weaknesses; apart from man and all his
   wickedness, God, who has spoken the Word, will perform it without fail.
   The Lord knows what He says. He speaks advisedly and not after the
   manner of the rash and boastful. Neither do His hands neglect to do
   what His lips have promised. He brings His supreme power and Godhead to
   carry out the Word of His mouth. The promise of Grace is the fiat of
   Omnipotence--"The waters shall be healed." One "shall" of God is worth
   all the legions of an empire! Yes, all the forces of the universe.
   "Shall," says

   God, and the event is sure. What can resist the thunder of His Word?
   Who shall stay His hand, or frustrate His design? Hear, O unbelief, and
   doubt no more--"The waters shall be healed!"

   The Lord will fulfill this Word thoroughly. This promise shall not be
   kept to the ear only, but it shall be fulfilled in the largest
   conceivable sense. The Prophet, in vision, saw the waters of the Dead
   Sea so completely healed that there were fish in it--yes, swarms of
   fish, and these fish so many that there was occupation for all those
   who cast the net, so that they stood from one shore to the other! Where
   there had been no life before, living things literally swarmed and
   teemed, as in the great main ocean itself! Brothers and Sisters, when
   God speaks of what He is about to do in the world, by way of Grace,
   interpret it very broadly--get no narrow ideas into your minds
   concerning the Grace of the Infinite! When our Lord Jesus sees of the
   travail of His soul and is satisfied, He will not have seen a handful
   of men, here and there, gathered to Him, but He will have seen a
   multitude that no man can number, worshipping the Father, each one of
   whom shall eternally bless His name for deliverance from sin! What
   hosts have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb! Ah, Beloved, God will cleanse London perfectly clean when He puts
   His hand to it! Even this Augean stable shall yet be sacred as the
   temple of Jehovah! No cleansing of the outside of the cup and platter
   will God make--He will purge out secret sins, both in high places and
   in cottages--and He will create for Himself, in this place, a city of
   priests! Glory be to His name for such a hope! Blessed be the Lord God!
   He will sanctify our hearts and spirits--in the secret parts He will
   implant truth and in the hidden parts He will make us to know wisdom!

   Observe that when God makes the promise on which my finger is still
   resting--for I love to press the very words, "The waters shall be
   healed"--He gives us an idea of how He will do it. He will fulfill this
   Word in connection with the present dispensation. To my mind this is
   clear enough from the fact that these waters flowed forth from Mount
   Zion. They flowed originally from that ancient hill of which God had
   said, "Here will I dwell forever." The healing stream proceeded from
   that sacred place, the Holy of Holies, on Mount Zion, which is the type
   of God's indwelling in His Son Jesus and in His Church. The rising
   river flowed hard by the altar of burnt-offering and became visible to
   the prophetic eye as it trickled forth from under the closed door at
   the east end of the Temple. These waters, in vision, were seen to flow
   towards the east--to create greenery in the desert and to melt into the
   Dead Sea. From this I gather that our God means to use His Church for
   His purposes of Grace. "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has
   shined."

   We believe that He means to win His ultimate triumphs by the preaching
   of the Gospel. Whenever the coming of our Lord shall be--and oh, that
   it were today, for we never needed Him more than now--whenever His
   Second Advent shall take place, yet it shall not be a dishonor to the
   Church, but it will be her glory to triumph with the King at her head.
   It may be that by His personal appearing, she shall win the victory. If
   our Lord delays His coming, He will send the wondrous influences of the
   Divine Spirit in much greater abundance than today--and then His Church
   shall work marvels in the land and salvation shall adorn her! The King
   shall marshal His troops around the central city of His choice and His
   Church shall be glorious in the eyes of all men because of the splendor
   of her Lord!

   Do not throw down your weapons and say, "Christ must come and wage this
   war." Perhaps so, but still He will carry on the battle by His chosen
   people. It is ours to stand fast like British squares in the day of
   battle. Hold the fort because your Lord is coming! Do not abandon it
   under some idea that He will work after a novel fashion and dispense
   with the Gospel and the testimony of His saints. I believe that the
   Lord Jesus will win the battle on the old lines--"Up, Guards and at
   them!" Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into
   spears, for you must fight as long as you live since the Lord has sworn
   to have war with Amalek from generation to generation. If you die at
   your posts, so be it--but never desert them! Till Jesus comes, gird
   yourselves and fight His battles. Your rest remains and it will be a
   full reward to you, but you have not yet come to it. By the river of
   God, which flows this day, the waters shall be healed.

   Note, carefully, that this Divine promise, "the waters shall be
   healed," will not put aside instrumentality, but when it is fulfilled,
   it will call forth more abundant agencies. The waters run into the Dead
   Sea and purify its waters. Then fish begin to multiply and man's part
   comes in--"The fishers shall stand upon it from En Gedi even unto En
   Eglaim." Rest assured that there will be plenty of fishers when, by His
   healing process, the Lord makes plenty of fish--we shall be fishers of
   men in right earnest when the times of refreshing shall come from His
   Presence! The Lord does not intend to put the fishers on one side any
   more than He will dismiss the reapers in the time of harvest. Mark how
   the Lord Jesus said, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
   He never intends the Gospel net to be laid aside till all His elect are
   taken in it and drawn out from the waters of sin and death.

   Those will be happy days when the Lord will cause the people to long
   for the Gospel--when those horrid wretches who are now lying asoak in
   the sulfurous lake of sin shall become wholesome fish and invite the
   fisher to cast his net! In those days many of you, my Brothers, who
   never handled a net before, will be moved by a holy call to catch men!
   And you, my Sisters, will have to help us with the rope to draw the net
   on shore! You slothful Christian men and women who have never gone to
   sea in this fishery, will then be moved to the work and will say, like
   Peter, "I go a-fishing." All round the lake, the Prophet saw fishermen
   and he says of the waters, "They shall be a place to spread forth nets;
   their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great
   sea, exceeding many." Oh, for the day when every Believer will be
   fishing for the souls of men! God send us that blessed time right
   speedily!

   On the strength of the promise now before us, if there were nothing
   else, let us look for such a consummation. "The waters shall be
   healed"--purity shall prevail--the Kingdom of God shall come. Our daily
   prayer shall not go up to Heaven in vain. Let us again cry--"Your will
   be done in earth, as it is in Heaven. For Yours is the kingdom, and the
   power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen!"

   II. Having asked you to consider the promise, I invite you, next, to
   CONSIDER THE WONDER OF THE HEALING WATERS that we may be helped,
   thereby, to believe that healing will come, even to the Dead Sea of
   this present evil world, this present sinful Babylon, this present
   deceitful heart.

   The wonders of the waters which Ezekiel saw, lay in many things. First,
   consider, from where they came. These waters sprang from the midst of
   Jerusalem, from the secret place of God's Throne--and this was why they
   were so potent. The 12th verse ascribes the fruit-producing power of
   the waters to this--"because they issued out of the sanctuary." In that
   sanctuary was the Throne of Jehovah--Eternal Sovereignty is the
   fountainhead of those gracious decrees in which the Lord has purposed
   to do good to the sons of men. He will have mercy on whom He will have
   mercy and in the freeness of His sovereign will He has purposed that
   this Dead Sea of humanity shall yet be healed! The healing waters flow
   from the Throne of God and of the Lamb. As God is God, He has decreed
   and purposed to redeem His people--and in that decree and purpose is
   the fountain of good to men.

   These waters flowed, in the vision, hard by the Altar of
   Burnt-Offering. Learn from this that the one channel of mercy to the
   sons of men is by the Sacrifice of Christ. By that Altar, where our
   great High Priest offered up Himself once and for all, there flows the
   River of Life. Since Christ has died, the world must yet be blessed.
   Those drops of blood that fell on Calvary were never gathered up and
   they have left the broad crimson mark of the redeeming Lord upon this
   globe of ours and, therefore, His it must be! Mankind shall be
   delivered from utter destruction because in Christ Jesus, our God has
   found a Ransom. There is hope in this, that "the waters shall be
   healed."

   These waters, though they flowed unseen across the Temple area,
   presently bubbled up from under the threshold of the door of the house.
   You know who is the Door of the Temple of God--by Him we enter in unto
   God--and by Him God comes forth in blessing unto us. The waters flowed
   from below, welling up from "the deep that lies under," in the Person
   and work of our Lord. Salvation comes not to us from any of the sons of
   men, but from the deeps of God's own heart. Streams of ever-flowing
   mercy flow to us through our Lord Jesus Christ! Blessed be His name!

   When the waters first appeared, the Prophet saw them trickling from
   under the closed door and this suggests another interpretation. The
   east door was shut, according to the vision recorded in the previous
   chapter, but the waters gushed forth from under the threshold. Old
   Judaism had its door closed against us Gentiles and yet the Gospel came
   from it to the nations! Israel's door is now shut till the Prince shall
   come and enter through it, yet from under its threshold, the river of
   the Gospel flowed to us Gentiles! Holy men of Jewish race came forth to
   tell of salvation bought with blood and justification perfected for
   faith--and by their means the heathen received the Light of the
   knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ! The stream
   began in the eternal purpose, it flowed through the sacrifice of Christ
   and proceeded out of the midst of that old Temple whose gate was shut!
   In Abraham's seed, all the nations of the earth are blessed! Surely
   that which comes from God's purpose through the sacrifice of Christ
   cannot be in vain. If God could make old Judaism to bud and blossom
   with the Gospel, what can He not do? If from under the shut gate the
   waters came gushing forth in gladsome stream to us perishing heathen,
   they can still flow to the vilest of the vile!

   Note next, as a wonder in connection with these waters, how they
   increased. They deepened so fast that, although there was but a little
   stream at the beginning, within less than a mile there were waters to
   swim in! Yes, they had become so deep and broad that the Prophet had to
   use an expression in the dual, signifying a double stream--the flood
   had be-

   come too deep and wide to be passed over! These waters were not fed by
   rivulets running into them, but they miraculously grew of themselves.
   In the vision they advanced from being ankle deep to being up to the
   knee and then up to the loins, and then they rose to be deep,
   unfathomable waters! All this the Prophet tested by his own wading into
   them.

   Now, if this happened by God's power, and if this happened so speedily,
   we may look for other marvels! "The waters shall be healed"--the Dead
   Sea shall yet teem with life! You and I have waded into these waters,
   have we not? If so, we know how they have increased upon us. Do you not
   remember when you rejoiced to have received a little Grace, so that it
   washed your feet and your life was cleansed? Do you not remember how
   very speedily these waters were up to your knees and you had power with
   God in prayer? It was but a few hours, more, before your heart was
   comforted and your inmost spirit was made glad--for the waters were up
   to your loins. Very soon, perhaps within hours, you were swimming in
   streams of heavenly love as you found that Christ was yours, your God
   your Heaven, your All! Do you not see that the God who has done all
   this for you can do as much for others? Can He not heal the waters of
   the Dead Sea of our day? Let us hope on, work on and believe in God to
   the end!

   Putting our finger, again, upon that promise, let us rest assured that
   "the waters shall be healed."

   Rapidly--for I have to be brief where there is so much to be
   said--notice what these waters produced. They began to flow and very
   soon vegetation came into the wilderness. They flowed into the desert
   and into the Acacia Vale, as Joel calls it. And soon, on both sides of
   the river, there were trees and, all of a sudden, the trees were
   bearing fruit! Wherever the Gospel goes, it carries life, growth and
   fruit with it. The fruits were for man's nourishment--these were the
   ordained food of Paradise, the best provender for man at his best! What
   food there is in the Gospel! Wherever it flows, the famine of the soul
   ceases. The Gospel contains all manner of fruit, for all sorts of
   seasons and appetites. It provides food for the young and food for the
   old; food for the feeble and food for the strong; food for the happy
   and food for the sad! This Tree of Life brings forth fruit abundantly,
   constantly and speedily. The leaves of the Trees of Life contained
   medicine, full of mystic virtue--they were for the healing of the
   people. Whatever diseases afflict men, they have but to pluck these
   leaves, and apply them, and health follows! Oh, that blessed Gospel! It
   has had a double effect for our good, for it has fed our souls and
   healed our infirmities! Well might its waters be called a double
   stream!

   Do you not know that it is thus singularly useful? If you have never
   eaten of its fruit, I must seem to be talking nonsense to you. If you
   have never been sick and felt the healing power of its leaves, I must
   seem to mock you with decisions. But if you have been hungering and
   thirsting, you know what these streams and these fruits are--and if you
   have been sick unto death--you have found, in God's Grace, a medicine
   better than the balm of Gilead--and it has made you whole! If the
   Gospel can thus cause Trees of Life to grow, the waters shall be
   healed-- the horrible Dead Sea of lust shall yet be purified, the
   sulfurous breath of vice shall yet be blown away, the death of sin
   shall yet give place to holy life--and the Lord, alone, shall be
   exalted where before He has been dishonored!

   As a further wonder, note where the stream flowed. One would have
   thought that such a clear crystal stream as this, proceeding from the
   Throne of God and of the Lamb, would have sought a pure channel for
   itself among the gardens of the Lord. But instead we are told, "These
   waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert,
   and go into the sea which, being brought forth into the sea, the waters
   shall be healed." What a mercy it is that the Gospel goes into the
   desert! Think of what this island used to be, when our ancestors
   wandered about in their nakedness among its oak groves. Think of the
   times when the great wicker image was set up and the Druids surrounded
   it, and that image was crammed full of hundreds of men and women who
   were all to be consumed in one dread fire while the people stood by to
   see their fellow creatures offered to their national Moloch!

   That is all over now. No longer is the mistletoe cut with the golden
   sickle, or the fierce deity appeased with blood of men. The missionary
   came and preached the Gospel and the Druids ceased out of the land.
   They were both the legislature and the hierarchy, but they could not
   stand before the Divine Truth of God! They were everybody then, but
   they are nobody now. I do not know what may yet happen here, but I do
   know this--when the Gospel comes, the images, the idols, the filthy
   things, the cruel things, the horrible things must go. The Gospel is
   still sent to sinners and it will save sinners. We are to preach the
   Gospel to every creature, "beginning at Jerusalem," and He who bade us
   do this will not permit us to labor in vain. The River of Life once
   purified Britain and it will cleanse it yet again--"The waters shall be
   healed."

   The waters ran down into the horrible sea. You would have said, as you
   stood there, "No! No! Do not waste these pure floods in that Hell lake!
   Do not let them disappear in pollution! Jordan, for many years, has
   been lavishing her sil-

   ver streams upon this Dead Sea and it has absorbed them all, but it has
   not been made a whit the purer--and every fish that has drifted down
   the Jordan has died as soon as it has touched this detestable lake! Do
   not pour the heavenly river into such a Pandemonium." Many speak thus
   nowadays--"Do not meddle with this vice and wickedness. Do not even
   hear about it, for it will pollute you! Forget its foul flow, it is
   sulfurous as Tophet--the smell of such iniquity will choke you!" This
   avoidance of evil is natural and safe, but what is to become of this
   Dead Sea if the precious crystal stream does not flow into it? Will God
   abandon our race to the devil? Would He have His Church abandon her
   function of salting the earth? I do not believe it! I tell you, there
   is to be a link made by almighty Grace between the Temple at Jerusalem
   and the very site of Sodom and Gomorrah--a silver stream is yet to
   traverse the space between the Throne of the Most High and the foul
   Dead Sea--mercy is to triumph over judgement and righteousness is to
   conquer sin! It shall yet be said on earth and sung in Heaven,
   "Hallelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!"

   Blessed be His name, that to the very chief of sinners this life stream
   has flowed and will continue to flow till time shall be no more! Who
   can diminish this flood? Not even he that glories to drink up Jordan at
   a draught! Who can divert it? It is not to be turned by the will of
   man. Who can destroy its saving force? Not even the Dead Sea, itself,
   shall be able to contend against the healing energy of this wondrous
   river. Let us begin to sing of the river whose streams make us glad.
   Let our spirits break out with exultation, for, "the waters shall be
   healed."

   III. Thirdly, for a moment or two I want you to CONSIDER THE EFFICACY
   OF THE WATERS. I will quit the

   figure in some measure in order to explain how the Gospel is adapted to
   heal the wickedness of men. "What does the Gospel do?" asks one. I
   answer--In the Gospel we set before men the horrible nature of sin and
   thus we lead them to turn from it. He does not preach the Gospel who
   fails to declare that sin slew the Son of God! The Cross unveils the
   baseness and ingratitude of sin and makes it to appear exceedingly
   sinful. The Gospel brings men to know the unchangeableness of the
   Divine Law and that sin is the transgression of that Law--and that
   every sin will have its just recompense of reward. There is no
   preaching the Gospel unless you declare the terrors of the Lord. God
   has winked at the times of man's ignorance, but now commands all men,
   everywhere, to repent, for sin is not a thing to be played with, but a
   deadly enemy to be shaken off into the fire, as Paul shook off the
   viper from his hand. All this tends to the removal of human sin.

   The Gospel gives man hope and that is a grand thing for the degraded
   and self-condemned. To have a hope that you can be a better man is a
   great help in escaping from sin. To hope that you can be renewed and
   become like the angels of God, though now you are like the devils in
   Hell, is a great encouragement to turn to God! My Gospel bids me go to
   the very vilest of the vile and bid him hope. I count no man so
   loathsome that God may not look upon him in love. What a Gospel this
   is, for hope is the beginning of amendment, the first letter of the
   alphabet of reform! Where there is no hope, the sinner gives the reins
   to his lusts and thinks it wise to enjoy his sin while he may. O Souls,
   this is the Gospel, indeed, to you, that there is
   forgiveness--forgiveness, even, for loud and crying sins!

   The Gospel purifies men because it gives them Christ, Himself, to be
   their Savior. It brings them the Son of God to be their salvation. It
   says, "Poor Souls, you cannot help yourselves! Here is One on whom help
   has been laid, even a mighty One! Here is One that took your sin and
   put it away. Here is One that will be a Friend to you in your worst
   times of need. Here is One that is bone of your bone and flesh of your
   flesh--lay your burdens down at His dear feet, for He has a fellow
   feeling for you! Here is a Leader and Commander for you who will lead
   you forth from the slavery of sin. Come, buckle on your harness to war
   against your sins, for He will give you power to overcome them." I tell
   you there is no Gospel like a Gospel that says, "Sinner, here is Christ
   for you!" Poor, wearied, burdened, heavy-laden Sinner, take Christ to
   be yours and you have all you need between this place and Heaven!

   Moreover, the Gospel does not merely tell men certain Truths of God,
   but it gives life, power and Grace to them. There comes with the Gospel
   an almighty Power which changes the nature of the man. It touches his
   understanding and enlightens it. It touches his will and changes it. It
   touches his affections and purifies them. This Power is the Holy
   Spirit, equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Son--nothing less
   than very God of very God! This Holy Spirit goes forth with the Gospel,
   giving hearts of flesh, causing men to be born again and creating all
   things new. The Truth comes not in Word only, but in the Power of the
   Holy Spirit. The waters shall be healed by such a Gospel, attended by
   such a Power as this!

   I heard it said the other day, "We do not need more preachers, for the
   supply is more than equal to the demand." But then, the Gospel creates
   its own demand! Wherever the Gospel goes, it makes men thirsty for
   itself. It makes men hungry

   for itself. It does its own work without aid from any foregoing human
   preparedness! It does not even ask to be left alone--it will effect its
   purpose even though it is tampered with! Its own essential Omnipotence
   secures its own preservation, enlargement and success. How I marvel at
   those who quit the heavenly stream for their own little brooks and
   streams! A certain divine has lately made a discovery by which he is
   going to pour a flood of light upon the Bible! The Bible, it seems, has
   been a dark, mysterious Book to our forefathers--though martyrs died
   for it and saints were comforted by it--yet those poor beings were in
   the dark for lack of 19th Century discoveries! At length the hour has
   come, and the man with it--a great genius has arisen who has found
   light with which to illuminate the Bible! We used to sing--

   "A glory gilds the sacred page, Majestic like the sun. It gives a light
   to every age, It gives, but borrows none."

   Are we to alter our tune and cheerfully accept the contributions of
   this uncommon person? I think not! Did you ever hear of a madman who,
   with a common match, determined to show up the sun in the middle of the
   day? Come here, you that never saw the sun before! It is a dim affair,
   but we will strike this match and then you shall see what you shall
   see! Brothers and Sisters, this talk is all foolishness--neither the
   scientists nor the divines can light up the Light of God! This Book is
   clear enough of itself and this Gospel is mighty enough of itself
   without the aid of human wisdom! It will not be cleared, but clouded,
   by modern doting upon evolution! The river of the Gospel will force its
   own way despite modern thought! It will win and conquer, whoever may
   oppose!

   The power of the Gospel to cleanse this horrible Lake of Gomorrah lies
   in this--it touches the heart, it moves the affections, it changes the
   nature, it renews the entire man! Moreover, it binds men in a holy
   brotherhood and leads them back to their Father and their God. Its
   torrent bears away the pride which makes one man stand at a distance
   from his fellow. It drowns the oppression by which the great man thinks
   to trample down the poor. Its waves say, as they flow, "All you are
   Brothers and Sisters and One is your Master, even Christ." Thus it
   works a holy revolution among men and a restoration of the royal rights
   of Jesus. God send it, send it to us, to London and to the entire
   world--and to His name shall be the praise!

   IV. I must close by noticing, fourthly, THE LESSON OF THE WATERS. What
   is their voice to us, today?

   I think the first lesson is that God works in very unexpected ways.
   There is that Dead Sea. We look down upon it with horror. Can it ever
   be healed? It never would have occurred to you or to me that yonder
   Temple, so pure and sacred, would have a spring welling up from under
   its threshold. Or that it was so little and so tiny that you might
   cover it with your hand, at first, and yet from that spring should come
   a sufficient purgation even for Sodom's sea! The Lord knows how to do
   His own work and He does it by apparently slender means. "Who has
   despised the day of small things?" Mark the little band at Jerusalem,
   when the number of the men was about 120--that stream grew within a few
   days till we read that--"the same day there were added unto them about
   3,000 souls." Then another day or so after, we read, "And the number of
   the men was about five thousand." That small beginning most rapidly
   increased, is increasing and will increase!

   The Gospel has the same potency and force about it, today, that it has
   had in ages past. Always expect the unexpected! Consider that God has
   great things in reserve. He shot yon arrow, but His quiver is still
   full! He has scarcely begun the battle! Jehovah of Hosts has stricken
   here, a blow and, there, a blow, but behold, He comes forth to do
   greater execution by the sword of His strength! O great Prince, "Ride
   prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your
   right hand shall teach terrible things"! Come quickly, we pray You!
   What else ought we to learn? As the Dead Sea has to be cleansed by that
   stream of water, all that we can do is, first of all, pray. Pray,
   "Spring up, O Well!" Pray that out of the midst of each of us may flow
   rivers of Living Water. Pray that God would work by His Spirit yet more
   abundantly. The Holy Spirit has descended--we do not need Him to be
   poured out, but we would realize His power in another fashion--we would
   descend into the floods of His sacred influences--we beg of Him to
   baptize us into His mighty waters and sweep every sin away before Him!

   When we have done that, what next have we to do? Why, begin fishing.
   Wherever this stream rushes along, there will be fish. In this London
   there are fish. Go and fish in the streets, fish in the street corners,
   fish in any little room you can open! Fish in the great crowds if they
   will come to you. The stream is breeding swarms of life--be you fishers
   of men!

   God says to His Church today, "I have much people in this city." Do not
   despair! God has an elect company in every parish of London. Get to
   work by this sea and stand there from En Gedi to En Eglaim, from
   Highgate to Norwood, from Stratford to Kensington, from one end of the
   city to the other! God help you to cast the net!

   Above all, we must not come to be the marshes of which we read just
   now. Certain spots of land were overflowed by the river and the sea,
   but afterwards, they were left high and dry as the stream retired, so
   that they were neither sea nor dry ground, but marshes. Beware of this!
   The most abominable beings out of Hell are Christians without
   Christianity, and there are plenty of them! They have "a name to live
   and are dead." They have no love to men, nor love to God, nor zeal for
   Christ's Glory--and yet they talk of being Christians! Beware of high
   professors who are unholy livers! These are jackdaws with peacocks'
   feathers stuck upon them--and they shall, one day, be stripped of all
   their plumes. These are not the children of the living God, but
   children of the devil!

   When they are brought before the Judge, to have their true parentage
   discovered, they shall be cut in sunder! So the great Solomon will
   ordain! Oh, that you and I may be true-born children of God! May we
   never be among those mongrels who are neither heathen nor Jews, neither
   Christians nor outsiders! May we be one thing or the other! Let us heed
   the voice of the Prophet--"If the Lord is God, follow Him: but if Baal,
   then follow him." All the blessing that ever comes from Heaven will
   never save neutrals, for "the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they
   shall be given to salt." God deliver us from such a curse, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

Up from the Country and Pressed Into Service

   (No. 1853)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 2, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of
   the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His Cross."
   Mark 15:21.

   JOHN tells us that our Savior went forth bearing His Cross (John
   19:17). We are much indebted to John for inserting that fact. The other
   Evangelists mention Simon the Cyrenian as bearing the Cross of Christ,
   but John, who often fills up gaps which are left by the other three,
   tells us that Jesus set out to Calvary carrying His own Cross. Our Lord
   Jesus came out from Pilate's palace laden with His Cross, but He was so
   extremely emaciated and so greatly worn by the night of bloody sweat
   that the procession moved too slowly for the rough soldiers and,
   therefore, they took the Cross from their prisoner and laid it upon
   Simon. Or, possibly they laid the long end upon the shoulder of the
   strong countryman, while the Savior still continued to bear, in part,
   His Cross till He came to the place of doom. It is well that we should
   be told that the Savior bore His Cross, for if it had not been so,
   objectors would have had ground for disputation. I hear them say--You
   admit that one of the most prominent types in the Old Testament, of the
   Sacrifice of the Son of God, was Abraham's offering up his son Isaac.
   Now Abraham laid the wood upon Isaac, his son, and not upon a servant.
   Should not, therefore, the Son of God bear the Cross Himself?

   Had not our Lord carried His Cross, there would have been a flaw in His
   fulfillment of the type--therefore, the Savior must bear the wood when
   He goes forth to be offered up as a Sacrifice. One of the greatest of
   English preachers has well reminded us that the fulfillment of this
   type appeared to have been in eminent jeopardy, since, at the very
   first, our Lord's weakness must have been apparent and the reason which
   led to the laying of the Cross upon the Cyrenian might have prevented
   our Lord's carrying the Cross at all. If the soldiers had put the Cross
   upon Simon a little earlier, which they might very naturally have done,
   then the prophecy had not been fulfilled! But God has the minds of men
   so entirely at His control that even in the minutest circumstance, He
   can order all things so as to complete the smallest jots and tittles of
   the prophecy! Our Lord was made to be, in all points, an Isaac and,
   therefore, we see Him going forth bearing the wood of the
   burnt-offering. Thus you see that it was important that Jesus should,
   for a while, bear His own Cross.

   But it was equally instructive that someone else should be made a
   partaker of the burden, for it has always been part of the Divine
   counsel that for the salvation of men from sin, the Lord should be
   associated with His Church. So far as Atonement is concerned, the Lord
   has trod the winepress alone and of the people there was none with Him.
   But as far as the conversion of the world and its rescue from the power
   of error and wickedness is concerned, Christ is not alone. We are
   workers together with God. We are to be, in the hands of God, part
   bearers of the sorrow and travail by which men are to be delivered from
   the bondage of sin and Satan and brought into the liberty of truth and
   righteousness. Hence it became important that in the bearing of the
   Cross, though not in the death upon it, there should be yoked with
   Christ one who would follow closely behind Him.

   To bear the Cross after Jesus is the office of the faithful. Simon the
   Cyrenian is the representative of the whole Church of God and of each
   Believer in particular. Often had Jesus said, "Except a man take up his
   cross daily and follow Me, he cannot be My disciple." And now, at last,
   He embodies that sermon in an actual person. The disciple must be as
   his Master--he that would follow the Crucified, must himself bear the
   cross--this we see visibly set forth in Simon of Cyrene with the Cross
   of Jesus laid upon his shoulder--

   "Shall Simon bear the Cross alone, And all the rest go free? No,
   there's a cross for everyone, And there's a cross for me."

   The lesson for each one of us is to take up our Lord's Cross, without
   delay, and go with Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.

   That many among this vast and mixed congregation may imitate Simon is
   the anxious desire of my heart! With holy expectancy I gaze upon this
   throng collected from all parts of the earth and I long to find in it
   some who will take my Lord's yoke upon them this day.

   I. I will begin with this first remark, that UNEXPECTED PERSONS ARE
   OFTEN CALLED TO CROSS-BEARING. Like Simon, they are pressed into the
   service of Christ. Our text says--"They compelled one Simon, a
   Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of
   Alexander and Rufus, to bear His Cross." Simon did not volunteer, but
   was forced into this work of cross-bearing. It would seem, from another
   Evangelist, that he speedily yielded to the command and lifted the
   burden heartily, but at first he was compelled. A rude authority was
   exercised by the guard who, being upon the Governor's business, acted
   with high-handed rigor and forced whomever they pleased to do their
   bidding. By the exercise of such irresponsible power, they compelled a
   passing stranger to carry Christ's Cross. It was especially singular
   that the man to have this honor was not Peter, nor James, nor John, nor
   any one of the many who had, for years, listened to the Redeemer's
   words, but it was a stranger from Northern Africa who had been, in no
   way connected with the life or teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

   Notice, first, that he was an unknown man. He was spoken of as, "one
   Simon." Simon was a very common name among the Jews, almost as common
   as John in our own country. This man was just, "one Simon"--an
   individual who need not be further described. But the Providence of God
   had determined that this obscure individual; this certain man--or I
   might better say, this uncertain man--should be selected to the high
   office of Cross-bearer to the Son of God! I have an impression upon my
   mind that there is, "one Simon" here, this morning, who has to bear
   Christ's Cross from this time forward. I feel persuaded that I am
   right. That person is so far unknown that most probably he does not
   recognize a single individual in all this throng and neither does
   anybody in this assembly know anything of him. Certainly the preacher
   does not. He is one John, one Thomas, or one William, or perhaps, in
   the feminine, she is one Mary, one Jane, one Maggie. Friend, nobody
   knows you except our Father who is in Heaven--and He has appointed you
   to have fellowship with His Son! I shall roughly describe you as, "one
   Simon," and leave the Holy Spirit to bring you into your place and
   service.

   But this "one Simon" was a very particular "one Simon." I lay the
   emphasis where there might seem to be no need of any--he was one whom
   God knew, chose, loved and set apart for this special service. In a
   congregation like the present, there may be somebody whom our God
   intends to use for His Gory during the rest of his life. That person
   sits in the pew and listens to what I am saying and, perhaps, as yet he
   does not begin to inquire whether he is that, "one Simon," that one
   person. And yet it is so and, before this sermon is ended, he shall
   know that the call to bear the Cross is for him. Many more unlikely
   things than this have happened in this house of prayer. I pray that
   many a man may go out from this house a different man from the man he
   was when he entered it an hour ago. That man Saul, that great
   persecutor of the Church, became such a mighty preacher of the Gospel
   that people exclaimed with wonder, "There is a strange alteration in
   this man." "Why," said one, "when I knew him, he was a Pharisee of the
   Pharisees! He was as bigoted a man as ever wore a phylactery and he
   hated Christ and Christians so intensely that he could never persecute
   the Church sufficiently."

   "Yes," replied another, "it was so, but he has had a strange twist.
   They say that he was going down to Damascus to hunt out the disciples
   and something happened. We do not know exactly what it was, but
   evidently it gave him such a turn that he has never been himself since.
   In fact, he seems turned altogether upside down and the current of his
   life is evidently reversed--he lives enthusiastically for that faith
   which once he destroyed." This speedy change happened to "one Saul of
   Tarsus." There were plenty of Sauls in Israel, but upon this one Saul,
   electing Love had looked in the counsels of eternity and for that Saul,
   redeeming Love had shed its heart's blood! And in that Saul, effectual
   Grace worked mightily Is there another Saul here, today? The Lord grant
   that he may now cease to kick against the pricks and may we soon hear
   of him, "Behold, he prays."

   I feel convinced the counterpart of that "one Simon" is in this house
   at this moment. And my prayer goes up to God--and I hope it is attended
   with the prayers of many thousands, besides--that he may, at once,
   submit to the Lord Jesus.

   It did not seem likely that Simon should bear the Cross of Christ, for
   he was a stranger who had newly come up from the country. He probably
   knew little or nothing of what had been taking place in Jerusalem, for
   he had come from another continent. He was "one Simon, a Cyrenian" and
   I suppose that Cyrene could not have been less than 800 miles from
   Jerusalem. It was situated in what is now called Tripoli, in Northern
   Africa, in which place a colony of Jews had been formed long before.
   Very likely he had come in a Roman galley from Alexandria to Joppa and
   there had been rowed through the surf and landed in time to reach
   Jerusalem for the Passover. He had long wanted to come to Jerusalem. He
   had heard of the fame of the Temple and of the city of his fathers--and
   he had longed to see the great Assembly of the tribes and the solemn
   Paschal feast. He had traveled all those miles and had hardly yet got
   the motion of the ship out of his brain--it had never entered into his
   head that he should be impressed by the Roman guard and made to assist
   at an execution! It was a singular Providence that he should come into
   the city at the moment of the turmoil about Jesus and should have
   crossed the street just as the sad procession started on its way to
   Golgotha.

   He passed by neither too soon nor too late! He was on the spot as
   punctually as if he had made an appointment to be there and yet, as men
   speak, it was all by mere chance. I cannot tell how many Providences
   had worked together to bring him there in the nick of time, but so the
   Lord would have it and so it came about! He, a man there in Cyrene, in
   Northern Africa, must, at a certain date, at the tick of the clock, be
   at Jerusalem in order that he might help to carry the Cross up to Mount
   Calvary--and He was there!

   Ah, my dear Friend, I do not know what Providences have been at work to
   bring you, here, today--perhaps very strange ones. If a little
   something had occurred you had not taken this journey. It only needed a
   small dust to turn the scale and you would have been hundreds of miles
   from this spot, in quite another scene from this. Why you are here, you
   do not yet know, except that you have come to listen to the preacher
   and join the throng. But God knows why He has brought you here! I trust
   it will be read in the annals of the future--

   "Thus the eternal mandate ran, Almighty Grace, arrest that man!" God
   has brought you here, that on this spot, by the preaching of the
   Gospel, you may be compelled to bear the Cross of Jesus. I pray it may
   be so. "One Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country," is here
   after a long journey, and this day he will begin to live a higher and a
   better life!

   Further, notice, Simon had come for another purpose. He had journeyed
   to Jerusalem with no thought of bearing the Cross of Jesus. Simon was
   probably a Jew far removed from the land of his fathers and he had made
   a pilgrimage to the Holy City to keep the Passover. Every Jew loved to
   be present at Jerusalem at the Paschal feast. So, to put it roughly, it
   was holiday-time--it was a time for making an excursion to the
   capital--it was a season for making a journey and going up to the great
   city which was "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth."
   Simon, from far-off Cyrene, must, by all means, keep the feast at
   Jerusalem. Maybe he had saved his money for months, that he might pay
   his fare to Joppa and he had counted down the gold freely for the joy
   which he had in going to the City of David and the Temple of his God.

   He came for the Passover and for that only. And he would be perfectly
   satisfied to go home when once the feast was over and once he had
   partaken of the lamb with the tribes of Israel. Then he could say
   throughout the rest of his life, "I, too, was once at the great feast
   of our people, when we commemorated the coming up out of Egypt."
   Brothers and Sisters, we propose one way, but God has other
   propositions! We say, "I will step in and hear the preacher," but God
   means that the arrows of His Grace shall stick fast in our hearts! Many
   and many a time, with no desire for Grace, men have listened to the
   Gospel and the Lord has been found of them that sought Him not. I heard
   of one who cared little for the sermon till the preacher chanced to use
   that word, "eternity," and the hearer was taken prisoner by holy
   thoughts and led to the Savior's feet.

   Men have even stepped into places of worship with evil designs and yet
   the purpose of Grace has been accomplished! They came to scoff, but
   they remained to pray! Some have been cast, by the Providence of God,
   into positions where they have met with Christian men and a word of
   admonition has been blessed to them. A lady was, one day, at an evening
   party and there met with Caesar Malan, the famous Divine of Geneva,
   who, in his usual manner, enquired of her whether she was a Christian.
   She was startled, surprised, vexed and made a short reply to the effect
   that it was not a question she cared to discuss. Whereupon, Mr. Malan
   replied, with great sweetness, that he would not persist in speaking of
   it, but he would pray that she might be led to give her heart to Christ
   and become a useful worker for Him. Within a fortnight she

   met the minister, again, and asked him how she must come to Jesus. Mr.
   Malan's reply was, "Come to Him just as you are." That lady gave
   herself up to Jesus--it was Charlotte Elliott, to whom we owe that
   precious hymn--

   "Just as I am--without one plea

   But that Your blood was shed for me

   And that You bid me come to You--

   O Lamb of God, I come."

   It was a blessed thing for her, that she was at that party, and that
   the servant of God from Geneva should have been there and should have
   spoken to her so faithfully! Oh for many a repetition of the story "of
   one Simon, a Cyrenian," coming, not with the intent to bear the Cross,
   but with quite another mind and yet, being enlisted in the
   cross-bearing army of the Lord Jesus!

   I would have you notice, once more, that this man was, at this
   particular time, not thinking upon the subject at all, for he was, at
   that time, merely passing by. He had come up to Jerusalem and whatever
   occupied his mind, he does not appear to have taken any notice of the
   trial of Jesus, or of the sad end of it. It is expressly said that he
   "passed by." He was not even sufficiently interested in the matter to
   stand in the crowd and look at the mournful procession. Women were
   weeping there right bitterly--the daughters of Jerusalem to whom the
   Master said, "Weep not for Me, but weep for yourselves, and for your
   children." But this man passed by! He was anxious to hurry away from so
   unpleasant a sight and to get up to the Temple. He was quietly making
   his way through the crowd, eager to go about his business, and he must
   have been greatly surprised and distressed when a rough hand was laid
   upon him--and a stern voice said, "Shoulder that Cross." There was no
   resisting a Roman centurion when he gave a command--and so the
   countryman meekly submitted, wishing, no doubt, that he were back in
   Cyrene tilling the ground.

   He must necessarily stoop his shoulder and take up a new burden and
   tread in the footsteps of the mysterious Person to whom the Cross
   belonged. He was only passing by and yet he was enlisted and commanded
   by the Romans and, as I take it, commanded by the Grace of God for
   life--for whereas Mark says he was the father of Alexander and
   Rufus--it would seem that his sons were well known to the Christian
   people to whom Mark was writing. If his son was the same Rufus that
   Paul mentions, then he calls her, "his mother and mine." And so, it
   would seem that Simon's wife and his sons became Believers and
   partakers of the sufferings of Christ. His contact with the Lord, in
   that strange compulsory way, probably worked out for him another and
   more spiritual contact which made him a true cross-bearer. O you that
   pass by this day, draw near to Jesus! I have no wish to call your
   attention to myself--far from it--but I do ask your attention to my
   Lord! Though you only intended to slip into this tabernacle and slip
   out again, I pray that you may be arrested by a call from my Lord!

   I speak as my Lord's servant and I would constrain you to come to Him.
   Stand where you are, a while, and let me beg you to yield to His love
   which even now would cast the bands of a man around you. I would compel
   you, by my Lord's authority, to take up His Cross and bear it after
   Him. It would be strange, you say. Yes, so it might be, but it would be
   a glorious event! I remember Mr. Knill, speaking of his own conversion,
   used an expression which I should like to use concerning one of you.
   Here it is--"It was just a quarter past twelve, August 2nd , when twang
   went every harp in Paradise, for a sinner had repented!" May it be so
   with you! Oh that every harp in Paradise may now ring out the high
   praises of Sovereign Grace as you now yield yourself to the great
   Shepherd and Bishop of souls! May that Divine impression which is
   imaged in the text by the compulsion of the Roman soldier take place in
   your case at this very moment! And may it be seen, in your instance,
   that unexpected persons are often called to be cross-bearers!

   II. My second observation is--CROSS-BEARING CAN STILL BE PRACTICED.
   Very briefly let me tell you in what ways the Cross can still be
   carried. First, and chiefly, by your becoming a Christian. If the Cross
   shall take you up, you will take up the Cross! Christ will be your
   hope! His death your trust, Himself the object of your love. You never
   truly become a cross-bearer till you lay your burdens down at His feet
   who bore the Cross and curse for you.

   Next, you become a cross-bearer when you make an open acknowledge of
   the Lord Jesus Christ. Do not deceive your-selves--this is expected of
   each one of you if you are to be saved. The promise, as I read it in
   the New Testament, is not to the Believer alone, but to the Believer
   who confesses his faith. "He that with his heart believes and with his
   mouth makes confession of Him shall be saved." He says, "He that
   confesses Me before men, him will I confess before My Father; but he
   that denies Me"--and from the connection it should seem to mean, he
   that does not confess Me--"him will I deny before My Father which is in
   Heaven." To quote the Inspired Scripture, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." There

   should be, there must be the open acknowledgement, in Christ's own way,
   of the secret faith which you have in Him. Now this is often a cross.
   Many people would like to go to Heaven by an underground
   railway--secrecy suits them. They do not want to cross the channel--the
   sea is too rough. But when there is a tunnel made, they will go to the
   fair country. My good people, you are cowardly and I must quote you a
   text which ought to sting your cowardice out of you--"But the fearful
   and unbelieving shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire
   and brimstone." I say no more and make no personal applications, but, I
   beseech you, run no risks! Be afraid to be afraid! Be ashamed of being
   ashamed of Christ! Shame on that man who counts it any shame to say
   before assembled angels, men and devils, "I am a follower of Christ."
   May you who have, up to now, been secret followers of the Crucified
   Lord become manifest cross-bearers! Do you not even now cry out, "Set
   down my name, Sir"?

   Further, some have to take up their cross by commencing Christian work.
   You live in a village where there is no Gospel preaching--preach,
   yourself! You are in a backwoods town where the preaching is very far
   from being such as God approves--begin to preach the Truth of God,
   yourself! "Alas," you say, "I would make a fool of myself." Are you
   ashamed to be a fool for Christ? "Oh, but I would break down." Break
   down--it will do you good and, perhaps, you may break somebody else
   down. There is no better preaching in the world than that of a man who
   breaks down under a sense of unworthiness--if that breakdown
   communicates itself to other people, it may begin a revival! If you are
   choked by your earnestness, others may become earnest, too. Do you
   still murmur, "But I would get the ill-will of everybody"? For Christ's
   sake, could you not bear that? When the good monk said to Martin
   Luther, "Go home to your cell and keep quiet," why did Martin not take
   the advice? Why, indeed? "It is very bad for young people to be so
   forward! You will do a great deal of mischief, therefore be quiet,
   Martin. Who are you to interfere with the great authorities? Be holy
   for yourself and don't trouble others. If you stir up a reformation,
   thousands of good people will be burnt through you. Do be quiet."

   Bless God, Martin did not go home and was not quiet, but went about His
   Master's business and raised Heaven and earth by his brave
   witness-bearing! Where are you, Martin, this morning? I pray God to
   call you out and, as you have confessed His name and are His servant, I
   pray that He may make you bear public testimony for Him and proclaim
   the saving power of the Savior's precious blood! Come, Simon, I see you
   shrink, but the Cross has to be carried, therefore bow your back! It is
   only a wooden Cross, after all, and not an iron one. You can bear it!
   You must bear it! God help you!

   Perhaps, too, some Brother may have to take up his cross by bearing
   witness against the rampant sin which surrounds him. "Leave all those
   dirty matters alone. Do not say a word about them. Let the people go to
   the devil, or else you will soil your white kid gloves." Sirs, we will
   spoil our hands as well as our gloves, and we will risk our characters,
   if necessary, but we will put down the devilry which now defiles
   London! Truly the flesh shrinks and the purest part of our manhood
   shrinks with it when we are compelled to bear open protest against sins
   which are done of men in secret. But, Simon, the Master may yet compel
   you to bear His Cross in this respect, and if so, He will give you both
   courage and wis-dom--and your labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

   Sometimes, however, the cross-bearing is of another and more quiet kind
   and may be described as submission to Providence. A young friend is
   saying, "For me, to live at home I know to be my duty, but father is
   unkind and the family generally imposes upon me. I wish I could get
   away." Ah, dear Sister, you must bear Christ's Cross and it may be the
   Lord would have you remain at home. Therefore bear the Cross! A servant
   is saying, "I would like to be in a Christian family. I do not think I
   can stay where I am." Perhaps, good Sister, the Lord has put you where
   you are to be a light in a dark place. All the lamps should not be in
   one street, or what will become of the courts and alleys? It is often
   the duty of a Christian man to say, "I shall stay where I am and fight
   this matter through. I mean, by character and example, with kindness
   and courtesy and love, to win this place for Jesus." Of course the easy
   way is to turn monk and live quietly in a cloister--and serve God by
   doing nothing--or to turn nun and dwell in a convent and expect to win
   the battle of life by running out of it!

   Is not this absurd? If you shut yourself away from this poor world,
   what is to become of it? You men and women that are Christians must
   stand up and stand out for Jesus where the Providence of God has cast
   you! If your calling is not a sinful one and if the temptations around
   you are not too great for you, you must "hold the fort" and never dream
   of surrender! If your lot is hard, look upon it as Christ's Cross and
   bow your back to the load. Your shoulder may be raw, at

   first, but you will grow stronger before long, for as your day, your
   strength shall be. "It is good for a man that he bears the yoke in his
   youth." But it is good for a man to bear the Cross in his old age as
   well as in his youth! In fact, we ought never to be rid of so blessed a
   burden. What wings are to a bird and sails to a ship, the Cross becomes
   to a man's spirit when he fully consents to accept it as his life's
   beloved load. Truly did Jesus say, "My yoke is easy and My burden is
   light." Now, Simon, where are you? Shoulder the Cross, man, in the name
   of God!

   III. Thirdly, TO CROSS-BEARING, THERE ARE NOBLE COMPULSIONS. Simon's
   compulsion was the rough hand of the Roman legionary and the gruff
   voice in the Latin tongue, "Shoulder that Cross." But we hear gentler
   voices which compel us, this day, to take up Christ's Cross.

   The first compulsion is this--"the love of Christ constrains us." He
   has done all this for you and, therefore, by sweet but irresistible
   compulsion, you are made to render Him some return of love. Does not
   Jesus appear to you in a vision as you sit in this house? Do you not
   see that thorn-crowned head, that visage crimsoned with the bloody
   sweat, those hands and feet pierced with the nails? Does He not say to
   you pointedly, "I did all this for you; what have you done for Me"?
   Startled in your seat, you cover your face and inwardly reply, "I will
   answer that question by the rest of my life. I will be first and
   foremost a servant of Jesus--not a trader, first, and a Christian,
   next, but a Christian, first, and a business man afterwards." You, my
   Sister, must say, "I will live for Christ as a daughter, a wife, or a
   mother. I will live for my Lord, for He has given Himself for me and I
   am not my own, but bought with a price."

   The true heart will feel a compulsion arising from a second reflection,
   namely, the glory of a life spent for God and for His Christ. What is
   the life of a man who toils in business, makes money, becomes rich and
   dies? It winds up with a paragraph in the Illustrated London News,
   declaring that he died worth so much--the wretch was not worth
   anything, him-self--his estate had value but he had none! Had he been
   worth anything, he would have sent his money about the world doing
   good. But as a worthless steward, he laid his Master's stores in heaps
   to rot. The life of multitudes of men is self-seeking! It is ill for a
   man to live the life of swine! What a poor creature is the usual
   ordinary man! But a life spent for Jesus, though it involve
   cross-bearing, is noble, heroic, sublime! The mere earthworm leads a
   dunghill life. A life of what is called pleasure is a mean, beggarly
   business. A life of keeping up respectability is utter slavery--as well
   be a horse in a pug-mill! A life wholly consecrated to Christ and His
   Cross is life, indeed--it is akin to the life of angels--yes, higher
   still, it is the life of God within the soul of man! O you that have a
   spark of true nobility, seek to live lives worth living, worth
   remembering, worthy to be the commencement of eternal life before the
   Throne of God!

   Some of you ought to feel the Cross coming upon your shoulders, this
   morning, when you think of the needs of those among whom you live. They
   are dying, perishing for lack of knowledge! Rich and poor, alike,
   ignorant of Christ! Multitudes of them wrapped up in
   self-righteousness! They are perishing and those who ought to warn them
   are often dumb dogs that cannot bark! Do you not feel that you ought to
   deliver the sheep from the wolf? Have you no heart of compassion? Are
   your hearts turned to steel? I am sure you cannot deny that the times
   demand of you earnest and forceful lives. No Christian man can now sit
   still without incurring awful guilt. Whether you live in London or in
   any other great town amidst reeking sin, or dwell in the country amidst
   the dense darkness which broods over many rural districts, you are
   under bonds to be up and doing! It may be a cross to you, but for
   Jesus' sake you must lift it up and never lay it down till the Lord
   calls you Home!

   Some of you should bear the Cross of Christ because the cause of Christ
   is at a discount where you dwell. I delight in a man in whom the
   lordlier chivalry has found a congenial home. He loves to espouse the
   cause of the Truth of God in the cloudy and dark day. He never counts
   heads, but weighs arguments. When he settles down in a town, he never
   enquires, "Where is the most respectable congregation? Where shall I
   meet with those who will advantage me in business?" No, he studies his
   conscience rather than his convenience. He hears one say, "There is a
   Nonconformist Chapel, but it is down a back street. There is a Baptist
   Church, but the members are nearly all poor and no gentlefolk are among
   them. Even the Evangelical Church is down at the heel--the best
   families attend the high church." I say he hears this and his heart is
   sick of such talk! He will go where the Gospel is preached and nowhere
   else! Fine architecture has scant charms for him--and grand music is no
   part of his religion! If these are substitutes for the Gospel, he
   abhors them. It is meanness, itself, for a man to forsake the Truth of
   God for the sake of respectability!

   Multitudes who ought to be found maintaining the good old cause are
   recreant to their convictions if, indeed, they ever had any! For this
   cause the true man resolves to stick to the Truth of God through thick
   and thin and not to forsake

   it because its adherents are poor and despised. If ever we might
   temporize, that time is past and gone. I warn yonder man, this morning,
   who has long been a Christian but has concealed half his Christianity
   in order to be thought respectable, or to escape the penalties of
   faithfulness! Come out from those with whom you are numbered, but with
   whom you are not united in heart! Be brave enough to defend a good
   cause against all comers, for the day shall come when he shall have
   honor for his reward who accepted dishonor that he might be true to his
   God, his Bible and his conscience. Blessed is he that can be loyal to
   his Lord, cost him what it may--loyal, even, in those matters which
   traitors call little things. We would compel that Simon, the Cyrenian,
   this day, to bear the Cross because there are so few to bear it in
   these degenerate days.

   Besides, I may say to some of you, you ought to bear the Cross because
   you know you are not satisfied--your hearts are not at rest. You have
   prospered in worldly things, but you are not happy. You have good
   health, but you are not happy. You have loving friends, but you are not
   happy. There is but one way of getting rest to the heart and that is to
   come to Jesus! These are His Words--"Come unto Me, all you that labor
   and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." If, after this, you
   need a further rest for other and higher longings, then you must come,
   again, to the same Savior and hearken to His next Words--"Take My yoke
   upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you
   shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is
   light." Some of you professors have not yet found perfect rest and the
   reason is because you have looked to the Cross for pardon, but you have
   never taken to cross-bearing as an occupation. You are hoping in Christ
   but not living for Christ! The finding of rest unto your soul will come
   to you in having something to do or to bear for Jesus. "Take My yoke
   upon you: and you shall find rest unto your souls." There are many
   ways, then, of bearing the Cross for Christ, and there are many reasons
   why some here present should begin, at once, to carry the load.

   IV. To close, bear with me a minute or two while I say that
   CROSS-BEARING IS A BLESSED OCCUPATION. I feel sure that Simon found it
   so. Let me mention certain blessings which must have attended the
   special service of Simon. First, it brought him into Christ's company.
   When they compelled him to bear His Cross, he was brought close to
   Jesus. If it had not been for that command, he might have gone his way,
   or might have been lost in the crowd. But now he is in the inner
   circle, near to Jesus! For the first time in his life, he saw that
   blessed form and, as he saw it, I believe his heart was enamored with
   it. As they lifted the Cross on his shoulders, he looked at that sacred
   Person and saw a crown of thorns about His brow. And as he looked at
   his fellow sufferer, he saw all down His cheeks the marks of bloody
   sweat and black and blue bruises from cruel hands. As for those eyes,
   they looked him through and through!

   That face, that matchless face, he had never seen its like. Majesty was
   therein blended with misery; innocence with agony and love with sorrow.
   He had never seen that Countenance so well, nor marked the whole form
   of the Son of Man so clearly if he had not been called to bear that
   Cross! It is wonderful how much we see of Jesus when we suffer or labor
   for Him. Believing Souls, I pray that this day you may be so impressed
   into my Lord's service that you may have nearer and dearer fellowship
   with Him than in the past! If any man will do His will, he shall know
   of the doctrine. They see Jesus best who carry His Cross most.

   Besides, the Cross held Simon in Christ's steps. Do you catch it? If
   Jesus carried the front part of the Cross and Simon followed behind, he
   was sure to put his feet down just where the Master's feet had been
   before. The Cross is a wonderful implement for keeping us in the way of
   our Lord. As I was turning this subject over, I was thinking how often
   I had felt a conscious contact between myself and my Lord when I have
   had to bear reproach for His sake--and how, at the same time, I have
   been led to watch my steps more carefully because of that very
   reproach! Brothers and Sisters, we do not want to slip from under the
   Cross. If we did, we might slip away from our Lord and from holy
   walking. If we can keep our shoulder beneath that sacred load and see
   our Lord a little ahead of us, we shall be making the surest progress!
   This being near to Jesus is a blessed privilege which is cheaply
   purchased at the price of cross-bearing! If you would see Jesus, bestir
   yourselves to work for Him! Boldly acknowledge Him! Cheerfully suffer
   for Him and then you shall see Him--and then you shall learn to follow
   Him, step by step! O blessed Cross which holds us to Jesus and to His
   ways!

   Then Simon had this honor, that He was linked with Christ's work. He
   could not put away sin, but he could assist weakness. Simon did not die
   on the Cross to make expiation, but he did live under the Cross to aid
   in the accomplishment of the Divine Purpose. You and I cannot interfere
   with Jesus in His passion, but we can share with Him in His commission.
   We cannot purchase liberty for the enslaved, but we can tell them of
   their emancipation. To have a finger in Christ's

   work is glory! I invite the man that seeks honor and immortality, to
   seek it thus. To have a share in the Redeemer's work is a more
   attractive thing than all the pomp and glitter of this world and the
   kingdoms thereof. Where are the men of heavenly mind who will covet to
   be joined unto the Lord in this ministry? Let them step out and say,
   "Jesus, I, my cross have taken. From now on I will follow You. Come
   life or death, I will carry Your Cross till You shall give me the
   crown."

   While Simon was carrying the Cross through the crowd, I doubt not that
   the rough soldiery would deal him many a kick or buffet--but I feel
   equally sure that the dear Master sometimes stole a glance at him.
   Simon enjoyed Christ's smile. I know the Lord so well that I feel sure
   He must have done so--He would not forget the man who was His partner
   for the while. And oh, that look! How Simon must have treasured up the
   remembrance of it! "I never carried a load that was so light," he says,
   "as that which I carried that morning, for when the Blessed One smiled
   at me amidst His woes, I felt myself to be strong as Hercules."
   Alexander, his first-born, and that red-headed lad, Rufus, when they
   grew up, both felt it to be the honor of the family that their father
   carried the Cross after Jesus. Rufus and Alexander had a patent of
   nobility in being the sons of such a man! Mark recorded the fact that
   Simon carried the Cross and that such-and-such persons were his sons. I
   think when the old man came to lie upon his deathbed, he said, "My hope
   is in Him whose Cross I carried. Blessed burden! Lay me down in my
   grave. This body of mine cannot perish, for it bore the Cross which
   Jesus carried and which carried Him. I shall rise, again, to see Him in
   His Glory, for His Cross has pressed me and His love will surely raise

   me."

   Happy are we if we can, while yet we live, be co-workers together with
   Him, that when He comes in His Kingdom, we may be partakers of His
   Glory! "Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is
   tried, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised
   to them that love Him." God bless you and especially you who have come
   out of the country. God bless you. Amen and amen!

The Foundation and Its Seal--a Sermon for the Times

   (No. 1854)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 9, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, 'The
   Lord knows them that are His,' and, 'Let everyone that names the name
   of Christ depart from iniquity." 2Timothy 2:19.

   PAUL had met with many difficulties in his earnest career, but his most
   painful trials came from false brethren. It is battle, enough, for the
   Church to contend with the world, but what is she to do when she has to
   contend with herself? To go forth weeping, bearing precious seed and,
   in due time, to reap it in the heat of the sun is toil enough for the
   farmer-- but what is he to do when the tares are sown among the wheat
   and they spring up and well-near choke the growing grain? He is
   distressed and knows not what to do! At first he is eager to root up
   the tares; then he fears that he might root up the wheat with them and
   so, at his Master's command, he lets both grow together until the
   harvest. This he does with tears in his eyes, for he foresees that
   those growing tares must do fearful mischief to the good seed and, in
   the end, where he looked for much, he will gather little.

   A compact army of brave spirits, every man in health and every man a
   hero, can march across a continent and strike at the foe, time after
   time--and every stroke shall fall as from the hammer of Thor. But if
   you have the leadership of a great and motley host--and there are many
   sick folk to be carried in the ambulances, while others are
   faint-hearted, cowardly and cold in the cause and, yet another company
   are half suspected of a design to go over to the adversary--then the
   captain's hair may well turn gray in a night at the thought of what may
   be the result of a battle! Paul was full of somewhat similar anxieties
   when about to leave the field of conduct to receive his crown. He was
   handing over his commission of Watchman of the Churches to Timothy and,
   as he did so, it was with a trembling hand, as he thought of the evil
   influences which were at work within the Church, itself. Outside
   persecution seemed light enough to him, but internal dissension, heresy
   and ungodliness weighed upon his spirit.

   When I read this Second Epistle to Timothy, it reminds me,
   somewhat--only it is a great improvement upon it--of David's addressing
   Solomon and reminding him of those who had given him trouble in his
   lifetime. He exhorted him how to deal wisely with them lest his kingdom
   should be disturbed by them. You notice that throughout the Epistle,
   the Apostle makes more mention of troublesome individuals than in any
   other letter. In the first chapter there is Phygellus and Hermogenes.
   And now we come upon Hymenaeus and Philetus. These dogs generally hunt
   in couples. A little further on you get Demas and Alexander, the
   coppersmith, who had done much evil to the Apostle. The departing
   saint, harboring no resentment, yet has great anxiety of spirit as to
   what these mischief-makers might do with a young man like Timothy,
   since they had been such thorns in his own side.

   It is a cheering thing to note that while Paul mentions these things
   with a gracious anxiety, they do not disturb the serenity of his faith,
   nor make him question, for a moment, the success of the cause, nor
   doubt the success of the work which the Lord had worked by his own
   hands. These are his words--"For I am now ready to be offered, and the
   time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have
   finished my course, I have kept the faith: therefore there is laid up
   for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge,
   shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them, also,
   that love His appearing." Courage, then, servant of God! Whatever may
   be your trials because of an apostatizing church, your faith will give
   you victory! Be faithful to the Word of the Holy Testimony and the
   Truth of God shall yet prevail. Live much in communion with your
   Master, for by His name shall you triumph!

   Project yourself into the eternal future. Feel the crown already upon
   your head when it is aching under many sorrows! Hear the Master's word,
   "Well done," when you are weary with the noise of them that oppose the
   Cross. Stand

   fast! Having done all, still stand! The campaign is not lost. Despite
   all that has happened, or ever shall happen, not one jot the less does,
   "the foundation of God stands sure." The work of God goes on and the
   reward which God gives to the workers is not diminished, nor even
   placed in danger. Therefore, in patience, possess your soul.

   This morning, with deep solemnity of soul, I approach this text and
   pray that the Spirit of God may bless it to us all. I see in it, three
   things. The first, perhaps, is rather in the context, it is the
   lamentable overthrow of which the Apostle has been speaking. He says
   that these two men, Hymenaeus and Philetus, overthrew the faith of
   some. Secondly, we shall survey the abiding foundation--"the foundation
   of God stands sure." And then, thirdly, the instructive inscription
   upon the foundation stone, "The Lord knows them that are His." And,
   "Let everyone that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."

   I. First, let us think, for a little, of THE LAMENTABLE OVERTHROW which
   the Apostle so much deplored.

   The Apostle observed with sorrow a general coldness. It was, in some
   respects, coldness towards himself, but in reality it was a turning
   away from the simplicity of the Doctrine of Salvation by Grace through
   faith. He says in the 15th verse of the previous chapter, "This you
   know, that all they which are in Asia are turned away from me; of whom
   are Phygellus and Hermogenes," two men, I suppose, of whom he had hoped
   better things--perhaps persons who had professed a warm attachment to
   him. Their departure was the unkindest cut of all.

   A great lack of spiritual life and zeal for the Truth of God is our
   trial, today. Laodicea is not the only Church that is neither cold nor
   hot. I am, at this moment, unwillingly compelled to believe that a very
   serious blight is upon many of our Churches. From a wide
   correspondence, I gather that a wintry chill is just now upon the
   Church--possibly it is not to such an extent as in certain terrible
   periods--but still to a very saddening degree. There is not that
   firmness in the faith, that holiness of life and that enthusiasm for
   the Cross of Christ that one would wish to see. I view the immediate
   prospect with serious anxiety. Yet, I was reading Mr. Bunyan's words
   concerning the age in which he lived and I find that he had similar
   apprehensions in his time. And I notice that before his day, each
   loyal-hearted man of God was troubled with similar fears.

   Nor were those fears childish--they were not a presumptuous trembling
   for the Ark of the Lord, but a godly jealousy lest the enemy should get
   an advantage over the hosts of God. It is a mercy that there should be
   somebody to complain; somebody to express the longing of the Church for
   better things. I am sure that there is grave reason for regret at this
   moment. Though we look with the greatest gratitude upon all the things
   that are good, we still have to look with heavy hearts upon much that
   is grievous to the Spirit of God in the Churches of the present day.

   Furthermore, the Apostle saw with much alarm that teachers were erring.
   He names two especially, Hymenaeus and Philetus, and he mentions the
   doctrine that they taught--not needlessly explaining it, but merely
   giving a hint at it. They taught, among other things, that the
   Resurrection was already past. I suppose they had fallen into the
   manner of certain in our day who spiritualize or rationalize
   everything. They say, "This is mythical! This death of Christ is to be
   understood as the triumph of self-sacrifice. This Resurrection of
   Christ means the revival of forgotten principles." Thus they hold an
   atonement which is no Atonement and a resurrection which is no
   Resurrection. They appear to accept the great historical fact and yet
   they reduce it to fiction! This is the subtlety of the old serpent!
   Somehow or other, these men manage to extract from the Gospel an
   attractive philosophy, but it is not the Gospel which God intended to
   be preached! They seek, rather, the wisdom of man's thought than the
   Revelation of God's thoughts. You need not that I go into particulars,
   for all around us men are dealing craftily with the Truth of
   God--adulterating it and in heart denying it. These are, by no means,
   persons to be trifled with--many of them are keen, acute, and
   thoughtful--and it is the great peril of the Church, at this moment,
   that she numbers such among her teachers. These can stab under the
   shield. We care not for the besiegers outside, but we are distressed
   because of the traitors within! God grant that this thing may go no
   further, but may His people become alarmed by the growing decline of
   the Church and resolve to be rid of this destructive influence which
   eats as does a canker.

   In Paul's day, many professors were apostatizing from the faith because
   of the evil leaders. Sheep are such creatures to follow something,
   that, when they do not follow the shepherd, they display great
   readiness to follow one another. When Hymenaeus and Philetus taught a
   highly intellectual doctrine, many people who fancied themselves to be
   cultured, must necessarily be of their mind. Hymenaeus had discovered a
   method of being abreast of the times, so that the Christian teacher
   could figure in the heathen academy and be complimented for his liberal
   views. These "cultured" teachers looked

   down with contempt upon those uncouth fishermen who were so unlearned
   and ignorant as to believe that the teaching of Jesus meant what it
   said, for they, themselves, gave the Gospel a more rational meaning!
   They thought themselves profound and eclectic men who could see the
   soul of things and, therefore, they rejected the simplicity of the
   Cross and put in its place the theories of the philosophers. They took
   away the foundation facts under the pretence of building higher and
   thus the faith of many was overthrown.

   Take away the Resurrection and what remains of the Gospel? The
   Resurrection of Christ and the consequent resurrection of His people is
   the keystone of the arch of the Christian system! And if that is
   removed as a myth, the whole building falls. The Apostle saw numbers of
   persons led astray by this error as, alas, we see many in these times
   deluded with kindred falsehoods! It becomes Christian men, nowadays, to
   carefully discriminate as to what they hear. I read, the other day, a
   complaint as to small towns having many chapels where one might have
   sufficed. Truly, one might suffice if the Gospel were faithfully
   preached in it, but a score would not be enough if, in them all, there
   was an absence of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and of the life and power
   of the Holy Spirit! When another Gospel is introduced, those who love
   the Truth of God are bound to enter their earnest protest and to form
   another congregation. I am for unity in the life and Truth of God, and
   for our coming closer and closer together--spiritual men to spiritual
   men--but that is quite another thing from making an aggregate of this
   great motley mass of Christian profession and unchristian teaching,
   since it has so little of the true life of Christ within it! Would to
   God that in every place where Christ is preached professedly, He were
   preached truthfully! Oh that you who profess to follow Christ were
   really doing so! But what is the chaff to the wheat? How much of chaff
   is mixed with every heap that lies upon our Lord's threshing floor!

   Paul also deplored that ungodliness increased. He says that the profane
   and vain babblings of his time increased unto more ungodliness. O
   Brothers and Sisters, it is godliness that we need--the living of the
   soul with God, in God and to God. We need a holy fear of God, a sacred
   sense of God, a true delight in God! We need less of man and more of
   God! Less of mere creed-repeating and more of vital faith in God. Less
   following of men and more following of God in Christ Jesus. More of
   union with God, living in God and likeness to God. Oh that He would
   work this in us! The world grows dark with accursed lusts and the
   Christian Church grows more conformed to the ungodly world.
   Persecutions unto death have ceased--it is easy and respectable to bear
   the Christian name--and, therefore, the separation from the world,
   which is the glory of Christians, becomes less and less apparent!

   My heart is sorely wounded with the sight of some who will come into
   God's house and undertake God's service during the Sabbath and yet,
   during the week they are unjust, oppressive, graceless and greedy--not
   servants of God, but servants of self and sin! By unholy professors,
   the Cross is dishonored, the Holy Spirit is grieved and Christ is put
   to an open shame! All this vexed the heart of the Apostle in his day
   and it is our cross and burden at this hour. "Lord have mercy upon us!
   Christ have mercy upon us!"

   II. Now let us turn to the subject which supplied Paul with
   consolation. He speaks of the ABIDING FOUNDATION--"Nevertheless the
   foundation of God stands sure." It is a joy to quit the ever-moving
   flood for the firm, substantial rock. It is bliss to feel that there is
   something under your feet, something substantial, abiding, sure.
   "Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands sure." Though the earth is
   removed and though the mountains are carried into the midst of the
   sea--though the waters thereof roar and are troubled and though the
   mountains shake with the swelling thereof-- yet will we not fear, for
   the Lord Jehovah changes not!

   What is this foundation which stands sure? Those who have interpreted
   the passage have given many meanings to it, but I believe that all
   those meanings are really one. For the sake of clearness, I would give
   three answers to the enquiry-- the foundation is, secretly, the purpose
   of God; doctrinally, the Truth of God; effectively, the Church of
   God--in all, the system of God whereby He glorifies His Grace. The
   foundation is the Divine purpose. Though men prove fickle, false,
   wicked and the Church is sorely grieved, "nevertheless" God's purpose
   is carried out! The Covenant of Grace is fulfilled and the Glory of God
   is revealed. God has a grand design from which He has never swerved,
   no, not by so much as a hair's breadth! His purpose shall stand! He
   will do all His pleasure. It is incumbent upon us to believe in the
   responsibility of men and to feel the weight of that Truth, for as a
   Truth of God, it is of the most solemn importance. It is our duty to
   give ourselves up with all our might to the doing of that which is
   right, as if all things depended on us. Yet when we are baffled by
   matters which are beyond our control, it is a blessed thing to fall
   back upon the purpose and Providence of the Almighty--and feel that
   though we are defeated--He cannot be! There is a power high over all
   which works for

   righteousness. The Messiah "shall not fail nor be discouraged till He
   has set judgement in the earth and the isles shall wait for His Law."
   The Divine design in creation shall be effected and in redemption and
   in Providence, it shall be the same. The Lord shall be, at the last,
   victor all along the line! The good shall glorify Him and even the evil
   shall be compelled to magnify the greatness of His majesty. "The Lord
   reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad
   thereof." God Himself, who is in very deed the Foundation of all
   things, stands sure!

   The Apostle also meant the Divine Truth, which is the foundation of the
   Gospel. He had been speaking about certain Truths of God which were
   spirited away by those two unworthies, Hymenaeus and Philetus, and he
   says, "Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure." Interpreters
   have thought that Paul points at the doctrine of the Resurrection. No
   doubt he does, but he includes every other doctrine which is a
   foundational Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Yonder is a man who
   has proved that Jesus is not truly God. Let him prove what he likes,
   since Jesus is God for all that! Another man has disproved the
   substitutionary Atonement of Christ--let him disprove it if he pleases,
   for it is just as true! Rhetoric and logic can do wonders in
   appearance, but they do nothing in reality. The orator's thunder has
   not shaken the unchangeable Truth of God! He is proud of his triumphs,
   but as we look into the Book and look into the dear Master's face, we
   feel that, "nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure."

   No Truth of God has ever been destroyed by all the fires through which
   it has passed! The fire which tried the bush in the wilderness was a
   much more potent element than any that men can kindle, for it was God's
   own Presence and He is, emphatically, "a consuming fire." Yet the bush
   was not consumed by such a fire! What, then, can destroy it? Even so,
   since the Truth can stand the test of God, the All-Trying One, depend
   upon it, it can endure the test of such poor fires as man can bring to
   bear upon it! In a broad Scotch version I read, "The bush lowe'd and
   was nane the waur"--that is to say, "it was none the worse." Brethren,
   the Gospel is none the worse for all the opposition which has
   surrounded it, though it has been as fierce as a devouring flame! Only
   the additions of men have been burnt out of it. Everything that can be
   consumed ought to be consumed and only that which cannot be burned is
   really God's eternal Truth. All that has happened by all the
   controversy of all the ages, is that man's fiction has been separated
   from God's foundation--man's speculation has been purged out of God's
   Revelation! The foundation of God stands sure and, oh, the joy of this
   fact to every heart that loves the Lord!

   But, further, I think Paul meant, here, not only the purpose of God and
   the Truth of God, but God's Divine work in the world in the salvation
   of His own. The Divine Election of God has been fulfilled so far--and
   those whom God has really saved--in whom there has been a real work of
   Grace, stand sure when all others are overthrown. You look upon the
   Church and lament that so many have turned aside; that so many others
   are very poor specimens of Christians; that so many more are sadly
   questionable and that a certain company are evidently false. Well, it
   is very sad, but there is a remnant according to the election of
   Grace--"the foundation of God stands sure." Those who were really laid
   upon the foundation by the Spirit of God--those who are vitally united
   to Christ--these still stand firm in faith and character! Those who are
   truly born of God live unto God! The righteous hold on their way. The
   choice spirits endure unto the end. Does not Jesus say, "My sheep hear
   My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me"? Does He not declare
   that, "A stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for
   they know not the voice of strangers"?

   The teachers of error would, if it were possible, have deceived the
   very elect, but the chosen detect the deception by the spiritual
   discernment which is in them and by the teaching of the Holy Spirit!
   They love the Truth and live the Truth--and the Truth lives in them.
   Thus in their persons, "the foundation of God stands sure." Brothers
   and Sisters, let us take great joy in this foundation of God, this
   faithful Church of God which is steadfast and immovable in the day of
   blasphemy and rebuke. Blessed be the name of the Lord, He still has a
   quickened people! He still has a Church in the world--in all
   communities of professing Christians, there is a secret seed of
   faithful ones--and while the floods and the winds have driven down the
   stream, the many towering houses that were built upon the sand, yet the
   house of God still stands upon the Rock!

   It is not yet complete so as to be fully built as the great House of
   God is to be. At the present it wears, rather, the aspect of a
   foundation, or basement, than of a house--but it will rise by degrees
   to be a fair palace--and even now the King, Himself, deigns to dwell in
   it! What there is of the true Church is a sure prophecy of what there
   shall be before long. "The foundation of God stands sure." Let us take
   courage from this and be not sorely moved nor dismayed in the day of
   apostasy. "They went out from us, but they were not of us." The
   hireling flees because he is an hireling. Let us not

   dwell exclusively upon the mournful side, lest we lose that joy of the
   Lord which is our strength. Our Master wept over Jerusalem, once, but
   He also rejoiced in spirit when His mind looked another way. In His
   heart He always mourned over the woes of ungodly men, but still, He
   thought and spoke of more cheering themes--and so must we. It would not
   become us to let any one form of thought penetrate our hearts through
   and through with painful monotony. You can contemplate the sad side of
   things till you become so wretched as to be unable to do good! Have a
   brave and hopeful heart. When you see a black cloud, look for its
   silver lining. When you see that which looked like substantial material
   consumed in the fire, be thankful that if the wood and hay are gone,
   the gold and silver remain. God is laying a foundation for the future,
   a foundation so sure that it cannot be moved! And He will build upon
   it, course after course of jeweled stones till its walls, great and
   high, appear unto all men!

   Soon shall we see its windows of agate and its gates of carbuncle. Soon
   shall the glittering pinnacles of "the terrible crystal" shine in the
   eternal light and, best of all, we shall inhabit the house forever and
   go no more out, for the Lord God and the Lamb shall be the Glory of
   that House and His faithful ones shall be built into it as living
   stones! Pluck up courage, then, and stand in your place, O you who are
   trembling! Let, "Onward!," be your watchword! Victory is not so far
   away as we fear. The retreat of yonder cowards is nothing--the turning
   back of the men of Ephraim is according to their nature. But be strong
   and quit yourselves like men, for the Lord of Hosts is with us, the God
   of Jacob is our refuge!

   III. Now, we are, in the third place, as we may be helped of the Holy
   Spirit, to look at this foundation and observe

   THE INSTRUCTIVE INSCRIPTION. I think this figure best expresses the
   Apostle's intent. He represents the foundation stone as bearing an
   inscription upon it, like the stone mentioned by the Prophet Zechariah,
   of which we read, "I will engrave the graving thereof, says the Lord of
   Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day." The
   custom of putting inscriptions upon foundation stones is ancient and
   general. In the days of the Pharaohs, the royal cartouche was impressed
   upon each brick that was placed in buildings raised by royal authority.
   The structure was thus known to have been erected by a certain Pharaoh.
   Here we have the royal cartouche, or seal, of the King of Kings set
   upon the foundation of the great palace of the Church. The House of
   Wisdom bears, on its forefront and foundation, the seal of the Lord.
   The Jews were known to write texts of Scripture upon the doorposts of
   their houses--in this, also, we have an illustration of our text.

   The Lord has set upon His purpose, His Gospel, His Truth, the double
   mark described in the text--the Divine Election and the Divine
   Sanctification. This seal is placed to declare that it belongs to the
   Lord, alone, and to set it apart for His personal habitation. Does not
   the Lord thus say, "This is My rest forever: here will I dwell; for I
   have desired it"? By His choice and by His sanctifying Grace, He has
   formed a people for Himself and they shall show forth His praise. The
   inscription, moreover, is put upon the foundation stone, that every man
   may take heed how he builds on it. We cannot be sure, when we build,
   that every stone we place upon the foundation is well and truly laid
   there--"The Lord knows them that are His." But we have this mark to
   guide us--those who truly name the name of Christ depart from all
   iniquity. "By their fruits you shall know them."

   We are to use judgement in our building and this is the rule of it--we
   must look for holiness in every real convert, for, "without holiness no
   man shall see the Lord." It is labor in vain to build those into the
   visible Church who are not sanctified in the spirit of their minds. In
   doctrine, also, it is in vain to preach unless our doctrine is
   according to godliness. A holy God will not dwell with an unholy
   people! If the foundation is holy, so must the building be. The seal
   upon the foundation is the mark of the builder and the indication of
   the object of that which is built. It is intended to denote the
   character of the entire edifice, for God's building is all of one piece
   and of one nature throughout. On each individual Christian, who is
   truly so, there is the private seal of Divine knowledge and the public
   seal of Divine likeness. God knows and approves each true Believer and
   each true Believer proves his knowledge of God and his delight in Him
   by departing from iniquity.

   My inmost soul vehemently desires to aid in building up a Church that
   shall be composed of men approved of God-- God-fearing, God-loving men
   and women in whom God lives and who, therefore, live unto Him! What a
   Church this will be! Upon such a people will be seen the second mark,
   for they will hate all sin and flee from it. They love that which is
   good, true, loving and God-like. In us these two things must
   meet--God's free and sovereign Grace towards us and our hearty and
   practical obedience to His will, or else we are not His sealed ones and
   are not built on His sealed foundation.

   If I might use another illustration, I can suppose that when the stones
   for the Temple were quarried in the mountains, each one received a
   special mark from Solomon's seal, marking it as a Temple stone and,
   perhaps, denoting its place in the sacred edifice. This would be like
   the first inscription, "The Lord knows them that are His." But the
   stone would not long lie in the quarry. It would be taken away from its
   fellows, after being marked for removal. Here is the transport mark in
   the second inscription--"Let everyone that names the name of Christ
   depart from iniquity." The first seal marked it for the Lord, the
   second secured its removal from the common stones around it. First
   comes election and then sanctification follows. I want every professing
   Christian to have that double mark and so to be Christ's man, known of
   all to be such by coming out from the unclean and being separated unto
   the Lord. Remember the words of the Prophet Isaiah--"Depart you, depart
   you, go you out from them, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the
   midst of her; be you clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord."

   Carefully follow me while I notice that the first mark is concerning
   God and us, and the second mark is concerning us and God.

   The first is concerning God and us. "The Lord knows them that are His."
   He knows, that is, He foresees and predestinates, for, "whom He did
   foreknow He also did predestinate." Those that are His, He always has
   known to be His, for they were His from before the foundation of the
   world! They are His known ones when He deals with them in Grace and
   comes into their hearts by His powerful operations. He watches over
   them by a special Providence, knowing the way that they take and never
   losing sight of them.

   The text teaches us that the Lord discriminates--"The Lord knows them
   that are His." Some who bear His name are not His and He knows them
   not. He will say of them at the last, "I never knew you." They are
   supposed to be His. They suppose themselves to be His--they are taken
   into His Church as His, they continue throughout a long life nominally
   His--but they are discovered at the last. There is another and severer
   test than that of ministers, elders and Church votes--the Lord knows
   the secret things of the heart. Be not deceived, God is not mocked!
   There is an eye that has no failure in its vision, but sees to the very
   soul of things and reads the hypocrite despite his pretended sanctity!
   This discernment on the part of God should make us walk very truthfully
   before Him. Let none of us profess to be the Lord's unless we are
   such--nor ever pretend to an experience which we have not truly felt,
   for the Lord cannot be, in any measure, deceived--He searches the heart
   and tries the reins of the children of men.

   "The Lord knows them that are His," signifies that He is familiar with
   them and communes with them. They that are really the Lord's property
   are also the Lord's company--He has conversation with them. They know
   Him and He knows them. He makes Himself known to them and they make
   themselves known to Him. O Brothers and Sisters, do you know God? Does
   God know you? Will He ever say, "I never knew you"? When I have been
   cast down, I have said unto the Lord--"Lord, You cannot say You do not
   know me, for I have knocked at Your door by the hour together! I have
   burdened You with my needs and haunted You with my groans. I have been
   Your daily beggar, receiving large alms at Your hands." It is a blessed
   thing to be sure that we are not unknown in Heaven. At least we have
   the fellowship of asking and receiving, if no more.

   Further, the words imply God's preservation of His own, for when God
   knows a man, He approves him and, consequently, preserves him. "The
   Lord knows them that are His" and He will keep such to the end. This
   man, Hymenaeus, and his fellow, Philetus, may deceive many, but the
   Lord, who is the true Pastor of the Church, will keep His own sheep
   according to His word--"I give unto My sheep eternal life and they
   shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."
   This is the first seal of the sure foundation. Be not afraid of it.
   "The Lord knows them that are His."

   The second seal is concerning us and God--"Let everyone that names the
   name of Christ depart from iniquity." Observe how the practical always
   goes with the doctrinal in holy Scripture. Those whom Free Grace
   chooses, Free Grace cleanses. We are not chosen because we are holy,
   but chosen to be holy and, being chosen, the purpose is no dead letter,
   but we are made to seek after holiness. Note that the word is universal
   as to Believers--"Let everyone that names the name of Christ depart
   from iniquity." You expect ministers to be careful in their conduct and
   so they should be. But are not their people under the same obligation?
   Elders and deacons are expected to be gracious. This, indeed, is as it
   should be, but why not those of whom they are the servants? Let
   everyone that is called a Christian, or trusts Christ, or preaches
   Christ, or teaches Christ, flee far from the ways of unrighteousness!

   This is a sweeping precept as to the thing to be avoided--let him,
   "depart from iniquity"--not from this or that crime or folly, but from
   iniquity, itself, from everything that is evil, from everything that is
   unrighteous or unholy! O you Christian people, be holy, for Christ is
   holy! Do not pollute that holy name by which you are named. O you
   people of God, if you are, indeed, the Lord's, let no sin dwell with
   you! Do not say, "It is a constitutional sin." You are born again, what
   have you to do with the old constitution but to mortify it? Do not say,
   "Oh, but others do it." What have you to do with others?--to their own
   master they stand or fall! Depart from iniquity on your own account,
   even as Israel departed out of Egypt. Let your family life, your
   personal life, your business life be as holy as Christ, your Lord,
   would have it to be.

   The text is very decisive--it does not say, "Let him put iniquity on
   one side," but, "Let him depart from it." Get away from evil. All your
   lives long travel further and further from it.

   Do you know where my text originally came from? I believe it was taken
   from the Book of Numbers. Read in the 16th chapter the story of Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram. In the Septuagint, almost the same words occur as
   those now before us. Moses and Aaron were the servants of God and they
   were, so to speak, the foundation of the building of the Jewish
   Commonwealth. Moses was faithful in all his house. Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram rebelled and sought to overthrow that foundation--and Moses
   replied to them, "The Lord will show who are His, and who are holy; and
   will cause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He has chosen will
   He cause to come near to Him." So Moses bids them come and bring their
   censers and officiate as priests, if they dare to do so. There they
   stand and there stands Aaron and the Lord knows and shows who are His!

   Now, turn to the 26th verse of the same chapter and read, "Depart, I
   pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
   theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins." Then the faithful fled
   away from their tents on every side and, before long, the ground split
   asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth and
   swallowed them up. What a parallel is the whole chapter with my text!
   And what a warning to all who teach false doctrine within the Church of
   God! Judgment will surely overtake them. The Lord shall "gather out of
   His Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity and
   shall cast them into a furnace of fire." The Lord Jesus is exercising
   discipline in His Church every day. It is no trifling matter to be a
   Church member and no small business to be a preacher of the Gospel. If
   you name the name of Christ, you will either be settled in Him or
   driven from Him! There is continually going on an establishment of
   living stones upon the foundation and a separating from it of the
   rubbish which gathers.

   Come to Christ, we say, and oh that you would come! But still do not
   come to Him pretendedly and nominally, for, "His fan is in His hand and
   He will thoroughly purge His floor." To and fro goes that great
   winnowing fan and every breath of the wind drives away chaff that looks
   like wheat! Who can tell, by sight, what it is? The good grain falls to
   the ground, but lo, the chaff is blown away! Yonder fire that is
   burning outside the threshing floor destroys it. Judgment must begin at
   the House of God! The Lord may let the wicked remain in this world
   unpunished for many a day, but if you come near to Him, He will be
   sanctified in you, or upon you. There is discipline within my Master's
   house and if you come under His roof, you must come under that
   discipline. For this cause in olden times many were sick in the
   Churches and many died prematurely--and it is still so, for within His
   great house a jealous God maintains a strict rule. Thus says the Lord,
   "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I
   will punish you for all your iniquities." Look how He dealt with
   Ananias and Sapphira within the Church, while many a liar outside of it
   grows gray in falsehood! Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord because
   they offered strange fire, while many another man has lived on in the
   blackest iniquities. For Achan's sin, the whole nation of Israel was
   sorely troubled! What a solemn thing is iniquity in the Church of God!

   Brothers and Sisters, I conclude with a brief but earnest appeal. Let
   us seek after the highest degree of holiness. Let us not be satisfied
   with being nominal Christians! Let us aim at the greatest measure of
   godliness. Let us plunge into the stream of Grace, immersing ourselves
   wholly into the life of God. How many professors appear to know nothing
   of the real force and energy of the Spirit of God in subduing sin and
   creating holiness! Theirs is a shallow life. Alas, how much they lose!
   They come under the obligations of the House of God, but they do not
   know the infinite privileges of that house. It is for the truly
   spiritual that God reserves the choicest of His dainties. Be half a
   Christian and you shall have enough religion to make you miserable--be
   wholly a Christian and your joy shall be full! Walk with God in the
   light as He is in the light and you shall have fellowship with Him,
   such as shall make earth akin to Heaven!

   But take a little light and a little darkness and attempt to make a
   mixture of them--seek to join the Church and the world--and you shall
   have neither the pleasures of the world nor the comforts of the Spirit.
   It is a pity for a man to miss joys which an angel might covet! What an
   injury such professors are to the Church! Each one pulls his companions
   up or drags them down. Every man in the Church is either a help or a
   hindrance. No Christian man can live to himself. He may attempt to
   confine himself within his own ribs, button up his coat and fancy that
   what he does is to himself, alone, and that his tongue and his heart
   are his own, but it is not so. A smell steals forth from every man's
   life and it is either like the spikenard of the alabaster box, or like
   the reeking of a dung-hill. God help us to remember our influence upon
   others!

   Think, also, how much the world is injured by Christians who are not
   Christians! Oh Friends, we need, nowadays, a sterling Christianity! We
   cannot do with German silver, now! We must have the real metal. I was
   about to say I would sooner you had no religion and made no pretence to
   having any, than to have the imitation of it. Sin is real today. We
   have heard enough of how far sinners will go--they venture not only to
   the brink of Hell, but they snatch the accursed fire out of the pit,
   itself, and bring it into our city! Shall saints be shams, when sinners
   are so real? Shall Baal have worshippers that cut themselves with
   knives and leap upon his altar in the frenzy of their lust--and shall
   Jehovah have only a faithless company who, as yet, are halting between
   two opinions and do not know whether He is God or not? Oh for a Church
   of God that will shake itself loose from the world! If we had but one
   such Church, there would be hope for our age. God send it!

   Last of all, how is Christ shamed and dishonored when we are not holy,
   but worldly, covetous, proud and unloving! Oh, Sirs, it seems to me
   that since the foundation of God was laid in agony and bloody sweat
   and, since God Himself became Incarnate that He might lay the
   foundation of holiness in the world, we ought to take heed how and what
   we build thereon! We must come to it, for, "other foundation can no man
   lay." And it behooves us to come very solemnly to it and to know what
   we mean by building thereon. True godliness is not to say, "I believe,"
   but to believe! Not to talk of repentance, but to repent! It is not to
   speak of regeneration, but to be born again! It is not to talk about
   consecration, but really to live to God! It is not to speak about the
   Holy Spirit, but to have Him dwelling in you!

   Be it ours to have the Truth of God in the inward parts and Grace in
   the core of the heart. Oh, may God bring us to this! We ask it for our
   Lord Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

What is the Verdict?

   (No. 1855)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 16, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Beloved, if our heart condemns us not, then have we confidence toward
   God." 1 John 3:21.

   CAREFULLY observe that this text is spoken to the people of God. It
   speaks to those who are called, "beloved." These are the people who are
   especially loved of God and of His people. It is a very sweet and
   endearing title, but it evidently, in this case, belongs only to those
   who are of the family of Grace--these, alone, can remain uncondemned of
   their hearts and live in confidence towards God. I want you to observe
   this because there are different ways of addressing different people
   and these ways are instructive. To those who are not yet numbered among
   the beloved, we preach the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
   It is a Gospel intended for the sinful and it talks to them of pardon
   bought with blood--it is a Gospel intended for the ungodly and it
   speaks to them of the work of the Holy Spirit, whereby their ungodly
   hearts may be renewed. Its tale is altogether of Grace and free favor
   and the passing by of transgression, iniquity and sin to all those who
   cast themselves believingly at Jesus' feet. That is the voice of
   Scripture to those who, as yet, are not beloved. The hope is that the
   Lord will call them beloved who were not beloved--and that in the place
   where it was said, "They are not My people," they shall be called the
   people of the living God!

   But when we come to speak to those who are saved, to those who are the
   beloved of God, we deal not with the pardon of criminals, but with the
   conduct of children. They are saved in the Lord with an everlasting
   salvation and, therefore, we do not so much urge them to saving faith
   as to the higher degree of boldness which grows out of faith--to that
   confidence towards God which is the right and privilege of the heirs of
   salvation! We want them not only to know that they have believed, but
   to be assured of it and to enjoy that holy familiarity with God, that
   blessed boldness towards God, that sweet joy and restfulness of spirit
   which are their privilege as the beloved of the Lord. These enjoyments
   may be had by them if they will be obedient to the directions of the
   Spirit of God which are laid down by the beloved Apostle in this
   Epistle.

   As soon as we become children, we are freed from the condemning power
   of the Law. We are not under the principle and motive of the Law of
   Works, but yet we are not without Law unto Christ. We come under those
   sacred regulations which rule the household of God. We are dealt with
   not as mere subjects are ruled by a king, but as children are governed
   by a father. We come from under that Law which was promulgated with
   thunder and lightning and the sound of a trumpet waxing exceedingly
   loud and long, and we listen to the gentle voice of the Man, Christ
   Jesus. We come from under that Law which did not permit even a beast to
   touch the mountain, but kept all Israel at a distance by boundaries set
   about the mountain, and we draw near with glad hearts unto the Lord. We
   come, I say, from under the Law and we feel the sway of love. "You are
   not under the Law, but under Grace" and, therefore, sin shall not have
   dominion over you. We have come into the family of God--and in that
   family there is a rule and discipline devised by love and carried out
   with infinite compassion. Upon our obedience to that discipline, our
   peace and prosperity depend. If we so live that our hearts condemn us
   not, then have we confidence towards God.

   It appears from the text that this child-like confidence towards God
   originally arises out of a certain solemn trial of our case. There is
   to be a trial within the heart, or conscience--a trial in which every
   power of the inner nature is to take its part as prosecutor, witness,
   jury, or judge. Out of this trial comes the non-condemnation which
   gives birth to "confidence toward God." At this time I shall bring
   before you, first, the trial in the inward court of the heart.
   Secondly, the acquittal pronounced by this court, "If our heart condemn
   us not." And thirdly, the result, the confidence which comes of this

   acquittal. "If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward
   God." May the Holy Spirit teach us while we think on these things!

   I. I want you to think of THE TRIAL HELD IN THE INNER COURT OF MAN'S
   NATURE, within his heart. It is a sort of petty session, not the Great
   Assize. Conscience sits within us, as judges sometimes sit in chambers,
   hearing cases, as they say, in camera. If we are righteously acquitted
   in this first court, then the matter is ended and we have confidence
   toward God. But if our heart condemn us; if in this preliminary trial
   we are condemned, it is an evil omen, for the probability is that the
   great all-knowing Judge will more than confirm the sentence.
   Condemnation by our own conscience is a bad sign, though there is a
   court of appeal. If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our
   heart and knows all things.

   I will now speak upon this trial under the heads of certain
   observations.

   This trial is studiously avoided by very many. Many professors shun
   anything like a testing of their profession--any trying of their
   religion by examination. Multitudes of persons seldom think! They live
   the life of butterflies, flitting from flower to flower with careless
   wing--there is no real purpose in their lives. Many others think, and
   think deeply, but not about their souls or their God. They consider the
   matter of their relationship to their Creator to be a very secondary
   matter which can be taken up in the last few minutes of their lives,
   when the death sweat is on their brow and they are quite incapable of
   proper judgment! They leave, I say, the best things to the worst
   moments and think that they are wise in so doing! This is a grave folly
   and ought not to rule a man in his senses.

   Certain Christian professors, too, who should know better, seldom
   examine themselves as to whether they are in the faith. They take it
   for granted that all is well with them. They made a profession a great
   many years ago. They have been decent sort of people ever since--in
   fact, they have been respected among their fellow Christians--possibly
   they have even taken office in the Church. Are they to question their
   foundation? Is it necessary that they should put themselves into the
   scales and be weighed again? It is a very ominous sign for a man, when
   he is afraid of discussing his spiritual state in the chamber of his
   own heart. I am persuaded that many Christians are the subjects of
   doubts and fears about their own condition simply because they have
   never thought the matter out. It is a great deal better to sift an
   affair to the bottom than it is to be always tormented by suspicion. If
   I must go to sea and I suspect the soundness of the vessel, I shall
   demand that the ship be surveyed and that I know whether it is a rotten
   old coffin, or whether it is a good substantial ship.

   I do not think it is a healthy state of things for man to be always
   singing--

   "'Tis a point I long to know."

   Brothers and Sisters, you ought to know whether you love the Lord or
   not! Your love must be very cold and feeble if it is a matter of
   question! Warmth of love proves its own existence in many ways. Friend,
   you should be anxious to the last degree to take stock of your
   spiritual estate. Your desire should be to know the very worst of your
   case. If your condition should turn out to be horribly bad, you had
   better know it--certainly your knowing it will not make it any worse!
   If your case should turn out to be all right, then you will have the
   confidence that comes of this knowledge--the confidence of which our
   text speaks. If our hearts, after due, deliberate and impartial trial,
   condemn us not, then we have confidence toward God and that confidence
   sweetens life! He that gets confidence through honest searching of
   heart shall be filled with delight and strength. But, I repeat it
   sadly, many avoid the inward trial of the heart--they will not bring
   their case into the spiritual court, even though the Judgement Seat is
   set up in the privacy of their own inward nature! Thus they walk on
   blindfolded to the brink of the precipice. God grant the bandage may be
   taken off before they have taken the final and fatal step.

   But secondly, let us note that genuine Christians very much frequent
   this court of conscience. They long to have their condition put to a
   thorough test, lest they be deceived. I have known some Christians even
   stay too much in this court-- they so often test themselves that it
   looks as if they would spend their lives in making trials of their
   state. Looking within can be easily overdone--we ought to have higher
   work than that of continually laying the foundation of repentance from
   dead works. When a ship first leaves the stocks, it is well for it to
   go on a trial trip, but to have a ship always being tried would be very
   absurd--it is time that it took voyages in real earnest and was
   registered in the merchant service-- there will then be trial enough in
   the actual execution of service.

   Some Christians, by a continual introspection, are always raising the
   point, "Am I a Christian?" Brothers and Sisters, be a Christian! "Am I
   a child of God?" Brothers and Sisters, be a child of God and enjoy it!
   And do not spend a lifetime in searching for the family register.
   However, it is certain that the genuine Christian is not averse to
   self-examination, nor to any form of test through which he can be put.
   If you are right with God, your prayer will be, "Search me, O God, and
   know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there is any
   wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. O my God, I do
   not wish to be deluded with 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace! I
   do not want to deceive myself, or to be lulled into soft slumbers upon
   the dainty bed of presumption. No, let me be emptied from vessel to
   vessel rather than be suffered to settle upon my lees. Let me be
   searched with candles rather than harbor sin within me. Let me even be
   thrust into the fire rather than remain base metal, the counterfeit of
   the King's money." Make sure work for eternity. Be certain, by the
   witness of the Holy Spirit within you, that you are, indeed, the
   children of God! The spirit of the true man answers to this--he is
   always willing to set in order the court of conscience and make solemn
   trial of his heart and life.

   In this court, dear Friends, the question to be decided is a very
   weighty one. What is that question, do you think? I do not think it is
   the question, "Am I perfect?" because we can solve that without holding
   a formal court. The question is not, "Am I absolutely free from sin?"
   for, "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth
   is not in us." The question is this, "Am I sincere in the truth? Is my
   religion true and am I true in my profession of it?" Next, "Does love
   rule in my nature?" All this chapter deals with love and teaches us
   that the possession of love is the supreme test of our state. Note the
   14th verse--"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because
   we love the brethren. He that loves not his brother abides in death."
   The enquiry is--"Do I love God? Do I also love my brother? Is my spirit
   that of love--for, if not, I am not a child of God."

   Then the next question is, "Do I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?" In
   the verse which succeeds my text, this is put as a great test, that we
   believe in Jesus Christ. Faith is the main question for conscience to
   decide, together with the following one, "Do I also keep His
   Commandments? Do I obey God? Do I seek to be holy as Jesus is holy? Or
   am I living in known sin and tolerating that in myself which does not
   and cannot please God?" The verse that follows my text puts it, "We
   keep His Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His
   sight." And the question is, "Do we not only try to keep the
   Commandments, but do we do so because it is pleasing to God? Is my
   master motive to please God? Do I want to be an Enoch, who had this
   testimony, that he pleased God? Do I keep His Commandments and labor to
   please Him?"

   These are the questions to be tried in the court of conscience and
   never was there a weightier issue! On this, our eternal state depends!
   It is not your estate that is now at stake; it is not your health that
   is now in question. It is your living unto God, your being now a child
   of God and so being prepared to face the mysterious solemnities of
   eternity. O Sirs, do not hesitate to take these matters into the court
   of conscience! If you have avoided that court before, attend it, now,
   and give your soul a solemn hearing!

   This court is guided by a mass of evidence. That evidence has not to be
   sought for--it is there already! If the case were to be, "Do my fellow
   men think me a child of God; do they regard me as being a Believer in
   whom faith works by love?" that would be a difficult question because
   we would have to subpoena so many to give their opinion of our private
   and public life. But in this case, we have nothing to do with
   outsiders--the conscience is the witness as well as the judge and jury!
   The whole case is carried on within. We cannot object to the witnesses,
   for they are our own heart and conscience. We must believe what these
   say. Nor can we object to the judgement, since our own conscience is
   judge and we are not at all likely to be unjust towards ourselves. We
   are so partial and there is so much of flattering deceit and self-love
   about us, that we could not wish to be tried by a more favoring judge
   than our own conscience! We cannot decline the jurisdiction under any
   pretence of prejudice against us.

   And, oh, what a mass of evidence our heart can furnish--evidence even
   more conclusive than that of outward actions! Memory rises up and says,
   "I remember all you have done since your profession of conversion--your
   shortcomings and breaches of the Covenant." The will confesses to
   offenses which never ripened into acts for lack of opportunity. The
   passions admit outbreaks which were concealed from human observation.
   The imagination is made to bear testimony-- and what a sinful power
   that imagination is and how difficult it is to govern it--its tale is
   sad to hear! Our tempers confess to evil anger, our lusts to evil
   longings, our hearts to evil covetousness, pride and rebellion. Hopeful
   witness there is, also, of sin conquered, habits broken and desires
   repressed--all this is honestly taken in evidence and duly weighed.

   Everything within us will have to tell whether it has been renewed or
   not, whether it has been changed from darkness to light, and come from
   under the power of sin and Satan into the power of Christ. Each power
   can give evidence of Grace or token of unregeneracy and, according to
   the weight of evidence, the verdict must go. The heart possesses a mass
   of evidence utterly unknown anywhere else, for the heart knows its own
   sinfulness as it knows its own bitterness and the man's heart can
   reveal secrets to itself which it dare not whisper into the ear of the
   kindest friend! The trial cannot fail from lack of evidence bearing
   upon the point.

   While the trial is going on, the deliberation causes great suspense. I
   stand trembling as long as I have to ask my heart, "Heart, do you
   condemn me, or do you acquit me?" You may have seen a picture entitled,
   "Waiting for the Verdict." The artist has put into the countenances of
   the waiters every form of unrest, for the suspense is terrible. Blessed
   be God, we are not called upon to wait long for she verdict of
   conscience! We ought never to let the question remain in suspense at
   all--we should settle it and settle it in the Light of God--and then
   walk in the light as God is in the light. I confess I cannot understand
   the comfort which I see in some people's faces when they admit that
   they do not know whether they are the people of God or not. If you are
   not saved, or are not sure of it, how dare you rest? Are you in danger
   of eternal wrath? Then give no sleep to your eyes till you know that
   you have escaped so great a peril! It looks to me as if your doubt
   could not be real if it does not work in your heart great misery and
   agony of spirit. A person in doubt about his salvation and unable to
   rest, I can perfectly well understand. But a person in doubt in any
   measure about his reconciliation to God and yet happy, is a mystery!
   How can the Grace of God be in a heart which is not sure of pardon and
   yet is content? It is an exceedingly painful thing to have this trial
   going on in the soul and to be waiting for the verdict.

   One thing I will observe, however, before I leave this matter--it is
   not the supreme court. If it should so happen that the verdict of the
   court should be against you, if your heart condemns you, remember the
   verdict is not final--there is still a higher court. I love the way in
   which Peter put it once. He had denied his Master, denied Him
   repeatedly with oaths, but he had bitterly repented--and when his Lord
   said to him, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me?" His heart did not
   condemn him upon the question of loving his Master, but it did condemn
   him sorely for having denied his Lord. So, after pleading, "Lord, I do
   love You," he takes his case into the Higher Court and says, "Lord, You
   know all things; You know that I love You." In moments of soul
   conflict, it will be wise for you to carry this question beyond
   yourself up to the Omniscient One! The translation of the Revised
   Version, though I do not like it, has a bearing on this point and so I
   quote it--"Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall
   assure our heart before Him, whenever our heart condemn us, because God
   is greater than our heart and knows all things."

   I pray you all to remember this, that the trial by your conscience is
   not, after all, the ultimate and the decisive one, because your
   conscience may go to sleep, or make a mistake in your favor. Or your
   conscience may become morbid and may not take under its consideration
   all the facts of the case and so, may go against you. Since there may
   be an error of judgment, you should make your appeal to the Most High,
   saying, "Search me, O God." Above all, if your conscience should now
   condemn you, still remember that there remains the free, full Gospel
   even for the chief of sinners! If you stand before God condemned in
   heart, this morning, throw yourself upon your face with that sense of
   condemnation upon you and cry, "God be merciful to me, a sinner!"
   Whichever verdict comes from an enlightened conscience, it will be
   exceedingly serviceable to you if you have regard to it. If it condemns
   you not, then have confidence toward God. And if it condemns you, the
   condemnation may drive you, at once, to flee for refuge to the Hope
   that is set before the guilty in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   May the Holy Spirit thus bless you!

   II. Allow me, secondly, to speak to you upon a pleasing theme, namely,
   THE ACQUITTAL ISSUED FROM THIS COURT--"If our heart condemns us not."
   Observe that a man may get an acquittal from the court of conscience,
   for the question laid before the heart can be settled. It can be
   ascertained whether I sincerely believe in Jesus Christ. It can be
   ascertained whether I sincerely love God and love His people. It can be
   ascertained whether my heart is obedient to the Commands of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. These are not hazy, mysterious problems which can never
   be solved! The case may be made clear one way or the other. The court
   has no difficulty before it beyond its faculty--it is quite competent
   to decide the question in the light of Scripture by the help of God.

   These questions, however, must be debated with great discernment.
   Suppose a person to be greatly tempted, to be tempted morning, noon and
   night with foul temptations, yet conscience must not say, "This person
   is no child of God because he is tempted." There is no sin in being
   tempted, since our Lord Jesus was tempted of the devil and yet in Him

   was no sin. Abundance, yes, superabundance of temptation is no proof
   against the sincerity of our faith in our God! On the contrary, it may
   sometimes happen that the more we are tempted the more true is it that
   there is something in us to tempt, some good thing which Satan seeks to
   destroy.

   Again, the verdict of the heart must be given with discrimination, or
   otherwise we may judge according to outward circumstances and so judge
   amiss. It will never do to say, "I am greatly afflicted in estate, in
   family, or in depression of spirits and, therefore, I cannot be a child
   of God." What? Are not God's children chastened? What son is there whom
   the Father chastens not? Some of the best children of God have been the
   most afflicted. Yes, and let me say it pointedly, some of the purest
   Christians that have ever lived have had the most sickness to bear and
   by that means they have been made more meet for Heaven, even as the
   sycamore fig, by being bruised becomes ripe. When, therefore, it is
   suggested that you are not a child of God because you are afflicted,
   the idea is not to be tolerated, since we are born to trouble as the
   sparks fly upward!

   Neither, again, do our imperfections or infirmities decide against us.
   An enlightened conscience says, "It is true this man has sinned, but it
   was not of intent, but by inadvertence or surprise. His soul hates the
   sin into which he fell. He deeply repents of his offense." The
   occurrence of sin in the life does not prove a man to be out of Grace.
   The prevalence of sin, the toleration of sin, the love of sin, the
   willful continuance in sin would do so--but the fact of imperfection,
   if wept over and repented of, is not condemnatory evidence! The fact
   that my child is little and feeble is no proof that he is not my son.
   The boy may be like his father and yet be only a tiny baby. Weakness
   and even faultiness may be confessed and yet we may have confidence
   towards God. So the verdict has to be given with great discrimination.

   And the verdict has to be given, mark you, upon Gospel principles. The
   question before the court of conscience is not, "Have I perfectly kept
   the Law?" The answer to that is simple enough--"There is not a just man
   upon earth that does good and sins not." "By the works of the Law shall
   no flesh living be justified." The question is, "Am I a Believer in the
   Lord Jesus Christ? Am I resting in Him for salvation and do I prove the
   truth of that faith by loving God, loving the Brethren, by doing those
   things which are pleasing to God and avoiding those things which are
   displeasing to Him? "The question is not concerning merit, but
   concerning Grace and the fruit of Grace! Salvation is of Grace and of
   Grace, alone--therefore my enquiry should be--"Am I partaker of that
   Grace? Unworthy though I am, am I washed in the blood of Jesus? Am I
   covered with His righteousness? Am I accepted in the Beloved?" That is
   the question and if ever you get to discussing it upon legal
   principles, you will go wrong. We are not tried in the court of the
   heart according to the Old Covenant, but according to the New
   Covenant--another book is opened which is the Book of Life.

   Permit me to say, here, that this question in the court of the heart
   must never be settled by our feelings. If the heart is at all right in
   its judgments, it will never say, "I am a child of God because I am so
   happy." Nor will it exclaim, on the other hand, "I cannot be a child of
   God because I am so sad!" Holy feelings may be brought in as evidence,
   but they are hard to estimate. Feelings are variable as the wind--they
   depend so much upon the body and outward surroundings--so much, even,
   upon the condition of the atmosphere! I acknowledge that as to
   feelings, I go up and down very much according to the weather.
   Therefore I make small account of my feelings. If I am very happy, I
   say to myself, "Keep steady. Be not intoxicated with joy." If I find my
   spirits sink, I cry, "Come, Heart, do not play the fool! You have
   nothing to be down about--rejoice in God, always, and have no
   confidence in the flesh." Deal thus with yourselves, for the question
   in hand is not, "Am I happy?" but, "Am I a sincere Believer. Does my
   faith prove its sincerity by the effect which it produces upon my
   life?" Sinners can rejoice as well as saints--and saints can mourn as
   well as sinners! The point is not what we feel, but what we believe and
   do.

   This question of our state ought to be settled speedily. As I have
   already said to you, it must not be allowed to hang about. We know "the
   law's delays," but we must not allow any delay in this court. No, we
   must press for summary justice. Does my heart condemn me, or does not
   my heart condemn me? Get a clear and plain answer, at once, to this
   issue. If your heart condemns any of you here, this morning--if you
   say, "Yes, I am a member of the Church but I ought not to be, I do not
   live as I should." If you are not Believers in Christ. If you feel that
   you have no love to the Brethren, then take the verdict and go humbly
   to God and ask Him to renew your hearts! The door of Free Grace is
   still open to you. But, on the other hand, if your conscience says,
   "Yes, with all my imperfections, with all my infirmities, I do love God
   with all my heart. I do trust in Christ, for I have nothing else to
   trust to. I do lean my whole weight upon His finished work. I hang on
   Christ as a vessel hangs on the nail. I have no dependence anywhere
   else. I know there is a change in me; I

   know that the things I once loved, I now hate, and the things I once
   hated, I now love. I desire perfect holiness in the fear of God"--then
   you are in the condition of which the Apostle says, "If our heart
   condemns us not, then have we confidence toward God."

   Let us consider that happy state at some length and then close our
   discourse. May you all have the full enjoyment of holy boldness before
   God through the operation of the Holy Spirit.

   III. Let us consider THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACQUITTAL. Here is the man
   who has had his acquittal in the court of conscience. Your conscience
   has said, "He is a sincere man. He is a believing man. He is quickened
   with the life of God. He is an obedient and God-fearing man." And now
   you have confidence toward God, or, at least, you have a right to such
   confidence. What does that confidence or boldness mean? There is the
   confidence of truthfulness. When you kneel down to pray, you know that
   you are praying and not mocking God. When you sing, you are making
   melody in your heart. When you preach, you are preaching that which
   your soul believes. If I spoke to you, today, about things which I was
   not quite sure of, it would be wretched work! But I usually feel a
   great deal of enjoyment when I am preaching because, to me, the things
   which I teach are my comfort and life. Ifyou do not enjoy the sermon,
   at least I do!

   Sometimes I say to myself, "These doctrines are exceedingly sweet. I
   feed upon them, myself, and, therefore, the people ought to be fed. And
   if they are not, it is their own fault." A cook may not even get a
   taste of the meat, but it is not often so with me. Because I believe
   for myself, I feel a confidence in preaching to you! Confidence towards
   God is a truthfulness of spirit which prevents our being ashamed in
   what we do towards Him. Can you say, "Whatever I do, I do it honestly.
   Though I am not what I wish to be in all things, yet that which I
   profess before God is true"? Then you have confidence! "One thing I
   know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see." I do not put spectacles
   over blind eyes and make people believe that I can see, but I really
   see. I know I do! I know I trust, I know I love God, I know I love
   holiness!

   This deep sincerity breeds in a man a blessed indifference to the
   judgments of men. Having a conscience void of offense, he feels a holy
   freedom as to the formalities of pretence. Look at the hypocrite--he is
   afraid of being found out! He has to do everything most primly and
   demurely lest he should be suspected. If you paint your face, you must
   take care neither to cry nor laugh, lest you crack the enamel! If you
   wear shoddy clothing, you must not run or jump, for your garments might
   tear! Accidents must be guarded against when you deal with shams. A
   hypocrite will censure you very severely for having smiled just
   now--and he will condemn me outright for being so wicked as to make you
   smile on such a day. Poor soul, he must keep up his propriety, for it
   is all he has.

   In these times of bad trade, many who are ready to fail are afraid to
   lower their expenditure for fear their poverty should be suspected--and
   so they keep up a good appearance to stave off bankruptcy as long as
   they may. If they were solvent, they would not be so fearful. If your
   conscience condemns you not, then you enjoy a blessed ease of spirit
   because the Truth of God is in you.

   The next kind of confidence is confidence towards God to one's
   acceptance with Him. If my heart say, "Yes, you do believe," then I
   know, from God's Word, that I have eternal life. The Word says, "He
   that believes on Me has everlasting life." Conscience says, "Yes, you
   have faith," and the heart concludes, there is, therefore, now no
   condemnation. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with
   God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Believe me, the sweetest stream that
   ever waters this desert world is the river of confident acceptance in
   the Beloved! When you know this, your life is gilded with the sunlight
   of the coming Glory and your heart rejoices exceedingly.

   This produces and, perhaps, it is that which the Apostle most intended,
   a boldness of converse. The man who knows that he is truthful and that
   God has accepted him, then speaks freely with God! He feels a holy awe
   of God and never wishes to lose it. He exercises a sacred boldness
   towards Him. Is it not wonderful to see how Abraham talked with God? He
   went up to the place where God spoke with Him and, when God told Him
   that He was about to destroy Sodom, how exquisitely and yet how boldly
   did Abraham put it--"Will You also destroy the righteous with the
   wicked? That be far from You." What? Does Abraham expostulate with God?
   Does Abraham dream do an unjust thing? Oh, no! But he is bold and that
   is the most forcible plea which he can think of and so he urges it
   again and again with God.

   How he pushes his case--"I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord,
   which am but dust and ashes: perhaps there shall lack five of the 50
   righteous: will You destroy all the city for lack of five?" It is
   wonderful pleading and it illustrates the words, "confidence toward
   God." Look at Job. There was a man whose heart did not condemn him, for
   he could say, "Lord, You know I am not wicked." He speaks with God very
   boldly and he says, "Oh, that I knew where I might find

   Him: I would come even to His seat--I would order my case before Him
   and fill my mouth with arguments." Though the terrors of God might make
   Him afraid, yet, secure in the quiet of his conscience, he has
   confidence towards God! Not only confidence in God, mark you, but
   toward God, so as to speak with God as a man speaks with his friend! Do
   you understand this? I know you do not if you have any doubt as to your
   being a child of God. Suspicion makes you a coward, for when your heart
   does not condemn you and you know that you are right before the Lord,
   then you feel liberty of converse.

   This leads to great confidence in prayer. Look at the context. "We have
   confidence toward God. And whatever we ask, we receive of Him because
   we keep His Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His
   sight." If you want power in prayer you must have purity in life! There
   is no promise in the Bible made to all of you that whatever you ask,
   God will give you--it is made to persons of a certain character! The
   unlimited promise is to the man of God who is so sanctified that he
   will not ask and does not think of asking anything that is not in
   accordance with God's will! Remember this passage--"Delight yourself,
   also, in the Lord; and He shall give you the desires of your heart."
   The desire of the man who delights in God is always in accordance with
   the mind of God--therefore he is the man that can get whatever he
   wills. When you do all things that please God and your life is
   sanctified and holy, then it is that you abide in His love. Has not
   Jesus said, "If you abide in Me, and My Words abide in you, you shall
   ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you"? Unsanctified desires
   will be graciously refused--but the will of the sincerely obedient man
   is conformed to the will of God and, therefore, it shall be fulfilled.
   "This is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask any thing
   according to His will, He hears us."

   Our text means, also, that such a man shall have confidence towards God
   in all service for God. Look at the man of God who has confidence
   towards God, as to the perils encountered in faithfully following His
   Lord. Take Daniel, for instance. Daniel does not question about what he
   has to do when the decree is signed that whoever shall pray, shall be
   cast into the den of lions. He opens his window as he was accustomed to
   do. He looks towards Jerusalem and bows his knees as he had done
   before--and he prays to God as if there were no edict! His confidence
   toward God is that he is safe in the path of duty. He does not count
   the cost and neither did the three holy children when the fiery furnace
   was before them, but they said, "Our God whom we serve is able to
   deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out
   of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto you, O king, that we
   will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have
   set up."

   Is not that a blessed confidence towards God which a man obtains when
   his heart does not condemn him? If Daniel had said, "I shall pray down
   in the cellar, or with the blinds drawn," he would have lost all
   confidence towards God and would not have been the man he was. If the
   three children had said, "We will bow the knee, but we will make in our
   minds a secret protest--we will not really worship the idol, but we
   will worship God while we bow before the image," they would not have
   had confidence in God. Alas, what foolish tricks men play with what
   they call their consciences, nowadays! This wonderful 19th Century is
   altogether incomprehensible to a simple, honest man! Consciences used
   to work up and down, yes or no--but now they have an eccentric action,
   altogether indescribable! A man serves the devil, nowadays, and gets
   the devil's pay--and all the while talks of serving God! May you have a
   conscience void of offense, straight and clear in everything, and so
   have confidence towards God.

   Moreover, we have this confidence towards God in the way of service so
   that we are sure of receiving all necessary help. God will help the
   true man and if he comes to a pinch and cannot get on by himself, he
   may boldly summon others of his Master's servants to his aid. Look at
   Joshua fighting with the Amalekites. The day is not long enough and,
   therefore, he lays his command upon the sun and says to it, "Sun, stand
   still upon Gibeon and you, moon, in the valley of Aja-lon"! He had need
   of longer daylight and he dared the sun and moon to move an inch till
   the pursuit of his foes was over. Thus may a servant of God challenge
   help from earth and Heaven and impress all forces into the service of
   his Lord. An officer, if he finds himself in straits, impresses anybody
   that passes by, saying, "In the King's name, help me." Even so, if you
   do your Lord's bidding and if conscience condemns you not, you may
   impress into the service of the great King every angel in Heaven and
   every force of Nature as need requires!

   I wish I had time to tell you all that confidence towards God means. It
   means rest, perfect rest. Look at your Lord when the tempest was on.
   Loud roaring, the billows come near to overwhelming the ship, but He is
   asleep! Nobody but He could dare to slumber because nobody else had
   such confidence in God! He knew the vessel was safe, why should He

   worry? True, He was Lord High Admiral of the seas and had
   responsibility not only for His own flagship, but for the whole fleet
   of little ships that sailed with Him that day--but He did not give way
   to sleeplessness because of that--He cast Himself on God and fell
   asleep! It was the best thing to do. You and I may do the same--we need
   not be frightened nor worried, nor troubled, but just trust in the Lord
   and do good and so shall we dwell in the land and, verily, we shall be
   fed. This is confidence towards God!

   This confidence often mounts up into joy till the Christian man
   overflows with delight in God. He cannot contain his happiness. As
   Solomon says, he eats his bread with joy, for God has accepted his
   works. He lives with the wife of his youth in full contentment and his
   children are a blessing to him. He goes to his toil rejoicing to serve
   God in his calling and he comes home at night to repose himself in the
   care of his God and Father. All is well and he knows it.

   Blessed man that has confidence in God! Such a man goes up to his last
   bed when the message comes that the spirit must return to God who gave
   it--he goes to die without alarm--his conscience does not condemn him
   and, therefore, he lays himself down in patience and waits the signal
   to be with God. Meanwhile the light of Heaven steals over his face and
   they that come to cheer and comfort him hear strange words, like notes
   of the birds of Paradise, dropping from his lips. They see that he is
   in pain, but they also mark that he is baptized in enjoyment. They
   think that he is dying, but he testifies that he is entering into life!
   The pearly gates are open before him--the glitter of the golden street
   is meeting his failing eyes. Hear him sing, as best as his failing
   breath permits--

   "And when you see my eye-strings break,

   How sweet my minutes roll!

   A mortal paleness on my cheek,

   But glory in my soul!"

   Now he is gone, gone into the land of spirits! He stands before his God
   and he does not tremble. He has that eagle-eye which can bear the light
   of the eternal sun! His heart condemns him not and he has confidence
   towards God. Amidst the supernal splendors he cries, "My Father!"
   Angels are crying, "Lord and God," but he says, "My Father"--and those
   loyal servants make room for a royal child! The shining ones escort the
   happy spirit to the blessed Father's feet. There we leave him.
   "Beloved, if our heart condemns us not, then have we confidence toward
   God." God bless you. Amen.

The History of Little-Faith

   (No. 1856)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 23, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and caught him, and
   said unto him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" Matthew
   14:31.

   THERE is only one word in the original for the phrase, "O you of little
   faith." The Lord Jesus virtually addresses Peter by the name of
   "Little-Faith" in one word. I do not suppose that Peter had ever before
   dreamed of that name as applicable to himself. Possibly he had thought
   in his heart that his faith was strong even to assurance. When so
   lately he had seen his Master feed the multitudes with a few loaves and
   fishes and had helped to gather up 12 baskets of fragments, he felt
   that his faith was equal to anything. He who could feed so many with so
   little, could do any kind of wonder! And how could Peter--brave, honest
   Peter--ever think of doubting his Lord? O Brothers and Sisters, we do
   not know ourselves! We fancy that we are rich and increased in goods
   and, lo, in the time of trial we discover that we are naked, poor and
   miserable!

   Those who are strong in faith to their own thinking, may soon be
   brought into circumstances where their confidence will be grievously
   shaken. All is not gold that glitters, neither is all faith that speaks
   bravely. Peter is strong in faith on board the ship, strong in faith
   even as he walks the waters--but that unexpected gust of wind which
   came howling down from the mountains took him aback, staggered him--and
   caused his faith to reel. Then the waters yielded under his feet and,
   as he began to sink, he discovered his own weakness and had his
   discovery confirmed by the verdict of his Lord who surnamed him,
   Little-Faith. Let no man think of himself beyond his own experience.
   Experience is the true gauge and he who boasts of an untried faith is
   puffed up with vainglory. Stretch not your arm beyond your sleeve lest
   it be frostbitten! He who glories in himself, deceives himself.

   It is not an easy thing to endure the humiliation which must follow
   upon the collapse of untried confidence. Rest assured, Brothers and
   Sisters, that between here and Heaven we shall need every ounce of
   faith that we have--and that whenever we feel too sure of our own
   strength--we are making sure of that which is frailty itself.
   Self-confidence is but the froth on the top of the cup--it is not the
   pure juice of the vine of the Truth of God. When a man begins to be
   secure in himself, he will court temptation. He will rashly venture
   upon needless experiments and, in the end, will need to cry in
   plaintive accents, "Lord, save me!" Learn, then, on the threshold of
   the text, that we are not as strong as we think we are and that, when
   we are most brave and daring, we may not be quite so far removed from
   fear and trembling as we imagine. Alas, that unbelief should mar even
   Peter's faith! Let him who thinks that he can walk the waves take heed
   lest he sink beneath them!

   In Peter's character there was an amazing mixture of the strong and the
   weak--he rose to excellence and sank to littleness. Yet, why should I
   speak of this as amazing, for we, ourselves, are made of much the same
   materials? In us, also, are mingled the iron and the clay. The best of
   men are men at the best! Since the old nature remains, though the new
   nature is born in us, there is, in our soul, a conflict between
   holiness and sin, faith and unbelief, strength and weakness. We walk
   the waters like our Lord and soon we sink like doubting Peter. The
   Christian man is full often a mystery to himself and, therefore, it is
   no wonder that he is a mystery to other people. Note how Peter
   speaks--he cries, "Lord, if it is You"--a speech which, if it is not
   censurable, is by no means praiseworthy, after his Lord had said, "It
   is I." Hear him again--"Bid me come unto You on the water." Here is
   courage almost blazing into rashness! And yet there is a measure of
   obedient deference, for he will not attempt to come unless he is bid to
   do so. He will risk his life if he has but his Mas-

   ter's permission! What diverse qualities meet in the same man! He
   proposes a rash venture and yet is prudent enough to ask his Master's
   permission.

   Look at him walking the waves and admire the strength of his faith!
   Could you do this? Then see him sinking because a fierce blast has
   blown in his face. Do you marvel at his unbelief? Would you have done
   better? He that knows himself knows that doubt dogs the heels of
   confidence. The Canaanite of distrust is still in the land and shows
   himself, sooner or later, at unexpected turns. Where the fairest
   flowers of faith, hope and joy bloom, the deadliest serpents of
   mistrust and suspicion may yet be lurking! Abraham, that father of
   Believers, yet sinned twice by distrust when he did not acknowledge
   Sarah to be his wife.

   Peter's mixture of unbelief was not to be justified, nor may it be used
   as an excuse for ourselves. We shall speak of it as a matter of fact,
   but not as an example, for it was an improper and unreasonable thing.
   Peter could not answer the Lord's question, "Why did you doubt?" His
   doubting was without ground or reason. If he believes at all, why does
   he doubt? The unbelief which makes faith little is to be confessed as a
   sin and mourned over as such--it would be wrong to regard it as a mere
   infirmity and invent excuses for it! The truth is that the Christian
   has no cause for doubting his Lord. The whole course of the Lord's
   dealing is calculated to inspire confidence. He has done nothing to
   create a suspicion of His love, or truth, or power. If we never doubt
   till we have cause for doubting, our life will be rich with faith!

   It is concerning little faith and its faults and unreasonableness, that
   I have to speak at this time--may God grant that all the Little-Faith
   family may be helped to stronger confidence! May the Holy Spirit bless
   the word and enable many a Ruth to pick up those handfuls that are
   dropped on purpose for the feeble folk who glean in these fields.

   I. Our first topic will be LITTLE-FAITH'S HISTORY. It is sketched in
   the story of Peter. We are, each one, apt to act over again the part
   which Peter played in this narrative.

   Little-Faith is a true disciple, though a faulty one. Not the
   littleness of the faith, but the faith, itself, is the gift of God.
   None but God could make a grain of mustard seed. None but God can give
   the least particle of living faith. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   however feeble it may be, is a fruit of the Spirit of God and a token
   of the new birth. I may say of Peter, on this occasion, what the Lord
   Jesus said of him at another time, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonas:
   for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you, but My Father which
   is in Heaven." Even the faith which can get no further than to touch
   the hem of Christ's garment is the work of the Spirit of God! Even that
   faith which cries, "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief is, as to its
   existence, though not as to its infirmity, the creation of the most
   High. Therefore let us note that Little-Faith is born in the new
   Jerusalem and is an Israelite, indeed--hence it has about it that
   immortal life of which our risen Lord has said, "Because I live, you
   shall live, also."

   Very early in its life, Little-Faith has great longings. See it in
   Peter's case. He is on board ship with his brethren while Jesus is
   yonder upon the waters. And Peter is so earnest to come to his Lord and
   be with Him, that he is ready to plunge into the sea to reach Him! Why
   could he not wait as the others did? His immediate duty was in the ship
   with his brethren, but his vehement desires carried him above common
   toiling and rowing. Strong faith exhibits patience where Little-Faith
   is in a hurry! It was well to have longings for Jesus, but it would
   have been wiser to have waited while the Lord came walking over the sea
   to the ship. The quiet, self-possessed Christian has deep longings for
   his Lord, but he has the assured conviction that his Lord will come to
   him if he continues faithful to his present duty and, therefore, he
   waits upon the Lord.

   Little-Faith, like Martha, runs to meet Jesus, but Strong-Faith, like
   Mary, sits still in the house. Little-Faith is feverish after immediate
   joy. Little-Faith wants to be in Heaven tomorrow. Little-Faith would
   convert the world before the sun went down and she grows faint because
   her zeal has not fulfilled her wish! Little-Faith must pluck the
   promises while they are green--she is not content to wait till they
   become ripe and mellow. Yet I love her desires and I would to God that
   all men had them! However mistaken pressing desires for spiritual joy
   may be, they are things that come not into unrenewed hearts! Those
   blessed longings after Christ which some of you feel, which make you
   cry, "Oh that I knew where I might find Him!"--you may thank God for
   them! Those who have greater faith know that they have found their
   Lord. They know that He is as the sun which cannot be hid. They feel
   His warmth and rejoice in His light--yet the keen hunger after Christ
   which goes with Little-Faith is an admirable thing--and the Lord
   Himself has blessed it.

   I rejoice in the blossom of the apple tree--it is not so valuable as
   the fruit, but it is exceedingly beautiful. And, even so, the eager
   longings of a trembling heart after the Lord Jesus are full of
   loveliness and fragrance--and are, by no

   means, to be despised. It is the nature of Little-Faith that it should
   be of a thirsty and eager temperament and hasty to make a dash for
   present fellowship with Christ.

   Little-Faith was daring. Early in her life she had intense longings and
   they grew so that Little-Faith was willing to venture everything to
   have her longings fulfilled. "If it is You, bid me come unto You on the
   water"--thus does Little-Faith cry to her Lord. These are big words,
   but they come out of a trembling heart. Men often venture all the more
   because their capital is so small. Souls who are little in faith are
   often put upon desperate measures to gain hope. O Beloved, are there
   not some of you who would give your eyes and ears--your very lives--to
   see Christ and to taste of His love? You have come up to the
   Tabernacle, this morning, feeling that if Christ bade you plunge into
   the sea to find Him, you would think nothing of it. You feel like
   Rutherford when he said he could swim through seven Hells to get at
   Christ--and think them nothing if he might but lie at His feet.

   Those vehement and burning desires within your spirit for your Lord and
   Master are sharp but exceedingly blessed things--you need not repress
   them, even though they urge you to venture everything for Christ's
   sake! Love's ventures for Christ will end in great profit. What shall
   it damage a man if he loses the whole world but gains his Savior? What
   loss could there be to a man though had, himself, sank in the sea, so
   long as his Lord stood there to stretch forth His hand and snatch him
   from destruction? Little-Faith can yet be a true hero when the Lord
   says to her, "Come." It is not the sea she fears--her concern is lest
   the Lord should frown upon her!

   At times Little-Faith accomplishes great wonders. Peter, when his
   Master said, "come," went down upon the waters and walked the waves
   with ease. The Lord puts forth His strength even when we reveal our own
   weakness of faith! Peter took one step and then another upon the
   rolling waves, wondering, all the while, how it ever could be. Has not
   your little faith done this? I remember the first step of faith I
   took--how I wondered at it--and wondered at myself. Have not you, also,
   been amazed at yourselves? Do you remember when you believed that God
   had saved you, seeing you had faith in Christ? Then, though you knew it
   to be true, you could hardly tell whether you should laugh for joy or
   cry for fear when you thought upon the possibility of your being saved
   in Christ Jesus! You dared to believe that you were adopted into the
   family of God and started back as your heart said, "How can He put me
   among the children?" Do you remember reading of the Doctrine of
   Election in Holy Scripture and, at last, saying, "Surely, I am one of
   the chosen! The Lord has loved me with an everlasting love; therefore
   with loving kindness has He drawn me"? Was it not a piece of daring to
   you?

   Walking on the water could not have been more venturesome! You stood
   upright when tempted! You held on, though sore beset by the enemy! You
   walked towards Jesus, though the way seemed to be on the sea! A high
   exhilaration raised your spirit. You rose out of yourself, but yet down
   deep within there was a latent fear, a half-developed apprehension that
   your confidence was too good to last, that your joy was presumptuous.
   In your very heart you were afraid of sinking--and it was no wonder
   that, by-and-by, your fear became matter of fact.

   But now comes in another bit of our history--Little-Faith is too apt to
   look away from the Lord. Peter, as he walked those billows, took his
   eye off his Master and just then a tremendous wind rushed boisterously
   in his face--and poor Peter was alarmed. He had thought of the
   fickleness of the waves, but he had overlooked the fury of the wind!
   When he spoke to the Lord, he said, "If it is You, bid me come unto You
   on the water." And so his faith had reckoned with the water, but it had
   not reckoned upon the force of the wind. That mysterious and subtle
   agent took him by surprise. He had forgotten that he had both winds and
   waves to contend with--and now the wind comes upon him as a new trial!
   As the blast came full in Peter's face, it chilled him to the marrow
   and chilled his heart, too. He heard the wind, but forgot the Voice
   which said, "It is I; be not afraid."

   This is the danger of Little-Faith. Little-Faith, at the outset, is
   scarcely comprehensive enough. It does not take a full view of all the
   possible dangers and difficulties and so, when that which it has
   omitted, comes to the front, it is very apt to be sorely troubled.
   Little-Faith, your hope lies in keeping your little self wholly
   dependent upon your great Lord! If you begin to measure circumstances,
   it will go ill with you, poor trembling creature that you are! What
   have you and I to do with measuring? There is One that measures with a
   span, the whole world, and weighs the mountains in scales and the hills
   in a balance! With unmeasured faith, let us leave ourselves in the
   hands of our immeasurable God, so shall our souls be kept in perfect
   peace, stayed on Him. I walk the waves, yet not I, but Jesus--therefore
   will I not look to the winds, but to Jesus! Neither will I think of
   sinking, but see Him standing and hope in Him!

   Now, the moment Peter took his eye off his Master and thought of the
   wind, Little-Faith began to sink. You see him going down. He is ready
   to perish--the proud waters prevail against him--he has no power,
   whatever, to help himself. I should suppose that Peter, being a
   fisherman, could swim. Why did he not strike out? Mark this, when a man
   begins to live by faith, if his faith fails him, even his natural
   ability fails with his faith. He that could swim with no faith,
   originally, will not swim when once, by faith, he has begun to walk the
   waters! Should he fail in his walking, he cannot fall back on his
   swimming. "Beginning to sink" is a terrible condition! Poor
   Little-Faith, it never reckoned on this! Deep experiences are all the
   more dreadful because unlooked for. When Peter left the ship and slid
   down the side of the boat and touched the sea, his first miraculous
   footsteps so elated him that he hardly thought it possible that he
   would, before long, be on the verge of drowning! But now down he goes,
   like lead in the mighty waters! The billows open wide their great
   mouths to swallow up poor Little-Faith and down he goes! Is that the
   condition of any child of God here, this morning? I must confess it has
   sometimes been mine. There was a step and scarcely a step, between me
   and death. That which bore me up appeared to give way and the waters
   came in even unto my soul.

   Let me not finish this history of Little-Faith without saying that
   Little-Faith knew how to pray. Though Peter did not know how to come to
   Christ on the waters, he knew how to come to Him by prayer. Though his
   faith was not what it ought to be, it was where it ought to be, for his
   cry was only to his Lord. He did not appeal to his brethren in the
   vessel, but only to his dear Master who stood so firmly on the rolling
   waves. He did not cry, "John, save me!" but, "Lord, save me." It was a
   short prayer, but it was a comprehensive one. It expressed his need of
   salvation. It proved his faith in the Lord's will to save him. It
   acknowledged Jesus to be his Lord and it tacitly admitted that the Lord
   could save him, and no one else.

   In his prayer, Peter quits all other hope and looks wholly and solely
   to Jesus, crying, "Lord, save me!" His faith quotes what the Lord had
   done for others in healing, feeding and saving them--and now he cries,
   "Lord, save me!" He asks Jesus to act as His name implies He would
   do--he practically says, "Savior, save me." He appeals to his
   authority-- "You are my Lord and You did bid me come. Therefore, as
   Lord, save Your own servant. Save me." His short cry is full of force.
   Let us imitate both its shortness and its fullness. Whenever faith is
   weak, let prayer be strong. When you cannot do anything else but cry,
   then cry with might and main! If it is less the cry of faith, let it be
   all the more the cry of agony! "Beginning to sink, he cried, Lord, save
   me." Little children are good at crying, if at nothing else--and so is
   Little-

   Faith.

   When Jacob was greatly afraid, he became bold enough to wrestle at
   Jabbok. Even Little-Faith has prayer for its vital breath, its native
   air. Where there is life, there is breath--and where there is faith,
   there is prayer! O Soul, are you sinking? Then cry, "Lord, save me!"
   Now, in this little picture, have any of you recognized yourselves? Do
   you long for Christ? Would you venture all things for His dear sake? Do
   you trust Him? Have you enjoyed happy moments when, by faith, you have
   accomplished things impossible to mere sense? Have you sometimes
   believed and, in that belief, found a bearing up of your spirit that
   made you more than conqueror? Then, if, at this moment there should be
   a collapse and your faith should waver, pray unto the Lord! He stands
   fast if you do not! It is your wisdom to cry mightily in this, your
   time of need, and as surely as the Lord lives, He will come to your
   rescue.

   Among all the carcasses that shall be washed up on the Dead Sea shore,
   there shall never be found the corpse of Little-Faith. Though
   Little-Faith has often said, "I shall one day fall by the hand of the
   enemy," no weapon has yet been forged that can strike its heart, or
   break its bones! He that believes even with a little and a trembling
   believing, is safe beneath the guardian care of the Eternal God. "He
   shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings shall you trust:
   His Truth shall be your shield and buckler."

   At the end, Little-Faith will grow to full assurance and will come up
   into the vessel, yes, into Heaven with Christ! Little-Faith shall find
   its way across the Jordan and stand in its lot in the end of the days.
   And, perhaps, among the most rapturous song that shall ever salute the
   Redeemer's ears will be the song of those who were weak and trembling
   when they were here below and yet were kept to the end. Therefore have
   confidence!

   II. I come, now, to the second head of my discourse, which is an
   interesting one--LITTLE-FAITH ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE LORD. In my text you
   will observe the Savior did not say, "O you of no faith," or, "O you of
   pretended faith," but, "O you of little faith." There are times when we
   would give all that we have if we could only have our Master's
   assurance that we have even a little faith! If He does but acknowledge
   that it is faith, then the root of the matter

   is in us! I would rather have great faith than little faith, but I
   would rather have little faith than have great presumption and mistake
   it for holy confidence. It ought to have comforted Peter, even as it
   rebuked him, to hear his Lord, who could not make a mistake,
   acknowledge that he had faith!

   In following up this subject, note that little faith is faith, and
   little faith is true faith. A grain of mustard seed has life in it as
   surely as the tree beneath whose spreading branches the birds of the
   air find shelter. A spark is as truly fire as the conflagration which
   burned down a city. Little faith is not such powerful faith as great
   faith, but it is true faith. O Soul, if you have a ray of light, it
   came from the sun! If you have a pulse of life, it comes from the
   heart! If you have any measure offaith, it is the work of the Spirit of
   God! A pearl is a pearl, though it is no bigger than a pin's head.
   God's signature is as valid when He writes it small, as when He uses
   capitals!

   In Peter's case, little faith was faith with a very solid reason at the
   back of it. O child of God, little as your faith may be, yet if you
   believe in Christ, you have faith most proper and justifiable. In fact,
   so strong is the ground of your little faith that the Savior even asks
   you, "Why did you doubt?" As much as to say, "You have every reason for
   your faith, but what reason have you for doubting?" Oh, dear Heart, if
   you come to Christ and cast yourself on Him, you are doing the best and
   the most right thing that you can do and none can question your
   conduct! Yes, if you even swoon away upon the dear bosom of the eternal
   Love, none shall tear you off, none shall separate you, even in your
   feebleness, from Christ! He has said that he that comes to Him, He will
   in no wise cast out. Who, then, can dismiss you from His Presence? You
   are not presumptuous, you are not going beyond what is permitted you
   when you trust yourself and your all on Christ, your

   Lord!

   Do it again and do it again, more thoroughly, and you shall never be
   ashamed of having done it! No, it shall be your glory that you dared to
   trust your Lord! His promise shall never be outdone by your faith! Open
   your mouth wide and He will fill it. Ask for more faith and He will
   give more faith and fulfill greater promises to you! Go from faith to
   faith and you shall receive blessing upon blessing! There is no limit
   to your Lord's love--take as much as you like--there is no reason why
   you should hesitate! Christ acknowledged Little-Faith to be faith with
   a solid reason at its back when He said, "Why did you doubt?"

   Our Lord Jesus acknowledged Little-Faith because, little as it was, it
   ventured all for Him. Peter had thrown himself into the sea to come to
   his Master and the Lord recognized that fact. He who ventures all for
   Jesus and on Jesus shall not find it to be a losing speculation. Though
   you dare not say that you have strong faith, yet you give up the
   world's pleasures, its sinful gains and its pleasing smiles for
   Christ--you would not deny Him for all the treasures of Egypt! Well,
   then, our Lord will acknowledge you as His and bear you harmless in the
   end. That little faith, which is real faith, knows nothing of the
   timidity which haunts the heart of the hypocrite! Little-Faith fears
   lest it should not be accepted at the last, but it is not afraid of
   being persecuted for Christ's sake. No, let me but know that I am His
   and He is mine--and I will go through fire and water to be with Him!

   Little-Faith, in the case of Peter, was coming to Jesus all the while.
   Peter, when he left the ship, left it to come to Jesus and for that
   purpose only. The first step he took upon the sea was towards Jesus and
   every other step was towards Jesus. And when he began to sink, he sank
   that way, leaning towards his Master and crying as he went down, "Lord,
   save me!" Now, the Lord Jesus always acknowledges a faith which comes
   towards Him, however lame it may be. If you have a faith which looks to
   yourself, a curse rests upon it! If you have a faith which looks to
   priests, it is superstition! If you have a faith which looks to
   ceremonies, creeds, prayers and feelings, it will fail you when you
   most need help! But if you have a faith whose eyes are on Jesus, whose
   longings are for Jesus, whose hopes are all centered in Jesus, whose
   steps all head to Jesus, then you have a faith upon which Jesus sets
   His seal and though He calls it, "little," yet He calls it, "faith." Be
   sure that that which the Lord, Himself, acknowledges to be faith, is
   faith, even though, for the present, it leaves you damp with the brine
   from which you are newly plucked!

   Once more, the Master acknowledges this faith--for, before long,
   Little-Faith came to walk with Jesus on the sea. I think I have seen a
   picture of Peter sinking and Christ stooping to save him, but I wish
   that some eminent artist would paint the two walking together in peace,
   Peter and his Lord. What joy to think that Little-Faith, once drawn
   from the deep, stands on those foaming waves side by side with the
   great saving Lord! Now is Peter conformed to his Lord! Now is the
   servant clothed with the might of his Master! We have, before, seen the
   Son of God walking in the fire with the three

   holy youths, and now we see the obverse of the medal--a saint walking
   on the water with the Son of Man! Is it not a splendid, reassuring
   Truth of God, that Little-Faith can grow to act like Christ?

   The day shall yet come when the Lord shall have so strengthened
   Little-Faith that the things that the Lord does, Little-Faith shall do,
   also, and the Word of God shall be fulfilled, "Greater works than these
   shall you do because I go unto My Father." You tell me that you cannot
   rejoice, today, but Jesus will see you, again, and your heart shall
   rejoice. You cannot go forth to Christian service, for you are lame
   through spiritual weakness--but the day comes when the lame man shall
   leap as a hart! The Healer of His people will lay His hand upon you and
   make you "strong in the Lord and in the power of His might." You have a
   greater consciousness, today, of your inability in yourself than you
   have of your ability in the Lord. But it shall not always be so--the
   time will come when, in rapt fellowship with Him, by the strength of
   His Grace, you shall be in this world even as He is--and that glorious
   life which, in the Person of Christ, trod on the sea as though it were
   a sea of glass--that same life shall be in you, so that you shall
   overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil!

   I feel right glad to have even a little faith! I am truly sorry that it
   is so little when I know that my Lord deserves all possible confidence,
   but yet I am glad that it is given to me to believe on His name, for it
   has brought me near Him and will bring me yet nearer. And it will,
   by-and-by, bring me to be with Him where He is, and to behold His
   Glory!

   Thus I have shown you that our Lord acknowledged Little-Faith. He did
   not break the bruised reed, nor disown the infant faith, but He called
   it faith, answered its prayer and made it to stand with Him in
   fellowship of power!

   III. In the third place, I want you to notice LITTLE-FAITH'S
   DELIVERANCE. Little-Faith began to sink, but it was only a beginning.
   The sinking did not end in Peter's drowning, but in his Lord's saving.
   The text says, "beginning to sink" and truly that is the whole matter.
   None of God's people shall go beyond, "beginning to sink." We may be
   "ready to perish," but we shall not actually perish. Our steps may be
   "almost gone," but, "almost," is not, "quite." A man may be near death,
   and yet live. He may begin to sink and yet be saved. Friend, it may be
   that for some time you have been "beginning to sink," but you have not
   yet sunk. Not yet are you consumed! Not yet is the Lord's mercy clean
   gone for-ever--not yet has He forgotten to be gracious. Oftentimes,
   "beginning to sink," with us, is with Christ, beginning to stretch out
   His hand! The beginning of a clear sense of our own weakness is often
   the beginning of the display of the power of God!

   Little-Faith received its deliverance wholly from the Lord. As I have
   already said, it was not Peter's swimming that got him out of his
   trouble, nor was it any revival of Peter's faith which did it. The Lord
   came to the rescue and proved His power to help at a dead lift. So
   shall it be with you, O trembling heart--in the hour of your extremity,
   God shall appear for you. The Lord will provide! Out of weakness you
   shall be made strong, for He has said, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you."

   It was of the Lord and, therefore, it was immediate. Will you kindly
   note the words in the text, "and immediately Jesus stretched forth His
   hand." Before He rebuked him for his little faith, He delivered him
   from his peril! O Little-Faith, you have but to cry out and the Lord
   will help you! Do not delay your crying and He will not delay His
   helping. The Lord may let the matter proceed some considerable distance
   till we think it is all over with us, but, in the nick of time, He will
   appear for our deliverance. In that dark moment when we read our own
   death warrant amid the roar of the tempest, the prompt relief of the
   Lord of Love will arrive! No wings of cherubim can be more swift than
   the Lord's right hand when He means to draw His people from great
   waters.

   It is added, "immediately He stretched forth His hand." It was an
   instructive action on the part of Jesus, that stretching forth of His
   hand--as if He was raising Himself to the utmost energy and reaching
   beyond Himself to rescue His servant. A stretched-out hand denotes the
   exercise of all the power of the person thus acting. In the case of
   God's people, it has often been necessary that He should bring them
   forth with a high hand and with an outstretched arm. Peter had his
   exodus from the water as Israel from Egypt. Who is to know the might of
   God's arm if He does not stretch it out? And why should it be stretched
   out unless there is a need for it--so that our perils produce the
   necessity for God to stretch out His hand and thus they turn out to be
   comfortable means of Grace to us! Our necessities are the doors through
   which the Lord's great bounty comes to us. If Little-Faith did not lift
   up its cry of dismay, the Lord's hand would not be lifted up for its
   rescue.

   It is added, He, "caught him." Thus the Lord came into personal contact
   with His servant. Look, He holds him up! The whole weight of Peter is
   on Christ! If Peter sinks, Jesus must sink, too, for He will not let go
   of His hold. For the time Peter and Christ are joined, they have only
   one standing and that standing is all in Christ. O Little-Faith, you
   feel a closer union to Christ in your hour of danger than ever before!
   It comes to this, that when Jesus interposes to save Little-Faith, He
   bends all His strength to the deed and takes hold of the sinking one
   with a grip so fast and firm that the two must sink or stand together!
   All the weight of Peter was on Jesus--all the security of Jesus was
   bestowed on Peter! Little-Faith holds Jesus while Jesus upholds
   Little-Faith. A half-hoping, half-despairing soul lays hold on Jesus
   with an iron grip and on such a poor feeble one, the hold of Jesus is
   equally tight and strong! He will never let the sinking sinner die when
   once that prayer has been uttered, "Lord, save me!" I hardly know of a
   more conscious union between a man and Christ than that which is
   effected when, in sinking times, the grip of the crucified hand is felt
   as our sole rescue from death!

   "Hallelujah, who shall part Christ's own bride from Christ's own
   heart?" Who is he that shall separate the most timid and trembling of
   all the believing company from that eternal hand which is sworn to
   deliver? "I give unto My sheep eternal life," He says, "and they shall
   never perish." Nor shall they though the heavens and the earth should
   pass away. The Lord must and will stretch out His hand and catch the
   sinking one and grant him the same standing as Himself.

   IV. I close with LITTLE-FAITH REBUKED. That comes last. After the poor
   soul is quite rescued and set on a sure footing, then comes the loving
   chiding--"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" This is such a
   gentle rebuking that it almost seems to me that the Master might say as
   much as this to us when we enter Paradise with Him. It might not be
   unkind, even there, to say, "Why did you doubt?" When you and I have
   come up from our dying beds and left all pain, poverty and sorrow far
   behind, we shall find ourselves in the golden-streeted city and the
   Well-Beloved with us--and we shall look back on all the way whereby He
   led us--and then He may lovingly whisper in our ears, "Why did you
   doubt?"

   Look back on your pilgrim way. There is the Slough of Despond dried up!
   There is Giant Despair's head on a pole! There is Apollyon bound with
   chains! There is the river whose chill stream so often frightened you,
   glittering in the eternal light! "Why did you doubt?" You doubted about
   nothing. You made mountains out of molehills. Where everything was
   working for you, you said with trembling Jacob, "All these things are
   against me." Will not our Lord produce a rapture within our spirit
   while He brings to mind His unchanging love, His immutable Truth, His
   immovable faithfulness? We shall eternally wonder at our own doubts!

   What if our Lord should say, "Did you not come up from the wilderness
   leaning upon Me as your Beloved? Did I ever fail you? Did I ever give
   you a cross word? Say, did I ever leave you or forsake you? Why did you
   doubt?" Then we shall sweetly chide ourselves to think we ever had a
   moment's distrust of our dear Lord, the Bridegroom of our souls, in
   whom our faith ought to have been constant as the day!

   Notice, dear Friends, with regard to this question, "Why did you
   doubt?" that it is an inconsistent thing for a believing man to doubt
   His God, or distrust the power of the Lord Jesus. You believe, and if
   you believe, why doubt? If faith, why little faith? If you doubt, why
   believe? And if you believe, why doubt? Oil and water will not mix! Oh,
   how could faith and unbelief unite? Yet they are often found together
   in deadly warfare. "Oh," said a dear Sister in Christ to me the other
   day, "I cannot doubt my God." Yet she also expressed a fear lest she
   should be wrong at the last! This was an odd mixture in one who knew
   the glorious Gospel so well! But then we are all odd in some way or
   other. In any case, it is not right that we believe and yet disbelieve.
   Shall a fountain send forth both sweet water and bitter? Be gone you
   doubts! Oh that they would go at my bidding! What business have you,
   here, at the festival of faith? Be gone, you harpies that devour the
   bread of the Lord's Table and defile our dainty things! What right have
   you to enter the holy abodes of

   faith?

   While doubts are so inconsistent, are they not also most dishonoring?
   Why should we doubt our Lord? Shall it go forth to the world that we
   cannot trust Christ? Shall it be said that those who are saved by Him,
   nevertheless say it is hard work to believe Him? Hard to believe Him
   who has proven His love by the agony and bloody sweat? My Lord, I will
   sooner doubt my brother, doubt my father, doubt my wife than doubt You!
   My Lord, I will doubt my eyes, and doubt my ears, and doubt the beating
   of my heart sooner than doubt You! I will doubt the laws of Nature--I
   will doubt everything that seems certain! I will doubt the conclusions
   of mathematics--but You, oh why, why, should I doubt You? No,

   let us hold on to the love of Jesus and cling to Him, even though He
   should frown and chasten. Be it ours to trust a scourging God! Yes,
   say, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him"

   Once again, how inexcusable is this doubting among you who believe! The
   only excuses worth mentioning are these. Some excuse themselves because
   they desire to be humble. "I dare not think that these good things are
   true to me. I know that I am altogether unworthy of them and I am
   afraid of being proud if I take them to myself." Do you not know, dear
   Friend, that the biggest pride in all the world is doubting God? And it
   is the sweetest humility to trust in God as a child trusts its father!
   It is the lowliest action of the heart to say, "These things are good,
   exceedingly good, and I am most un-worthy--but then the Lord has said
   that He gives these gracious gifts to the unworthy--and, if He has said
   it, God forbid that I should question Him." Who am I that I should
   venture to raise a doubt about the bona fides of the Lord Jehovah? I
   must, I will cease from all such proud questioning and artful doubts
   and be even as a new born babe, drinking in the unadulterated milk of
   the Word of God!

   I am persuaded that unbelief is sometimes occasioned by ignorance. I
   pray you, do not let such ignorance remain in you. Be diligent in
   searching Holy Scripture. If you do not know the Lord, nor know His
   Providence, nor know the Doctrine of the Final Perseverance of the
   Saints, nor know the Covenant of Grace, why, then you may be
   staggered--but learn those things that you may be established.

   I have no doubt that unbelief is caused not only by ignorance, but by
   forgetfulness. We forget the Lord's past mercies. If the Lord has
   plucked you, like a brand, out of the fire, cannot He pluck you out of
   the sea? He that delivered you from the deadly power of sin--cannot He
   deliver you from every temptation? In fact, the Lord has done more for
   us, already, than He ever will have to do for us in the future, for He
   will never have to die, again, upon the bloody Cross and He will never
   have to offer Himself, again, as an Atonement for our sin! Nine hundred
   and ninety-nine parts out of a thousand are already ours! We have only
   to shut our eyes and open them in Heaven and the rest will be ours.
   Today is our salvation nearer than when we believed. We are almost
   Home! We are within sight of the white cliffs of the better land! Shall
   we now tremble? Shall we not begin to rejoice with unspeakable joy?
   Does not Little-Faith begin to mount into assurance?

   You that have not believed in Jesus, I have tried to show the way of
   salvation by faith in Christ. You that have believed but tremblingly, I
   have pointed out to you much that ought to comfort you. And to you who
   can believe with full assurance, I would say, guard that full assurance
   with great care--it is Heaven below--it is the beginning of Heaven
   above!

   The Lord, the Holy Spirit, be with you all, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Necessity of Growing Faith

   (No. 1857)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 30, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "We are bound to thank God always for you, Brethren, as it is fitting,
   because your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of
   you all abounds toward each other." 2 Thessalonians 1:3.

   LAST Lord's-Day I tried to say cheering and encouraging words to
   "Little-Faith." I trust that the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, did
   thereby strengthen some to whom the Savior said, "O you of little
   faith, why did you doubt?" But none of us would desire to remain among
   the Little-Faiths--we long to press forward in our march to the better
   land. If we have just started in the heavenly race, it is well, for
   there are grounds of comfort about the first steps in the right way,
   but we are not going to stop at the starting-point! Our desire is
   towards the finish line and the crown. My prayer, at the commencement
   of this discourse, is that we may, each of us, rise out of our little
   faith into the loftier region of assurance, so that those who love us
   best may be able to say, "We are bound to thank God always for you,
   Brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly."

   The Church of Jesus Christ at Thessalonica did not commence under very
   propitious circumstances. Remember that oft-quoted text about the
   Bereans--"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
   they searched the Scriptures daily whether those things were so." That
   record does not relate to the converts in Thessalonica, but to those
   Jews who heard Paul preach in the synagogue and refused to test his
   teaching by a reference to the Old Testament. They were not a noble
   sort of people and yet, from among them, there were taken by almighty
   Grace a certain company who were led to believe in the true Messiah!
   Thus they became more noble than even the Bereans, for we do not hear
   of a Church in Berea, neither was an Epistle written to the Bereans.
   Thessalonica received two Epistles, bright with hearty commendations.
   Paul praised the Philippians, but the Thessalonians he praised even
   more, thanking God at every remembrance of them, and glorying in them
   among the Churches of God for their patience and faith.

   I shall ask you, with your Bibles open, to see whether we cannot
   account in some measure for this remarkable condition of things. The
   verse before us is full of thanksgiving to God for the growth of the
   Thessalonians in faith and in love. And to my mind, it sounds like an
   echo of the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The First Epistle is
   the key and the cause of the Second. Very often a man's success in this
   place, or in that, will tally with his own condition of heart in
   relation to that place. As we sow we reap. The Grace of God enabled
   Paul to sow toward the Thessalonians with great hopefulness, trust and
   prayerfulness and, consequently, he reaped plentifully.

   Observe how (1 Thess. 1:2, 3) Paul began by distinctly recognizing the
   existence of faith and love in that Church. "We give thanks to God
   always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; remembering
   without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of
   hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father."
   Recognize the root and then look for the flower! See that faith is in
   the soul, smile upon it and foster it--and then you may expect that the
   faith will steadily increase. In our text Paul mentions faith as
   growing and love as abounding, while in the next verse he mentions
   patience, which is the outgrowth of hope--"the patience of hope." He
   noticed in the Thessalonians the birth of those three Divine
   sisters--faith, hope, and charity! That which he recognized with
   pleasure, he afterwards saw growing exceedingly! Those who cherish the
   seed shall rejoice in the plant. Observe in the children under your
   care the first blossoms of any good thing and you shall observe its
   increase! Despise not the day of small things. When you have learned to
   recognize faith in its buds, you shall soon see faith in its flowers
   and faith in its fruits! Do not overlook feeble Grace, or criticize it
   because it is as yet imperfect--mark its beginnings with thankfulness
   and you shall behold its advance with delight!

   In addition to recognizing the beginnings of faith, Paul labored hard
   to promote it. Look in the second chapter and read verses 7, 8, 11,
   12--"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her
   children: so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
   have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God, only, but also our own
   souls because you were dear unto us. As you know how we exhorted and
   comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,
   that you would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto His kingdom
   and glory." He threw his whole strength into the work of building that
   Church, toiling night and day for it and, consequently, he obtained his
   desire-- for still it is true in the farming of God, that those who sow
   and steep their seed in the tears of earnestness, shall doubtless come
   again, rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them!

   Paul had accompanied his public labors with his private prayers. See
   how 1 Thessalonians 3:12 tallies with our text--"And the Lord make you
   to increase and abound in love, one toward another, and toward all men,
   even as we do toward you." This was his prayer--and he received exactly
   what he prayed for. He saw abounding love in each one towards every
   other! The Lord seemed to have noted the wording of Paul's prayer and
   to have answered him according to the letter of his request. If we open
   our mouth wide, the Lord will fill it! Brothers and Sisters, what we
   comfortably recognize in its gracious beginnings--what we labor to
   increase and what we earnestly guard with prayer shall, in due time, be
   granted to us!

   More than this--Paul had gone on to exhort them to abound in love and
   faith. Look at Chapter 4, verse 9--"As touching brotherly love you need
   not that I write unto you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love
   one another. And indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in
   all Macedonia: but we beseech you, Brethren, that you increase more and
   more." Paul did not only quietly pray for the Church, but he added his
   earnest admonitions. He bids them increase more and more and, in
   response, they do increase, so that he says, "your faith grows
   exceedingly." When a man says, "more and more," it is only another way
   of saying, "exceedingly." Is it not so? There was a big heart in Paul
   towards the Thessalonians. He wanted them to grow in faith and love
   "more," and then, to take another step and add another, "more," to it!
   The exhortation being given out of a full heart, behold, God has
   fulfilled it to His servant and the people have willingly followed up
   the Apostolic precept!

   But Paul had added faith to his prayers and his exhortations. Look at
   Chapter 5:23, 24, and see if it is not so. "And the very God of peace
   sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body
   be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Faithful is He that calls you, who also will do it." When we are sure
   that God will do it, it will surely be done! We miss many a blessing
   because we ask without faith. The Apostle believed that he had the
   petition which he had sought of the Lord and he received according to
   his faith. He who can firmly believe shall, before long, fervently pour
   out thanksgiving! The Church at Thessalonica, the child of Paul's
   prayers, the child of his labors and, at last, the child of his faith,
   obtained a remarkable degree of faith and an amazing warmth of love.
   The Lord give to us, who are workers, the mind and spirit of Paul, and
   lead us to follow him in our conduct to others, and then I do not doubt
   that our good wishes shall be realized! If we are right, ourselves, we
   shall see prosperity in the Churches, or classes, or families whose
   good we seek--and as we feel bound to pray about them, we shall also
   feel bound to thank God concerning them.

   Before I plunge into the sermon, I should like to pause and ask whether
   we, as Christian men and women, are such that Paul could say of us, "We
   are bound to thank God always for you, Brethren, as it is fitting,
   because your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of
   you all abounds toward each other." What do you think? Could your
   pastor bless God for you? Could your nearest and dearest Christian
   friend feel that he was bound to always thank God for you? If not, why
   not? Oh that we may rise into such a happy state that we shall be the
   cause of gratitude in others! It ought to be so--we ought to glorify
   God--causing men to see our good works and praise our Father in Heaven.

   One more question--Do you think we are in such a condition that it
   would be safe for anybody to praise us? Would it be safe to ourselves
   for us to be thus commended and made subjects of thankfulness? It takes
   a great deal of Grace to be able to bear praise. Censure seldom does us
   much harm. A man struggles up against slander and the discouragement
   which comes of it may not be an unmixed evil, but praise soon suggests
   pride and is, therefore, not an unmixed good. "As the fining-pot for
   silver, and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise." Would it
   be safe if Paul were, here, to say good things about you as he did
   about the Thessalonians? Did it not prove that the Brothers and
   Sisters, there, were sober, well-established Believers?

   Once more, do you ever feel it in your heart to talk like this about
   your fellow Christians? Paul was in a fine condition when he could thus
   extol his Brethren. Few men are ready with hearty commendations of
   others. We are greedy in receiving praise and niggardly in dispensing
   it. We seldom speak too kindly of one another. Now and then you hear a
   person say, "There is no such thing as love in the Church at all." I
   know that gentleman very well and I never saw any excess of love in
   him. I heard one say, "Brotherly love is all a mockery; there is no
   reality in Christian charity"--and truly, he measured his own corn very
   accurately! Most men would see others better if their own eyes were
   clearer. When a man honestly feels that his fellow Christians are, for
   the most part, much better than himself and that he would willingly sit
   at the feet of many of them, then he is, himself, in a healthy state. I
   admire the Grace of God in many around me! I see their imperfections as
   though I did not see them! I am not looking for the thorns, but for the
   roses--and I see so many of them that my heart is glad and in spirit I
   bless the name of the Lord!

   The man who can commend the work of the Lord in others without saying a
   word about himself, has, by that fact, given himself a good character.
   His eyes must have been washed in the fountains of Love. They must have
   been cleansed from the dust of pride, envy and self, or he would not
   have so seen or so spoken. I love the text because it is an instance of
   a man of great Grace, of a man under the Inspiration of the Spirit of
   God who yet delighted to speak enthusiastically of a Church which
   certainly was far from perfect. I delight in that eye which can be a
   little blind to faults while it exercises a clear vision in seeing all
   that is good and praiseworthy towards God!

   So, then, we come to our text and the subject runs thus--for us to grow
   in faith is a subject for devout thanksgiving. And, in the second
   place, it is an object for diligent endeavor. Thirdly, if we greatly
   grow in faith it will be the source of other growth, for as faith
   increases, love, patience and every other virtue will flourish.

   I. For us to grow and increase in faith is A SUBJECT FOR DEVOUT
   THANKSGIVING. Paul gives a commendation of the Thessalonian Church
   which is exceedingly warm and hearty. One critic says the words may be
   regarded as somewhat extravagant, after the mode of the Apostle when he
   wishes to be emphatic. He writes fervidly--"Your faith grows
   exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other
   abounds." It is an intense and unreserved commendation. As I have
   already said, this Church was not absolutely perfect for, because of
   the love of every one towards another and their great kindness towards
   the poor, certain unworthy persons encroached upon their liberality. To
   use a very rough word, beggars were multiplied among them as they
   always are where generosity abounds. Shame that it should be so. Read
   chapter 3, Verse 11--"For we hear that there are some which walk among
   you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies." There had
   been, also, among them, here and there, a person of loose life and of
   sharp business dealings--and to such Paul spoke in the First
   Epistle--but these flies in the pot of ointment did not destroy its
   sweetness. They were, comparatively, so few, that Paul speaks of the
   whole body with warm praise. When our faith shall grow and our love
   abound, it may be proper for a pastor to speak with unrestricted
   admiration of what the Lord has done.

   The blessing of increased faith is of unspeakable value and, therefore,
   praise should be largely rendered for it. Little faith will save, but
   strong faith is that which builds up the Church, which overcomes the
   world, which wins sinners and which glorifies God. Little-Faith is slow
   and feeble and, to suit his pace, the whole flock travel softly.
   Little-Faith is a wounded soldier and has to be carried in an ambulance
   by the armies of the Lord. But faith which grows exceedingly lifts the
   banner aloft, leads the van, meets hand to hand the foes of our Prince
   and puts them to the rout! If we were invoking blessings upon a Church,
   we could scarcely ask for a larger blessing than that all the Brothers
   and Sisters might be strong in faith, giving glory to God! Strong-Faith
   ventures into large endeavors for Christ and, therefore, missions are
   projected. Strong-Faith carries out the projects of holy zeal and,
   therefore, daring ideas are turned into facts! Strong-Faith is a shield
   against the darts of error and, therefore, she is the object of the
   contempt and hatred of heresy.

   Strong-Faith builds the walls of Zion and casts down the walls of
   Jericho. Strong-Faith smites the Philistines hip and thigh and makes
   Israel to dwell in peace. Oh that the night of Little-Faith were over
   and that the day of glorious faith would come! Soon would our young men
   see visions and our old men dream dreams if faith were more among us.
   When the Son of Man comes, shall He find faith in the earth? At the
   revival of faith, we shall see another Pentecost with its rushing
   mighty wind and its tongues of flame--but during our lack of faith we
   still abide in weakness and the enemy will exact upon us. O God, we
   beseech You, make Your face to shine upon us! Cause our faith to grow
   exceedingly and our love to abound yet more and more! Then shall there
   be times of refreshing from the Presence of the Lord.

   Paul thus fervently gave thanks to God because the blessing came to the
   Church at a remarkably seasonable time. The people of Thessalonica had
   risen against the Church and persecuted it. Thus, without were fights,
   but within there were no fears, for the Brethren were firm in faith and
   fervent in love. The Church was subject to constant tribulation, but
   its faith grew exceedingly. Has it not often been so with the Lord's
   people? Times of cloud and rain have been growing times. Pharaoh dealt
   harshly with Israel, but the more he oppressed them, the more they
   multiplied! The more the Church of God is trod down, the more it rises
   into power and influence! The bush burns and is not consumed. No,
   rather, it flourishes in the flame! I say not that this increase of
   faith is the immediate effect of persecution, but it is singularly the
   attendant put upon it. God knew that when His poor servants were hauled
   to prison; when they were brought before rulers and kings for His
   name's sake; when they were robbed of their goods, they needed
   increased strength and, therefore, He gave it to them by growth in
   faith. As the persecution rose upon them like a deluge, their
   confidence in God rose above it--like Noah's ark, which rose higher,
   the deeper the waters became! They stood fast in the day of trial and
   became an example to all other Churches, whether persecuted or not--and
   this because their faith grew exceedingly!

   Beloved, I pray for each member of this Church that your confidence in
   God may rise from ebb to flood. We need it much just now. This is a
   time of depression in trade, when many are suffering need and almost
   all find their means decreased. We need to be rich in faith, for we are
   growing poor in pocket! Many children of God cannot find employment in
   which to earn their bread. This is, moreover, a time of abounding vice.
   Perhaps never in our memories were any of us so shocked as we have been
   of late by the discoveries of unspeakable abominations! We need that
   our faith should grow exceedingly, for sin runs down our streets in
   torrents! It is also a period of grievous departure from the faith once
   delivered to the saints. Looking back to our younger days, we are
   amazed at the progress of error. We mourned, in those days, that men
   trifled with the Doctrines of the Gospel, but what shall we say now,
   when men deride those Doctrines and mock at them as antiquated fables?
   The foundations of the earth are removed and only here and there will
   you find a man who bears up the pillars--therefore we need that our
   faith should be exceedingly steadfast. I charge you, Brothers and
   Sisters, to be rooted and grounded in faith, seeing the times are evil!
   I cannot speak emphatically enough upon the abounding dangers of the
   times--they demand of us that we be not of doubtful minds, but that we
   take firm hold of the Infallible Truths of God and endure as seeing Him
   who is invisible! He that cannot say, "I believe and am sure," is one
   born out of due time.

   The Apostle's commendation was meet and fit, since, if there is any
   growth in faith, it is the work of God's Spirit. Faith is the gift of
   God in its beginnings and it is equally the gift of God in its
   increase. If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, God gave it to
   you. And if you have faith as a spreading tree, God has given the
   increase. The infancy of faith is of God and so is its perfect manhood.
   In the natural world, we ought as much to admire God's hand in growth
   as in creation for, indeed, the bursting out of spring, the advance of
   summer and the maturity of autumn are all a sort of creation seen in
   detail. Even thus the progress of faith reveals the same power as the
   commencement of faith. If you do not look to God for more faith, you
   will never have more faith--great faith in its strong broad current
   flows as much from the fountainhead of Grace as in its first trickling
   stream of hope in Christ. Let God have all the glory of faith from its
   Alpha to its Omega!

   If you are a strong man in Christ Jesus, take heed that you do not
   sacrifice to your own net, nor burn incense to your own drag and
   glorify your own experience as if you made yourself strong and rich in
   the things of God. We are bound to render all the thanksgiving unto
   God--it is meet that it should be so. Look how the Apostle puts it--"We
   are bound to thank God always for you." I like the modesty of that. He
   does not so much say that he thanked God, though he did do so. But in
   deep humility he admits the debt which he could not fully pay. He did
   not judge his thanksgivings to be sufficient, but acknowledged that he
   was still under bonds to render more praise. I rejoice to be bound with
   these bonds, to be bound to thank God every day and all day! I wear
   these golden fetters and count them my best ornaments! "Bind the
   sacrifice with cords, even with cords to the horns of the altar." I
   would be bound over not to keep the peace, but to keep praise forever.
   Let the Altar of Incense be always burning, yes, flaming higher and
   higher with the sweet spices of love and gratitude. Blessed be God for
   what He is doing for His people when He causes their faith to grow--for
   it is a blessing so immense, so incalculable that our praises ought to
   rise to the height and glory of loud-sounding hallelujahs!

   Brothers and Sisters, let us bless God for every good man we know whose
   faith has grown, for every holy woman whose love in the Church is
   manifest to all! And when we have done so, let us turn our eyes to God
   and say, "Lord, make

   me such a one that others may glorify You in me, also. I am, as yet,
   sadly weak and undeveloped. Make me to grow till all Your image shall
   be seen in me and my fellow Christians shall bless You concerning me."
   Thus have I set growth in faith before you as a subject for
   thanksgiving. It is, indeed, a jewel worth more than both the Indies!

   II. In the second place, it is worthy to have AN OBJECTIVE OF DILIGENT
   ENDEAVOR. If you have it not, labor speedily to attain it. As the
   merchantman seeks goodly pearls, so seek a growing faith. Covet,
   earnestly, the best gifts and the noblest Graces. Never be
   self-satisfied, but cry with Jabez, "Oh that the Lord would bless me,
   indeed, and enlarge my coast."

   Why? Because the proof of faith lies in the growth of faith. If you
   have a dead faith, it will always be the same. But if you have the
   faith of God's elect, it must grow! If I heard of a child that was born
   some years ago and had never grown, I should begin to guess that my
   friend was entrapping me and that the child was dead from birth. Life
   in its earliest stages is always attended with growth. Brothers and
   Sisters, you must have more faith, or we shall fear that you have no
   faith-- you must have more love, or else, for sure, you have no love at
   all. That which does not grow unto God does not live unto

   God!

   We ought to have more faith because God's Truth deserves it. It ought
   to be the easiest thing in the world for us to trust God. To believe
   every word of the Lord should be an act to which we need not to be
   exhorted--it should be as natural as for the lungs to heave, or the
   heart to beat! We ought, as children of God, to believe our Father by
   instinct, even as young eaglets hide under their mother's wing. We
   ought to exercise faith even as the eye sees and the ears hear because
   thereunto we were created by the Holy Spirit. It should be a necessity
   of our spiritual existence that we must and will trust the Lord Jesus
   Christ yet more and more! I pray that it may be so, for unbelief is a
   horrible crime. Have you doubted God? Have you, in any sense,
   mistrusted Him? Have you limited the Holy One of Israel? Then continue
   not the slave of such a sin, but give unto God your heart's confidence
   from this time forward and forever.

   Moreover, we ought to grow in faith because it will be so much for our
   own spiritual health, strength and joy. Does Little-Faith know what he
   might be, do and enjoy if he could only quit its littleness? There are
   many ways of being a Christian, as there are many ways of being an
   Englishman--but all are not equally desirable. I may be an Englishman
   in banishment, or in the workhouse, or in prison--but I prefer to be an
   Englishman at home, in health and at liberty. So you may be a Christian
   and be weak, timorous and sad. But this is not desirable--it is better
   to be a happy, holy, vigorous, useful Christian! As your being an
   Englishman does not depend on your health or wealth, so neither does
   your salvation turn upon the strength or joy of your faith--yet much
   does depend on it. Why not glorify God on the road to Heaven? Why not
   have foretastes of it now?

   It is not my desire to go through the world in miserable style, singing
   always--

   "Do I love the Lord or not? Am IHis, or am Inot?"

   I infinitely prefer to so trust God that my peace may be like a river
   and my righteousness like the waves of the sea! Look at the difference
   between Abraham, the Father of the faithful, and his nephew, Lot. Lot
   was righteous, but he was, by no means, as strong in faith as Abraham.
   Neither was he as great or as happy. Abraham is calm, bold, royal. Lot
   is greedy, timid, trembling. Lot, in Sodom, is, with difficulty, made
   to run for his life, while Abraham, alone with God, is interceding for
   others! Lot escapes from a burning city with the loss of all things,
   while Abraham dwells peacefully with the Lord who is the Possessor of
   Heaven and earth. Abraham's faith makes him rise like some lone Alp
   till he touches the very Heaven of God! It is well to be Lot, but it is
   infinitely better to be Abraham! Seek the highest degree of faith, for
   if this is in you and abounds, you shall not be barren or unfruitful.
   Heaven lies that way. More faith, more rest of heart. To grow heavenly
   we must grow more believing.

   The question is, how is this to be done? How is my faith to be made to
   grow exceedingly? I have already told you that it is the work of the
   Holy Spirit--but He still uses us for the increase of our own faith! If
   we are to grow in faith, certain evils are to be avoided with
   scrupulous care. Avoid continual change of doctrine. If you have a tree
   in your garden and you transplant it often, it will yield you scanty
   fruit. Those who are everything by turns and nothing long, are, "ever
   learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth of God."
   Unstable as water, they shall not excel! Those Brothers and Sisters who
   believe this, today, and that, tomorrow, and the other thing the next
   day, do not believe anything in downright earnest! They cannot grow!
   They are not rooted and grounded. Like the moon, they are always

   changing--and what light they have is cold and sickly. He who can
   change his religion, has none to change! Those who prefer philosophy to
   Christ, never knew Him!

   Then, again, if you had a tree and did not transplant it, but began to
   dig away the earth from it, removing the ground in which it stood, you
   would impoverish it and prevent its fruitfulness. I know certain
   professors who are giving up the ground which their souls should grow
   in. One doctrine after another is forsaken till nothing is held to be
   important. They do not believe much, now, and they are on the line to
   believe nothing at all. The experiment of the Frenchman who had just
   brought his horse to live on a straw a day, when it died, is being
   repeated among us, faith being literally starved to death! What low
   diet some men prescribe for their souls! Marrow and fatness they do not
   even smell! How can your faith grow when vital Truths of God are
   abandoned, or held with feeble grasp? Oh for a band of Puritan
   Believers! Oh for a troop of spiritual Ironsides!

   Next, a tree cannot grow if it is shut out from sun, rain and dew.
   Without heavenly influences, we must be barren. Plant a little tree
   right under a great oak so that it is always in the shade and it cannot
   grow! Clear the big tree away or the sapling will dwindle to death.
   Some men's faith cannot grow because it is overshadowed by worldliness,
   by tolerated sin, by love of riches, by the pride of life, by cares of
   lower things. The pursuit of Christ Crucified must be all-absorbing or
   it will be ineffectual. To know what you believe and to abide steadfast
   in it, is the way to be robust in faith. Men whose hearts are not in
   their trades, men who chop and change--these are the men whose names
   appear in the Gazette--are not many spiritual bankruptcies due to the
   same cause?

   There are methods which the spiritual farmer uses to cause faith to
   grow. First, faith grows by an increase of knowledge. Many persons
   doubt because they are not instructed. Some doubt whether they shall
   hold on to the end--they are ignorant of the Doctrine of the Final
   Perseverance of the Saints! Some are in despair because they find evil
   desires arising in their hearts--they do not know the teaching of
   Scripture as to the two natures and the warfare between flesh and
   spirit. Many think themselves condemned because they cannot wholly keep
   the Law--they forget that they are justified by faith! A great deal of
   unbelief vanishes when knowledge, like the morning sun, drives away the
   mists! Unbelief is an owl of the night and when the sun rises, it hides
   away in a dark corner. Study the Word of God--give your heart to
   searching it! Seek to get at the inner teaching and learn the analogy
   of faith. Practice deep-sea fishing and you will reach those mysterious
   Truths which are the secret riches of the soul. These Truths are much
   despised now, but those who rejoice in them will find their faith
   growing exceedingly.

   Better still than mere knowledge, which, alone, would puff you up,
   faith grows by experience. When a man has tried and proved a thing,
   then his confidence in it is largely increased. Take a promise and test
   it, and then you will say, "I know that is so." When you have tested it
   again and again, and again, nobody will be able to shake you, for you
   will say, "I have tasted and handled of this good Word of God. I have
   made it my own and I am not to be driven from it." The experienced
   Christian is the established Christian. The man who proved all things
   is the man who holds fast that which is good. God give Grace to
   increase our faith by knowledge and by experience!

   Faith also grows by much meditation and walking with God. If you want
   to believe in a man, you must know him. Half the disputes between
   Christian people arise from their not knowing one another. There is a
   hymn of Mr. Sankey's which I venture to alter thus--

   "When we kno w each other better The mists will roll away."

   When we know each other, our suspicions, prejudices and dislikes will
   speedily disappear. I am sure it is so with our God. When you walk with
   Him; when your communion with Him is close and constant, your faith in
   Him will grow exceedingly. Some of you, I am afraid, do not give five
   minutes in the day to meditation. You are in too great a hurry for
   that. In London life, men get up in a hurry even as they went to bed in
   a hurry and slept in a hurry! They swallow their breakfast in a hurry;
   they have no time to digest it; the bell is ringing at the station and
   they must hurry to catch the train! They reach business in a hurry.
   They hurry through it and they hurry to get back from it. Men cannot
   think, for they have barely time to blink their eyes. As to an hour's
   meditation and reading the Scriptures and communing with God, many
   professors, nowadays, would think they committed robbery against the
   god of this world if they took half-an-hour out of their service to
   give it to fellowship with the world to come! If our faith is to grow
   exceedingly, we must maintain constant conversation with God.

   Another way of increasing faith is by much prayer. Pray for faith and
   pray with faith--thus shall your soul become firm in its reliance on
   the promises. It is while we wrestle with the Angel that we find out
   our weakness, as the sinew of our thigh shrinks. But, at the same time,
   we prove our God-given strength, since as princes we wrestle with God
   and prevail! Power from prayer as well as power in prayer is what we
   need. On our knees we gather strength till doubting and fearing
   disappear.

   We must be careful to render obedience to God. A man cannot trust God
   while he lives in sin. Every act of disobedience weakens confidence in
   God. Faith and obedience are bound up in the same bundle. He that obeys
   God, trusts God. And he that trusts God, obeys God. He that is without
   faith is without works and He that is without works is without faith.
   Do not oppose faith and good works to one another, for there is a
   blessed relationship between them. And if you abound in obedience, your
   faith shall grow exceedingly.

   Again, faith grows by exercise. The man who uses the little faith he
   has will get more faith. But he that says, "I have not enough faith for
   such-and-such work" and, therefore, shrinks back, shall become more and
   more timid, till, at last, like a coward, he runs away! Go forward with
   your little faith and to your surprise it shall have grown as you have
   advanced! Accomplish much and then endeavor something more, and
   something more. I have often used an illustration taken from a person
   who teaches the art of growing taller. I do not believe in that art--we
   shall not add a cubit to our stature just yet. But part of this
   professor's exercise is that in the morning, when you get up, you are
   to reach as high as you can and aim a little higher every morning,
   though it is only the hundredth part of an inch. By that means you are
   to grow. This is so with faith. Do all you can and then do a little
   more--and when you can do that, then do a little more than you can.
   Always have something in hand that is greater then your present
   capacity. Grow up to it and when you have grown up to it, grow more! By
   many little additions, a great house is built. Brick by brick, up rose
   the pyramid! Believe and yet believe more! Trust and have further
   trust! Hope shall become faith and faith shall ripen to full assurance
   and perfect confidence in God Most High!

   This then, Brothers and Sisters, is what I commend to you. May God the
   Holy Spirit help you all to go from faith to

   faith.

   III. Finally, this growing faith becomes THE CENTER OF OTHER CHRISTIAN
   GRACES. "Your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of
   you all abounds toward each other." A firm faith in Gospel Truths will
   make us love one another, for each Doctrine of Truth is an argument for
   love. If you believe in God as having chosen His people, you will love
   His elect. If you believe in Christ as having made Atonement for His
   people, you will love His redeemed and seek their peace. If you believe
   in the Doctrine of Regeneration and know that we must be born again,
   you will love the regenerate. Whatever doctrine it is that is true, it
   ministers toward the love of the heart. I am sure you will find a deep,
   firm, fervent unity with one another in those that hold the Truth of
   God in the love of it. If you are not filled with brotherly love, it
   must be because you are not firmly believing that Truth which works
   toward love.

   Firmness in the faith ministers toward the unity of the Church. The
   Church at Thessalonica did not have a secession, or a split, as some
   call it--the Church at Thessalonica did not divide under the pressure
   of persecution--they adhered closely to one another! As they were
   hammered all the more, the more they were consolidated. They were
   welded into one solid mass by the hammer of persecution and the fire of
   love--and the reason was because they each one held the Truth of God
   with all firmness. I am always afraid of a Church that is made up of
   mixed elements--when some are Calvinistic, some Arminian, some Baptist
   and some Paedobaptist. When the minister who holds them together dies,
   they will disintegrate. When certain reasons that now make them cohere,
   cease to exist, the Church will divide like quicksilver--each little
   bit breaking into smaller bits--and so they will go rolling about in
   innumerable factions. But given a Church that holds the Truths of God
   firmly, with deep and strong faith, then if the pastor dies, or 20
   pastors die, they believe in a Pastor who lives forever--and whoever
   comes or does not come--the Truth they hold, holds them in living
   unity. I cannot imagine a greater blessing for you as a Church, in
   years to come, than for each man and woman to be intelligently
   established in the Truth of God you have received. Who shall separate
   the men who are one in Christ by the grip of mighty faith? I commend
   firm faith to you with all my heart as the source of love and the means
   of unity in years to come.

   This faith breeds patience in men and patience assists love. Truth to
   tell, God's people are, some of them, an amazing tribe! A countryman
   was accustomed to say that if God had not chosen His people before they
   were born, He would never have done so afterwards. There is truth in
   that saying. Therefore if a man loves his fellow Christians as an act
   of mere

   nature, he will often feel himself baffled. He will say, "They acted
   very unkindly to me. Who can love people that are so ill-mannered, so
   ungrateful?" But when faith is strong, you will say, "What is that to
   me? I love them for Christ's sake. If I am to have a reward, it shall
   come from my Lord Christ. As for God's people, I love them despite
   their faults. Over the head of the mistaken judgements they form of me,
   I love all my Brethren." The way to make men better is not to be always
   censuring them, but to love them more. The quickest way to win a sinner
   is to love him to Christ! The quickest way to sanctify a Believer is to
   love him into purity and holiness! Only faith can do this. May faith,
   therefore, grow exceedingly, for faith, by working patience, helps us
   to bear with others.

   If there is anything grand, good, desirable--anything Christ-like,
   anything God-like--the way to it is to let your faith grow exceedingly!
   If this Church is to become more and more a missionary Church, as I
   pray God it may, your faith must grow exceedingly! If you are to stand
   fast as a breakwater in these times of departure from the faith once
   delivered to the saints, your faith must grow exceedingly! If you are
   to be made a blessing to this wicked city and shine like a lighthouse
   over this sea of London, your faith must grow exceedingly! If God has
   brought you as a Church, together with other Churches, to the Kingdom
   for such a time as this--if you are to achieve your destiny and work
   for God and glorify His name--your faith must grow exceedingly!

   The man who is timorous and faint-hearted, let him go home--he is not
   fit for the day of battle. The age requires heroes! The chicken-hearted
   are out of their place in this perilous century! You that know what you
   know and believe what you believe, whose tramp is that of fearless
   warriors--you have a high calling--fulfill it! You shall see what God
   will do for you and with you! And it shall be written in the pages of
   eternity that at such a time the Church grew in its faith and,
   therefore, God used it for His Glory.

   May it be so. May those among us who have no faith be led to Jesus. O
   Believers, try your own faith by speaking to unbelievers as they go
   away this morning! This afternoon, in the Sunday school, prove your
   faith by winning your dear children for Christ! Try your faith every
   day in the week by giving sinners no rest until they come to Christ!
   God bless you, each one, for His name's sake. Amen.

God Our Continual Resort

   (No. 1858)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 6, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Be You my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort."
   Psalm 71:3.

   DAVID, in his younger days, had been obliged to hide himself away with
   his followers in the great caverns and rocks of his native land. In the
   cave of Adullam, by the rocks of the wild goats, he had dwelt amid the
   most stern surroundings of Nature. No doubt he had climbed aloft upon
   the mountain's side and then had penetrated into one cave after another
   and treated them as chambers of his house of rock. There he had spent
   both nights and days, looking from on high upon the plains beneath,
   often seeing his cruel pursuers passing by in eager hunt for him while
   he was secure in his rocky fastness.

   Nothing leaves a clearer impression upon the memory than a residence
   amidst such scenes. You might live for an age in such a town as this
   and forget it all. What is there to remember in this labyrinth of
   bricks and mortar? But when you get into the clear bracing atmosphere
   of the hills--when you tread their sublime heights, or descend into
   their mysterious hollows--you cannot forget it! A day of leaping, like
   the wild goats, from crag to crag, ended by a night amid the dread
   seclusion of a mountain den makes a clear mark on the surface of life
   which can never be erased--a man will carry such memories with him to
   his grave.

   This must have been especially the case with a genius so poetic as that
   of David. I would not hesitate to place the King of Israel among the
   first masters of song. If you take the whole company of the poets,
   together, you cannot find one who did more for devotional prose than
   David. All the altars of God in the world have been set alight by flame
   from David's lamp. When men worship God in any language, they quote one
   or other of the Psalms. What better expressions can they borrow or
   invent? With such a soul as his, and such eyes, and such a tongue, and
   such a harp, it was no wonder that, in his riper days, when he had
   known the soft luxury of palaces, he could not refrain from rehearsing
   the sublime memories of his earlier and more adventurous days--and
   drawing inspiration from the wild and sublime scenery among which he
   had been reared. The man, as full of Grace as of genius, as saturated
   with the Spirit of God as with the spirit of poetry, could not but in
   his loftiest songs speak of his God in language culled from the
   cave--"Be You my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
   resort." Or, as some read it, "Be You to me a rock of repose." The deep
   quiet of the enormous recesses in the lone rocks was remembered by the
   Psalmist and worked into his prayer.

   I shall want you to carry the thought of those rocks and those caves
   with you, because it will form a background for our subject and help us
   to illustrate it.

   What a gracious heart David must have had, to speak like this of his
   God! He desired to be upon the most intimate terms with the Lord, his
   God. He wished to dwell not merely with God, but in God. He cries, "Be
   You my strong habitation." Not merely did he long to dwell in the house
   of the Lord forever, but he would have the Lord to be his house! He
   would be surrounded by God and that not as with a dungeon, in which he
   was forced to be, but as the habitation of his choice, for his pleasure
   and rest. He would not merely live in God's world, but within God
   Himself! He would realize the meaning of Moses, when he said, "Lord,
   You have been our dwelling place in all generations." What a man of God
   David must have been, despite his infirmities and sins! None but a mind
   in harmony with God as to the great principles of truth and purity
   would ever have desired such constant converse with God as that which
   is implied in the words, "Whereunto I may continually resort."

   The wicked say, "No God," but David sighed for none but God! The mere
   pretender would have God on Sabbaths and high days and in times of
   trouble. But David would have God all day and every day. The formalist
   is satisfied with a

   word with God in the morning and another at night. When he is either
   hurried or sleepy, he forces from himself the tax of a minute or two in
   prayer. But he that loves the Lord delights to walk with Him always!
   Yes, to make his home with God and to abide in Him! Some would like a
   Sabbath once in the month, but David would make all his days holiness
   unto the Lord. Many would like to speak with the Lord from a distance,
   but David would live and move and have his being in his God. By this,
   the man after God's own heart, proved that his own heart was after God.
   Judge yourselves, therefore, at the very outset, as to what your own
   condition of heart is. If you can repeat the words of David from your
   very soul, bless the Grace of God that has taught you to do so! And if
   you cannot so pray, breathe a silent prayer to Heaven saying--Lord,
   teach me to love You and long for You. I would gladly acquaint myself
   with You and be at peace.

   Without inventing any mechanical divisions, I would remark that the
   text naturally suggests three things. The first is that God was to
   David, a delightful repose--He was his habitation, or home. Secondly,
   that David found in his God peaceful security--"Be You my strong
   habitation." God was his fortress, his castle, his high tower, his rock
   of defense. And then, thirdly, David had continual access to his
   God--"Whereunto I may continually resort." Those five words are as a
   musical box set to the most charming air--they discourse a quiet
   harmony to my soul, such as one hears when listening to the brook which
   warbles as it flows--"Whereunto I may continually resort."

   I. Let us dwell on this for a few minutes. David found in his God,
   DELIGHTFUL REPOSE. "Be You my strong habitation." That is, be my house
   and home. David was one of those who had made the Most High his
   habitation and, therefore, did God continually preserve him. He was one
   of the favored ones who dwelt in the secret place of the tabernacles of
   the Most High, abiding under the shadow of the Almighty.

   Observe what wonderful condescension he had experienced from the Lord!
   What infinite Grace, that God should allow His servants to think of Him
   as their house! My God, You are the Glory of Heaven and the angels veil
   their faces in Your Presence and yet I dare to say, "Be You my
   habitation." My God, You are terrible in righteousness; You are a
   consuming fire! All things perish at Your Presence when once You are
   angry, yet You permit me to dwell in You and to find in You, not
   destruction, but eternal life! Brothers and Sisters, we aspire not
   merely to be reconciled to God, nor even to draw near unto Him, but to
   enter into Him and to hide ourselves beneath Him! It is one of the
   sublimities of Christian experience to be in God the Father and in
   Christ Jesus. Do we understand this? We have never reached the sum of
   our Grace-given privileges till we are more at home with God than with
   anyone else in the universe! What a wonder that the eternal God is our
   refuge! What condescension that the Infinite Jehovah should be the
   abode of His saints!

   David had realized in his God peculiar love. In a man's own home, he
   expects to find love. Pity on the poor wretch who is disappointed
   there. When we are abroad in the world, my Brothers and Sisters, we
   reckon to meet with rough handling and to receive scant consideration.
   But within our own doors we enter the sanctuary of love. If we receive
   and return love anywhere, it is within the walls of our own habitation.
   That is how David felt towards the Lord, his God. Abroad he had many
   enemies and faithless friends not a few, but they were all outside of
   his real life. When he came to his true life in God, he breathed an
   atmosphere of love! He dwelt in One who loved him better than he loved
   himself! Do you know what this means, dear Brothers and Sisters? Is God
   the center of your repose because in Him is love? Are your affections
   all set on Him? And do you know that He loves you and takes a Divine
   delight in you? "He shall rest in His love"-- do you rest in it? Oh,
   that your heart may be filled to the brim with a sweet consciousness
   that you are the object of infinite affection! May you say of the Lord
   Jesus, "Who loved me and gave Himself for me" And may you hear the
   Father say, "I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with
   loving kindness have I drawn you." He that dwells in love dwells in
   God, for God is Love! Oh blessed experience, to dwell in God as the
   abode of love!

   Moreover, home is the place of special rest. At home we are unloaded of
   the world's huge load. The advocate takes off his gown and says, "Lie
   there, Mr. Barrister, and let the father come to the front." The
   tradesman takes off his apron, the warrior his harness, the bearer his
   yoke, for they are at home. And if a man may rest anywhere on earth, it
   must surely be in his own habitation! Is not our God our rest? O
   Beloved, is there, indeed, beneath the sun, any repose for a poor soul
   except in God? There remains a rest for the people of God and that rest
   is God, Himself! "Return unto your rest, O my Soul; for the Lord has
   dealt bountifully with you." When we know Jehovah's Truth, His
   faithfulness, His power, His wisdom, His Grace, then we rest in Him!
   When we see Him glorified in the majesty of His love in the Person of
   the Well-Beloved Savior, who has redeemed us from death and Hell, then
   we who have believed do enter into rest.

   The Lord makes us partakers of His own Sabbatic rest! The peace of God
   which passes all understanding keeps our hearts and minds by Christ
   Jesus. Beloved, have you not sweet recollections of times when you had
   been tossed with tempests and not comforted, but obtained access to God
   and so entered into a deep calm? When wearied and bewildered, the
   Presence of the Lord has brought you perfect peace and you have felt
   yourself at home. Then have you sung--

   "Let cares like a wild deluge come,

   And storms of sorrow fall.

   My soul has safely reached her home,

   Her God, her Heaven, her All." We have not yet read all the meaning
   that couches beneath this sweet word, "habitation," or home. Our
   habitation is the place of joyful freedom and hearty naturalness. One
   is not stiff and starched at home. You are not guarded, there, as to
   what you say or do, for you are not exposed to criticism and
   misrepresentation. Some of us cannot open our mouths without seeing a
   reporter's pencil twinkling across his prepared paper. Our steps are
   dogged by those who take notes and print them! We live under the
   microscope. We can hardly think without being published, with this
   addition, that what we do not think is often imputed to us! Do not
   wonder if we walk somewhat under constraint. But at home, a man feels,
   "Well, these dear children and the dear wife of my love, and these kind
   friends--I am not afraid of them--they will not misjudge me."

   Did you ever feel that with relation to God? Are you yourself when
   alone with Him? Are you at ease in His Presence? Those firm, stately
   prayers we sometimes hear, majestic and cold--we find no fault with
   them except that there is nothing in them to suit rapt devotion or to
   express the spirit of adoption. Do you pray after a more living, loving
   fashion? God's children dare to be familiar with Him. God so knows our
   hearts that it is of no use to be reserved before Him-- therefore let
   us unlock our hearts and talk with Him as a man talks with his friend.
   Are there not a thousand things you could not tell to any but your God?
   Have you not griefs, yes, sins, which it were wrong to reveal to any
   but to Him? O our God, we have not to study our language while with
   You! Our soul speaks to You without words; her thoughts and emotions
   rise to You in their pure spirit, without the encumbering embodiment of
   speech. Our heart leans against Your heart and You know what we mean,
   even as You have made us to know what You mean, for "the secret of the
   Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them His Covenant."

   Religious people sometimes start back from the prayers of a true saint
   and say, "He is too familiar!" Of course a child is too familiar for
   the imitation of a stranger--but have you ever blamed a child for
   climbing his father's knee? And yet you would not think of copying him!
   Boy, do you know what you are doing? You are playing with a learned
   judge, before whom prisoners tremble and courts are hushed! Even wise
   counselors speak to him as, "My lord." That urchin does not say, "My
   lord." Look! He is plucking him by the beard! He is kissing his cheek!
   What presumption! No! He is the judge's child--he who is judge to
   others is, "father," to him! So the saints of God say, "Our Father
   which are in Heaven," ever reverentially, but yet with sweet
   familiarity! They are at home with Him. Beloved, may you know what that
   means by the teachings of the Spirit of sonship, for only He can teach
   us the blessed freedom of being at home with

   God!

   A man's habitation is also the place of his intimate knowledge. David
   knew the Lord even as he knew the caves in which he had sheltered.
   David could have served as guide to the great hollows of Adullam and
   these, in their vastness and sublimity, may be likened to the mysteries
   of God. There is a weird charm to my mind about caves--I like to visit
   all that are in my way. One is pleased to pass from one subterranean
   room to another and mark the secrets which are revealed by the glare of
   the torches. Here there is a spring of water, there a grand
   stalactite--here is an ascending staircase leading to another
   hollow--and there you must go down by a ladder to a greater depth. This
   is a fair allegory of the way in which the Spirit of God leads us into
   all the Truths of God. In God, even in Christ Jesus, are hid all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge and, within these hiding places we
   find our habitations. David was so much at home with God that he
   entered by earnest trust into one attribute after another and delighted
   in them all! He knew the Lord. He could say, "My meditation of Him
   shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord." He loved to dwell in the
   rocky strongholds of eternal Love, unchanging Grace, almighty Wisdom,
   unspotted Holiness, unerring Purpose and infinite Power. O Brothers and
   Sisters, seek to have the same clear knowledge of the Lord as David
   had, till you can say that you are at home with God, who is your
   habitation!

   Home, also, has about it the thought of tender care. Where are we so
   lovingly watched over as at home? Where else are there such soft
   pillows for our aching heads, such gentle words for our wounded
   spirits? "Take me home," says the sick child. I had the great sorrow,
   yesterday, of speaking to a dear Brother whom I had hoped would be
   spared for great usefulness in a distant land. But he had just
   received, from the doctor's examination, the solemn information that he
   was hopelessly diseased. We proposed that he should go to the seaside,
   but I saw which way his heart went. He thought of his wife and his
   habitation and he said, "Let me go home. If I must die, let it be in my
   own house." He spoke as I would have done in like case. At home, one
   might not have all the skill of the hospital at your command, but one
   would be sure of a certain priceless tenderness which no nurse can
   rival. Lord, You have been my dwelling place--I will die in Your arms!
   When I am sick and weary there is none like You, my God! When my heart
   breaks, none can bind it up but You, my God! I turn to You when in my
   mortal sickness, like Hezekiah, I turn my face to the wall--"Into Your
   hands I commit my spirit." Yes, my unrest is all over when I get to
   You. The ship is in harbor. The bird is in its nest. My heart has found
   the bosom on which it loves to recline. I have all things, my Lord,
   when I have You! You say, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I
   comfort you."

   There is much more in this first part of the verse than I can possibly
   set before you. I have only opened the windows and I now invite you to
   look out upon the landscape so full of beauty!

   II. Secondly, David had realized in God, PEACEFUL SECURITY. "Be You my
   strong habitation"--"My rock of habitation." Now, the child of God,
   when he enters into the Lord by faith, feels himself perfectly safe.
   Safe, first, from all risk of the Lord's changing or failing. God
   Himself is strong, His Love is immutable, His Power is unfailing. This
   is the solid ground of our security. When the winds are out in all
   their fury, those of us whose habitations stand on the top of a hill
   know the value of stability. There are periods in the rage of the storm
   when our habitation shakes like a ship which trembles from stem to
   stern--and though this is very exciting, it does not create a sense of
   peaceful security! When once we enter into God, we do not shake or know
   fear. Rise winds, roar waves, blow tempests, howl hurricanes! There is
   no shaking our sure abode in God! David, in the rocks, had often defied
   the storm, for he felt that though the earth should be removed and the
   mountains be cast into the midst of the sea, he would not fear. Such is
   the confidence of every child of God! God changes not, God's arm is not
   shortened; God is not vanquished; no purpose of God shall be defeated;
   no decree of His shall fail! Rocks may dissolve, but the eternal God
   changes not and His people in Him shall have a sure abode!

   But David also felt great safety from his enemies. When he climbed the
   rocks and crept into his cavern, he knew that his enemies could not
   follow him. Had Saul come with all Israel at his back, David's band
   could have kept armies at bay. He must often have felt like the eagle
   when it has flashed upward to its nest on the craggy rock and from
   there looks down upon the hunters. He is almost out of sight, but he
   can see all the movements of the foe. However long the range of the
   rifle, the noble bird knows no fear, for he is beyond range. I think I
   see him sitting there quietly, eying the enemy, of whom he knows no
   dread. Thus may a child of God defy the great adversary!

   "Let us sing," said Luther, "the 46th Psalm, and defy the devil." The
   devil's restless nature is fretted by the serenity of the firm Believer
   in God--and let him be fretted! His utmost rage is insufficient to hurt
   a single hair of the head of a Believer! No adversary can carry by
   storm our impregnable stronghold. Tyre stood a siege of 13 years, but
   our fortress has been beleaguered throughout the ages and never
   captured! Security, itself, is our portion for time and for eternity
   when we trust in the Lord. I love to think of the child of God as
   getting into God and resting secure beyond the evil designs of the
   malicious hand, the crafty mind and the slanderous tongue. No stone
   will be left unturned to do us ill and yet no stone of our rocky
   habitation shall be dislodged! "No weapon that is formed against you
   shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in
   judgment, you shall condemn."

   The trials of life shall not harm us. The bereavements of death shall
   not cause us to despair. Sickness shall help on our sanctification.
   Poverty shall increase our wealth of experience. When God blesses,
   nothing curses! If God is for us, who can be against us? Under the
   shadow of the Almighty we are out of harm's way. In God we dwell on
   high and our place of defense is the munitions of rocks. What would be
   a crushing disaster to us, apart from God, now turns to a benediction
   with God to overrule it! O child of God, trust in God, for He is worthy
   of all confidence! In Him you are secure in every sense. He that keeps
   you does neither slumber nor sleep--who, then, can do you ill? You are
   secure from the penalty of sin, for Christ has put it away from you,
   bearing the chastisement of your peace. Hidden beneath His Atonement,
   you are

   secure from the wrath of God--your transgression is forgiven, your sin
   is covered--thus the sting is taken from every evil.

   You are secure against final overthrow by your own natural and
   constitutional weaknesses, for the Lord will cleanse your blood which
   He has not cleansed. He will purge you thoroughly and cleanse you from
   all your idols--and write His Law upon your inward parts so that you
   shall not depart from Him. You are secure against all the trials and
   troubles of Providence, since these shall work together for your good!
   The griefs and pangs of death you need not fear, since God is with you
   and will raise you from the grave! The terrors of eternity are not for
   you--immeasurable joys are your portion! Once safe in God, what is
   there to fear? "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect"?
   Who shall "separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
   our Lord?"

   A blessed sense of perfect security ought to be enjoyed by every
   believing man and woman. You ought to be as serene as the glorified,
   since around you there is a wall of fire and God is with you as a glory
   and a defense. The enemies may gather together, but they only gather to
   be scattered! Those that love God and are the called according to His
   purpose are beloved of the Lord and He will interpose His eternal power
   and Godhead between them and evil. When God is our Friend, the whole
   universe is under bond to keep the peace towards us! The beasts of the
   field are at peace with us and the stones of the field are in league
   with us! The stars are our lights, the heavens are our curtains, angels
   are our servitors, the elements are our providers, time is our
   rehearsal and eternity is our anthem of joy! Be glad and rejoice in
   God--and say with the Psalmist--"Be You my strong habitation."

   III. We have now reached our last point, upon which we may be somewhat
   more lengthy than upon the others. David's God was to him a place of
   CONTINUAL RESORT. "Whereunto I may continually resort." I was talking,
   the other day, with a man of God who has very much service and great
   care upon him. And as we communed, the one with the other, he said to
   me--"That expression of the Psalmist is very sweet to me, 'Whereunto I
   may continually resort.' It rises frequently before my thoughts."
   Indeed, I did not wonder, for it is an exceedingly choice expression.
   Happy are we that the gate of communion with God is never locked! In
   our pastoral cares, in our business trials, in our family afflictions,
   in our personal conflicts there is this saving proviso, that we may
   always flee unto God for succor! "Whereunto I may continually resort,"
   said David while the veil was yet untorn--may we not say the same with
   emphasis, today, now that we have access to the holiest by the blood of
   Jesus?

   There is joy in this thing in itself. Is it not a great bliss to have
   the entree of Jehovah's palace day and night? Is it not Heaven below to
   have access without ceasing to Father, Son and Holy Spirit? How blessed
   to enter the golden gate unchallenged and remain unrebuked in the
   pavilion of the King of Kings! O Believer, you may come when you will
   to the Throne of Grace and never fear a repulse! You may come not only
   into the King's palace, but what is infinitely more, into the King,
   Himself, for He is your habitation, whereunto you may continually
   resort! The Persian kings forbade anyone to come near them--and if any
   ventured into the king's court and the monarch did not stretch out the
   silver scepter, the guards cut them down at once. Yet there were
   certain favored courtiers who, by special privilege, had the right to
   approach the king at all times, guard or no guard. These were the
   noblest in the king's dominions.

   Such honor have all the saints! No cherub with flaming sword guards the
   way of approach to God against any child of the great Father! You have
   a privilege that is much greater than any dignity belonging to the
   mightiest monarchs of earth--the privilege of perpetual converse with
   God at whatever hour you will! It ought to make your heart leap for joy
   to think of it! Come in the dewy morning, come at dusky night, come in
   the midnight's dreariest hour--the Lord is always ready to receive
   you--and you may speak freely with Him. This is His Word--"Ask, and it
   shall be given you; seek, and you shall find." "Delight yourself, also,
   in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart." Continual
   access to the God of all Grace is a perpetual fountain of joy!

   There is a great comfort in it as an outlook. "Whereunto I may
   continually resort." Throughout all future time, I may draw near unto
   God! The day may come when I shall be sorely sick and be compelled to
   stay in my bed. And then I may resort unto God! I shall not be able to
   go up to the House of the Lord, but still, I may resort to God, who is
   more than house and home! No form of disease shall shut me out from my
   heavenly Father! I may lie on my bed and sleep--and when I awake I
   shall still be with Him. Old age steals on apace and, perhaps, my feet
   will not be able to bear me to the place of the assembly--but even then
   I may resort to God. When my ears shall grow dull of hearing and I
   shall not enjoy the preaching of the Word of God--even then I shall
   hear the still small voice of the Spirit in my heart! When I am so far

   gone with age that my bed will become the best place for me, I shall
   still enjoy His Presence and sing His praises! O Brothers and Sisters,
   fear not the future, for the Lord says, "I will never leave you nor
   forsake you."

   "Should fate command you to the utmost verge of the green earth, rivers
   unknown to song," yet may you continually resort to God. If you should
   be a castaway upon the salt sea, the Lord sits upon the floods and you
   shall resort to Him there. If you were like Alexander Selkirk, out of
   humanity's reach, yet you would not be out of reach of Divinity! Oh no,
   even in the dreariest solitude you may continually resort to Him whose
   company is better than that of all mankind! In death and in eternity
   this is the perpetual privilege of every Believer in Christ--he may
   still draw near unto God.

   Now, this continual resorting to God is not only a joy in itself and in
   its outlook, but it is a joy which answers so many blessed purposes. I
   wish you would read this 71st Psalm quietly at home in the light of my
   text--then you will see that David found, in coming to God, everything
   that he needed.

   First, he found an escape from present ills--"Deliver me in Your
   righteousness and cause me to escape." As the cony does not fight its
   foe, but hides itself in the rock, so you, in your time of trouble,
   need not go forth to conflict, but may resort continually to your God.
   Stop up the rabbit's burrow and you might soon take him--keep a
   Believer from his God and you would soon destroy him--but so long as he
   can reach his hiding place, no enemy can wreak vengeance on him.

   David also looked upon God as the place of his prayer, for he says,
   "Incline Your ear unto me and save me." We may always pray and when our
   prayer is too weak to rise to Heaven, we may expect the Lord to bow His
   ear to hear our groans. Prayer is never out of season--it is a tree
   which yields its fruit every day! Whenever a trouble drives you to your
   knees, the Lord waits to be gracious. There are certain hours during
   which it is difficult to send a telegram to a friend, but we can, at
   all times, speak with God by the telephone ofprayer. No grief is too
   little, no trial too heavy, no hour too early, no moment too late for
   prayer! "Whereunto I may continually resort." The Mercy Seat abides in
   its place, the veil remains torn and whoever has faith in God may come
   to the Throne of Grace whenever he pleases.

   David, by resorting to the Lord, received upholding. "By You have I
   been held up from the womb...I am as a wonder unto many, but you are my
   strong Refuge." He had kept his footing in slippery places by keeping
   close to God. He had surprised his enemies by the way in which he
   avoided their snares. When he was tempted, he overcame the temptation
   by resorting to God. When he did not resort to God, he fell, as others
   have done.

   David also resorted to God for strength. "Cast me not off in the time
   of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails." He looked beyond
   himself to the unfailing power of the Almighty and expected to be
   strengthened when infirmities crept over him. Do you need more power
   for service, more patience for suffering? Resort to God. They that wait
   upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Go to the Strong for
   strength! By prayer and faith gird yourself with Omnipotence! When you
   need renewing, run to Him who sustains all things. Go and draw water
   from the well of strength! Let down your bucket--drain it dry and let
   it down again--for to this fountain you may "continually resort." If
   you lack strength, you are not straitened in Him--you are straitened in
   your own heart. Believe in God and be strong according to your faith.

   See how David went to God continually in holy praise. Every hour is
   canonical for a man who is ready to praise God. "Let my mouth," he
   says, "be filled with Your praise and with Your honor all the day." We
   may sing unto the Lord even when the voice is cracked and the lungs
   have failed! We need never be afraid that He will reject our praises on
   account of age or infirmity! We may sing to Him in any place, from the
   cellar to the attic! We may sing at our work and sing in our rest, yes,
   sing aloud upon our beds!

   When we have done singing and wish for matter for instructive
   conversation, we shall find abundance of it in the Lord. "My mouth
   shall show forth Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for
   I know not the numbers thereof." We shall always find fresh matter in
   the Lord. No fear, you preachers, of running dry, if the Lord is your
   subject! Who can exhaust the Infinite? Who can come to a standstill for
   lack of themes when the Triune God is the Object of his continual
   meditation? O you servants of the Lord, fill your seed baskets from
   this granary, whereunto you may continually resort!

   David also continually resorted to God for quickening. Notice how he
   puts it in the 20th verse--"You, who have showed me great and sore
   troubles, shall quicken me, again, and shall bring me up, again, from
   the depths of the earth." Have any of you got down there? Do you want
   to rise out of them? Those depths of the earth are not pretty places,
   but we

   stumble into them, sometimes, by careless walking--would you rise from
   them into newness of life? Then resort to God and He will bring you up
   from the lowest deeps! He will raise you from death to life, more
   fitted for holy service than ever!

   The fact is, whatever you need, you have only to go to God for it, and
   whenever you need it, you may go. Whatever your condition, you may
   still resort to the Lord. If you cannot come as a saint, you may come
   as a sinner. If you cannot come boldly, you may come trembling! When
   you feel most unfit to resort to God, you may still go to Him, for He
   is your Fitness and your Physician. When you feel that you dare not go,
   you may still go to Him--"Whereunto I may continually resort."

   There is a blessed positiveness about my text. "I may continually
   resort." I may, I am sure I may! Just now, in the courts of law, it is
   the Long Vacation--nothing can be done in Chancery this month, for the
   poor lawyers must rest-- but there is no Long Vacation in the courts of
   King's Bench above! You may plead your suit and urge your case with God
   every day in the year. The Lord allows, permits, invites, commands you
   to plead with Him! "Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
   you and you shall glorify Me."

   I may continually resort to God, that is to say, He prompts me to do
   so--His Spirit helps my infirmities--He teaches me how to pray. Is not
   this sweet? What more can you desire? You know the way, for Christ is
   the Way--that way is always accessible, for Christ is always with us
   unto the end of the world. Come, tried Believer, ring the night bell
   and call up the great Physician! You have only to call upon Him and He
   will be with you in an instant. Yes, before you call, He will answer
   you! Why, then, do you resort to man so often and to God so seldom? Why
   drink so far down the stream, where it is muddy and polluted, when the
   pure fountainhead may be reached? Men will grow weary of you, but you
   cannot weary God. You may come to the Lord even though conscious of sin
   and backsliding. You may come to Him though your soul is sick and
   faint. He will restore you while you are yet coming! Before you are
   aware, He can fill you with Divine Love. You have but to turn the helm
   towards the harbor of His Love and the wind will turn, too, and you
   shall be happy in the Lord! Come, then, at once, to God in Christ
   Jesus, just as you are! In all your backsliding and coldness of heart
   come to Him for renewal! The Lord has not grown indifferent, nor has He
   shut His door against petitioners.

   You may continually resort to God, for He is never like Baal, on a
   journey, or asleep--He waits to be gracious--He listens for His
   people's cry. You may continually resort to Him with confidence that
   you shall not seek His face in vain, for the Lord is never unable to
   help His people. Whatever the form of their trial, He is prompt to come
   to their rescue. One of old exclaimed, "The Lord was ready to save me."
   All the day long, all the night long and all the year long, in every
   case, and in every place, the Lord sits at receipt of supplication and
   holds Himself in readiness to commune with His people!

   Listen to a parable--A certain young man traded and in all things he
   prospered for a while. In all his dealings he was wise and prudent and
   none were able to overreach him. The cause of his wisdom was that he
   had a father, a man of amazing knowledge, of great experience, of large
   wealth and great influence. His son never entered upon a transaction
   without consulting his father. Whenever he felt himself at all in
   difficulty, he hastened to ask counsel of his father. Whenever he
   needed money to meet a sudden demand, he drew upon his father. Their
   love to each other was more and more manifest as the one trusted and
   the other helped. Does anybody wonder that the young man grew rich?
   But, after a while, the son grew cold towards his father and seldom
   sought his advice. There was no quarrel, but the young man was growing
   independent of his father and preferred to act upon his own judgement.
   He failed to ask and to receive substantial help--which would have been
   freely given--and he fell into great losses which might readily have
   been avoided. The young man became weak as others! He was the prey of
   deceivers. He spent labor and thought and substance upon matters which
   ended in failure. He grew poorer and poorer, till he trembled on the
   verge of bankruptcy. Do you wonder? Do you pity him? Do you see in him
   your own portrait? If so, change it all and say of your heavenly
   Father--He is my Friend and Counselor and, to Him I do continually
   resort. This will be your wisdom, your strength, your happiness and
   your spiritual wealth!

   Multiply your approaches to God. Let them become incessant, constant,
   continual! No man ever resorted to God to excess. It might be possible
   to spend too much time in the posture of devotion, but you can be in
   the spirit of prayer and praise all day long and yet never run to
   extravagance. "Pray without ceasing" is the command of our Infallible
   Lord. Towards men there is a limit of resort, but to God there is none.
   By your continual coming, you will not weary the Lord.

   Through your importunity, you will prevail with Him. I had a dear
   friend whose company I esteemed, but all of a sudden he did not come to
   see me. He stayed away and, as I knew he had not ceased to love me, I
   wondered why. At last I found that the good Brother had taken it into
   his head that he might outrun his welcome--he had read those words of
   Solomon, "withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house; lest he be
   weary of you, and so hate you."

   I admired my friend's prudence, but I labored hard to make him see that
   Solomon knew nothing of me and that I was more wearied when he stayed
   away than when he came! I hope he made me an exception to a very
   sensible rule. But never get that thought into your head concerning
   your God! Will you weary my God, also? You may weary Him by withdrawing
   prayer, but never by abounding in supplication! Abide with your God and
   cry to Him day and night--and let this be the music of your whole life,
   "whereunto I may continually resort."

   Our immediate practical conclusion is this--If we may continually
   resort to God, let us go to Him at once. Let us come before His
   Presence with thanksgiving and prayer even now! Here are several
   thousands of us who profess to have come here to worship--let us all
   draw near unto God, this morning. Let each one hasten to his footstool
   for himself, individually. Forget the vast congregation! Forget
   everything but that which is holy and spiritual--and come unto your God
   who, at this moment, calls you to His footstool. "Alas, I have been so
   worldly all the week"! This is to be confessed and repented of, but it
   must not, now, keep you from God. "But I feel dull and dead." I know it
   and the Lord knows it, too! But you may still approach Him. You
   remember what our Lord Jesus said of the Laodicean Church? That He
   would spue it out of His mouth--but what does He say afterwards?
   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." He says to the same Church,
   "If any man opens the door, I will enter in"--enter into the same
   Church which had so disgusted Him-- "and will sup with Him"--sup with
   that Church of which, just now, He was so sick!

   Come, then, you lukewarm ones and, in coming to Jesus, you will cease
   to be disgusting to Him! Come, you whose spiritual state would make
   Jesus, Himself, sick. He stands at your door and knocks! Open to Him
   and He will enter in, and He will have no distaste of you, but He will
   delight in you! You have returned from your health resorts--now come to
   a still healthier resort! Come, see how graciously Jesus can restore
   your souls and make you full of His life and joy! He will forget your
   sins and, instead of His being sick of you, He will make you glad in
   Him until you shall cry out with the spouse, "Stay me with flagons,
   comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love!" Blessed love sickness!

   If you never have come to Jesus before, come, you chief of sinners,
   now! Come, you that have but little spiritual feeling! Come just as you
   are, since Jesus, from this platform, says, "Come unto Me, all you that
   labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." "The Spirit and
   the bride say, Come." "Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life
   freely." That God who is the house of His people, sets wide His doors
   and writes over them in letters of light, "Whoever will, let him come."
   Jesus comes to the door! He beckons to you and persuades you to enter,
   saying, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." The Lord
   enable you to come, for His dear mercy's sake. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Psalm 71.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Cross Our Glory

   (No. 1859)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 13, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But God forbid that I should glory except in the Cross of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
   world." Galatians 6:14.

   ALMOST all men have something in which to glory. Every bird has its own
   note of song. It is a poor heart that never rejoices. It is a dull
   packhorse that is altogether without bells. Men usually rejoice in
   something or other and many men so rejoice in that which they choose
   that they become boastful and full of vainglory. It is very sad that
   men should be ruined by their glory and yet, many are. Many glory in
   their shame and more glory in that which is mere emptiness. Some glory
   in their physical strength, in which an ox excels them, or in their
   gold, which is but thick clay, or in their gifts, which are but talents
   with which they are entrusted. The pounds entrusted to their
   stewardship are thought, by men, to belong to themselves and,
   therefore, they rob God of the glory of them. O my Hearers, hear the
   voice of Wisdom, which cries, "He that glories, let him glory only in
   the Lord." To live for personal glory is to be dead while we live! Be
   not so foolish as to perish for a bubble! Many a man has thrown his
   soul away for a little honor, or for the transient satisfaction of
   success in trifles. O men, your tendency is to glory in something--your
   wisdom will be to find a glory worthy of an immortal mind!

   The Apostle Paul had a rich choice of things in which he could have
   gloried. If it had been his mind to have remained among his own people,
   he might have been one of their most honored rabbis. He says, in his
   Epistle to the Philippians, in the third chapter, "If any other man
   thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
   circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
   Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the Law, a Pharisee;
   concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness
   which is in the Law, blameless." He says that he profited in the Jews'
   religion above many of his equals in his own nation and he stood high
   in the esteem of his fellow professors. But when he was converted to
   the faith of the Lord Jesus, he said, "What things were gain to me,
   those I counted loss for Christ. Yes doubtless, and I count all things
   but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord."
   As soon as he was converted, he forsook all boasting in his former
   religion and zeal, and cried, "God forbid that I should glory in my
   birth, my education, my proficiency in Scripture, or my regard to
   orthodox ritual. God forbid that I should glory except in the Cross of
   our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Paul might also, if he had chosen, have gloried in his sufferings for
   the Cross of Christ, for he had been a living martyr, a perpetual
   self-sacrifice to the cause of the Crucified. He says, "Are they
   ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool). I am more; in labors more
   abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths
   often. Of the Jews five times received I 40 stripes save one. Thrice
   was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck,
   a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeys often, in perils
   of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in
   perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the
   wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in
   weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in
   fasting often, in cold and nakedness." He was once driven to give a
   summary of these sufferings to establish his Apostleship, but before he
   did so, he wrote, "Would to God you could bear with me a little in my
   folly." In his heart he was saying, all the while, "God forbid that I
   should glory except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   The great Apostle had yet another reason for glorying, if he had chosen
   to do so, for he could speak of visions and revelations of the Lord. He
   says, "I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago. . . caught up to the
   third Heaven. And I knew such a man. . .how that he was caught up into
   Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a

   man to utter." He was in danger of being exalted above measure by
   reason of the abundance of these revelations and, therefore, he was
   humbled by a painful thorn in the flesh. Paul, when hard driven by the
   necessity to maintain his position in the Corinthian Church, was forced
   to mention these things--but he liked not such glorying--he was most at
   ease when he said, "God forbid that I should glory except in the Cross
   of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Brothers and Sisters, notice that Paul does not here say that he
   gloried in Christ, though he did so with all his heart--he declares
   that he gloried most in "the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," which, in
   the eyes of men, was the very lowest and most inglorious part of the
   history of the Lord Jesus! He could have gloried in the
   Incarnation--angels sang of it, wise men came from the far East to
   behold it. Did not the new-born King awake the song from Heaven of,
   "Glory to God in the highest"? He might have gloried in the life of
   Christ--was there ever such another, so benevolent and blameless? He
   might have gloried in the Resurrection of Christ--it is the world's
   great hope concerning those that are asleep. He might have gloried in
   our Lord's Ascension, for He "led captivity captive" and all His
   followers glory in His victory. He might have gloried in His Second
   Advent and, I doubt not, that he did, for the Lord shall soon descend
   from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the
   trumpet of God, to be admired in all them that believe.

   Yet the Apostle selected beyond all these, that center of the Christian
   system, that point which is most assailed by its foes, that focus of
   the world's derision--the Cross--and, putting all else somewhat into
   the shade, he exclaims, "God forbid that I should glory, except in the
   Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." Learn, then, that the highest glory of
   our holy religion is the Cross! The history of Grace begins earlier and
   goes on later, but in its middle point stands the Cross. Of two
   eternities this is the hinge--of past decrees and future glories this
   is the pivot. Let us come to the Cross, this morning, and think of it
   till each one of us, in the power of the Spirit of God, shall say, "God
   forbid that I should glory except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ."

   I. First, as the Lord shall help me, (for who shall describe the Cross
   without the help of Him that hung upon it), WHAT DID PAUL MEAN BY THE
   CROSS? Did he not include, under this term, first, the fact of the
   Cross? Secondly, the Doctrine of the Cross? And thirdly, the Cross of
   the Doctrine?

   I think he meant, first of all, the fact of the Cross. Our Lord Jesus
   Christ did really die, upon a gallows, the death of a felon. He was
   literally put to death upon a tree, accursed in the esteem of men. I
   beg you to notice how the Apostle puts it--"the Cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." In his Epistles, he sometimes says, "Christ." At another time,
   "Jesus," frequently, "Lord," oftentimes, "our Lord"--but here he says,
   "our Lord Jesus Christ." There is a sort of pomp of words in this full
   description, as if in contrast to the shame of the Cross. The terms are
   intended, in some small measure, to express the dignity of Him who was
   put to so ignominious a death. He is Christ, the Anointed, and Jesus,
   the Savior. He is the Lord, the Lord of All, and He is, "our Lord Jesus
   Christ." He is not a Lord without subjects, for He is, "our Lord." Nor
   is He a Savior without saved ones, for He is, "our Lord Jesus." Nor has
   He the anointing for Himself, only, for all of us have a share in Him
   as, "our Christ." In all, He is ours, and was so upon the Cross.

   When they bury a great nobleman, a herald stands at the head of the
   grave and proclaims his titles. "Here lies the body of William, Duke of
   this, and Earl of that, and Count of the other, knight of this order
   and commander of the other." Even thus, in deep solemnity, with brevity
   and fullness, Paul proclaims, beneath the bitter tree, the names and
   titles of the Savior of men and styles Him, "our Lord Jesus Christ."
   There are enough words here to give a four-square description of the
   honor, dignity and majesty of Him who has both Godhead and Manhood and
   "bore our sins in His own body on the tree." Be it forever had in
   reverent remembrance that He who died upon the Cross between two
   thieves counted it not robbery to be equal with God! By nature He is
   such that the creed well describes Him as, "Begotten of His Father
   before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God."
   Yet He "made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a
   servant. . .and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   Cross." I declare this fact to you in words, but I think them poor,
   dumb things. I wish I could speak this matchless truth in fire-flakes!
   The announcement that the Son of God died upon the Cross to save men
   deserves the accompaniment of angelic trumpets and of the harps of the
   redeemed!

   But next, I said that Paul gloried in the Doctrine of the Cross, and it
   was so. What is that Doctrine of the Cross, of which it is written that
   it is "to them that perish foolishness, but unto us who are saved it is
   the power of God and the wisdom of God"? In one word, it is the
   Doctrine of the Atonement, the Doctrine that the Lord Jesus Christ was
   made sin for us, that Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many
   and that God has set Him forth to be the Propitiation for our

   sins. Paul says, "When we were yet without strength, in due time,
   Christ died for the ungodly." And again, "Now once in the end of the
   world has He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." The
   Doctrine of the Cross is that of sacrifice for sin--Jesus is "the Lamb
   of God that takes away the sin of the world." "God so loved the world,
   that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life." The Doctrine is that of a full
   atonement made and the utmost ransom paid. "Christ has redeemed us from
   the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: for it is written,
   Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree." In Christ upon the Cross, we
   see the Just dying for the unjust that He might bring us to God--the
   Innocent bearing the crimes of the guilty that they might be forgiven
   and accepted. That is the Doctrine of the Cross, of which Paul was
   never ashamed.

   This, also, is a necessary part of the Doctrine--that whoever believes
   in Him is justified from all sin. That whoever trusts in the Lord Jesus
   Christ is, in that moment, forgiven, justified and accepted in the
   Beloved. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
   must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have eternal life." Paul's Doctrine was, "It is not of
   him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy." And
   it was his constant teaching that salvation is not of works, nor of
   ceremonies, but simply and only by believing in Jesus! We are to
   accept, by an act of trust, that righteousness which is already
   finished and completed by the death of our blessed Lord upon the Cross.
   He who does not preach Atonement by the blood of Jesus does not preach
   the Cross! And he who does not declare justification by faith in Christ
   Jesus has missed the mark, altogether! This is the very heart of the
   Christian system. If our ministry shall be without blood, it is without
   life, for, "the blood is the life thereof." He that preaches not
   justification by faith knows not the Doctrine of Grace, for the
   Scripture says, "Therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace; to
   the end the promise might be sure to all the seed." Paul gloried both
   in the fact of the Cross and in the Doctrine of the Cross.

   But the Apostle also gloried in the Cross of the Doctrine, for the
   death of the Son of God upon the Cross is the crux of Christianity.
   Here is the difficulty, the stumbling block and rock of offense. The
   Jew could not endure a crucified Messiah--he looked for pomp and power!
   Multitudinous ceremonies and different washings and sacrifices--were
   these all to be put away and nothing left but a bleeding Savior? At the
   mention of the Cross, the philosophic Greek thought himself insulted
   and vilified the preacher as a fool. In effect, he said, "You are not a
   man of thought and intellect; you are not abreast of the times, but are
   sticking in the mire of antiquated prophecies. Why not advance with the
   discoveries of modern thought?" The Apostle, teaching a simple fact
   which a child might comprehend, found in it the wisdom of God! Christ
   upon the Cross, working out the salvation of men was more to him than
   all the sayings of the sages. As for the Roman, he would give no heed
   to any glorying in a dead Jew, a crucified Jew! Crushing the world
   beneath his iron heel, he declared that such romancing would never win
   him from the gods of his fathers.

   Paul did not budge before the sharp and practical reply of the
   conquerors of the world! He did not tremble before Nero in his palace.
   Whether to Greek or Jew, Roman or barbarian, bond or free, he was not
   ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, but gloried in the Cross. Though the
   testimony that the one all-sufficient Atonement was provided on the
   Cross stirs the enmity of man and provokes opposition, yet Paul was so
   far from attempting to mitigate that opposition that he determined to
   know nothing save Jesus Christ and Him crucified! His motto was, "We
   preach Christ crucified." He had the Cross for his philosophy, the
   Cross for his tradition, the Cross for his Gospel, the Cross for his
   glory and nothing else!

   II. But, secondly, WHY DID PAUL GLORY IN THE CROSS? He did not do so
   because he was in need of a theme, for, as I have shown you, he had a
   wide field for boasting if he had chosen to occupy it. He gloried in
   the Cross from solemn and deliberate choice. He had counted the cost,
   he had surveyed the whole range of subjects with an eagle eye and he
   knew what he did and why he did it. He was master of the art of
   thinking. As a metaphysician, none could excel him. As a logical
   thinker, none could have gone beyond him. He stands almost alone in the
   early Christian Church as a master mind. Others may have been more
   poetic, or more simple, but none were more thoughtful or argumentative
   than he. With decision and firmness, Paul sets aside everything else
   and definitely declares, throughout his whole life, "I glory in the
   Cross." He does this exclusively, saying, "God forbid that I should
   glory except in the Cross." There are many other precious things, but
   he puts them all upon the shelf in comparison with the Cross.

   He will not even make his chief point any of the great Scriptural
   Doctrines, nor even an instructive and godly ordinance. No, the Cross
   is to the front. This constellation is chief in Paul's sky. The choice
   of the Cross he makes devoutly,

   for although the expression used in our English version may not stand,
   yet I do not doubt that Paul would have used it, and would have called
   upon God to witness that he abjured all other ground of glorying save
   the atoning Sacrifice--

   "Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, Save in the death of Christ, my
   God! All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to His
   blood."

   He would have called God to witness that he knew no ambition save that
   of bringing glory to the Cross of Christ. As I think of this, I am
   ready to say, "Amen," to Paul and bid you sing that stirring verse--

   "It is the old Cross still, Hallelujah!Hallelujah! Its triumphs let us
   tell, Hallelujah! hallelujah! The Grace of God here shone Through
   Christ, the blessed Son, Who did for sin atone. Hallelujah for the
   Cross!"

   Why did Paul thus glory in the Cross? You may well desire to know, for
   there are many, nowadays, who do not glory in it, but forsake it! Alas
   that it should be so, but there are ministers who ignore the Atonement!
   They conceal the Cross, or say but little about it. You may go through
   service after service and scarcely hear a mention of the atoning
   blood-- but Paul was always bringing forward the expiation for
   sin--Paul never tried to explain it away. Oh the number of books that
   have been written to prove that the Cross means an example of
   self-sacrifice, as if every martyrdom did not mean that! They cannot
   endure a real substitutionary Sacrifice for human guilt and an
   effectual purifying of sin by the death of the great Substitute. Yet
   the Cross means that or nothing!

   Paul was very bold. Although he knew this would make him many enemies,
   you never find him refining and spiritu-alizing--the Cross and the
   Atonement for sin are plain matters of fact to him. Neither does he
   attempt to decorate it by adding philosophical theories. No, to him it
   is the bare, naked Cross all blood-stained and despised! In this he
   glories and in none of the wisdom of words with which others vexed him.
   He will have the Cross--the Cross and nothing but the Cross! He
   pronounces an anathema on all who propose a rival theme--"But though
   we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that
   which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."

   I take it that this was so, first, because Paul saw in the Cross a
   vindication of Divine Justice. Where else can the Justice of God be
   seen so clearly as in the death of God, Himself, in the Person of His
   dear Son? If the Lord Himself suffers on account of broken Law, then is
   the majesty of the Law honored to the fullest! Some time ago, a judge
   in America was called upon to try a prisoner who had been his companion
   in his early youth. It was a crime for which the penalty was a fine,
   more or less heavy. The judge did not diminish the fine. The case was
   clearly a bad one and he fined the prisoner the maximum fine. Some who
   knew his former relation to the offender thought him somewhat unkind to
   thus carry out the law, while others admired his impartiality. All were
   surprised when the judge quitted the bench and paid, himself, every
   farthing of the penalty! He had shown both his respect for the law and
   his goodwill to the man who had broken it. He exacted the penalty, but
   he paid it himself.

   So God has done in the Person of His dear Son. He has not remitted the
   punishment, but He has, Himself, endured it. His own Son, who is none
   other than God, Himself--for there is an essential union between
   them--has paid the debt which was incurred by human sin. I love to
   think of the vindication of Divine Justice upon the Cross. I am never
   weary of it! Some cannot bear the thought, but to me it seems
   inevitable that sin must be punished, or else the foundations of
   society would be removed. If sin becomes a trifle, virtue will be a
   toy! Society cannot stand if laws are left without penal sanction, or
   if that sanction is to be a mere empty threat. Men in their own
   governments, every now and then, cry out for greater severity. When a
   certain offense abounds and ordinary means fail, they demand exemplary
   punishment--and it is but natural that they should do so, for deep in
   the conscience of every man there is the conviction that sin must be
   punished to secure the general good. Justice must reign, even
   benevolence demands it! If there could have been salvation without an
   Atonement, it would have been a calamity--righteous men, and even
   benevolent men, might deprecate the setting aside of law in order to
   save the guilty from the natural result of their crimes.

   For my own part, I value a just salvation. An unjust salvation would
   never have satisfied the apprehensions and demands of my conscience.
   No, let God be just even if the heavens fall! Let God carry out the
   sentence of His Law, or the universe will suspect that it was not
   righteous--and when such a suspicion rules the general mind, all
   respect for God will be gone! The Lord carries out the decree of His
   Justice even to the bitter end, abating not a jot of its requirements.
   Brothers and Sisters, there was an infinite efficacy in the death of
   such a One as our Lord Jesus Christ to vindicate the Law. Though He is
   Man, yet is He also God and, in His passion and death, He offered to
   the Justice of God a vindication not at all inferior to the punishment
   of Hell! God is just, indeed, when Jesus dies upon the Cross rather
   than that God's Law should be dishonored. When our august Lord,
   Himself, bore the wrath that was due for human sin, it was made evident
   to all that law is not to be trifled with. We glory in the Cross, for
   there the debt was paid, our sins on Jesus laid.

   But we glory because on the Cross we have an unexampled display of
   God's love. "God commends His love toward us, in that, while we were
   yet sinners, Christ died for us." Oh to think of it, that He who was
   offended takes the nature of the offender and then bears the penalty
   due for wanton transgression! He who is Infinite, thrice holy, all
   glorious, forever to be worshipped, yet stoops to be numbered with the
   transgressors and to bear the sin of many! The mythology of the gods of
   high Olympus contains nothing worthy to be mentioned in the same day
   with this wondrous deed of supreme condescension and Infinite Love! The
   ancient Shasters and Vedas have nothing of the kind! The death of Jesus
   Christ upon the Cross cannot be an invention of men--none of the ages
   have produced anything like it in the poetic dreams of any nation! If
   we did not hear of it so often and think of it so little, we would be
   charmed with it beyond expression! If we now heard of it for the first
   time and seriously believed it, I know not what we would not do in our
   glad surprise! Certainly we would fall down and worship the Lord Jesus
   and continue to worship Him forever and ever!

   I believe again, thirdly, that Paul delighted to preach the Cross of
   Christ as the removal of all guilt. He believed that the Lord Jesus on
   the Cross finished transgression, made an end of sin and brought in
   everlasting righteousness. He that believes in Jesus is justified from
   all things from which he could not be justified by the Law of Moses.
   Since sin was laid on Jesus, God's justice cannot lay it upon the
   believing sinner. The Lord will never punish the same offense twice. If
   He accepts a Substitute for me, how can He call me to His bar and
   punish me for that transgression for which my Substitute endured the
   chastisement? Many a troubled conscience has caught at this and found
   deliverance from despair. Wonder not that Paul gloried in Christ, since
   it is written, "In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
   and shall glory." This is the method of salvation which completely and
   eternally absolves the sinner and makes the blackest offender white as
   snow! Transgression visited upon Christ has ceased to be, so far as the
   Believer is concerned. Does not Faith cry, "You will cast all their
   sins into the depths of the sea"? O Sirs, there is something to glory
   in in this and those who know the sin-removing power of the Cross will
   not be hindered in this glorying by all the powers of earth or Hell!

   Paul glories in it, again, as a marvel of wisdom. It seemed to him the
   sum of perfect wisdom and skill. He cried, "O the depths of the riches
   both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" The plan of salvation by
   vicarious suffering is simple, but sublime. It would have been
   impossible for human or angelic wisdom to have invented it! Men already
   so hate it and fight against it that they never would have devised it!
   God, alone, out of the treasury of His Infinite Wisdom brought forth
   this matchless project of salvation for the guilty through the
   Substitution of the Innocent. The more we study it, the more we shall
   perceive that it is full of teaching. It is only the superficial
   thinker who regards the Cross as a subject soon to be comprehended and
   exhausted! The most lofty intellects will here find ample room and
   space enough. The most profound minds might lose themselves in
   considering the splendid diversities of light which compose the pure
   white light of the Cross! Everything of sin and justice, of misery and
   mercy, of folly and wisdom, of force and tenderness, of rage and pity
   on the part of man and God may be seen here. In the Cross may be seen
   the concentration of Eternal Thought, the focus of Infinite Purpose,
   the outcome of Illimitable Wisdom. Of God and the Cross we may say--

   "Here I behold His inmost heart, Where Grace and vengeance strangely
   join; Piercing His Son with sharpest smart To make the purchased
   pleasures mine."

   I believe that Paul gloried in the Cross, again, because it is the door
   of hope even to the vilest of the vile. The world was very filthy in
   Paul's time. Roman civilization was of the most brutal and debased kind
   and the masses of the people were sunken in vices that are altogether
   unmentionable. Paul felt that he could go into the darkest places with
   light in his hand when he spoke of the Cross. To tell of pardon bought
   with the blood of the Son of God is to carry an Omnipo-

   tent message! The Cross lifts up the fallen and delivers the
   despairing. Today, my Brothers and Sisters, the world's one and only
   remedy is the Cross. Go, you thinkers, and get up a mission to the
   fallen in London, leaving out the Cross! Go, now, you wise men, reclaim
   the harlots and win to virtue the degraded by your perfumed
   philosophies! See what you can do in the slums and alleys without the
   Cross of Christ! Go talk to your titled reprobates and win them from
   their abominations by displays of art! You will fail, the most
   cultivated of you, even to win the rich and educated to anything like
   purity, unless your themes are drawn from Calvary and the Love which
   there poured out its heart's blood!

   This hammer breaks rocky hearts, but no other will do it. Pity, itself,
   stands silent. Compassion bites her lip and inwardly groans she has
   nothing to say till she has learned the story of the Cross. But, with
   that on her tongue, she waxes eloquent! With tears she entreats,
   persuades, prevails! She may but stammer in her speech--like Moses, she
   may be slow of utterance--but the Cross is in her hand as the rod of
   the Prophet. With this she conquers the Pharaoh of tyrannical sin! With
   this she divides the Red Sea of guilt! With this she leads the host of
   God out of the house of bondage into the land of promise which flows
   with milk and honey! The Cross is the standard of victorious Grace! It
   is the lighthouse whose cheering ray gleams across the dark waters of
   despair and cheers the dense midnight of our fallen race, saving from
   eternal shipwreck and piloting into everlasting peace.

   Again, Paul, I believe, gloried in the Cross, as I often do, because it
   was the source of rest to him and to his Brethren. I make this
   confession and I make it very boldly, that I never knew what rest of
   heart truly meant till I understood the Doctrine of the Substitution of
   our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, when I see my Lord bearing away my sins as
   my Scapegoat, or dying for them as my Sin Offering, I feel a profound
   peace of heart and satisfaction of spirit. The Cross is all I ever need
   for security and joy. Truly, this bed is long enough for a man to
   stretch himself on. The Cross is a chariot of salvation where we
   traverse the high road of life without fear! The pillow of Atonement
   heals the head that aches with anguish. Beneath the shadow of the
   Cross, I sit down with great delight, and its fruit is sweet to my
   taste. I have no impatience even to hasten to Heaven while resting
   beneath the Cross, for our hymn truly says--

   "Here it is I find my Heaven, While upon the Cross I gaze."

   Here is perfect cleansing and, therefore, a Divine security guarded by
   the Justice of God. And, therefore, a "peace of God, which passes all
   understanding." To try to entice me away from the God's Truth of
   Substitution is labor in vain! Seduce me to preach the pretty nothings
   of modern thought? This child knows much better than to leave the
   substance for the shadow, the truth for the fancy! I see nothing that
   can give to my heart a fair exchange for the rest, peace and
   unutterable joy which the old-fashioned Doctrine of the Cross now
   yields me. Will a man leave bread for husks and quit the home of his
   love to dwell in a desolate wilderness? I dare not renounce the Truth
   of God in order to be thought cultured! I am no more a fool than the
   most of my contemporaries and if I could see anything better than the
   Cross, I would willingly grasp it as they--for it is a flattering thing
   to be thought a man of light and leading! But where shall I go if I
   quit the Rock of the atoning Sacrifice? I cannot go beyond my simple
   faith that Jesus stood in my place and bore my sin and took it away.
   This I must preach! I know nothing else! God help me, I will never go
   an inch beyond the Cross, for to me all else is vanity and vexation of
   spirit! Return unto your rest, O my Soul! Where else is there a glimpse
   of hope for you but in Him who loved you and gave Himself for you?

   I am sure Paul gloried in the Cross yet, again, because he saw it to be
   the creator of enthusiasm. Christianity finds its chief force in the
   enthusiasm which the Holy Spirit produces--and this comes from the
   Cross. The preaching of the Cross is the great weapon of the crusade
   against evil. In the old times, vast crowds came together in desert
   places, among the hills, or on the moors, at peril of their lives, to
   hear preaching. Did they come together to hear philosophy? Did they
   meet at the dead of night, when the hounds of persecution were hunting
   them, to listen to pretty moral essays? I think not! They came to hear
   of the Grace of God manifest in the Sacrifice of Jesus to believing
   hearts! Would your modern Gospel create the spirit of the martyrs? Is
   there anything in it for which a man might go to prison and to death?
   The modern speculations are not worth a cat's dying for them, much less
   a man!

   A something lies within the Truth of the Cross which sets the soul
   aglow! It touches the preacher's lips as with a live coal and fires the
   hearer's hearts as with flame from the Altar of God. We can live on
   this Gospel--and for this Gospel die. Atonement by blood, full
   deliverance from sin, perfect safety in Christ given to the Believer
   call a man to joy, to

   gratitude, to consecration, to decision, to patience, to holy living,
   to all-consuming zeal! Therefore, in the Doctrine of the Cross we
   glory, neither will we be slow to speak it out with all our might!

   III. My time has gone, or else I had intended to have enlarged upon the
   third head, of which I must now give you the mere outline. One of
   Paul's great reasons for glorying in the Cross was its action upon
   himself. WHAT WAS ITS EFFECT UPON HIM?

   The Cross is never without influence. Come where it may, it works for
   life or for death. Wherever there is Christ's Cross, there are also two
   other crosses. On either side there is one and Jesus is in the middle.
   Two thieves are crucified with Christ and Paul tells us their names in
   his case--"The world is crucified to me, and I unto the world." Self
   and the world are both crucified when Christ's Cross appears and is
   believed in! Beloved, what does Paul mean? Does he not mean just
   this--that ever since he had seen Christ, he looked upon the world as a
   crucified, hung up thing which had no more power over Paul than a
   criminal hanged upon a cross? What power has a corpse on a gallows?
   Such power had the world over Paul. The world despised him and he could
   not go after the world if he would--and would not go after it if he
   could! He was dead to it and it was dead to him and, therefore, there
   was a double separation!

   How does the Cross do this? To be under the dominion of this present
   evil world is horrible--how does the Cross help us to escape? Why,
   Brothers and Sisters, he that has ever seen the Cross looks upon the
   world's pomp and glory as a vain show! The pride of heraldry and the
   glitter of honor fade into meanness before the Crucified One. O you
   great ones, what are your silks, your furs, your jewelry, your gold,
   your stars and your garters to one who has learned to glory in Christ
   Crucified! The old clothes which belong to the hangman are quite as
   precious. The world's light is darkness when the Sun of Righteousness
   shines from the Cross! What do we care for all the kingdoms of the
   world and the glory thereof when once we see the thorn-crowned Lord?
   There is more glory about one nail of the Cross than about all the
   scepters of all kings! Let the knights of the Golden Fleece meet in
   chapter and all the Knights of the Garter stand in their stalls, but
   what is all their splendor? Their glories wither before the inevitable
   hour of doom, while the glory of the Cross is eternal! Everything of
   earth grows dull and dim when seen by the light of the Cross!

   So was it with the world's approval. Paul would not ask the world to be
   pleased with him, since it knew not his Lord, or only knew Him to
   crucify Him. Can a Christian be ambitious to be written down as one of
   the world's foremost men when that world cast out His Lord? They
   crucified our Master! Shall His servants court their love? Such
   approval would be all stained with blood. They crucified my Master, the
   Lord of Glory--do I want them to smile on me and say to me, "Reverend
   Sir," or, "Learned Doctor"? No! The friendship of the world is enmity
   with God and, therefore, to be dreaded! Mouths that spit on Jesus shall
   give me no kisses! Those who hate the Doctrine of the Atonement hate my
   life and soul--and I desire not their esteem.

   Paul also saw that the world's wisdom was absurd. That age talked of
   being wise and philosophical! Yes, and its philosophy brought it to
   crucify the Lord of Glory! It did not know perfection, nor perceive the
   beauty of pure unsefish-ness. To slay the Messiah was the outcome of
   the culture of the Pharisee. To put to death the greatest Teacher of
   all time was the ripe fruit of Sadducean thought. The serious thoughts
   of the present age have performed no greater feat than to deny the
   Doctrine of satisfaction for sin! They have crucified our Lord afresh
   by their criticisms and their new theolo-gies--and this is all the
   world's wisdom ever does. Its wisdom lies in scattering doubt,
   quenching hope and denying cer-tainty--and, therefore, the wisdom of
   the world to us is sheer folly! This century's philosophy will one day
   be spoken of as an evidence that softening of the brain was very usual
   among its scientific men! We count the thought of the present moment to
   be methodical madness, Bedlam out of doors and those who are furthest
   gone in it are credulous beyond imagination! God has poured contempt
   upon the wise men of this world! Their foolish heart is blinded, they
   grope at noonday.

   So, too, the Apostle saw the world's religion to be nothing. It was the
   world's religion that crucified Christ. The priests were at the bottom
   of it, the Pharisees urged it on. The church of the nation, the church
   of many ceremonies, the church which loved the traditions of the
   elders, the church of phylacteries and broad-bordered garments--it was
   this church, which, acting by its officers, crucified the Lord! Paul,
   therefore, looked with pity upon priests and altars and upon all the
   attempts of a Christless world to make up, by finery of worship, for
   the absence of the Spirit of God. Once see Christ on the Cross and
   architecture and fine display become gaudy, cheap things. The Cross
   calls for worship in spirit and in truth--and the world knows nothing
   of this.

   And so it was with the world's pursuits. Some ran after honor, some
   toiled after learning, others labored for riches. But to Paul, these
   were all trifles since he had seen Christ on the Cross. He that has
   seen Jesus die will never go into the toy business--he puts away
   childish things. A child, a pipe, a little soap and many pretty
   bubbles--such is the world. The Cross, alone, can wean us from such
   play.

   And so it was with the world's pleasures and with the world's power.
   The world, and everything that belonged to the world, had become as a
   corpse to Paul and he was as a corpse to it. See where the corpse
   swings in chains on the gallows. What a foul, rotten thing! We cannot
   endure it! Do not let it hang longer above ground to fill the air with
   pestilence. Let the dead be buried out of sight. The Christ that died
   upon the Cross now lives in our hearts. The Christ that took human
   guilt has taken possession of our souls and, therefore, we live only in
   Him, for Him, by Him. He has engrossed our affections. All our ardors
   burn for Him. God make it to be so with us, that we may glorify God and
   bless our age!

   Paul concludes this Epistle by saying, "From henceforth let no man
   trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus." He was
   a slave, branded with His Master's name. That stamp could never be
   erased, for it was burned into his heart. Even thus, I trust the
   Doctrine of the Atonement is our settled belief and faith in it is part
   of our life. We are rooted and grounded in the unchanging Truths of
   God! Do not try to convert me to your new views--I am past it. Forget
   about me! You waste your breath. It is done--on this point the wax
   takes no farther impress. I have taken up my standing and will never
   quit it. A crucified Christ has taken such possession of my entire
   nature, spirit, soul and body, that I am henceforth beyond the reach of
   opposing arguments!

   Brothers and Sisters, will you enlist under the conquering banner of
   the Cross? Once rolled in the dust and stained in blood, it now leads
   on the armies of the Lord to victory! Oh that all ministers would
   preach the true Doctrine of the Cross! Oh that all Christian people
   would live under the influence of it and we should then see brighter
   days than these! Unto the Crucified be glory forever and ever! Amen.

"Behold, He Prays"

   (No. 1860)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 20, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus, for,
   behold, he prays." Acts 9:11.

   THESE words are the hallmark of genuine conversion. "Behold, he prays"
   is a surer witness of a man's conversion than, "Behold, he sings," or,
   "Behold, he reads the Scripture," or, "Behold, he preaches." These
   things may be admirably done by men who are not regenerate! But if, in
   God's sense of the term, a man really prays, we may know for sure that
   he has passed from death unto life. True prayer is a sure evidence of
   spiritual quickening--the Holy Spirit has put spiritual life into the
   heart of the man who prays, for prayer is the breath of heavenly life.
   Prayer is the outcome of that sense of need which arises from the new
   life--a man would not pray to God if he did not feel that he had urgent
   need of blessings which only the Lord can bestow. While expressing his
   sense of need and appealing to God for help, the praying man gives
   evidence of being at peace with his Lord and cured of his natural
   alienation. He who prays, trusts, and thus reveals the faith which
   saves. Some forms of prayer display great faith, but all real prayer is
   the working of faith, either little or great. Will a man cry to God for
   mercy if he does not believe in Him? Will he plead at the Mercy Seat if
   he does not expect to obtain his desire? Thus, dear Friends, prayer of
   the true kind is a voucher for the existence of spiritual life in its
   consciousness of need, in its turning towards God and in its faith in
   Him.

   Prayer is the autograph of the Holy Spirit upon the renewed heart.
   Prayer is also an admirable form of communion with God and, as the
   carnal mind can have no fellowship with God, it becomes the token of
   regeneration, the evidence of adoption! He that prays has some
   knowledge of God, some acquaintance with the great Invisible. The habit
   of private prayer and the constant practice of heart fellowship with
   the Most High are the surest indicators of the work of the Holy Spirit
   upon the heart. When it can be said of a man, "Behold, he prays," the
   seal of the great King is upon him! He bears the endorsement of the
   Searcher of hearts. Hence the Lord gave to Ananias this sure indication
   that Saul of Tarsus was a converted man, by saying to him, "Behold, he
   prays."

   In Saul's case, this indication was very specially remarkable. "Behold,
   he prays" had a peculiar meaning in relation to this conversed
   Pharisee. I shall have to show you this at length. It was thought a
   great wonder that king Saul, of the Old Testament, prophesied. So
   unexpected and amazing was the event that it became a proverb--"Is Saul
   also among the Prophets?" But it was an equal marvel when this more
   modern Saul was seen to pray! Is Saul of Tarsus among those who pray to
   Jesus for mercy? The Lord from Heaven, Himself, mentions it as a
   prodigy! He points to it as a thing to be beheld and wondered at, for
   He says to His servant Ananias, "Behold, he prays."

   I. We will begin our discourse with the following observation--This
   expression concerning Saul of Tarsus is remarkable, for IT IMPLIES THAT
   HE HAD NEVER BEFORE PRAYED. "Behold, he prays" could hardly be spoken
   of one who had been accustomed to pray in former days.

   This is very striking, for Saul was a Pharisee and, therefore, a man
   who habitually repeated prayers. Pharisees boasted of the regularity,
   number and length of their prayers. Perhaps there had never been a day
   in Saul's life from the time in which he was conscious in which he had
   not gone through his prayers. Many devout Jews spent nine hours a day
   in prayer, for they occupied an hour in actual supplication and sat
   still for an hour before and an hour after prayer--and this was done
   three times a day! Pharisees offered prayer not only in the Temple and
   in the synagogue, but even at the corners of the streets where they
   could be seen of men. Whatever the quality of their praying might be,
   there was plenty of it in quantity. If any fact was in public evidence
   so that nobody could deny it, it was that Saul of Tarsus had been much

   in prayer and, therefore, it is the more striking that the Lord,
   Himself, should say to Ananias concerning this constantly devout
   Pharisee, "Behold, he prays."

   Behold how the Lord revises the judgements of men! In the opinion of
   all who knew Saul of Tarsus, the disciple of Gamaliel, he was much
   given to prayer. But He who searches the hearts and knew Saul well--and
   knew truthfully what prayer is--here declares that now, at last, Paul
   begins to pray! Despite all his former superfluity of ostentatious
   devotion, Saul, all his life, had never prayed at all! What his friends
   would have put down as a great mass of prayer, the Lord here makes
   nothing of! Until the first broken-hearted confession of sin came from
   the poor blinded persecutor of Jesus, the Lord considered that he had
   never prayed! I want to push this fact home upon some who are present
   with us, this morning. I mean those who, in a formal manner, have
   always prayed and yet have never spiritually prayed. Your mother taught
   you a form of prayer--you repeated this form all through your childhood
   and your youth. At this moment you are most regular in bowing the
   knees, both morning and evening, and yet no single prayer may ever have
   risen from your heart to the heart of God!

   You go constantly to your place of worship; you are diligently
   observant of every Christian ordinance; you join in the responses, or
   you bow your head and listen in silence to the extemporary utterance of
   your minister and, therefore, you suppose that you pray--and yet it may
   be a vain supposition! If anyone were to say that you had not prayed,
   you would be very angry! And yet it is possible that such a statement
   would be strictly true. How much I long that today, for the first time,
   you may in real earnest cry unto the Lord God and cause Him to bear
   witness that now, indeed, you pray! You will then think little of all
   your heartless repetitions of prayers and you will cry to God for the
   Holy Spirit who helps our infirmities, since we know not what we should
   pray for as we ought.

   I have told you that the Pharisees were noted for their prayers and,
   therefore, it seems the more amazing that the Lord should announce that
   Saul of Tarsus had now begun to pray. Yet it was so--he was now
   offering his first real prayer. That prayer of the Pharisee which we
   read just now from the 18th Chapter of Luke was meant for prayer, but
   there is not a particle of prayer in it! He did not ask for anything.
   He did not confess a necessity, nor plead a promise. He did not seek
   mercy, nor mention propitiation. His formal thanksgiving was stained
   with proud self-esteem and it was more the boast of vanity than the
   request of humility! Much of what is called prayer is the husk and not
   the kernel of prayer. Suppose you take the best form that was ever
   written and you go through that in the most orderly style--you may do
   that and continue to do it throughout a life of 70 years--and yet you
   may never have sought God in real earnest!

   If you prefer to compose your own prayers, you may do so throughout
   life and you may make prayers which shall be excellent in language. You
   may even make a new one every morning and every evening--and yet there
   may not have been a single atom of true supplication in the whole round
   of pious effusions! What if your first prayer has yet to be prayed?
   What a solemn suggestion to you who have been nursed in the lap of
   piety and wrapped in the garments of religion! I do not wonder that it
   cuts you to the quick. This heart-searching enquiry ought not to be
   thrust aside as if it did not concern you. Unless your heart speaks to
   God; unless your soul comes into spiritual contact with the great
   Father of Spirits, your form of prayer, whether it is liturgical or
   extemporaneous, is of little worth! God is not the God of the dead, but
   of the living--and this applies to prayers as well as men--

   "God abhors the sacrifice Where not the heart is found."

   One sentence of true heart-pleading, such as, "God be merciful to me, a
   sinner," is worth volumes of mere lip-service!

   Real prayer must be spiritual and Saul's prayers had not been such
   before. Words are but the body of devotion--the confession of sin, the
   longing for mercy, the groaning for Grace--these are the soul and
   spirit of prayer! A man may have repeated the choicest words and these
   may have been the outward embodiment of true prayer because his heart
   went with them--but, on the other hand, he may have used equally select
   expressions and may not have prayed at all--for there may have been in
   him no stirring of the heart towards God. A man may utter no words
   whatever. He may sit in absolute silence and he may be praying most
   effectually. Moses cried aloud when he said not a word and Hannah was
   heard in the Temple when she made no sound, but only her lips moved! I
   reckon that those prayers which cannot be expressed in language are
   often the most deep and fervent. When desires are so weighty that they
   burden our words and even crush them down, then are they most prevalent
   with God. There is power in that solemn silence which is "frost of the
   mouth, but

   thaw of the mind," when the soul flows with strong current in a deep
   and hidden bed till it reaches the heart of God and prevails with Him.

   Anyway, that prayer which is not spiritual is not reckoned of the Lord
   to be prayer at all, for "God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him
   must worship Him in spirit and in truth." You may, if you like, praise
   God with organs, as the English do, or you may pray to God with
   windmills, as the Tartars do--the things are very much alike, as I
   believe-- but your praising and your praying will not be measured by
   the heaving of the bellows, nor by the revolution of the sails. They
   will be measured only by the heart work which was in them. If the
   spirit does not commune with God, there has been no prayer. There may
   have been music and oratory, but there has been no prayer if the
   spiritual nature has not spoken with the Father of Spirits. Notice,
   then, that we only begin to pray when we begin to live spiritual lives.

   Next to this, Saul had never prayed a single right prayer of the kind
   which the Lord can accept. Saul, up to then, had not known the Lord
   Jesus and, therefore, he did not know the way of access to the Father
   through His Son, whom He has appointed Mediator. Saul knew the letter
   of the Truth of God according to the Ceremonial Law, but he did not
   know the spirit of it as it is embodied in Jesus. He had been going
   about to establish his own righteousness, but he had not submitted
   himself to the righteousness of Christ and, therefore, in his prayers
   he had not been traversing the road which led to the heart of God. If a
   man, using his rifle at Wimbledon in a contest for a prize, were told,
   "It is not that target on the right, but this upon the left which must
   be aimed at," if he would continue to shoot towards the right, even
   though he should make a center, yet he would not have scored! Inasmuch
   as that was not the target appointed in the competition, his best shots
   would count for nothing.

   When a man does not pray in the Lord's appointed way, nor through Jesus
   Christ, nor in dependence upon the Holy Spirit, he does not pray at
   all! However fine his prayer, it is only a splendid sin. If you employ
   a servant to do a work and he obstinately persists in doing another
   thing, he will not earn his wages. However industriously he works at
   what you have never set him to do, he will receive nothing at your
   hands. So if you pray to God in a way which God has never ordained; if
   you refuse to use the name which He has appointed; if you neglect the
   cultivation of that holy and humble spirit which the Lord will, alone,
   accept, you may pray till your tongue cleaves to the roof of your
   mouth, but in God's judgement you have not prayed at all and you will
   not receive anything of the Lord!

   It is certain, too, that Saul of Tarsus had never made mention of the
   name of Jesus in his prayers and, therefore, God reckoned that he had
   not prayed. Saul had heard of Jesus, but he had rejected His claims and
   hated His people. Our heavenly Father never turns a deaf ear to the
   name of Jesus when it is honestly pleaded. But He will not hear us if
   we despise that ever-blessed name. There is no other name under Heaven
   given among men whereby we must be saved! There is no other name by
   which we can hopefully approach the Mercy Seat! Saul had rejected that
   name and had come in his own name and, therefore, he had not prayed at
   all. Suppose a king should make a rule that every petition that was
   presented to him should bear a certain stamp which his representative
   would freely put upon it? Then if a man neglected or refused to have
   his petition thus endorsed, he could not wonder if his petitions were
   treated as impertinences and returned unanswered! Virtually, such a man
   has sent in no petition, whatever, since he has declined to comply with
   the regulation without which no petition can be received! Friends, let
   us see to it that we most humbly and heartily, in our prayers, plead
   the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the force of prayer
   lies mainly in our pleading the name and work of the well-beloved Son
   of God! We must set ourselves on one side and hide ourselves behind the
   Lord Jesus--for we and our prayers can only be accepted in the Beloved,
   through the Person, the merit, the sacrifice, the ever-living
   intercession of the Lord Jesus Christ! If we have not prayed in the
   name of Jesus, we have not prayed at all!

   Furthermore, I should like you to notice that real prayer cannot come
   from men whose characters are contrary to the mind of God. He whose
   character contradicts his prayer has not prayed. His life has
   effectually pleaded against his lips. Saul of Tarsus was opposed to the
   Son of God--how could he be in favor with God? He did not believe the
   Gospel, though the seal of God was on it--how, then, could God receive
   his prayer? How shall the Lord listen to us if we will not listen to
   Him? How shall God accept us if we will not accept His Son? If we set
   ourselves in opposition to His Gospel, do we not shut the door of mercy
   in our own faces? While we pretend to be knocking at Heaven's gate, we
   are turning the key against ourselves! Saul had been more than an
   opposer, he had become a persecutor--can persecutors enjoy the favor of
   God? Can we hope for God's blessing while we are cursing God's people?
   How can a persecutor pray?

   Saul of Tarsus was evidently full of hate and cruelty--how could he
   pray? Love is the element of the children of God! "Everyone that loves
   is born of God"--but Saul had conceived such an intense disgust against
   the followers of the Crucified, that he hauled them to prison and voted
   for their death! Brothers and Sisters, we have no right to persecute
   any man for his religion or his irreligion--whether he is Catholic,
   Jew, Muslim, or Infidel, we must do nothing wrong towards him, nor rob
   him of any of his rights, however erroneous his views may be. We are
   bound to be just and right towards all men as men, whatever their
   religions convictions, or irreligious notions. Injustice is no friend
   to the Truth of God! We must not fight God's battles with the weapons
   of ill will. For us to hate those who are in error and talk of them
   with contempt or wish them ill, or do them wrong is not according to
   the Spirit of Christ. You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct
   error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of
   the Christian is love and if Paul had sought to overthrow what he
   thought to be an error by love, although he had been mistaken, he would
   not have been so guilty.

   Whoever they might be, whether righteous or wicked, men or women, he
   would compel them to blaspheme the name of Jesus, whom he judged to be
   an impostor. He sought to domineer over their consciences and to
   oppress them for their beliefs. How, then, can God hear his prayer? If
   you have the spirit of hate in you, it nullifies your devotions and
   makes your prayer to be no prayer. In love lies the essence of prayer
   and prayer ought to be the flower and crown of love. If I go through
   the world hating my fellow men because they differ from me. If I am
   determined to force my own doctrines upon others with an iron hand, I
   cannot lift that hand in prayer! A malicious heart pollutes the
   sacrifice which it offers. When I come before God in prayer, I may be
   offending Him when I dream that I am pleasing Him. Friend, if you are
   living an ungodly life, I do not care how regularly you bend your knees
   in seeming devotion, there is nothing in it! If you are not living as a
   Christian should, your prayers prove nothing--your matins and your
   vespers, your family prayers and your Prayer Meetings are the mimicry
   of prayer and nothing more.

   You may have been baptized and you may have frequented the Lord's
   Table, but it is all mockery--the caricature of godliness and nothing
   more--unless you strive after holiness and labor to conform your life
   to the will of God. God will hear us when we hear Him--He will do our
   will when we do His will. But persistence in known sin and especially
   indulgence in enmity and hatred are so destructive to prayer, that till
   we are free from them, we do not pray! Be at peace with all men, or
   talk not of prayer! Lay aside all opposition to the Gospel of the Lord
   Jesus or you can no more pray than a fiend of the Pit!

   Yet again--Saul, with all his prayers, had never truly prayed because
   humility was absent from his devotions. What a test this is! Saul had
   gone about the world feeling that he was a righteous man. Did he not
   wear texts of Scripture between his eyes? What a pious man he was! Had
   he not broad borders on his garments--borders of blue? What a saint he
   was! Did he not fast thrice in the week and pay tithes of mint and
   anise and cummin? There was not a better man in all the dominions of
   Caesar than this Saul, in his own judgment! When he prayed, there was a
   high flavor of self-righteousness in his religious exercise and this
   made them disgusting to the Most High. The Lord delights in humble and
   contrite spirits, but the proud, He knows afar off. There was no
   confession of sin, no crying for mercy through a propi-tiation--his
   prayer was the expression of thankfulness that Saul of Tarsus was a
   Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the Law, blameless!

   In the courts above, where outward appearances are nothing and God
   looks at the heart, his pious harangues were not reckoned to be prayers
   at all. If you feel quite content with your own prayers, permit me to
   suggest that you do not pray, for few who pray aright are ever content
   with their own petitions. Those who dream themselves to belong to the
   Good-Enough family will find themselves bad enough and the Too-Goods
   will find themselves shut out of Heaven! If you have a righteousness
   made out of your prayers, throw it to the dogs! Self-righteousness is a
   leaven which the Lord commands us to put away, for He abhors it and
   considers that it pollutes His Passover. If you pray as a deserving
   person, pleading your own good deeds, there is such a lie at the bottom
   of your prayers that you have not prayed at all!

   I say again this makes terrible work of a great many persons who have
   been brought up in outward religion. Dear Friend, be not vexed or angry
   if this should seem to come home to you. If before your eyes the whole
   heap upon your threshing floor should be blown away like chaff, thank
   God that it has been blown away so soon, while there is time to gather
   the true wheat! It is better for you to make the sad discovery now,
   than to make it when you come to die, or to wake up in another world
   where there will be no hope of rectifying the error! Let this thought
   come to every professor of

   religion this morning--that you may have been a praying man or woman
   for years, you may have come, like Saul of Tarsus, to the fullness of
   your age and have abounded in the appearance of devotion--and yet you
   may have to pray to God for the first time!

   II. This brings me to my second reflection, and that is, IT IS IMPLIED
   IN THE TEXT THAT IT WAS A REMARKABLE THING FOR SUCH A PERSON TO NOW
   PRAY. It is put with an ecce, a mark of admiration, "Behold,

   he prays!" It is a very difficult thing, a very marvelous thing, for a
   man to truly pray who has been, all his lifetime, praying in a false
   way! It is a miracle of Grace to bring a proud Pharisee to plead for
   mercy like a penitent publican! It is not half so wonderful that an
   irreligious man should begin to pray as that a vainglorious professor
   should begin to pray. The most remarkable conversion that could take
   place here, today, would not be that of Elymas, the sorcerer, but of
   Saul, the Pharisee! The most remarkable conversion in the Apostolic age
   was that of a man who, from his youth up, had been plunged in
   self-righteousness and in the self-content which comes of attention to
   ritual, ceremony and the form of godliness. "Behold he prays."

   It is hard for him to pray because he is a person who has been a
   formalist for a long time. He is so rooted in the habit of formal
   devotion and so contented with it that it is extremely difficult to
   bring him to attend to spiritual things. The letter kills in more
   senses than one--and the man so killed has no life for the things of
   the spirit. If he goes up to his chamber at the hour of prayer, he runs
   along the old trams without the least feeling and heart. He repeats the
   words, but he might as well be reading an unknown language. The
   tendency is to say the same thing over and over again till the lips
   move mechanically and the soul is in a deep slumber. The Bible is read,
   but the mind is dozing. The sermon is heard, but the heart is
   wandering. Where is the good of this? Yet how hard it is to get men out
   of it! It is easier to attend a thousand "masses," or to go to church
   every day in the week, than to offer one true prayer!

   It is very difficult for you who are rich in nominal devotion to enter
   the Kingdom of Heaven. It is hard to get the robe of Christ's
   righteousness upon that man's back who believes that his own coat is as
   good as it needs to be--he has worn his own rags so long that they
   cling to him! He is too proud to beg, for he has lived so long like a
   gentleman on his own income. He has been rich and increased in goods so
   long--and in need of nothing--that he has grown so used to his way of
   external and superficial religion, that you cannot get him, without a
   miracle of Grace, to seek after that which is deep and true.

   Again, self-righteousness is a very great hindrance to coming to Christ
   in prayer. In Christ's day, the publicans and harlots entered the
   Kingdom before the Pharisees who were self-righteous! It is a great
   thing to conquer sinful self, but it is a greater thing to overcome
   righteous self. The man who is downright bad and feels it, asks for
   mercy, but these people are bad at heart and do not feel it and,
   therefore, they will not seek the Lord. They think that they have done
   everything they ought to have done--wrapping themselves about in their
   shoddy righteousness, they imagine themselves to be quite fit to enter
   into the royal feast without putting on the wedding garment of the
   king's providing! It costs a self-righteous man a great effort to stoop
   to prayer. If he did but know that his righteousness is only a part of
   his filthiness, he would change his note. The Scripture says, "All our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags." When we see them to be such, we
   are glad to be rid of them, for they are loathsome in themselves and
   the foul disease of pride poisons every thread!

   The man that has been accustomed to pray without his heart and to be
   pious without being converted is very hard to be made to pray because
   he is prejudiced against the way of Grace. He has made up his mind that
   he will not see the Light of God because he believes in his own light.
   You talk to him about salvation by Grace, redemption by the precious
   blood and justification by faith, alone, but he cannot stand such
   themes--they may suit the wicked, but he is of another breed! He is
   overshadowed with the glory of himself and, therefore, he cannot see
   the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. The habit of superficial
   external religion once formed is as hard to break as for the Ethiopian
   to change his skin. A man hugs his self-righteousness as he hugs his
   life. Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has, will he give for his
   legal life, the life of

   self.

   Besides, a self-righteous man knows that everybody thinks him to be
   right and, therefore, he cannot demean himself by such prayers and
   confessions as might suit a common sinner. If you talk to him about
   being converted, why, dear Sir, he needs no conversion! He was born
   good! He has always been a Christian! He needs no change--you don't
   know what a fine gentleman he is! He never cries in the bitterness of
   his soul, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." Why should he? His mother
   and father were extremely good people and he was born again at the
   baptismal font and has since been confirmed!

   What more do you need? Washed in the blood of Jesus? Well, perhaps he
   needs this as others do, but there is no special sin in him, nothing,
   certainly, for which he could be condemned. Persons who are of this
   order are seldom brought to pray. They may be called reprobate silver,
   for the Lord has rejected them. If ever such as these are saved, it
   will astonish men and angels--and the Lord Himself will cry, "Behold,
   he prays."

   Even religious intensity and fervor may become a hindrance to a man's
   conversion when that ardor is for a false faith. The earnest formalist
   is encased in steel and the arrows of the Gospel glance off him. Some
   worship every nail of the church door and every tile of the chancel. If
   such a thing as a priest should cross the road, they are ready to kiss
   the ground he treads upon! How can these be brought to the simplicity
   of the faith? Among Dissenters are there not persons who are obstinate
   for trifles, conservative for old methods, inflexible with habit,
   ferocious for externals and yet devoid of spiritual life? Those who
   have none of the inward and spiritual Grace are often the more fierce
   for the outward and visible sign. The man who has no money is a great
   stickler for a respectable appearance, the fact being that if he does
   not keep that up, he will soon be in the Gazette. A sincerely gracious
   Christian is tempted, rather, to think too little of externals than too
   much of them. He sets the highest value upon the inner life and faith
   in the Lord Jesus. I say again, Brothers and Sisters, it is such a
   wonderful thing that the externally-religious man ever should begin to
   pray in earnest that it is recorded as a wonder! "Behold, he prays."

   See what was needed in Saul's case to make him pray--the Lord Jesus
   must, Himself, appear and bring him to his knees! Nothing less than a
   Light shining from Heaven could show him his vileness! Oh that such a
   Light would break upon all self-righteous souls! The proud man must
   fall to the earth, cast down from his high places! Until he lies low,
   he will still glory in his flesh. He must be struck with blindness,
   that he may be ready to accept the sight of faith. Three days he must
   neither eat nor drink, to wean him from earth and make him feed on the
   Bread of Heaven. Great must be the agony of his spirit, for he that has
   been so intensely self-righteous cannot be brought to Christ without a
   wrench. He that has rested in himself so completely and so long needs
   to be torn up by the roots before he will quit his carnal confidences.
   It takes, as it were, a special interposition of Grace to bring a
   religious professor to pray in spirit and in truth!

   III. And now I want you to notice, in the third place, that albeit it
   was a great wonder that Saul prayed, yet IT IS DIVINELY DECREED IN THE
   TEXT THAT HE DID.

   One would have liked to have heard Saul of Tarsus pray. Look at him
   now! This fine, good man! How humble, how lowly he is! His prayer began
   with a full and grievous confession of sin. He offered neither excuse
   nor extenuation. He looked to Him whom he had pierced and mourned for
   Him. He acknowledged that he was the chief of sinners--"Because I
   persecuted the Church of God." The only thing he could say by way of
   apology was, "I did it ignorantly, in unbelief." Look at him there,
   alone in his chamber, with his eyes opened and yet blinded, He weeps,
   cries, groans and humbles himself before the Lord. Indeed, he prays!
   The other day, as he rode along to Damascus, everybody looked upon him
   as a saint, but now by his own confession, he is a sinner of the
   blackest sort! Listen how he defames himself! He repents in dust and
   ashes! He prays for mercy. He begs to be forgiven his scarlet sins. He
   acknowledges that if he were sent to Hell, it would be no more than
   just, but he begs that for the Savior's sake, he may be spared and
   permitted to see the Light of God's Countenance. I think I hear him
   making this sad confession. Behold, he now prays!

   Now you will find him acknowledging his great need. "Why," he says,
   "Lord, I need everything! It is not one thing that I am devoid of, but
   everything is gone that is worth having. I need a new heart and a right
   spirit. I need the Truth of God in the hidden parts and that, in the
   inward parts, I may be made to know wisdom." He had nothing to boast
   of--he had turned from a boastful millionaire into a beggar! He would
   cry, "Lord, give me my sight again, but specially grant me my spiritual
   sight. Take away the scales from my heart as well as from my eyes! Help
   me to see Jesus as my Savior! Help me to live to His Glory, as before I
   have lived to persecute Him." He prayed this time--and none could doubt
   it!

   I think I can see mingled with that prayer the lowliest adoration. How
   he would worship Jesus of Nazareth as his God now that he was conquered
   by Him! How he would cry, "My Lord, my Lord, have I been persecuting
   You? Are You the Messiah whom all the 12 tribes expected, and have I
   rejected You? Did I sit to see Your servant, Stephen, stoned, and keep
   the garments of those that stoned him, and I have been breathing out
   threats against You, my Lord?" Surely the deep homage of his chastened
   spirit must have come up sweetly before the exalted Lord as Saul bowed
   himself in the dust before Him and said again and again, "God forbid
   that I should glory, except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
   "Behold, he prays!"

   Consider what pleas he had. Did it ever strike you how Saul must have
   pleaded? Pleading is the truest and strongest part of prayer. Now, how
   did Saul of Tarsus plead? Assuredly he urged the promise, "Let the
   wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let
   him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him, and to our
   God, for He will abundantly pardon." He knew the Old Testament
   Scriptures better than we do and he would be sure to use them in his
   prayer. I hear him crying, "O Lord, You have said, 'Come, now, and let
   us reason together, says the Lord; though your sins are as scarlet,
   they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they
   shall be as wool.'" Surely, he also went over that 51st Psalm, every
   bit of it--it suited him exactly. "Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O
   God, God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your
   righteousness."

   Do you not think that when he had gone over those promises, he would
   then plead the types of the Ceremonial Law concerning Christ? How the
   53rd of Isaiah must have flashed in his mind! He was blinded, but what
   a light must have flamed up in his spirit as he saw the Man of sorrows,
   the acquaintance of grief, and heard the Prophet say, "Surely He has
   borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. . .The chastisement of our
   peace was upon Him." How Saul would begin to cry to Jesus, "Oh, Son of
   God, be my Scapegoat, be my Sin Offering, be my morning and evening
   Sacrifice! Be to me the blood of sprinkling and the Paschal Lamb!"
   Knowing, as he did, all the types of the Jewish Law, he must have found
   them rich in comfort, now that, in beholding Jesus, he had found the
   Key of them all!

   And, Beloved, all this must have been steeped in a wonderful fervor. If
   we could have stood outside the door and listened, we should have
   understood why the Lord said, "Behold, he prays." Before, you might
   have heard him repeating words, but now he uttered groans, cries, sobs
   and tears! Before, you might have said to yourself, "He is saying his
   prayers," but this time it was as when a man wrestles for his life and
   is in bitterness for his only son! All previous prayer was sham, but
   this was real! All the rest was but a performance, but now he did real
   business with the Most High! "Behold, he prays." Now he is a real
   Israel, and lo, he comes off more than conqueror through Him that has
   taught him to pray!

   IV. Lastly, we see that as soon as he did pray, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE
   LORD ACCEPTED HIS PRAYER.

   How do I know this from the text, "Behold, he prays"? Well, I know it
   from the text, first, because here is God bearing witness that he did
   pray. Might not the Lord stand in a Prayer Meeting and hear a dozen of
   us talk our piece and never say, "Behold, he prays"? But if a voice
   from Heaven were to say concerning someone, "Behold, he prays," we
   would know that the man was accepted of the Lord. So it was with Saul.
   The first time he prayed, God heard him. Try it, my Friend, try it! If
   this is your first prayer this morning, breathe it to God with humble
   faith and He will hear you!

   We know that God had accepted this first prayer, for He was about to
   answer it. He had Ananias in readiness to go and comfort the poor
   blinded penitent. God is about to answer your prayer, my dear Brother,
   this morning, if you have cried to Him. Perhaps the man is present in
   the Tabernacle who will speak to you before you leave these walls, or
   somebody will soon call to tell you the way of peace more perfectly. If
   now you quit the way of self-righteousness and formal devotion and
   begin to cry out for the living God, that God will meet you!

   Moreover, we are sure that God accepted this first prayer because He
   called attention to it by a, "Behold." It is as if God said to angels,
   to men, to everybody--"Behold, he prays." We have heard of the seven
   wonders of the world and of other marvels concerning which men cry,
   "Behold," but that which strikes God most is a praying man, a sinner
   praying! God does not say, "Behold Herod on his throne," or, "Behold
   Caesar in his palace," but He does say, "Behold, he prays," as if He
   would make the praying man the center of observation, the focus of
   regard! "Behold, he prays." The heart of God is delighted with true
   prayer. The arch-enemy notices true prayer and trembles when a man
   falls on his knees. And God would have all His saints on earth and His
   saints in Heaven look down upon a man in prayer. To the great Father's
   heart, it is a prodigal returning! He cries, "Behold, he prays," but He
   means, "Behold, he is coming home! Behold, he seeks his Father's face!
   Behold, I have found My son which I had lost!" Prayer is God's delight,
   God's admiration!

   Beloved, has this ever been the case with you, that you could draw the
   attention of the great God to yourself? I am afraid there are many of
   whom it would have to be said, "Behold, he never prays!" What a sight
   upon earth--a man created by his Maker who never worships his
   Creator--a man who is daily fed by God's bounty, but never worships
   Him! Sir, you are a monster, you are a creature among men most
   loathsome! A man that lives without prayer ought not to live!

   It is a wonder that the earth does not open her mouth and swallow up
   such a wretch! And yet when he does pray, God makes a wonder of it!

   It is his first prayer this morning. I see him--the sermon is over and
   he has reached home. He has gone up to his room. He is afraid somebody
   will come in and disturb him--he is turning the key. He is kneeling by
   the side of that bed on which he has slept so often without prayer and
   he cries, "O God, I do not know what to say, but be merciful to me, a
   sinner, and forgive my sins!" I hear the rustling wings of angels as
   they gather around the sacred spot! Soon they fly upward crying,
   "Behold, he prays!" Years shall pass on with you, young man, and you
   shall come to middle life and be exposed to sharp temptation--what will
   you do then? Good spirits watch you, fearing lest you should go astray,
   and devils watch for your halting. You will then remember that day in
   the middle of September when you first prayed--and you will say to
   yourself, "I will again cry unto God, as I have often done." You go
   upstairs and say, "Lord, many days have passed since first I cried to
   You and I have not ceased to cry, but now I am in special trouble. I
   beseech You, deliver me!" God will help you. The great wheel of
   Providence will revolve for you. Meanwhile, both angels and devils have
   spied you out--the angels sing and the devils mutter, "Behold, he
   prays."

   A few years have passed. The young man has grown old and the time is
   come that he must die. He has gone up to the same room for the last
   time and there are those about him who weep and watch. Mark the sweet
   serenity of the departing soul! He is looking into eternity without
   fear. He knows whom he has believed and he is ready to depart. What is
   he doing in his expiring moments? "Behold, he prays." Prayer, which has
   long been his vital breath and native air, is now--

   "His watchword at the gates of death-- He enters Heaven with prayer!"
   Demons that gather about our last hour shall flee away as bats fly out
   of a cavern scared by a torch! They shall flee when they hear the
   voice, "Behold, he prays." The shining ones shall gladly meet the soul
   that is on Jordan's bank when they hear the voice, "Behold, he prays."
   They shall meet the praying spirit on the other side of the river and
   shall smile while the prayer of earth melts into the praise of Heaven!
   Soon shall we be forever with the Lord! God grant it may be so, for His
   name's sake. Amen.

The Lowly King

   (No. 1861)

   Delivered on Thursday Evening, June 25th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [15]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
   behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation,
   lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an
   ass."Zechariah 9:9.

   I. DO not intend to expound the whole text at any length, but simply to
   dwell upon the lowliness of Jesus. Yet this much I may say: whenever
   God would have his people especially glad, it is always in himself. If
   it be written, "Rejoice greatly," then the reason is, "Behold, thy King
   cometh unto thee!" Our chief source of rejoicing is the presence of
   King Jesus in the midst of us. Whether it be his first or his second
   advent, his very shadow is delight. His footfall is music to our ear.

   That delight springs much from the fact that he is ours. "Rejoice
   greatly, O daughter of Zion: . . . behold, thy King cometh unto thee."
   Whatever he may be to others, he is thy King, and to whomsoever he may
   or may not come, he cometh unto thee. He comes for thy deliverance,
   thine honor, thy consummated bliss. He keeps thy company: he makes thy
   house his palace, thy love his solace, thy nature his his home. He who
   is thy King by hereditary right, by his choice of thee, by his
   redemption of thee, and by thy willing choice of him, is coming to
   thee; therefore do thou shout for joy.

   The verse goes on to show why the Lord our King is such a source of
   gladness: "He is just, and having salvation." He blends righteousness
   and mercy; justice to the ungodly, and favor to his saints. He has
   worked out the stern problemhow can God be just, and yet save the
   sinful? He is just in his own personal character, just as having borne
   the penalty of sin, and just as cleared from the sin which he
   voluntarily took upon him. Having endured the terrible ordeal, he is
   saved, and his people are saved in him. He is to be saluted with
   hosannas, which signify, "Save, Lord"; for where he comes he brings
   victory and consequent salvation with him. He routs the enemies of his
   people, breaks for them the serpent's head, and leads their captivity
   captive. We admire the justice which marks his reign, and the salvation
   which attends his sway; and in both respects we cry, "Blessed is he
   that cometh in the name of the Lord"!

   Moreover, it is written of him that he is lowly, which cannot be said
   of many kings and princes of the earth; nor would they care to have it
   said of them. Thy King, O daughter of Jerusalem, loves to have his
   lowliness published by thee with exceeding joy. His outward state
   betokens the humility and gentleness of his character. He appears to be
   what he really is: he conceals nothing from his chosen. In the height
   of his grandeur he is not like the proud monarchs of earth. The patient
   ass he prefers to the noble charger; and he is more at home with the
   common people than with the great. In his grandest pageant, in his
   capital city, he was still consistent with his meek and lowly
   character, for he came "riding upon an ass." He rode through Jerusalem
   in state; but what lowliness marked the spectacle! It was an
   extemporized procession, which owed nothing to Garter-king-at-arms, but
   everything to the spontaneous love of friends. An ass was brought, and
   its foal, and his disciples sat him thereon. Instead of courtiers in
   their robes, he was surrounded by common peasants and fishermen, and
   children of the streets of Jerusalem: the humblest of men and the
   youngest of the race shouted his praises. Boughs of trees and garments
   of friends strewed the road, instead of choice flowers and costly
   tapestries: it was the pomp of spontaneous love, not the stereotyped
   pageantry which power exacts of fear. With half an eye every one can
   see that this King is of another sort from common princes, and his
   dignity of another kind from that which tramples on the poor. According
   to the narrative, as well as the prophecy, there would seem to have
   been two beasts in the procession. I conceive that our Lord rode on the
   foal, for it was essential that he should mount a beast which had never
   been used before. God is not a sharer with men; that which is
   consecrated to his peculiar service must not have been aforetime
   devoted to lower uses. Jesus rides a colt whereon never man sat. But
   why was the mother there? Did not Jesus say of both ass and foal,
   "Loose them, and bring them unto me"? This appears to me to be a token
   of his tenderness: he would not needlessly sever the mother from her
   foal. I like to see a farmer's kindness when he allows the foal to
   follow when the mare is ploughing or labouring; and I admire the same
   thoughtfulness in our Lord. He careth for cattle, yea, even for an ass
   and her foal. He would not even cause a poor beast a needless pang by
   taking away its young; and so in that procession the beast of the field
   took its part joyfully, in token of a better age in which all creatures
   shall be delivered from bondage, and shall share the blessings of his
   unsuffering reign. Our Lord herein taught his disciples to cultivate
   delicacy, not only towards each other, but towards the whole creation.
   I like to see in Christian people a reverence towards life, a
   tenderness towards all God's creatures. There is much of deep truth in
   those lines of "The Ancient Mariner":

   "He prayeth best who loveth best
   All things both great and small."

   Under the old law this tenderness was inculcated by those precepts
   which forbade the taking of the mother-bird with her young and the
   seething of a kid in its mother's milk. Why were these things
   forbidden? There would seem to be no harm in either of these practices,
   but God would have his people tender-hearted, sensitive, and delicate
   in their handling of all things. A Christian should have nothing of the
   savage about him; but everything that is considerate and kind. Our Lord
   rode through the streets of Jerusalem with an ass, and a colt the foal
   of an assfor he is lowly in heart, and gentle to all. His is no
   mission of crushing power, and selfish aggrandisement; he comes to
   bless all things that be, and to make the world once more a Paradise,
   wherein none shall be oppressed. Blessed Savior, when we think of the
   sufferings of thy creatures, both men and beasts, we pray thee to
   hasten thy second advent, and begin thy gentle reign!

   Now, this riding of Christ upon an ass is remarkable, if you remember
   that no pretender to be a prophet, or a divine messenger, has imitated
   it. Ask the Jew whether he expects the Messiah to ride thus through the
   streets of Jerusalem. He will probably answer "No." If he does not, you
   may ask him the further question, whether there has appeared in his
   nation anyone who, professing to be the Messiah, has, at any time, come
   to the daughter of Jerusalem "riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the
   foal of an ass." It is rather singular that no false Messiah has copied
   this lowly style of the Son of David. When Sapor, the great Persian,
   jested with a Jew about his Messiah riding upon an ass, he said to him,
   "I will send him one of my horses": to which the Rabbi replied, "You
   cannot send him a horse that will be good enough, for that ass is to be
   of a hundred colors." By that idle tradition the Rabbi showed that he
   had not caught the idea of the prophet at all, since he could not
   believe in Messiah's lowliness displayed by his riding upon a common
   ass. The rabbinical mind must needs make simplicity mysterious, and
   turn lowliness into another form of pomp. The very pith of the matter
   is that our Lord gave himself no grand airs, but was natural,
   unaffected, and free from all vain-glory. His greatest pomp went no
   further than riding through Jerusalem upon a colt the foal of an ass.
   The Mohammedan turns round with a sneer, and says to the Christian,
   "Your Master was the rider on an ass; our Mohammed was the rider on a
   camel; and the camel is by far the superior beast." Just so; and that
   is where the Mohammedan fails to grasp the prophetic thought: he looks
   for strength and honor, but Jesus triumphs by weakness and lowliness.
   How little real glory is to be found in the grandeur and display which
   princes of this world affect! There is far more true glory in
   condescension than in display. Our Lord's riding on an ass and its foal
   was meant to show us how lowly our Savior is, and what tenderness there
   is in that lowliness. When he is proclaimed King in his great Father's
   capital, and rides in triumph through the streets, he sits upon no
   prancing charger, such as warriors choose for their triumphs, but he
   sits upon a borrowed ass, whose mother walks by its side. His poverty
   was seen, for of all the cattle on a thousand hills he owned not one;
   and yet we see his more than royal wealth, for he did but say, "The
   Lord hath need of them," and straightway their owner yielded them up.
   No forced contributions supply the revenue of this prince; but his
   people are willing in the day of his power. He is thy King, O Zion!
   Shout, to think that thou hast such a Lord! Where the scepter is love,
   and the crown is lowliness, the homage should be peculiarly bright with
   rejoicing. None shall groan beneath such a sway; but the people shall
   willingly offer themselves; they shall find their liberty in his
   service, their rest in obedience to him, their honor in his glory.

   Now, my brethren, you may forget the hosannas of that day of Palms, for
   I beg you to confine your thoughts to the consideration of the
   lowliness of our divine Lord and Master. "Behold, thy King cometh unto
   thee . . . lowly, and riding upon an ass."

   Let us think for a few minutes upon the displays of the lowliness of
   our Lord Jesus Christ; then upon the causes of that lowliness; and
   thirdly, upon certain lessons to be learnt from that lowliness.

   I. First, then, let us think of THE DISPLAYS OF LOWLINESS MADE BY OUR
   LORD JESUS CHRIST. You do not need me to remind you how devoutly we
   worship him as God over all, blessed for ever. Yet while on earth he
   veiled his Godhead, and laid bare his lowliness. His sojourn here below
   was full of the truest greatness; but it was a grandeur, not of
   loftiness, but of lowliness; not of glory, but of humiliation. Our Lord
   was never more glorious in the deepest sense than in his humiliation:
   because of it "he shall be exalted, and extolled, and shall be very
   high."

   First, think of the lowliness of Christ in even undertaking the
   salvation of guilty men. Man without sin, as God first made him, is
   certainly a noble creature. It is written, "Thou hast made him a little
   lower than the angels." But, as a sinner, man is a base and
   dishonorable being, only worthy to be destroyed. In that character he
   has no claims to be regarded of God at all. If it had pleased the
   divine supremacy to blot this rebel race from existence, God might
   readily have repaired the loss by the creation of superior beings; and
   it was lowliness of the tenderest kind which led our Lord, who took not
   up angels when they fell, to take up the seed of Abraham. If it were
   possible for some tall archangel to espouse the cause of emmets upon
   their hill in yonder forest, it would be a wondrous stoop; yet it would
   be nothing compared with the condescension of the eternal God in bowing
   from his lofty throne to redeem and sanctify the sons of men. We are
   frail creatures at the best; born yesterday, we die to-day: we are as
   green leaves in the forest for a while, and then our autumn comes, we
   fade, and the wind carries us away. For such ephemera the Lord of glory
   came to this sin-shadowed globe. Were he not of a lowly mind, he had
   never found his delights with the sons of men, nor would he have
   thought upon the woes of poor and needy ones.

   Herein, in the next place, he showed his lowlinessthat he actually
   assumed our nature. I cannot tell that story, it is too wonderful. A
   free spirit voluntarily encases itself in human clay: a pure spirit
   willingly becomes a partaker of flesh and blood! This is marvellous
   lowliness. The strong is compassed with infirmity; the happy assumes
   capacity for suffering; the infinitely holy becomes one of a race
   notorious for its iniquity! This is a triumph of lowliness. The great
   God, the Infinite of ages, unites himself with a human body; he is born
   into our infancy, he grows up into our youth, he toils through our
   manhood; he accomplishes a life like our own! This is a miracle of
   lowliness. Methinks the angels still gaze into these things, and wonder
   at the Word made flesh. It is particularly said of our incarnate Lord
   that he was "seen of angels"; and that leads us to believe that angels
   watched him with intense curiosity, and ever-growing interest,
   wondering what it all could mean, that he, who made and ruled the
   heavens, should be born of a woman, and made under the law. They
   wondered that he should eat, and drink, and sleep, and sigh, and
   suffer, like the creatures of his hand; and should, indeed, be such as
   they were! Surely they talk of it now with hushed voices and astonished
   hearts, and will so talk of it throughout the ages. Made lower than his
   angels are, his angels must feel a solemn awe at such a divine descent
   of love. This lowliness was such as only God could display: let us
   worship in the person of our Lord a condescending love as unique as the
   Person who exhibited it.

   Furthermore, when our Lord found himself below, in the fashion of a
   man, he manifested his true lowliness by carrying out to the full the
   part of a servant. He had taken upon himself the form of a servant by
   becoming man, but it was no matter of form with him. He became actually
   obedient; having put on the livery of service, he executed the lowest
   office. Never scullion in a king's kitchen did menial work so
   thoroughly as he. In his great house there are vessels to honor and to
   dishonor, and he selected to be used for the lowest offices; he made
   himself of no reputation; he became a servant of servants; all they
   that saw him laughed him to scorn; "he was despised, and we esteemed
   him not." If anybody was wanted to talk with a fallen woman, he was
   soon seen sitting on the well; if anyone was needed to win a publican,
   he was speedily at the house of Zaccheus. If any man must needs be
   slandered as having a devil and being mad, he is ready to bear the
   worst reproach. He could truthfully say, "Ye call me Master, and Lord:
   and ye say well; for so I am"; yet he, their Master and Lord, had
   washed their feet, and therein proved that he was meek, and lowly of
   heart. Brothers, it is a wonderful thing that the Lord of all should
   have become the servant of all; it is so wonderful that many have lost
   their way in thinking of it; they have been unable to grasp the idea of
   Godhead combined with servitude, majesty united with obedience. Indeed,
   it is only by faith that we can realize that he that built all things
   yet became so poor a thing as Mary's Son, so sad a being as the Man of
   sorrows, so lowly a personage as the "despised and rejected of men."
   Yet so it was; and herein he showed the truth of his own statement, "I
   am meek and lowly in heart." He wore the yoke himself, and therefore
   can experimentally say, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me . . .
   and ye shall find rest unto your souls." This is he who breaks not the
   bruised reed, and quenches not the smoking flax. This is he who
   "endured such contradiction of sinners against himself." His life was
   one long proof of meekness and lowliness, and in nothing did he fail:
   he exhorts us to conquer by the same persevering methods; for he has
   proved that gentleness and meekness will prevail.

   Still, let me keep you thinking upon the lowliness of your Lord when I
   bid you remember his life-long poverty. He does not advise his
   disciples voluntarily to espouse poverty, unless it be for his sake,
   and then they do well. Times have been, and may be again, when
   believers must forsake all things for his cause; but in his day some of
   his disciples ministered him of their substance, and therefore had
   substance. He did not command these to renounce that substance, and
   become poor, though I doubt not that, when persecution came, many of
   them gladly did so for his sake. Not to all did he put the test, "Sell
   all that thou hast"; but it was needful to his own personal work that
   he should become poor, that his people might be made rich; and this he
   cheerfully endured. He was laid in a borrowed cradle in the stable
   wherein he was born; he dwelt in his work-life in borrowed houses, and
   lived upon the charity of his followers; and when he rested, it was in
   a borrowed bed; for though the foxes had holes, he had not where to lay
   his head. He preached from a borrowed boat; and when he fell asleep,
   and died, he was buried in a borrowed tomb, for he had no foot of land
   for a possession. He endured poverty as if he were to the manner born;
   for he was quite at home among the poor and lowly, receiving sinners
   and eating with them. Truly, a dignity surrounded him far more real
   than that which has been conceived to hedge a king; and yet in his
   poverty he never seemed uneasy, and the society of the poor and
   unlearned never grieved him. He was with the poorest as one of them;
   and they knew it, and therefore they loved to gather about him. He was
   so sweetly and tenderly their associate that the common people heard
   him gladly.

   Remember, that he might have quitted that poverty at any moment; he
   that could turn water into wine, might have quaffed full many a
   delicious draught had he so willed; he that could multiply bread and
   fish needed never to have hungered. A word from him might have created
   palaces more wonderful than the dreams of Aladdin, and wealth greater
   than the abundance of Solomon, for nothing was impossible to him. If he
   had willed to make himself the object of his own life, he could have
   surrounded himself with every luxury; but, instead thereof, "though he
   was rich, for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty
   might be rich." In this he magnified his lowliness.

   But I think I see more of his lowliness at times in his associates than
   in anything else; because men may be very poor, and yet they may be
   very proud. I think I have seen it sadly so. I have known men without a
   penny wherewith to bless themselves as full of caste feeling as the
   wealthiest peer. They are working-men, it may be, but they think
   themselves superior persons, of remarkable gifts, and eminent
   respectability. We are a little overdone with superior persons just
   now. Almost everywhere I come across them, in this department and in
   that, and, of course, I look up to them with such respect as I can; but
   sometimes a little more reverence is asked of us than we can
   conveniently bestow. In this age we have to be careful not to trench
   upon the dignity of certain persons; and yet he who was in all respects
   superior to us all, never played the superior person once in all his
   life. He sat on a well, and talked to a woman; and his disciples, we
   read, marvelled that he spoke to a woman. It is not to "the women," as
   we get it in our Authorized Version, but the Revised Version puts it
   more correctly, "they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman."
   They thought that such a one as he should not speak to any Roman; for
   they were tinctured with the exclusiveness of the period. I do not
   suppose that it occurred to our Lord that he was doing anything
   remarkable in speaking to a woman; for he was born of woman, and he
   never disowned the tender ties which come of such a birth. To some men
   it would be a great come-down to speak familiarly to any one if he did
   not keep a carriage. Even in our churches the silly caste feeling will
   intrude, and brethren in Christ hardly think a poor saint to be their
   equal. Our Lord had no pride of manner about him, for his lowliness was
   in his heart. We read that the publicans and sinners gathered round
   him: even women of ill-fame listened with tearful eyes to his teaching.
   Oh, no, we never mention them, of course! We call them "outcasts," and
   treat them as offcasts: yet Jesus had a kind word for them. What a
   congregation he often had, of those whom the Pharisees abhorred! yet he
   never said to one of them, "Begone!" His rule was to welcome all,
   saying, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." Those
   publicans were certainly very mean characters; they collected a hateful
   tax for the foreigner, and squeezed out an extra portion for
   themselves: but yet the Savior never said to a single publican
   "Begone!" Quite the contrary, he gave the publican an honorable place
   in his parable; he made one of them an apostle, and he went to abide in
   the house of another, who received him joyfully. He did not merely
   speak a good word to these degraded persons, but he actually sat at
   table with them as a friend. "Horrible, was it not?" So the Pharisees
   thought. "Glorious," say we, as we reverence that divine humility which
   scorned nothing that lived, and especially nothing in the form of man
   or woman. "This man receiveth sinners," was said in disdain: let it be
   thundered out in a hymn as glorious as the song of the seraphim, who
   continually do cry, "Holy, holy, holy!" Never was purity more pure than
   when its incarnation bowed to become "a Friend of publicans and
   sinners."

   He did what was more singular still: he received little children. Now,
   I can see some reason for talking with grown-up men and women, even if
   they be debased and depraved, but as for those boys and girls, what can
   be done with them? When they heard the children crying "Hosanna" in the
   temple, the Pharisees demanded of him, "Hearest thou what these say?"
   As much as to say, "These boys! are these thine admirers? Dost thou
   find thy followers among children?" He had a lowly answer for them; but
   it was one which silenced them. These hosannas came of our blessed Lord
   having said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
   them not: for of such is the kingdom of God." He accepted children as
   the pattern of the kind of people who enter his kingdom; he himself was
   called God's holy child Jesus; and he was at home with children because
   of his perfect guilelessness and gentleness. Proud men seldom care for
   children, nor children for them; but our Lord, in his true lowliness of
   heart loved children, and they loved him.

   I wish we had a longer time in which to set out all the lovely
   lowliness of our adorable Christ; but I must only gather a few ears
   where I would have preferred to have reaped sheaves. Our Lord's patient
   bearing under accusations that were so foul and false, was another
   proof of his lowliness. "I hear," says a man, "that a calumny has been
   whispered against me, and I will drag it to light. I will have it out,
   let it cost what it may. Who dares breathe upon my character? He shall
   feel the law, and know that he cannot defame me with impunity." Some
   professing Christians appear to lose their balance when misrepresented:
   the lamb roars like a lion, and the ox eats flesh like the leopard.
   Churches have been rent, and families ruined, to avenge a hasty word.
   Is not that spirit the opposite of the mind of our blessed Master? They
   said he was a drunken man and a wine-bibber: the charge must have
   grieved him, but he did not become angry, and threaten his accusers. It
   was most important that his character should be cleared; he smiled to
   himself as he thought, "I will not contradict the accusation, for
   everybody knows that it is not true." They said that he had a devil,
   and he did condescend to answer that, and confounded all his accusers
   by making them see the absurdity of the charge; for if the devil was in
   Jesus fighting against the devil, then the devil must have become
   divided against himself, and his kingdom would soon come to an end.
   Towards the end of our Lord's life, his enemies gathered up their
   charges, and flung them in set form before Pilate's judgment-seat, but
   he answered them never a word: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
   and like a lamb dumb before her shearer, so opened he not his mouth."
   In silence he maintained his lowliness. Oh, if he had spoken who could
   speak as never man spake; if he had defended himself with his own
   irresistible oratory, with such a subject as himself to speak upon, he
   might have made them all go out of the judgment-hall, as once he had
   scattered them when his client was a woman taken in adultery. He might
   have turned the crowd against their rulers, had he chosen; or divided
   their counsels by setting Pharisees against Sadducees, but he sought
   not himself: He had been content to ask, "Which of you convinceth me of
   sin?" "For which of those works do ye stone me?" And when he came to
   his end he had no harder word for them than "Father, forgive them!"

   To crown all, you know how our Well-beloved died. He laid down his life
   for usdearest pledge of lowliness! The decease which he accomplished
   at Jerusalem was no famous death in battle, amid the roar of cannon,
   and the blast of trumpet, shaking heaven and earth with tidings of
   victory. His was no death amid the tears of a nation who prepare for
   their beloved prince a more than royal mourning. No, he dies with
   malefactors; he dies at the common gallows; he dies amid a crowd of
   scoffers, where felons cast contempt upon him as he hangs between them.
   Hear how the ribald throng challenge his divine sonship, and say, "If
   thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross"! The bearing of such
   obloquy, the endurance of such scorn, was the utmost proof of a
   lowliness of spirit which we humbly admire, and feebly imitate, but
   which we can never equal.

   II. I shall but occupy you one or two minutes while I try to explain
   THE CAUSE OF THIS LOWLINESS.

   His supreme lowliness of character grew out of the actual lowliness of
   his heart. He never aimed at humility, nor labored after it: it was
   natural to him. Of all sickening things, the pride that apes humility
   is the most loathsome: not a particle of that nauseous vice was found
   in our Lord. He never puts on an air, nor strikes an attitude, nor
   plays the humble part; but he is meek and lowly, and all can see it. He
   is never other than he seems to be, and he always is and seems to be
   the meekest of mankind. His inmost heart was seen, and seen to be all
   lowliness.

   Why was he so? I conceive that he was so lowly because he was so great.
   A little man feels the necessity of magnifying himself, and therefore
   becomes proud. Pride is essentially meanness. It is the little man that
   cannot afford to be-little himself. Some of us are too low to be lowly,
   too mean to be meek. True greatness is ever unconscious, and never
   seeks to make a display. It magnifies a man when he can sink himself
   for the good of others. No one knew how to descend so gracefully as our
   Lord, for his great mind knew well the ways of self-denial. A man who
   is greatly rich is not ashamed to be seen in well-worn clothes in those
   same places where the pretentious bankrupt would not venture except in
   his newest attire. He who has a small estate puts a diamond ring upon
   his finger, and holds it so that it sparkles in the light, to let all
   people see that he is a man worth something; but your eminent men of
   wealth scorn such display. Truly great men are humble. I have often
   heard it said of men of large substance, "He is singularly unassuming;
   you would never dream that he is a man of property." So, too, of men of
   genius have we heard it said, "he gave himself no airs, he was as
   modest and friendly as the least of us." Just so; and that very much
   accounts for his high standing. He that is somebody to others is nobody
   to himself. He who was more than all, even our Lord Jesus Christ, was,
   therefore, for that very reason, lowly of heart.

   He was lowly, next, because he was so loving. Mothers are frequently
   proud of their children, but, I think, they are seldom, if ever, proud
   to their children. No, if they love them, they do not think that it is
   any condescension to kiss them, or wash them, or carry them in their
   bosom. I never heard of a father who thought that he was very
   humble-minded because he allowed his boy to clamber upon his knee, and
   hold on with his arms about his neck. Those whom we love we elevate to
   an equality with ourselves; or, rather, we go down to them. Love is a
   charming leveller. Jesus had so much love that he could not be anything
   but lowly towards his little ones. You never yet heard even a
   blasphemer impute pride to God. Though our blood has chilled when we
   have heard the High and Mighty One arraigned for this and that by
   arrogant tongues; yet we have not known profanity to run in that line.
   It would be too absurd to impute pride either to God, or to his
   ever-blessed Son, Jesus Christ. The reason for this evident freedom
   from pride is the fact that "God is love." The fullness of divine love
   blinds the eye which looks askance upon it. God is patient, for he is
   loving: Christ is lowly of heart, because his heart is made of love.

   Moreover, once more, our blessed Master was so absorbed in his great
   object that he was necessarily lowly. The man who is driving at a great
   object has no time for the affectations of self-adulation. He has no
   time in which to think of how he appears to others. He does not stand
   at the glass to arrange his beauties; the idea would be too absurd. He
   cannot be too particular about how he puts that poetic word, or how he
   mouths that polished sentence; his sole desire is to deliver his
   message, and to impress men with the matter in hand. Earnestness
   carries the speaker beyond the orator's rules of self-display; his
   rhetoric is melted down by his enthusiasm. A great orator can readily
   be made to appear ridiculous by the comic critic, who coolly looks down
   from the gallery upon him; but what cares he? His theme so absorbs him
   that he has forgotten all elegance of attitude and gesture, and only
   cares to carry his point. He would make himself a fool, ten thousand
   times deep, if he could but win his suit, and bless his country
   thereby. He cares for nothing but his subject and his aim. So is it
   pre-eminently with our Lord: he pursues his course careless of man's
   esteem. He burns his way, his zeal eats him up, he is straitened till
   his work is accomplished, and therefore he has no thought about the
   maintaining of his dignity. His greatness and his intense devotion
   forbid anything approximating to pride, and by force of nature he is
   meek and lowly in heart. Because he has a great object to achieve, and
   that object has absorbed his whole self, he must walk in all lowliness
   of mind. Blessed Master, teach us this way of lowliness! Fire us with
   an ambition for thy glory which shall shut out every thought of pride!

   III. What are the LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THIS LOWLINESS of our
   Lord?

   The lessons are, first, brethren, let us be lowly. Did I hear one say,
   "Well, I will try to be lowly"? You cannot do it in that way. We must
   not try to act the lowly part; we must be lowly, and then we shall
   naturally act in a humble manner. It is astonishing how much of pride
   there is in the most modest. Of course I do not mean in those who say
   that they are perfect. No, I leave them to their own vain-glory; but in
   us poor, imperfect creatures, what a deal of pride there is! How we
   condemn pride! We feel that it would be well if all were as humble as
   we are. We boast that we detest boasting. We flatter ourselves that we
   hate flattery. When we are told that we are singularly free from pride,
   we feel as proud as Lucifer himself at the consciousness that the
   compliment is right well deserved. We are so experienced, so solid, so
   discerning, so free from self-confidence, that we are the first to be
   caught in the net of self-satisfaction. Brethren, we must pray God to
   make us humble. If we become lowliest of the lowly it will not be much
   of a condescension on our part; we shall only come down to the point
   which we ought never to have left. Down in the dust is the fit place
   for such poor mortals as we are. What right have we to be anything else
   but meek and lowly?

   Alas! we can be very proud in many ways: let me give you a case or two
   in point. Yonder is one that is called to suffer, and he rebels against
   it. Hear his complaint"Why should I be called to endure such great
   trials? What have I done that I am thus tried?" Do you not at once
   detect the great "I"? Very different is this from the lowly prayer,
   "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt."

   "But, then, persons have spoken evil of me. I do not deserve to be
   treated thus." Clearly it is specially wrong for any one to speak amiss
   of such an excellent being as you are. There lies the grievance.
   Because you are so good, it is horrible wickedness to traduce you. You
   reply, "But, really, it was so malicious, and the charge was so absurd
   and unreasonable." Just so. People ought to be peculiarly careful not
   to hurt your feelings, for you are so deserving and praiseworthy. Is
   not self-esteem the spring of half our sorrow? We are so wonderfully
   good in our own judgment that we claim the box-seat of the coach, and
   the chief seat in the synagogue. If we were really lowly of heart, we
   should say, "I have been treated very badly, but when I think of how my
   Lord was treated, I cannot dream of complaining. This severe critic
   cannot see my excellences; but I do not wonder, for I cannot see them
   myself. He has been finding fault with me, and his charges were not
   true; but, if he had known me better, he might have found more fault
   with me, and have been nearer the truth. If I do not deserve censure in
   this way, I do in another; and so I will cheerfully bear what is
   measured out to me. Yea, if it be in no sense my due, I will give my
   back to the smiters, as my Master did." Oh, that the Lord would make us
   meek and lowly in heart, and we should submit to wrong rather than
   resist evil!

   "But surely," cries one, "you do not want me to associate with
   sinners?" No, dear friend, I do not want such a good person as you are
   to go near them at all; I could not so degrade your honorable self.
   Moreover, if you did go near them, you would aggravate them by your
   self-opinionated goodness. If your perfections are not quite so
   full-blown as usual, I would, however, suggest that you might do
   sinners good by kindly speaking to them; and that to gather up your
   skirts in fear and trembling, lest you should be defiled by their
   presence is not the most excellent way. When you are afraid lest the
   wind should blow from a sinful person towards your nobility, you act
   the fool, if not the hypocrite; perhaps both. Why, you would have been
   in hell yourself if it had not been for sovereign grace! You, fine
   ladies and prime gentlefolk, you would have been as surely cast away as
   the vilest of mankind, if it had not been for infinite compassion! It
   ill becomes us to boast, since we have enough sins of our own to plunge
   us in despair, were it not for the love of the lowly Savior, who his
   own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree. O Lord, stamp out
   our pride, and make us lowly in heart!

   Lastly, let us learn to say to the despondent and timorous words of
   cheer. Since the Lord Jesus Christ is so meek and lowly, poor,
   trembling, guilty one, you may come to him! You may come to him now! I
   was sitting the other night amongst some excellent friends, who, I
   suppose, were none of them rich, and some of them poor. I am sure it
   never entered into my head to think how much money they owned, for I
   felt myself very much at home with them, until one of them remarked,
   "You do not mind mixing with us poor folk?" Then I felt quite ashamed
   for myself that they should think it necessary to make such a remark. I
   was so much one with them that I felt honored by having fellowship with
   them in the things of God, and it troubled me that they should think I
   was doing anything remarkable in conversing with them. Dear friends, do
   not think hardly of any of us who are ministers of Christ; and you will
   think hardly of us if you conceive that we think it a coming-down to
   associate with any of you! We are in heart and soul your brothers, bone
   of your bone, your truest friends whether you are rich or poor. We
   desire your good, for we are your servants for Christ's sake. Above
   all, do not think hardly of our Lord and Master by supposing that it
   will be a strange thing for him to come to your house, or to your
   heart. It is his habit to forgive the guilty, and renew the sinful.
   Come to him at once, and he will accept you now. Jesus is exceedingly
   approachable. He is not hedged about with guards to keep off the poor
   or the sinful. Your room may be very humble; what cares he for that? He
   will come, and hear your prayer. Many a time Jesus has had no room to
   pray in, but

   "Cold mountains, and the midnight air
   Witnessed the fervor of his prayer."

   Do you complain that you cannot arrange your words correctly? What is
   that to him? He looks more at the sincerity of your heart than at the
   grammar of your language. Let your heart talk to him without words, and
   he will understand you.

   Do you complain with shamed face that you are such a sinner? You are
   not the first sinner that Jesus has met with, nor will you be the last.
   You are heavy-laden with sin; but he knows more about the weight of sin
   than you do. That terrible load of guilt worries you; but it pressed
   him down even more terribly when it brought him into the dust of death.
   It makes you weep to think of sin; but it caused him to sweat great
   drops of blood. You feel that you cannot live under so crushing a
   burden; and he did not live under it, but gave up the ghost in agony.
   Do not crucify your Lord afresh by suspecting that he is proud, and
   will therefore pass you by. Do not insult him by dreaming that he will
   reject you for your insignificance or unworthiness. Come, and welcome,
   to him who will delight to bless you. Come to him at once, without
   further question or hesitation. Come just as you are, fall at his
   pierced feet, and trust the merit of his blood, and the good Lord will
   accept you on the spot, for he has said, "Him that cometh to me I will
   in no wise cast out."

   God bless you, by leading you all to love this lowly and loving Lord!
   Even at this present moment I pray that you may take that step which
   will secure our meeting in heaven to adore eternally our King, so meek
   and lowly, who will then dwell in the midst of us, and lead us to
   living fountains of water!

             The True Tabernacle, and Its Glory of Grace and Peace

   A Sermon

   (No. 1862)

   Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, September 27th, 1885, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [16]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
   glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
   and truth." John 1:14.

   "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
   Christ." John 1: 17.

   THERE WAS A TIME when God freely communed with men. The voice of the
   Lord God was heard walking in the garden in the cool of the day. With
   unfallen Adam the great God dwelt in sweet and intimate fellowship; but
   sin came and not only destroyed the garden, but destroyed the
   intercourse of God with His creature man. A great gulf opened between
   man as evil, and God as infinitely pure; and had it not been for the
   amazing goodness of the most High, we must all of us forever have been
   banished from His presence, and from the glory of His power. The Lord
   God in infinite love resolved that He Himself would bridge the
   distance, and would again dwell with man; and in token of this He made
   Himself manifest to His chosen nation Israel when they were in the
   wilderness. He was pleased to dwell in type and symbol among His
   people, in the very center and heart of their camp. Do you see yonder
   tent with its curtains of goats' hair in the center of the canvas city?
   You cannot see within it; but it was all glorious within with precious
   wood, and pure gold, and tapestry of many colors. Within its most
   sacred shrine shone forth a bright light between the wings of cherubim,
   which light was the symbol of the presence of the Lord. But if you
   cannot see within, yet you can see above the sacred tent a cloud, which
   arises from the top of the Holy of Holies, and then expands like a vast
   tree so as to cover all the host, and protect the chosen of God from
   the intense heat of the sun, so apt to make the traveler faint when
   passing over the burning sand. If you will wait till the sun is down,
   that same cloud will become Alimonies, and light up the whole camp.
   Thus it was both shade and light; and by its means was enjoyed that
   safety which was afterwards set forth in the promise, "The sun shall
   not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night." Over all the glory was a
   defense and a comfort. The Lord dealt not so with any nation, save only
   His people Israel, of whom He said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in
   them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."

   The day of the type is over; we see no more a nation secluded from all
   others and made to be as "the church in the wilderness." God doth not
   now confine His abode to one people; for "The God of the whole earth
   shall he be called." There is now no spot on earth where God dwells in
   preference to another. Did not our Lord say, at the well of Sychar,
   "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
   mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father." "But . . . the
   true worshipers shall worship the Father it spirit and in truth"?
   Wherever true hearts seek the Lord, He is found of them. He is as much
   present on the lone mountain's side as in the aisles of yonder above,
   or in the galleries of this tabernacle. "Howbeit the most High dwelleth
   not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is my
   throne, and earth is my footstool; what house will ye build me? saith
   the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?"

   Yet there is a true house of, a real temple of the infinite, a living
   abode of the Godhead. The epistle to the Hebrews speaks of "the true
   tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." There is still a
   trysting-place where God doth still meet with man, and hold fellowship
   with him. That place is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, "in whom
   dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. "The manhood of Christ
   is become to us the anti-type of that tent in the center of the camp.
   God is in Christ Jesus; Christ Jesus is God; and in His blessed person
   God dwells in the midst of us as in a tent; for such is the force of
   the original in our text. "The Word was made flesh, and tabernacled, or
   tented, among us." That is to say, in Christ Jesus the Lord dwelt among
   men, as God of old dwelt in His sanctuary in the midst of the tribes of
   Israel. This is very delightful and hopeful for us: the Lord God doth
   dwell among us through the incarnation of His Son.

   But the substance far excels the shadow; for in the wilderness the Lord
   only dwelt in the abode of man, but now His approach to us is closer,
   for He dwells in the flesh of man. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
   among us." Note that word "flesh." It doth not say, "The Word was made
   man": it means that, but the use of the word "flesh brings the Lord
   Jesus still closer to us, and shows that He took on Him the very nature
   and substance of manhood: He did not merely assume the name and notion,
   and appearance, of manhood, but the reality: the weakness, the
   suffering, the mortality of our manhood He actually took into union
   with Himself. He was no phantom, or apparition, but He had a human body
   and a human soul. "The Word was made flesh." When the Lord became bone
   of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, His incarnation in a human body
   brought Him far nearer to man than when He only abode within curtains,
   and occupied a tent in the midst of Israel.

   Moreover, it is to be noted that God does in the person of Jesus not
   merely dwell among men; but He hath joined Himself unto men--the Word
   not only dwelt in flesh, but "was made flesh." It is impossible to use
   words which are exactly accurate to describe the wonderful incarnation
   of the Son of God in human flesh; but these words are used to show that
   our Lord is as truly and as really man as He is God. Not only does God
   dwell in the body of man; but our Lord Jesus is God and man in one
   person. He is not ashamed to speak of men as His brethren. "Forasmuch
   then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
   likewise took part of the same with us. This approach to us is
   exceeding close. God was never one with the tabernacle, but in Christ
   Jesus He is one with us. This union hath in it a sweetness of sympathy,
   a tenderness of relationship, and a condensation of fellowship greatly
   to be admired. Now we listen to the music of that blessed name
   Emmanuel, "God with its." In the person of the only begotten, our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ, we see God reconciling the world unto
   Himself. Let us rejoice and be glad that we have in Jesus more than
   Israel had in the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. The
   ancient believer gazed upon the sacred tent, he thought of the holy
   place of sacrifice, and the Holy of Holies, the inner shrine of the
   Lord's indwelling; but we have unfeignedly more, we have God in our
   nature, and in Him "truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with
   his Son Jesus Christ."

   In and around the tent wherein the Lord dwelt in the center of the camp
   there was a manifestation of the presence of God. This was the glory of
   that house: but how scanty was the revelation! A bright light which I
   have already mentioned, the Shekinah, is said to have shone over the
   mercy-seat; but the high priest only could see it, and he only saw it
   once in the year when he entered with blood within the veil. Outside,
   above the holy place, there was the manifest glory of the pillar of
   cloud by day, and of fire by night. This sufficed to bear witness that
   God was there; but still, cloud and fire are but physical appearances,
   and cannot convey a true appearance of God, who is a spirit. God cannot
   be perceived by the senses; and yet the fiery, cloudy pillar could
   appeal to the eyes only. The excellence of the indwelling of God in
   Christ is this--that there is in Him a glory as of the only begotten of
   the Father, the moral and spiritual glory of Godhead. This is to be
   seen, but not with the eyes; this is to be perceived, but not by the
   carnal senses: this is seen, and heard, and known, by spiritual men,
   whose mental perceptions are keener than those of sight and hearing. In
   the person of the Lord there is a glory which is seen by our faith,
   which is discerned of our renewed spirits, and is made to operate upon
   our hearts. The glory of God in the sanctuary was seen only by the
   priest of the house of Aaron; the glory of God in the face of Christ is
   seen by all believers, who are all priests unto God. That glory the
   priest beheld but once in the year; but we steadily behold that glory
   at all times, and are transformed by the sight. The glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ is not a thing of outward appearance, to be beheld
   with the eyes, like the pillar of cloud and fire; but there is an
   abiding, steady luster of holy, gracious, truthful character about our
   Lord Jesus Christ, which is best seen by those who by reason of
   sanctification are made fit to discern it. Blessed are the pure in
   heart, for they shall see God; yea, they do see Him in Christ Jesus.
   "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in
   the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." Many of us besides the
   apostles can say, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." We have not seen
   Jesus raise the dead; we have not seen I Jim cast out devils; we have
   not seen Him hush the winds and calm the waves, but we do see, with our
   mind's eye, His spotless holiness, His boundless love, His superlative
   love and truth, His wondrous heavenliness; in a word, we have seen, and
   do see, His fullness of grace and truth; and we rejoice in the fact
   that the tabernacling of God among, men in Christ Jesus is attended
   with a more real glory than the mere brilliance of light and the glow
   of flame. The condescension of Christ's love is to us more glorious
   than the pillar of cloud, and the zeal of our Lord's self-sacrifice is
   more excellent than the pillar of fire. As we think of the divine
   mysteries which meet in the person of the Lord, we do not envy Israel
   the gracious manifestation vouchsafed her when "a cloud covered the
   tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord covered the
   tabernacle"; for we have all this and more in our incarnate God, who is
   with us always, even to the end of the world.

   As the Holy Spirit shall help me, I shall at this time say, first of
   all, Let us behold this tabernacling of God; and secondly, Let us avail
   ourselves of this tabernacling of God in all the ways for which it was
   intended.

   1. First, then, LET US BEHOLD THIS 'TABERNACLING OF GOD WITH US. "We
   beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full
   of grace and truth. "In Jesus Christ all the attributes of God are to
   be seen; veiled, but yet verily there. You have only to read the
   gospels, to look with willing eyes, and you shall behold in Christ all
   that can possibly be seen of God. It is veiled in human flesh, as it
   must be; for the glory of God is not to be seen by us absolutely; it is
   toned down to these dim eyes of ours; but the Godhead is there, the
   perfect Godhead in union with the perfect manhood of Christ Jesus our
   Lord, to whom be glory forever and ever.

   Two divine things are more clearly seen in Jesus than aught else. Upon
   these I would speak at this time, considering the two together, and
   then each one separately--"Full of grace and truth."

   Observe the two glorious qualities, joined inseparably--grace and
   truth--and observe that they are spoken of in the concrete. The apostle
   says that the only begotten is "full of grace and truth." He did not
   come to tell us about grace, but actually to bring us grace. He is not
   full of the news of grace and truth, but of grace and truth themselves.
   Others had been messengers of gracious tidings, but He came to bring
   grace. Others teach us truth, but Jesus is the truth. He is that grace
   and truth whereof others spoke. Jesus is not merely a teacher, an
   exhorter, a worker of grace and truth; but these heavenly things are in
   Him: He is full of them. I want you to note this. It raises such a
   difference between Christ and others: you go to others to hear of grace
   and truth, but you must go to Christ to see them. There may be, there
   is, grace in other men; but not as it is in Christ: they have take it
   as water flowing through a pipe, but He has it as water in its fountain
   and source. He has grace to communicate to the sons of men, grace
   without measure, grace essential and abiding. There is truth in others
   where God has wrought it, by His Spirit; but it is not in them as it is
   in Christ. In Him dwell the depth, the substance, the essence of the
   fact. Grace and truth come to us by Him, and yet they evermore abide in
   Him. I say again, our Lord did not merely come to teach grace and
   truth, or to impress them upon us; but He came to exhibit in His own
   person, life, and work, all the grace and truth which we need. He has
   brought us grace in rivers and truth in streams: of these He has an
   infinite fullness; of that fullness all His saints receive.

   This grace and truth are blended. The "and" between the two words I
   would treat as more than a common conjunction. The two rivers unite in
   one fullness--"Full of grace and truth": that is to say. The grace is
   truthful grace, grace not in fiction nor in fancy, grace not to be
   hoped for and to be dreamed of, but grace every atom of which is fact;
   redemption which does redeem, pardon which does blot out sin, renewal
   which actually regenerates, salvation which completely saves. We have
   not here blessings which charm the ear and cheat the soul; but real,
   substantial favors from God that cannot lie. Then blend these things
   the other way. "Grace and truth": the Lord has come to bring us truth,
   but it is not the kind of truth which censures, condemns, and punishes;
   it is gracious truth, truth steeped in love, truth saturated with
   mercy. The truth which Jesus brings to His people comes not from the
   judgment-seat, but from the mercy-seat; it hath a gracious drift and
   aim about it, and ever tends unto salvation. His light is the life of
   men. If thou art overshadowed with a dark truth which seems to deepen
   thy despair, look thou to it again and thou wilt perceive within it a
   hidden light which is sown for the righteous. The darkness of
   convincing and humbling truth maketh for light: by engendering despair
   of self, heart-searching truth is meant to drive thee to the true hope.
   There is grace to God's people in everything that falls from the lips
   of'.Jesus Christ. His lips are like lilies dropping sweet smelling
   myrrh; myrrh in itself is bitter, but such is the grace of our Lord
   Jesus that His lips impart sweetness to it. See how grace and truth
   thus blend, and qualify each other! The grace all true, and the truth
   is all gracious, This is a wondrous compound made according to the art
   of the divine Apothecary. Where else is grace so true, or truth so
   gracious?

   Furthermore, it is grace and truth balanced. I wish I were able to
   communicate my thoughts this morning as they came to me when I was
   meditating upon this passage; but this thought almost speaks for
   itself. The Lord Jesus Christ is full of grace; but then He has not
   neglected the other quality which is somewhat sterner, namely, that of
   truth. I have known many in this world very loving and affectionate,
   but they have not been faithful: on the other hand, I have known men to
   be sternly honest and truthful, but they have not been gentle and kind:
   but in the Lord Jesus Christ there is no defect either way. He is full
   of grace which doth invite the publican and the sinner to Himself; but
   He is full of truth which doth repel the hypocrite and Pharisee. He
   does not hide from man a truth however terrible it may be, but He
   plainly declares the wrath of God against all unrighteousness. But when
   He has spoken terrible truth, He has uttered it in such a gracious and
   tender manner, with so many tears of compassion for the ignorant and
   those that are out of the way, that you are much won by His grace as
   convinced by His truth. Our Lord's ministry is not truth alone, nor
   grace alone; but it is a balanced, well-ordered system of grace and
   truth. The Lord Himself is in His character "just and having
   salvation." He is both King of righteousness and King of peace. He does
   not even save unjustly, nor does He proclaim truth unlovingly. Grace
   and truth are equally conspicuous in Him.

   Beloved, notice here that these qualities in our Lord are at the full.
   He is "full of grace." Who could be more so? In the person of Jesus
   Christ the immeasurable grace of God is treasured up. God has done for
   us by Christ Jesus exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or even
   think. It is not possible even for imagination to conceive of any
   person more gracious than God in Christ Jesus. You cannot desire,
   certainly you cannot require, anything that should exceed what is found
   of grace in the person, offices, work, and death of the only begotten.
   Come, ye that have large minds, and intellects that are creative, and
   see if ye can devise anything that should be mentioned in the same day
   with what God, in the infinite glory of His grace, has given us in the
   person of His Son. And there is an equal fullness of truth about our
   Lord. He Himself, as He comes to us as the revelation and manifestation
   of God, declares to us, not some truth, but all truth. All of God is in
   Christ; and all of God means all that is true, and all that is right,
   and all that is faithful, and all that is just, all that is according
   to righteousness arid holiness. Christ Jesus has brought to us the
   justice, truth, and righteousness of God to the full: He is the Lord
   our righteousness. There are no reserves of disagreeable faith in
   Christ. There is nothing hidden from us of truth that might alarm us,
   nor anything that might have shaken our confidence; nor, on the other
   hand, is any truth kept back which might have increased our
   steadfastness. He says, "If it were not so I would have told you."
   Admire the full-robed splendor of the Sun of Righteousness. Ask not
   with Pilate, "What is truth?" but behold it in God's dear Son. Oh, I
   know not how to speak to you upon themes so full and deep! How shall 1,
   that am but as a twinkling dewdrop on a blade of grass, reflect the
   full glory of this Sun of Righteousness? But all truth and all grace
   dwell in Christ in all their fullness beyond conception, and the two
   lie in each other's bosoms forever, to bless us with boundless, endless
   joy and glory.

   Thus have I taken the two together. Now I want to dwell briefly on each
   one by itself.

   Grace is put first. "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace." Jesus Christ is the Son of God;
   He is His only begotten Son. Others are begotten of God, but no other
   was ever begotten of God as Christ was; consequently, when He came into
   this world the glory that was about Him was a glory as of the only
   begotten. A very singular, and very special, and incommunicable glory
   abides in the person of our Lord. Part of this was the glory of His
   grace. Now, in the Old Testament, in that thirty-fourth chapter of
   Exodus, which we read in part this morning, you notice that the glory
   of God lay in His being "the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
   longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth." The glory of the
   only begotten of the Father must lie in the same things as the glory of
   the Father, namely, in longsuffering and truth. In Christ there is a
   wonderful gentleness,.patience, pity, mercy, and love of God. Not
   merely did He teach the grace of God, and invite us to the grace of
   God, but in Himself He displayed the grace of God.

   This is seen, first, in His incarnation, It is a wonderful instance of
   divine grace that the word should be made flesh and dwell among us, and
   reveal His glory to us. Apart from anything that springs out of the
   incarnation of Christ, that incarnation itself is a wondrous act of
   grace. There must be hope for men now that man is next akin to God
   through Jesus Christ. The angels were not mistaken when they not only
   sang, "Glory to God in the highest," but also, "on earth peace,
   goodwill towards men," because in Bethlehem the Son of God was born of
   a virgin. God in our nature must mean God with gracious thoughts
   towards us. If the Lord had meant to destroy the race, He never would
   have espoused it and taken it into union with Himself. There is
   fullness of grace in the fact of the Word made flesh tabernacling among
   us.

   More than this, there is fullness of grace in the life of Christ when
   we consider that He lived in order to perfect Himself as our High
   Priest. Was He not made perfect through His sufferings, that He might
   sympathize with us in all our woes? He was compassed with infirmities,
   and bore our sorrows, and endured those crosses of the human life which
   press so heavily on our own shoulders; and all this to make Himself
   able to deal graciously with us in a tender and brotherly way. Apart
   from that which comes wonderful brotherhood, there is a bottomless
   depth of grace about the fellowship itself. The Lord Jesus cannot curse
   me, for He has borne my curse: He cannot be unkind to me, for He has
   shared my sorrows. If every pang that tends my heart has also rent His
   heart, and if into all my woes He has descended even deeper than I have
   gone, it must mean love to me, it cannot mean anything else; and it
   must mean truth, for Jesus did not play at fellowship, His griefs were
   real. I say then that this manifestation of God in the person of Christ
   Jesus is seen in His sorrowing life to be full of grace and truth.

   Then think for a minute of what He did. He was so full of grace that
   when He spoke His words dropped a fatness of grace, the dew of His own
   love was upon all His discourses; and when He moved about and touched
   men here and there, virtue went out of Him, because He was so full of
   it. At one time He spoke and pardoned a sinner, saying, "Thy sins be
   forgiven thee"; at another moment He battled with the consequences of
   sin, raising men from sickness and from death: He again He turned
   Himself and fought with the prince of darkness himself, and cast him
   out from those whom he tormented. He went about like a cloud which is
   big with rain, and therefore plentifully waters waste places. His life
   was boundless compassion. There was a power of grace about His
   garments, His voice, His look; and in all He was so true that none ever
   thought Him capable of subterfuge. Everywhere He went He scattered
   grace among the children of men; and He is just the same now; fullness
   of grace abides in Him still.

   When it came to His death, which was the pouring out of His soul, then
   His fullness of grace was seen. He was full of grace indeed, forasmuch
   as He emptied Himself to save men. He was Himself not only man's
   Saviour, but his salvation. He gave Himself for us. He was indeed full
   of grace when He bore our sins in His own body on the tree. His was
   love at its height, since He died on the cross, "the just for the
   unjust, to bring us to God," pronounce the word "Substitution, " and
   you cannot help feeling that the Substitute fori guilty man was full of
   grace; or use that other word, " representative," and remember that
   whatever Jesus did, He did as the covenant Head of His people. If He
   died, they died in Him; if He rose again, they rose in Him; if He
   ascended up on high, they ascended in Him; and if He sits at the right
   hand of God, they also sit in the heavenly places in Him. When He shall
   come a second time it shall be to claim the kingdom for His chosen as
   well as for Himself; and all the glory of the future ages is for them,
   and not for Himself alone. He saith, "Because I live, ye shall live
   also." Oh, the richness of the grace and truth that dwell in our Lord
   as the representative of His people! He will enjoy nothing unless His
   people enjoy it with Him. "Where I am, there also shall my servant be."
   "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in Thy throne, even
   as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."

   There is yet another word higher than "substitution," higher than
   "representation," and that is "union." We are one with Christ, joined
   to Him by a union that never can be broken. Not only does He do what He
   does, representing us, but we are joined unto Him in one spirit,
   members of His body, and partakers of His glory. Is it not a miracle of
   love that worms of earth should ever be one with incarnate Deity, and
   so one that they never can be separated throughout the ages?

   Thus I have shown you that there is in our Lord a fullness of grace.
   Your own thoughts will dig deeper than mine.

   But then it is said there is in Him also a fullness of truth, by which
   I understand that in Christ Himself, not merely in what He said, and
   did, and promised, there is a fullness of truth. And this is true,
   first, in the fact that He is the fulfillment of all the promises that
   went before concerning Him. God had promised great things by His
   prophets concerning the coming Messiah, but all those predictions are
   absolutely matters of fact in the person of the Well-beloved. "All the
   promises of God are yea and Amen in Christ Jesus." Verily He hath
   bruised the serpent's head. Verily He hath borne our griefs, and
   carried our sorrows. Verily He hath proclaimed liberty to the captives.
   Verily He hath proved Himself a prophet like unto Moses.

   According to my second text, in verse seventeen, I understand our Lord
   Jesus to be "truth" in the sense of being the substance of all the
   types. The law that was given by Moses was but symbolical and
   emblematical; but Jesus is the truth. He is really that blood of
   sprinkling which speaketh better things than that of Abel; He is in
   very deed the Paschal lamb of God's Passover: He is the burnt-offering,
   the sin-offering, and the peace-offering--all in one! He is the true
   scapegoat, the true morning and evening Lamb; in fact, He is in truth
   what all the types and figures were in pattern. Blessed by God,
   brethren, whenever you see great things in the Old Testament in the
   type, you see the real truth of those things it the person of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. The Jew had nothing that we have not; he had nothing even
   in outline and shadow which we have not obtained in substance. The
   covenant in its fullness is in Christ: the prophecy is in Moses, the
   fulfillment is in Jesus: the foreshadowing is in the law, the truth is
   in the Word made flesh.

   Further than that, our Lord Jesus Christ is said to be grace and truth
   in this sense, that He truthfully deals with matters of fact in the
   case of our salvation. I know the notion of the world is that the
   salvation of Christ is a pretty dream, a handsome piece of sentiment.
   But there is nothing dreamy, about it: it is no fiction; it is fact
   upon fact. The Lord Jesus Christ does not gloss over or conceal the
   condition of man in his salvation; He finds man condemned, and takes
   him as condemned in the very worst sense, condemned of a capital
   offense; and as man's substitute He endures the capital penalty, and
   dies in the sinner's stead. The Lord Jesus views the sinner as
   depraved, yea, as dead in trespasses and sins, and He quickens him by
   His resurrection life. He does not wink at the result of the fall and
   of actual sin; but He comes to the dead sinner and quickens him; He
   comes to the diseased heart and heals it. To me the gospel is a
   wonderful embodiment of omnipotent wisdom and truth. If the gospel had
   said to men, "The law of God is certainly righteous, but it is too
   stern, too, exacting, and therefore God will wink it at many sins, and
   make provision for salvation by omitting to punish much of human
   guilt," why, my brethren, we should always have been in jeopardy. If
   God could be unjust to save us, He could also be changeable, and cast
   us away. If there was anything rotten in the state of our salvation, we
   should fear that it would fail its at last. But our foundation is sure,
   for the Lord has excavated down to the rock; He has taken away every
   bit of mere sentiment and sham, and His salvation is real throughout.
   It is a glorious salvation of grace and truth, in which God takes the
   sinner as God is, on the principles of true righteousness; and yet
   saves him.

   But it means more than that. The Lord deals with us in the way of
   grace, and that grace encourages a great many hopes, but those hopes
   are all realized, for He deals with us in truth. Our necessities
   demands great things, and grace actually supplies those great things.
   The old law could never make the comers thereunto perfect as pertaining
   to the conscience, but the grace of God makes believers perfect as
   pertaining to the conscience. If I were to sit down and try to imagine
   a flaw in the ground of my salvation by Christ, I could not do it.
   Believing as I do in Him who bore my sins in His own body on the tree,
   I feet that by no possibility can His atonement fail me. I have not
   imagination strong enough to feign a reason for distrust: I do not see
   hole or corner in which any charge could lurk against the man that
   believes in Jesus Christ. My conscience is satisfied, and more than
   satisfied. Sometimes it even seems to me that my sins could not have
   deserved that the Son of God should die. The atonement is greater than
   the sin. Speak of the vindication of the law!--not the vindication even
   greater than the dishonor? Does not the law of God shine out more
   lustrous in its indescribable glory through the sacrifice of Christ as
   the penalty for sin, than it would have done had it never been broken,
   or had all the race of law-breakers been swept into endless
   destruction? O brothers in the salvation of Jesus there is a truth of
   grace unrivaled! There is a deep verity, a substantiality, an inward
   soul-satisfaction in the sacrifice of Christ, which makes us feel it is
   a full atonement--a fountain of "grace and truth."

   Nor have I yet quite brought out all the meaning, even if I have
   succeeded so far. Christ has brought to us "grace and truth"; that is
   to say, He works in believers both grace and truth. We want grace to
   rescue us from sin; He has brought it: we need truth in the inward
   parts; He has wrought it. The system of salvation by atonement is
   calculated to produce truthful men. The habit of looking for salvation
   through the great sacrifice fosters the spirit of justice, begets in us
   a deep abhorrence of evil, and a love for that which is right and true.
   By nature we are all liars, and either love or make a lie: for this
   cause we are content t with refuges of ties, and we compass ourselves
   with deceit. In our carnal state we are as full of guile as an egg is
   full of meat; but when the Lord comes to us it Christ, no longer
   imputing our trespasses to us, then He takes out of our heart that
   deceit and desperate wickedness which had else remained there. I say
   it, and dare avow it, that the system of salvation by the indwelling of
   God in Christ and the atonement offered by Him for men has a tendency
   in it to infuse grace into the soul and to produce truth in the life.
   The Holy Ghost employs it to that end. I pray that you and I may prove
   it so by the grace which causes us to love both God and man, Santa and
   the truthfulness with which we deal in all the affairs of life.

   Thus has our Lord displayed the glory of God in the grace and truth
   with which He is filled. I am sorry have spoken so feebly on a theme so
   grand. May the Spirit bless you even through the infirmities of my
   speech!

   II. Now I want a few minutes to say to you, Come brothers and sisters,
   LET US AVAIL OURSELVES OF THIS TABERNACLING OF GOD AMONG US.

   First, then, if God has come to dwell among men by the Word made flesh
   let us pitch our tent around this central tabernacle; do not let us
   live as if God were a long way off. To the Israelites God was equally
   near from every near from every quarter of the camp. The tabernacle was
   in the center, and the center is equally near to every point of the
   circumference. No true Israelite could say, "I must go across the sea,
   or soar up into the air, or dive into the depths to find my God." Every
   Israelite could say "He dwelleth between the cherubim: I have but to go
   to His tabernacle to be in His presence and speak with Him." Our God is
   not far from any one of His people this day. We are made nigh by the
   blood of Christ. God is everywhere present, but there is a higher
   presence of effectual grace in the person of the only begotten. Do not
   let us feel as if we worshiped a far-off God. Let us not repine as if
   we were deserted. Let us not feel alone, for the Father is with us.

   God is near thee, therefore cheer the sad soul.

   Open thy window towards Jerusalem, as Daniel did; pray, with thine eye
   upon Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead bodily the
   greatest nearness to us. God is never far away since Christ has come to
   dwell among men.

   Next, let us resort to this central tabernacle to obtain grace tto help
   in time of need. Let us come to Christ without fear, for He hath grace
   to give, and He will give it to us abundantly whenever we need it. I
   like to think of the wording if my text. Leave out the parentheses, and
   it runs, "He dwelt among us full of grace." He could not have dwelt
   among such provoking ones if he had not been full of grace." But if He
   dwells among us full of grace, we need not fear that He will cast us
   away because of our sins and failings. I invite you, therefore to come
   boldly to Him who is full of forgiving love. I beg you to come and
   receive of His fullness, for grace is truly grace when it is
   communicated: grace which is not distributed is grace in name only.
   "Alas!" you say, "I want so much grace." Brother, it is treasured up in
   Christ for you without measure. It is placed in Him that you may have
   it. Do we not try to persuade the sinner that there is life in a look?
   Shall I need to persuade saints that grace is equally free to them? Do
   we tell the sinner that God is not be sought for as far away, but that
   He is waiting to be gracious? Must I tell the believer the same? You
   may at this moment obtain all the grace you need. The door is open;
   enter and take what you will. Do not stop till you reach home and go
   through a set of religious exercises; but here, and now, believe in
   Jesus to the full. In the center of the camp is the incarnate God;
   Israel had but to go the central tent to find present help in time of
   trouble. In the person of Christ, who hath said, "I am with you always,
   even to the end of the world," there is, in truth, all the grace you
   can possibly need. Come to this well and drink. Receive of His
   fullness, and go on your way rejoicing.

   What next shall we do? Brethren, since God in Christ is in the midst of
   us, let us abide in joyful, peaceful confidence in Him who is grace and
   truth to us. Do not let us wander to other sources. To whom should we
   go? Shall we leave our God? Shall we leave His grace, His truth? Do not
   let us dream that He has changed, for He is God. Do not imagine that He
   has removed, for He hath said. "This my rest forever; here will I
   dwell, for I have desired it." Do not let us conceive that His grace
   and truth are exhausted; for His fullness is eternal. Let us receive
   strong consolation, and remain steadfast, unmovable. Let us quietly
   rest in the firm belief that all we can want between here and heaven,
   all that we need this moment and in all moments yet to come, is
   treasured up in Christ Jesus, who is abidingly the center of His church
   and the manifestation of God.

   Once more: if this be so, and God really in Christ dwell in the midst
   of His people "full of grace and truth," let us tell everybody of it. I
   am sure if I had been an Israelite in the wilderness, and had met an
   Amalekite or an Edomite, I should have gloried in the privileges which
   His presence secured me. We know that Amalekites and Edomites could not
   have come into the house of the Lord: but nowadays, if we meet with one
   who is a stranger, we can tell him of our privilege, with sweet
   persuasion that the stranger can be brought nigh through the blood of
   the Lamb. Therefore let us abundantly speak of the dwelling of God with
   men. Let us tell to all that the Lord has come to man, not in wrath,
   not in judgment, but "full of grace and truth." O my unconverted
   hearer, come to Jesus! He is able to save to the uttermost those that
   come unto God by Him. Draw night to the meek and lowly Jesus, and you
   draw night to God. He saith, "He that hath seen me hath seen the
   Father." Publish the invitation of grace to the four winds. Ring out
   your silver trumpets, or if you have them not, sound your ram's horns;
   but somehow let all people know that the tabernacle of God is with men,
   and He doth dwell among them. Tell out his news in the far country,
   that the wandering prodigal son may hear it, and cry, "I will arise,
   and go to my Father." God has come to men' will not come to receive
   grace and truth?

   One more lesson remains, And that is--what manner of people ought we to
   be among whom Jehovah dwells? It must have been a very solemn thing to
   be a member of that great camp of two million in the wilderness of
   Sinai. God's presence in the midst of the camp must have made every
   tent sacred. As we walked through the streets of that canvas city, if
   we had been Israelites, and in our right minds, we should have said,
   "These tents are none other than the house the house of God and the
   very gate of heaven; for see, Jehovah is in the midst of us. Mark you
   not the bright light that shines about His sanctuary?" We should have
   felt that in such in such a camp all should be holy. The pollution of
   sin should be unknown there. In such a camp constant prayer and praise
   should be presented to Him whose presence was its glory and defense.
   Today let our congregation be a holy convocation; and as for ourselves,
   let us be holiness unto the Lord. We are consecrated men and women,
   seeing the Lord has come so very near to us. I spoke of solemnity; I
   meant not dread and sorrow, but a solemnity full of joy. It is a solemn
   thing to have God so near, but the joy is equal to the solemnity. Glory
   be unto God most high, for He is here! Let us spend our days and nights
   in gladness and delight. God is reconciled to us in the person of His
   dear Son, and we have fellowship with God in Christ Jesus; Wherefore
   let us rejoice evermore. Amen and amen.

Departed Saints Yet Living

   (No. 1863)

   SUGGESTED BY THE DECEASE OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY.

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 4, 1885, BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage that the dead are
   raised, when he called the Lord, 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
   and the God of Jacob.' For He is not the God of the dead but of the
   living, for all live to Him." Luke 20:37,38.

   DURING the past week, the Church of God and the world at large have
   sustained a very serious loss. In the taking home to Himself by our
   gracious lord, the Earl of Shaftesbury, we have, in my judgement, lost
   the best man of the age. I do not know whom I should place second, but
   I certainly should put him first--far beyond all other servants of God
   within my knowledge--for usefulness and influence. He was a man most
   true in his personal piety, as I know from having enjoyed his private
   friendship. He was a man most firm in his faith in the Gospel of our
   Lord Jesus Christ; a man intensely active in the cause of God and the
   Truth of God. Take him whichever way you please, he was admirable. He
   was faithful to God in all His house, fulfilling both the first and
   second commands of the Law in fervent love to God and hearty love to
   man. He occupied his high position with singleness of purpose and
   immovable steadfastness--where shall we find his equal? If it is not
   possible that he was absolutely perfect, it is equally impossible for
   me to mention a single fault, for I saw none. He exhibited Scriptural
   perfection, inasmuch as he was sincere, true and consecrated.

   Those things which have been regarded as faults in him by the loose
   thinkers of this age are prime virtues in my esteem. They called him
   narrow--and in this they bear unconscious testimony to his loyalty to
   the Truth of God. I rejoiced greatly in his integrity, his
   fearlessness, his adherence to principle in a day when the Revelation
   of God is questioned, the Gospel explained away and human thought set
   up as the idol of the hour. He felt that there was a vital and eternal
   difference between the Truth of God and error and, consequently, he did
   not act or talk as if there was much to be said on either side and,
   therefore, no one could be quite sure. We shall not know for many a
   year how much we miss in missing him; how great an anchor he was to
   this drifting generation and how great a stimulus he was to every
   movement for the benefit of the poor!

   Both man and beast may unite in mourning him! He was the friend of
   every living thing. He lived for the oppressed; he lived for London; he
   lived for the nation and he lived, still more, for God! He has finished
   his course and though we do not lay him to sleep in the grave with the
   sorrow of those that have no hope, yet we cannot but mourn that a great
   man and a prince has fallen this day in Israel! Surely the righteous
   are taken away from the evil to come and we are left to struggle on
   under increasing difficulties.

   It must always be so. The godly must die, even as others. Though our
   life is perfectly consecrated, yet it cannot forever be continued in
   this world. It is appointed unto men once, to die, and that appointment
   stands. We expect the present rule to last till He shall come who shall
   destroy the last enemy. We are not troubled with Sadducean doubts. To
   us, seeing that Christ rose from the dead, it is a matter of certainty
   that all His followers must rise, also. And seeing that Jesus always
   lived, it is equally a matter of certainty to us that all the saints
   are still living, for He has said, "Because I live, you shall live,
   also." Yet, if no infidelity is permitted to creep into our brain and
   disturb our belief, it may penetrate into our heart and cause us great
   sadness. We who believe in Jesus should rise into an atmosphere more
   clear and warm than

   that of the sepulcher, for the Lord Jesus has "abolished death and
   brought life and incorruption to light through the

   Gospel."

   We are not now sitting in the shadow of death, for eternal light has
   sprung up! Children of God, it is in the highest degree proper that you
   should think of things as your Father thinks of them--and He says that
   "all live unto God." Let us correct our phraseology by that of
   Scripture, and speak of departed saints as Divine Inspiration speaks of
   them! Then shall we come back to the simple child's talk which
   Wordsworth so sweetly turned into rhyme--"Master, we are seven," and in
   our family we shall number brothers, sisters and friends, whose bodies
   lie in the churchyard and shall speak of those who have crossed the
   border and passed within the veil as still our own! Like Jesus, we
   shall say, "Our friend Lazarus sleeps." Like Paul, we shall speak of
   them as absent from the body but present with the Lord and regard them
   as part and parcel of the one family in Heaven and earth!

   Our text was fashioned in a place which has the air of death, burial
   and resurrection about it. The voice came to Moses in the desert. This
   was a strange place for Moses--the living, active, well-instructed mind
   of Moses, mighty in all the wisdom of Egypt and full of noble thoughts
   concerning the living God--was buried in a desert. It is singular to
   see the foremost mind of the age in the remotest part of the desert
   hidden away among sheep! He who was a born king is, here, feeding a
   flock. It is death to Moses. Rest assured that Moses cannot be kept in
   this living tomb--he must rise to life and leadership. While there is a
   God and a Providence, Moses cannot continue in obscurity. There are
   certainties wrapped up in him which cannot fail. A man need not be a
   Prophet to stand at Horeb and prognosticate that Moses will emerge from
   the desert and shake Egypt by his resurrection!

   While Moses is in the desert, he is thinking about another case of
   death, burial and resurrection, namely, Israel in Egypt. The people of
   God, the favored nation of Jehovah with whom He had entered into
   Covenant, saying, "I will be their God and they shall be My
   people"--these were in Egypt, ground down by relentless oppression,
   begrimed with brick dust and black and blue with the blows of
   taskmasters. It has come to this, that they are compelled to cast their
   male children into the river and so to be the destroyers of their own
   race! The children of Israel have become a herd of slaves, yet they are
   God's elect people, God's favored family! It does not require a Prophet
   to declare that this death in Egypt cannot last--the elect nation must
   live and rise and go forth free to serve the Lord! No, Israel, you
   shall never perish! The voice must yet be heard--"Thus says the Lord,
   Let My people go, that they may serve Me!"

   And so, while Moses in the desert is thinking of Israel in Egypt, he
   sees a bush, and that bush is all ablaze. An ordinary bush upon the
   heath needs only to be touched with a match and, in one moment, there
   is a puff of flame and then all is over--nothing is left but a trace of
   ashes. Yet here was an extraordinary thing--a bush that continued to
   burn and was not consumed! Here was life in the midst of death,
   continuance in the midst of destruction! This was an emblem of God
   abiding with a people and yet suffering them to live--or of the fires
   of affliction being rendered harmless to the children of God. He who
   then spoke to Moses was the God of Life, the God who could sustain in
   the midst of destruction! He was the God who could preserve even a bush
   from being devoured by the intense fury of flame! Said I not truly that
   the surroundings of Moses and the bush all favor a display of life in
   death and resurrection out of death?

   Now we come to the central matter. Out of the midst of the bush there
   came a Voice, a mysterious and Divine Voice which said, "I am the God
   of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." From this
   Voice our Divine Lord teaches us to gather this fact--that God's people
   live when they appear to have been long dead--for He who cannot be the
   God of the dead, or non-existent, still avows Himself to be the God of
   the long-buried Patriarchs! Our Lord proved from that utterance at the
   bush, the continued life of the Lord's chosen and also their
   resurrection--how did He do this?

   I. We will not go straight to the answer, but we will beat about the
   bush a little, that the reasoning may the more

   gently enter our minds. I would say, first, that in these words we have
   A GLORIOUS RELATIONSHIP DECLARED.

   Moses called the Lord, "The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob."

   The glorious Lord did, at the bush, as good as say, "These three men
   have chosen Me to be their God." So they had-- through the Grace of God
   they had deliberately chosen to part with their natural kindred in the
   country of the Chaldees and to journey to a land of which they knew
   nothing except that God had promised that they should afterwards
   receive it for an inheritance. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were three very
   different characters, yet this was common to the three-- that they
   believed God and took Him to be their God, alone. They nestled in the
   bosom of Jehovah while the rest of the world went after their idols. In
   all their troubles, they flew to Jehovah; for the supply of all their
   needs they resorted to

   Him, alone. They were men who had, through Divine Grace, deliberately
   attached themselves unto Jehovah, the Most High, throughout the whole
   of their lives.

   It is a sublime sight to see a man trust in God as Abraham did--and
   obey the Lord fully as he did in the matter of Isaac, when he accounted
   God to be able to raise him up, even from the dead. Surely there must
   be everlasting life in a being who could thus confide in Jehovah! I
   call you to admire the fact that God called the Patriarchs into the
   noble position of following the Lord fully, of fixed and settled
   choice. Being men of like passions with ourselves, they nevertheless
   cast in their lot with the Lord and for His sake preferred the life of
   strangers and pilgrims on the earth to the comforts of settled
   residence in Ur of the Chaldees and to the sinful pleasures of Canaan.
   We, also, take this God to be our God, even the God of Abraham, of
   Isaac and of Jacob. There is a nobility about the choosers of the true
   God which will surely secure them from annihilation.

   Next, these three men had learned to commune with God. How wondrously
   had Abraham spoken with God! Full many a spot was consecrated as "the
   place where he stood before the Lord." Isaac also walked in the fields
   at eventide and, doubtless, there entered into secret fellowship with
   God. The Lord also appeared unto him at night and led him to build an
   altar and call upon the name of Jehovah. The good old man, even in his
   blindness, found solace in communion with the Lord God Almighty. Jacob,
   also, was favored with heavenly visitations. We can never forget that
   mystic dream at Bethel, nor the wrestling at Jabbok, nor the many times
   when he turned to the God of his father Abraham and his father
   Isaac--and God spoke with him as a man speaks with his friend! It is a
   wonderful thing that the Lord should thus commune with men. He does not
   thus show Himself to the beasts which perish. He does not thus reveal
   Himself to the lifeless stones of the field. Those are strangely
   honored beings with whom God enters into close communion as He did with
   these three men! I argue from it that these beings cannot dissolve into
   a handful of dust and cease to be. Can those eyes cease to be which
   have seen the Lord? Can these souls perish which have conversed with
   the Eternal? We think not! And, just now, I ask you only to meditate
   upon the glories to which the Patriarchs were lifted up when they were
   permitted to be the Friends of God.

   What was still more notable, the Lord entered into Covenant with them.
   He made a Covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob which He remembered,
   saying, "Surely, blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will
   multiply you." You know how the Lord swore to give unto the seed of
   Abraham a goodly heritage, a land that flowed with milk and honey. Now,
   it is a wonderful thing that God should enter into compact with man.
   Does He make an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure,
   with mere insects of an hour? Especially, would He give His Son Jesus
   to die to seal the everlasting Covenant by His heart's blood with mere
   shadows who are but for a little time and then cease to be? I am sure
   it is not so. If God makes men capable of entering into an everlasting
   Covenant with Himself, there lies within that fact the clear suggestion
   that He imparts to them an existence which is not for today and
   tomorrow, but for eternity! Still, I wish you mainly to regard the
   Glory into which manhood is lifted up when God enters into gracious
   Covenant with it.

   Moreover, to go further, these men were not only in Covenant with God,
   but they had lived in accordance with that Covenant. I do not mean that
   they had lived perfectly in accord with it, but that the main strain of
   their lives was in conformity with their Covenant relationship to God.
   For the sake of that Covenant, Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees and
   dwelt no longer in the land of Haran, but became a sojourner with God
   in the land of Canaan. For the sake of this, he sent away his firstborn
   after the flesh, seeing it was said, "In Isaac shall your seed be
   called." "By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
   country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
   him of the same promise." These faithful men had respect to the
   recompense of the reward and, therefore, they were not mindful of the
   country from where they came out, neither sought opportunity to return.

   Jacob, the most faulty of the three, greatly as he erred in his conduct
   to his brother Esau, was evidently actuated by an intense faith in the
   Covenant birthright so that he ventured all things to obtain it. In his
   old age and death, he was anxious not to be confused with the
   Egyptians, or separated from the chosen household and, therefore, he
   said unto Joseph, "But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry
   me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place." This he made
   Joseph swear, for he must make sure of it. He was aiming at the
   promise, despite the errors that he committed in so doing. Now, does
   God enter into Covenant with men and help men to live in accordance
   with that Covenant and, after all, shall they miss the blessing? Shall
   it end in nothing? Hiding beneath the shadow of God's wings, shall
   they, after all, perish? It cannot be! They must live to whom God is
   God.

   For this was the Covenant, that they should have God to be their God
   and that they should be God's people. O Brothers and Sisters, I do not
   know how to speak on such a blessing as this, though I live in the
   daily enjoyment of it! This God is our God. All that the Lord is and
   all that He can do, He has given over to us, to be used on our
   behalf--the fullness of His Grace and Truth, the infinity of His Love,
   the Omnipotence of His Power, the Infallibility of His Wisdom--all, all
   shall be used on our behalf! The Lord has given Himself over to His
   people to be their inheritance and, on the other hand, we, poor weak
   feeble creatures as we are, are taken to be the peculiar treasure of
   the living God! "They shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in that
   day when I make up My jewels." "The Lord's portion is His people: Jacob
   is the lot of His inheritance." We are God's heritage, we are God's
   jewels, we are God's children, we are dear to Him as the apple of His
   eye! We are to Him as the signet upon His hand and the crown upon His
   head! He cannot have chosen for His portion a mass of corruption, or a
   handful of brown dust--yet that is what the body comes to in death. He
   cannot have chosen for His heritage that which will melt back into
   mother earth and be no more found--this cannot be!

   The Covenant has within it the sure guarantee of eternal life. Oh what
   an honor it is that God should even say to you and to me--"I will be
   your God and you shall be My people. Beyond the angels, beyond Heaven,
   beyond all My other creatures, I reserve you unto Myself. I have loved
   you with an everlasting love. I will rest in My love to you. I will
   rejoice over you with singing." In this the Lord has highly exalted His
   covenanted ones and raised them to great nearness to Himself--and thus
   to glory and honor. What has God worked? What is man that God is thus
   mindful of him, or the son of man that He thus visits him? Angels are
   nowhere as compared with men, yes, cherubim with all their burning
   bliss and consecrated ardor cannot match with men who are in Covenant
   with God! Blessed above all other beings are those who have Jehovah to
   be their God and who are, themselves, the Lord's choice, care and
   delight! Each one of these points, if well thought out, will go to
   strengthen our belief that the saints must live, must live forever and
   are, at this moment, living unto God.

   II. We now come to that matter more distinctly under our second
   head--here is ETERNAL LIFE IMPLIED, for "God is not the God of the
   dead, but of the living."

   It is implied, first, in the very fact of the Covenant of Grace. As I
   have asked before--Does the eternal God covenant with creatures that
   shall live only to threescore years and 10 and then shall go out like a
   candle-snuff? How can He be a God to them? I understand how He can be a
   helper and a friend to men of brief existence, but I see not how He can
   be a God. Must they not partake in His eternity if it is truly said, "I
   will be your God"? How can the Lord be an eternal blessing to an ending
   being? He has power and He will give me sufficient strength; He has
   wisdom and He will give me as much of His wisdom as I am capable of
   receiving. Must He not, also, cause me to partake of His immortality?
   How is He a God to me if He suffers me to be blotted out of existence?
   When David said in dying, "Yet has He made with me an everlasting
   Covenant," his comfort lay in his belief that he should live in the
   everlasting age to enjoy the fruit of that Covenant. How could there be
   an everlasting Covenant with a creature who would cease to exist?

   But next, this Covenant was made up of promises of a very peculiar
   order for, in very deed, the Covenant that God made with Abraham was
   not altogether, or even mainly, concerning things temporal. It was not
   only the land of Canaan of which the Lord spoke to Abraham, but the
   Patriarchs declared plainly that they desired "a better, that is, an
   heavenly country" (Heb. 11:16). Even when they were in Canaan, they
   were still looking for a country--and the city promised to them was not
   Jerusalem for, according to Paul in the 11th of the Hebrews, they still
   were looking for "a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker
   is God." They did not find, in their earthly lives, the complete
   fulfillment of the Covenant, for they received not the promises, but
   saw them afar off and were persuaded of them. The temporal blessings
   which God gave to them were not their expected portion--they took hold
   upon invisible realities and lived in expectation of them!

   They were evidently actuated by faith in something spiritual, something
   everlasting and they believed that the Covenant which God had made with
   them concerned such things. I have not the time to go into this
   subject. You get it more fully explained to you in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews--but so it was, that the Covenant blessings were of an order
   and a class that could not be compassed within the space of this
   present mortal life--the outlook of Covenant promises was towards the
   boundless sea of eternity. Now, if the Lord made a Covenant with them
   concerning eternal blessings, these saints must live to enjoy those
   blessings. God did not promise endless blessings to the creatures of a
   day.

   More especially, Beloved, it is to be remembered that for the sake of
   these eternal things, the Patriarchs had given up transient enjoyments.
   Abraham might have been a quiet prince in his own country, living in
   comfort, but, for the sake of the spiritual blessing, he left Chaldea
   and came to wander in the pastures of Canaan--in the midst of
   enemies--and to dwell in tents in the midst of discomforts. Isaac and
   Jacob were "heirs with him, also, of the same promises," but they
   entered not into the pursuits of the people--they dwelt alone and were
   not numbered among the nations. Like Moses, to whom God spoke, they,
   "counted the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
   Egypt."

   They left kith and kin and all the advantages of settled civilized life
   to be rangers of the desert, exiles from their fatherland. They were
   the very types and models of those who have no abiding city here and,
   therefore, for certain, though they died in hope, not having received
   the promise, we cannot believe that God deceived them! Their God was no
   mocker of them and, therefore, they must live after death! They had
   lived in this poor life for something not seen as yet and, if there is
   no such thing and no future life, they had been duped and mislead into
   a mistaken self-denial. If there is no life to come, the best
   philosophy is that which says, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we
   die." Since these men put this life in pawn for the next, they were
   sadly mistaken if there is no such life. Do you not see the force of
   our Savior's reasoning?-- God, who has led His people to abandon the
   present for the future--must justify their choice.

   Besides, the Lord had staked His honor and His reputation upon these
   men's lives. "Do you want to know," says He, "who I am? I am the God of
   Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob. If you want to know how I deal with My
   servants, go and look at the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." My
   Brothers and Sisters, as far as the earthly lives of the Patriarchs can
   be written in human records, they are certainly full of God's loving
   kindness--but still, there is nothing so remarkably joyous and majestic
   about them from a natural point of view as to make the Lord's dealings
   with them appear to be especially wonderful. Others who did not fear
   God have been as rich, powerful and honorable as they. Especially is
   the life of Jacob plowed and cross-plowed with affliction and trial! He
   spoke the truth when he summed up his life in the words, "Few and evil
   have the days of the years of my life been."

   Does the Lord intend us to judge of His goodness to His servants from
   the written life of Jacob? Or from the career of any one of His
   servants? The judgement must include the ages of an endless
   blessedness! This life is but the brief preface to the volume of our
   history! It is but the rough border, the selvage of the rich cloth of
   our being! These rippling streams of life come not to an end, but flow
   into the endless, shoreless ocean of bliss! Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
   have long been enjoying happiness and shall enjoy it throughout
   eternity! God is not ashamed to be called their God if you judge of the
   whole of their being--He would not have spoken thus if the visible were
   all and there were no future to counterbalance the tribulations of this
   mortal life! God is not the God of the short-lived who are so speedily
   dead--He is the living God of an immortal race whose present is but a
   dark passage into a bright future which can never end!

   Yet further, to bring out the meaning here, God cannot be the God of
   the non-existent. The supposition is too absurd! Our Savior does not
   argue about it, but He says so most peremptorily! God is not the God of
   the dead--that cannot be! If Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are reduced to a
   handful of ashes, God cannot be, at this moment, their God. We cannot
   take a dead object to be our God, neither can Jehovah be a God to
   lifeless clay. God is not the God of putrefaction and annihilation! God
   is not the God of that which has ceased to be! We have but to put the
   idea into words to make it dissolve before the glance of reason. A
   living God is the God of living men--and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are
   still alive!

   This even goes far to show that the bodies of these saints shall yet
   live. God reckons His covenanted ones to be alive. He says, "The dead
   are raised." He reckons them to be raised and, as He reckons nothing
   falsely, it is said by way of anticipation, "Your dead men shall live."
   Inasmuch as a portion of these chosen ones is still in the earth, God,
   who reckons things that are not, as though they were, looks upon their
   bodies as possessing life because they are to possess life so soon. God
   is not only the God of Abraham's soul, but of Abraham as a whole--his
   body, soul and spirit! God is the God of Abraham's body--we are sure of
   that because the Covenant seal was set upon the flesh of Abraham. Where
   the doubt might be, there is the confirming seal, namely, in his mortal
   body. There was no seal set upon his soul, for the soul had life and
   could not see death--no, it was set upon his body which would die--to
   make sure that even it would live!

   At this day we have Baptism and the Holy Supper to be seals as to the
   body. I have sometimes thought to myself that it were better if there
   were no water Baptism, seeing it has become the nest of so much
   superstition. And the Lord's Supper, with all its blessed uses, has
   been so abused that one is apt to think that without outward ordinances
   there might be more spiritual religion--but the Lord intends that the
   materialism of man and of creation shall be lifted up--and that

   the body shall be raised incorruptible and, therefore, has He given
   seals which touch the outward and material. The water where the body is
   washed and the bread and wine whereby the body is nourished, are tokens
   that there comes to us not only spiritual and invisible blessings, but
   even such as shall redeem and purify our mortal body! The grave cannot
   hold any portion of the covenanted ones! Eternal life is the portion of
   the whole man. God is the God of our entire manhood--spirit, soul and
   body--and all live unto Him in their entirety. The whole of the
   Covenant shall be fulfilled to the whole of those with whom that
   Covenant was made!

   This is good reasoning to those who have gone beyond mere reason and
   have ascended into the realm of faith. May the Holy Spirit grant unto
   us to be among them!

   III. Thirdly, and very briefly, beloved Friends, my text not only
   declares glorious relationship and implies eternal life, but it also
   unveils somewhat scantily, but still sufficiently, what the glorious
   life must be! Look, then, and see the

   GLORIOUS LIFE UNVEILED!

   It is clear that they live personally. It is not said, "I am the God of
   the whole body of the saints in one mass." But, "I am the God of
   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob." God will make His people to live individually.
   My mother, my father, my child-- each will personally exist. God is the
   God of saints, as living distinct lives--Abraham is Abraham, Isaac is
   Isaac, Jacob is Jacob! The three Patriarchs were not all melted into
   one common Abraham, nor Isaac into one imaginary Isaac. Neither was
   anyone so altered as to cease to be himself. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
   are all literally living as actual men--and the same men as they used
   to be. Jacob is Jacob and not an echo of Abraham! Isaac is Isaac and
   not a rehearsal of Jacob. All the saints are existent in their
   personality, identity, distinction and idiosyncrasy.

   What is more, the Patriarchs are mentioned by their names and so it is
   clear they are known--they are not three anonymous bodies--but Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob. Many inquire, "Shall we know our friends in Heaven?"
   Why should we not? The saints in Heaven are never spoken of in
   Scripture as moving about anonymously--their names are spoken of as
   written in the Book of Life. Why is this? The Apostles knew Moses and
   Elijah on the Mount, though they had never seen them before. I cannot
   forget old John Ryland's answer to his wife--"John," she said, "will
   you know me in Heaven?" "Betty," he replied, "I have known you well,
   here, and I shall not be a bigger fool in Heaven than I am now--
   therefore I shall certainly know you there." That seems to be clear
   enough! We read in the New Testament, "They shall sit down with
   Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven"--not sit down with
   three unknown individuals in iron masks, or three impersonalities who
   make a part of the great pan, nor three spirits who are as exactly
   alike as pins made in a factory--but Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. That is
   clear enough in the text.

   That glorious life, while it is a personal and a known life, is also
   free from all sorrow, misery and earthly grossness. They are neither
   married nor given in marriage; neither shall they die any more. But
   they are as the angels of God. It is a life of perfect blessedness, a
   life of hallowed worship, a life of undivided Glory! Oh, that we were
   in it! Oh that we may soon reach it! Let us think of the many who are
   enjoying it now and of those who have attained to it during the last
   few days. I am sure they are at home in every golden street and fully
   engaged in the adoration and worship of their Lord. Those saints who
   have been in Glory, now, these thousands of years cannot be more
   blessed than the latest arrivals. Within a very short space you and I
   shall be among the shining ones! Some of us may spend our next Sabbath
   with the angels! Let us rejoice and be glad at the bare thought of it.
   Some of as are not doomed to live here through another win-ter--we
   shall pass beyond these autumn fogs into the golden light of the
   eternal summer before another Christmas day has come! Oh the joy which
   ought to thrill our souls at the thought of such amazing bliss!

   And now, taking the whole subject together, I want to say a few
   familiar things about the influence which all this ought to have upon
   us. Concerning those that have gone before us, we gather from this
   whole text that they are not lost. We know where they are. Neither have
   they lost anything, for they are what they were and more. Abraham has
   about him still everything that is Abrahamic. He is still Abraham. And
   Isaac has everything about him that properly belongs to Isaac. And
   Jacob has all about him that makes him God's Israel. These good men
   have lost nothing that really appertained to their individuality,
   nothing that made them precious in the sight of the Lord. They have
   infinitely gained-- they have gloriously developed! They are Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob now at their best--or rather they are waiting till the
   trumpet of the Resurrection shall sound--when their bodies also shall
   be united to their spirits--and then Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will be
   completely Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, world without end!

   We are, by no means, deprived of our dear ones by their death--they
   are--they are themselves and they are still ours. As Abraham is not
   lost to Isaac, nor to Jacob, nor to God, nor to himself, so are our
   beloved ones, by no means, lost to us. Do not let us think of them,
   then, as if they were lost. I know your sorrows make an excursion to
   the grave, to look for the deceased ones. You want to lift that coffin
   lid and to unwrap the shroud. Oh, do not, do not! He is not here; the
   real man has gone. He may be dead to you, for a while, but he lives
   unto God. Yes, the dead one lives! He lives unto God! Do but anticipate
   the passage of that little time, which is almost gone while I am
   speaking of it, and then your Savior's angels shall sound their golden
   trumpets and at the welcome noise, the grave shall open its portals and
   resign its captives. "Your brother shall rise again." Comfort one
   another with these words! Shaftesbury is as much Shaftesbury as ever
   and even more so! We have parted with the Earl, but the saint lives! He
   has gone past yonder veil into the next room and there he is, before
   the Lord of Hosts! He has gone out of this dim, dusky, cloudy chamber
   into the bright, pearly light that streams from the Throne of God and
   of the Lamb! We have nothing to sorrow about in reference to what he is
   or where he is. So, too, your valued parents and beloved children and
   choice friends--they are still yours!

   Herein is great cause for thankfulness. Put aside your sackcloth and
   wear the garments of hope! Lay down the sack-but and take up the
   trumpet! Draw not the beloved bodies to the cemetery with dreary pomp
   and with black horses, but cover the coffin with sweet flowers and
   drape the horses with emblems of hope! It is the better birthday of the
   saint, yes, his truer wedding day! Is it sad to have done with sadness?
   Is it sorrowful to part with sorrow? No, rather, when joy begins to our
   friends, where Glory dwells in Immanuel's land, we may in sympathy
   sing, as it were, a new song, and tune our harps to the melodies of the
   glorified!

   I want you, also, to remember that the departed have not become members
   of another race--they have not been transferred into another
   family--they are still men, still women, still of our dear kindred.
   Their names are in the same family register on earth and in Heaven. Oh,
   no, no! Do not dream that they are separated and exiled! They have gone
   to the Home country--we are the exiles--they are Home! We are en route
   to the Fatherland--they are not so far from us as we think. Sin worked
   to divide them from us and us from them while we were here, together,
   but since sin is now taken away from them, one dividing element is
   gone! When it is also removed from us, we shall be nearer to each other
   than we could have been while we were both sinful! Do not let us think
   of them as gone far, for we are one in Christ.

   And they are not gone over to the other side in the battle. Oh, do not
   speak of them as dead and lying on the battlefield! They live, they
   live in sympathy with our Divine conflict. They have marched through
   the enemy's country. They have fought their fight and taken possession
   of their inheritance. They are still on our side, though we miss them
   from the daily service. When you number up the hosts of God, you must
   not forget the godlike bands that have fought the good fight, kept the
   faith, and finished their course. They are in the armies of the Lord,
   though not at this moment resisting unto blood. The 144,000 sealed unto
   the Lord include in their ranks all who are with God, whether here or
   in Heaven--

   "One family we dwell in Him, One Church, above, beneath, Though now
   divided by the stream, The narrow stream of Death."

   Our sacramental host marches onward to the New Jerusalem. Certain of
   the legionaries have forded the dividing flood. I see them ascending
   the other side! The bank of the river is white with their rising
   companies. Lo! I hear the splash of the ranks before us as they
   steadily pass down into the chill stream! In deep silence we see them
   solemnly wading through the billows. The host is ever marching on,
   marching on. The much dreaded stream lies a little before us--it is but
   a silver streak. We have come to the bank. We shudder not at the
   prospect! We follow the blessed footsteps of our Lord and His redeemed.
   We are still all one army--we are not losing our men--they are simply
   ascending from the long campaign to take their endless rewards at the
   Lord's right hand!

   What then? Why, then we will take up their work. If they have gone into
   the upper chamber to rest, we will make up their lack of service in
   this lower room! The work they did was so human that we will not allow
   a stitch to drop, but take it up where they left it and persevere in
   earnest. They are in Glory, but they were not glorified when they were
   here. The work they did was done by men of such infirmities as ours, so
   let us not fear to go on where they left off and perpetuate the work
   which they rejoiced in! There lies the plow in the furrow and the oxen
   are standing still, for Shamgar, the champion, is gone. Will no one lay
   hold of the plow handles? Will nobody urge the oxen with the goad?
   Young men, are

   you idling? Here is work for you! Are you hiding yourselves? Come
   forward, I pray you, in the name of the great Husbandman, and let the
   fields be tilled and sown with the good seed! Who will fill the gap
   made by death? Who will be baptized for the dead? Who will bear the
   banner, now that a standard bearer has fallen? I hope some consecrated
   voice will answer, "Here am I; send me!"

   Now, last of all, Brothers and Sisters, we may expect the same
   assistance as they received who have gone before. Jehovah says that He
   is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. But He
   also says, "I am the God of your father." The father of Moses had the
   Lord to be his God! That God is the God of my father, blessed be His
   name! As I took the old man by his hand, yesterday, at the age of 76, I
   could not but rejoice in all the faithfulness of the Lord to him and to
   his house. He was the God of my father's father, also--I cannot forget
   how the venerable man laid his hands upon his grandchild and blessed
   him--and the blessing is with him still. Yes, and He is the God of my
   children and He shall be the God of my children's children, for He
   keeps Covenant to thousands of them that love Him! Therefore take
   courage, Brothers and Sisters! This God is your God! He is a God to you
   and you are a people to Him!

   Act as His true servants. Live as those who are elect. If you are His
   choice, be choice characters! The chosen should be the best, should
   they not? The elect should be especially distinguished above all others
   by their conversation and their fervent zeal for Him that chose them.
   As you shall rise from among the dead because the Lord Jesus has
   redeemed you from among men, so stand up from among the dead and
   corrupt mass of this world--and be alive unto God--through Jesus Christ
   your Lord! What manner of people ought you to be who serve the living
   God? Since the living God has manifested Himself so wonderfully to you,
   ought you not to live unto Him to the utmost? God bless you for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

First Things First

   (No. 1864)

   [This address has been lengthened a little in order to fill the usual
   number of pages. It has also been revised sufficiently to make it read
   much the same as it was heard. There were passages which depended so
   much upon the voice and tone that they could

   not be reproduced by letterpress.]

   AN ADDRESS BYC. H. SPURGEON, DELIVERED AT THE MONTHLY MEETING OF THE
   LONDON BANKS' PRAYER UNION, HELD AT THE EGYPTIAN HALL, MANSION HOUSE,
   LONDON,

   ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 28, 1885, THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD MAYOR,
   M.P., IN THE CHAIR.

   MY LORD MAYOR AND GENTLEMEN--I was asked to give an address to the
   members of the Banks' Prayer Union and to others occupied in banking,
   but I beg to warn you all that an address from me is very much like a
   sermon. I am so in the habit of preaching that almost of necessity my
   talk drops into sermon form. I have heard a story of a painter of
   signboards in Harp Alley in the olden times which illustrates the force
   of habit. An innkeeper selected an angel as the sign of his house and
   asked this knight of the brush to produce one, but the painter replied,
   "You had better have a lion. I have been painting lions so long that
   they are more in my line than angels." My host answered that there were
   three or four lions of different colors in the street, already, and
   that he must have an angel. "Well," said our artist, "if you must have
   an angel, you shall have an angel, but it will be dreadfully like a
   lion." Thus it comes to pass that when I am compelled to give an
   address, it is extremely like a sermon! I pray you have patience with
   me now that I have confessed my weakness.

   A philosopher has remarked that if a man knew that he had 30 years of
   life before him, it would not be an unwise thing to spend 20 of those
   years in mapping out a plan of living and putting himself under rule,
   for he would do more with the 10 well-arranged years than with the
   whole 30 if he spent them at random, There is much truth in that
   saying. A man will do little by firing off his gun if he has not
   learned to take aim.

   Possibly I address myself to some who have, up to now, lived
   haphazardly and, if so, I invite them to a more hopeful method of
   living. To have a great many aims and objectives is much the same thing
   as having no aim at all, for if a man shoots at many things, he will
   hit none, or none worth hitting. It is a grand thing to know what we
   are living for and to live for a worthy objective with the undivided
   energy of our being. Shall we, when the end comes, have made a success
   of life? Has our objective been a right one and has it been wisely
   pursued? Are the results of our conduct such as we shall wish them to
   have been when the conflict of this mortal life is over? These
   questions deserve immediate consideration.

   Another question arises out of them--What position should religion
   occupy in reference to a man's life? That is a question which naturally
   arises in the arranging of life for, whatever we chose to think of it,
   there is such a thing as religion in the world--and there is within us
   some yearning after spiritual things. We cannot help feeling that we
   need somewhat more than this visible world can offer us. Many of us
   find our greatest joy in the cultivation of that feeling, for it is to
   us the token of our spiritual nature and the prophecy of immortality.
   To us, this life is mainly worth living because it promises to be the
   introduction to a better life--

   "Alas for love, if you were all, And nothing beyond, O earth!"

   Alas for life if this were all and there were not a higher and better
   state of existence! No knell would be more doleful than that which
   signified the death of man's hope of immortality.

   What position should religion occupy in your life and mine? The answer
   must depend very much upon another ques-tion--What is religion and what
   does religion, itself, demand? What are the requirements of the great
   God and of the soul and of eternity? This question has suggested to me
   the text upon which I shall speak this afternoon--

   "Seek you first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all
   these things shall be added unto you." Matthew 6:33.

   I shall not trespass beyond the appointed time. However prosy I may be
   during the time allotted to me, I shall stop when the hour is complete.

   HERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT TRUE RELIGION IS. According to the Words of
   Christ Jesus our Lord, it is "The Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness." Just now I read to you a portion of Scripture, Matthew
   6:24-34, and I read it to you that you might note that our text occurs
   in the midst of a warning against undue anxiety. Undue anxiety is very
   common among city men and it is not rare anywhere. Certain of us are
   nervous, timid, doubtful and prone to fear. There are plenty of
   pessimists about, although they will hardly recognize themselves by
   that title. To them, evil is always impending--we are about to take a
   leap in the dark. All their birds are owls or ravens. All their swans
   are black. If it rains today, it will rain tomorrow--and the next day
   and the next--and, in all probability, there will be a deluge! Or if it
   is fine today, it will be dry tomorrow and so on, for months--and the
   earth and all the meadows that are therein will perish with drought. As
   to the sun, they observe with pleasing despondency that he has spots.
   His light they hardly notice, but they dote upon his spots with amiable
   horror! Minds of this sort--

   Find poisons in trees, deaths in the running brook Dirges in stones and
   ill in everything. I suppose they cannot help it--yet Christian men
   must help it, for the Lord's precept is plain and binding--"Be not,
   therefore, anxious."

   Fretful anxiety is forbidden to the Christian. In the first place, it
   is needless. Matthew 6:26--"Behold the fowls of the air," said Christ,
   "they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
   heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?" If you
   have a Father in Heaven to care for you, are you not put to shame by
   every little bird that sits upon the bough and sings, though it has not
   two grains of barley in all the world? God takes charge of the fowls of
   the air and thus they live exempt from care--why do not we?

   Our Lord also taught that such anxiety is useless as well as needless,
   for, with all our care, we cannot add a cubit to our stature. Can we do
   anything else by fretful care? What if the farmer deplores that there
   is no rain? Do his fears unstop the bottles of Heaven? Or if the
   merchant sighs because the wind detains his laden ship--will his
   complaining turn the gale to another quarter? We do not better
   ourselves a bit by all our fret and fume. It were infinitely wiser to
   do our best and then cast our cares upon our God. Prudence is wisdom,
   for it adapts means to ends, but anxiety is folly, for it groans and
   worries and accomplishes nothing.

   Besides, according to our Savior, anxiety about carnal things is
   heathenish--"After all these things do the Gentiles seek." They have no
   God and no Providence and, therefore, they try to be a providence to
   themselves! As for the man of God who can say, "God's Providence is my
   inheritance," why should he pine away with trouble? Let the heir of
   Heaven act a nobler part than the mere man of the world who has his
   portion in this life and lives without God and without hope! Our
   distrust of our God is childish and dishonoring. I was going through
   these streets one day, driven by a friend in a four-wheeled chaise, and
   he, being a good driver, must necessarily drive into narrow places
   where it seemed to me that we should be crushed by the vans and
   omnibuses. I shrank back in my timidity and expressed my unwise alarms
   so freely, that with a smile he laid the reins in my hand, and said,
   "If you cannot trust me, would you like to drive yourself?" From that
   ambition I was wholly free and I assured him that he might drive as he
   liked, rather than make me the charioteer. Surely, the great God might
   well put the same proposal to those who are complaining of His
   Providence. If we cannot trust Him, could we manage better, ourselves?
   If we are men in Christ, let us believe in our God and leave the
   governance of the great world outdoors, and of the little world within
   our own gates, to the Lord God, our heavenly Father, who will surely
   cause all things to work together for good to them that love Him!

   It is plain that within us there is a propensity to be anxious. Can we
   not utilize it? Can we not turn it to good account? I think so. Some
   are naturally thoughtful and careful--can they not transform this
   tendency into a benefit? We have a tendency to be anxious. Very well,
   let us be anxious, but let our anxiety run in the right direction. Here
   is a mental heat--let us apply it to some useful purpose. Our text sets
   before us the true sphere of Christian carefulness. "Seek you first the
   Kingdom of God and His righteousness." Seek that with all your care!
   Seek that with all your energy. Be anxious about that. Let your whole
   mind run in that direction with eagerness and thought. You cannot be
   too careful or too energetic when God and righteousness are concerned.

   In our text there is a description of true religion. What is it? "The
   Kingdom of God." Without using a single superfluous theological term, I
   may say that the great God has always had a Kingdom in this world. In
   the olden times He set up a kingdom among His people, Israel, to whom
   He gave laws and statutes. But now the Lord is King over all the
   world--"The God of the whole earth shall He be called." "The earth is
   the Lord's and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
   therein." God has a Kingdom in this world, but it is too much neglected
   and forgotten of men. The first thing to be done by us is to enter that
   Kingdom. Blessed is that man who has the Lord God to be his King and
   has learned to order his life according to Divine Law. The highest
   liberty comes from wearing the yoke of God. The servant of men who
   dares not call his soul his own is a serf to be pitied. But the servant
   of God who fears nothing but sin, is a man of princely mold. We must
   stoop before God, that we may conquer among men! If we determine to
   yield ourselves wholly unto the Lord, we shall become influential among
   our fellow men.

   We can only enter into this Kingdom of God by being born again of His
   Spirit, for, "except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of
   God." In that new birth we learn to submit ourselves to the Lord Jesus
   Christ and to find in Him, eternal life. God has appointed the Lord
   Jesus heir of all things. By Him, also, He made the worlds. He says of
   Him, "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish from the way, when
   His wrath is kindled but a little." Faith in Christ casts our sins at
   the foot of His Cross and brings us an inward life unto holiness. We
   must believe in Jesus and trust in His great Atonement for sin, for
   apart from His full Atonement, there is no salvation and no true
   service to God. This faith puts us into the Kingdom of God for, to "as
   many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God,
   even to them that believe on His name." The first anxiety of every man
   should be to be a loyal subject of the Kingdom of

   God.

   And when we feel that we are reconciled to God and are under His
   supreme sway, our next objective should be to continue there and to
   become more and more completely obedient to Divine rule--so that we may
   more fully enjoy every privilege of the Kingdom. In the Kingdom of God
   every man is a king and a priest. He that serves God reigns. He that
   serves God is the possessor of all things! All things are ours when we
   are Christ's--

   "This world is ours, and worlds to come: Earth is our lodge, and Heaven
   our home." Let the Christian seek to know to the fullest what is the
   heritage of the saints in Christ Jesus.

   Our next business should be to spread that Kingdom--to try to bring
   others under the dominion of Christ. It should be the lifework of each
   man to bring others to acknowledge the Sovereignty of the Lord Jesus.
   What opportunities most of you possess! Your station, your education,
   your wealth--all give you advantages for serving the Lord. Are you
   using them? It is a great joy to the Christian minister to have about
   him a people who are missionaries in their daily lives. With great joy
   have I listened to some poor girl who has confessed her faith in Christ
   and then has added very timidly, "There is another girl waiting outside
   who would like to speak to you. She works with me in a warehouse in the
   City and I spoke to her and she sought Jesus. And I believe she is
   converted." I fear that many men of position are less diligent in
   winning souls than the poor workers they employ. Should it be so? He
   lives most and lives best who is the means of imparting spiritual life
   to others! May not some of you, at the last, come to a lonely end from
   lack of usefulness? We heard, not long ago, of the shipwreck from which
   a mother was washed on shore, but found all her children drowned. She
   telegraphed to her husband two words. The first was very pleasant to
   his eyes--"Saved." The next was full of misery--"Saved alone." Ah me!
   Would you or I like to have it--"Saved alone"? God forbid! When we
   reach Heaven's gate, may we be able to say, "Here am I, and the
   children that You have given me."

   This is the meaning of that first word--"Seek the Kingdom of God." The
   reign of our Lord is to be our main objective if we would lead a
   well-ordered, useful, happy, and honored life.

   Our text has a second word--"Seek first the Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness," by which I understand the practical part of true
   religion. Seek to have the imputed righteousness of Christ, by all
   means, but seek, also, to exhibit the infused righteousness which comes
   of sanctification. Brothers in Christ, let us aspire after a high
   degree of holiness! We are called to be saints and saints are not
   miraculous beings to be set up in niches and admired--they are men and
   women who live, trade, do righteousness and practice charity in the
   streets of a city, or the fields of a village! Those who are washed in
   the blood of the Lamb should not be satisfied with the common
   cleanliness of morality--the garment of their life should be whiter
   than any fuller can make it! Purity becomes the disciples of Jesus. In
   spirit, soul and body we

   ought to be holiness to the Lord. Our righteousness must exceed that of
   the scribes and Pharisees! It should be a reproduction of the Character
   of our Lord!

   By the phrase, "His righteousness," I understand that power in the
   world which is always working, in some form or other, for that which is
   good, true and pure. Everything in this world which is holy, honest and
   of good repute may count upon the Christian as its friend, for it is a
   part of God's righteousness. Does drunkenness eat out the very life of
   our nation? Do you want men of temperance to battle with this evil? The
   Christian man cries, "Write down my name!" When the slave had to be
   freed, the subjects of God's Kingdom were to the front in that deed of
   righteousness. And today, if oppression is to be put down, we dare not
   refuse our aid. If the people are to be educated and better housed, we
   hail the proposal with delight. If the horrible sin of the period is to
   be denounced and punished, we may not shrink from the loathsome
   conflict! Let each man in is own position labor after purity and, as
   God shall help us, we may yet sweep these streets of their infamies and
   deliver our youth from pollution! Every Christian man should say of
   every struggle for better things, "I am in it, cost what it may." Hosts
   of your professors of religion forget to seek God's righteousness and
   seem to suppose that their principal business is to save their own
   souls--poor little souls that they are! Their religion is barely
   sufficient to fill up the vacuum within their own ribs where their
   hearts should be! This selfishness is not the religion of Jesus! The
   religion of Jesus is unselfish--it enlists a man as a crusader against
   everything that is unrighteous. We are Knights of the Red Cross and our
   bloodless battles are against all things that degrade our fellow men,
   whether they are causes social, political, or religious. We fight for
   everything that is good, true, and just.

   True religion is diffusive and extensive in its operations. I see
   people drawing lines continually and saying, "So far is religious, and
   so far is secular." What do you mean? The notion is one which suits
   with the exploded notions of sacred places, priests, shrines and
   relics! I do not believe in it. Everything is holy to a holy man! To
   the pure, all things are pure. To a man who seeks, first, the Kingdom
   of God and His righteousness, his house is a temple, his meals are
   sacraments, his garments are vestments, every day is a holy day and he,
   himself, is a priest and a king unto God! The sphere of Christianity is
   co-extensive with daily life. I am not to say, "I serve God when I
   stand in the pulpit," for that might imply that I wished to serve the
   devil when my sermon was over! We are not only to be devout at Church
   and pious at Prayer Meetings, but to be devout and godly everywhere!
   Religion must not be like a fine piece of medieval armor, to be hung
   upon the wall, or only worn on state occasions. No, it is a garment for
   the house, the shop, the bank! Your ledgers and iron safes are to be
   made, by Grace, "holiness unto the Lord." Godliness is for the parlor
   and the drawing room, the counting house and the exchange. It can
   neither be put off nor on. It is of the man and in the man if it is
   real! Righteousness is a quality of the heart and abides in the nature
   of the saved man as a component part of his new self. He is not
   righteous who is not always righteous!

   Undefiled religion is a vital matter--it is in the life of the man. I
   am afraid that the religion of some people is like the shell of the
   hermit crab. At sea, the dredge brings up innumerable creeping things
   and among them, creatures which have their own natural shells to live
   in. But here comes a fellow who has annexed the shell of a whelk and
   bears it about as if it were his own. He lives in it while it suits him
   and he gives up the tenancy when it becomes inconvenient. The shell is
   not part of himself. Avoid such a religion! Beware of a Sunday shell
   and a weekday without the shell! That religion which you can part with,
   you had better part with! If you can get rid of it, get rid of it! If
   it is not part and parcel of yourself, it is good for nothing! If it
   does not run right through you like a silver thread through a piece of
   embroidery, it will not be of any use for your eternal salvation.

   I said, just now, that true godliness must be diffusive and I return to
   the statement. I remember a remark of John Newton, once rector of St.
   Mary Woolnoth, across the road. He was a thoroughly Calvinistic
   preacher, but when one asked him whether he believed in Calvinism, he
   replied, "I am a Calvinist, but I do not take it as children eat lumps
   of sugar. I use it to flavor all my preaching, as men use sugar in tea
   or food." Hypocrites swallow religion in lumps-- inviting all to admire
   the quantity--but sincere seekers after righteousness quietly dissolve
   their godliness in their lives and sweeten all their common
   relationships with it. The real saint flavors his ordinary life with
   Divine Grace so that his wife and his children, his servants and his
   neighbors are the better for it. Mr. Rowland Hill used to say that a
   man was not a true Christian if his dog and his cat were not the better
   off for it. That witness is true.

   A man's religion ought to be to him what perfume is to a rose, or light
   to the sun--it should be the necessary outcome of his existence. If his
   life is not fragrant with the Truth of God and bright with love, the
   question arises whether he

   knows the religion of our Lord Jesus. The division between sacred and
   secular is most unhappy to both divisions of life-- we need them
   united! In the days of Queen Mary, a foolish spite dug up the bones of
   the wife of Bucer. Poor woman! She had done no ill except that she had
   married a teacher of the Gospel--but she must be dragged from her grave
   to be buried in a dunghill for that grave offense! When Elizabeth came
   to the throne, her bones were buried again--but to make the body secure
   from any future malice of bigots, our prudent forefathers took the
   relics of a certain Popish saint who was enshrined at Oxford and mixed
   the remains of the two deceased persons past all chance of separation!
   Thus Mistress Bucer was secured from further disrespect by her unity
   with the body of one of the canonized! I want the secular to be thus
   secured by union with the sacred! If we could only feel that our common
   acts are parts of a saintly life, they would not so often be done
   carelessly. If we lay our poor daily life by itself, it will be
   disregarded, but if we combine it with our holiest aspirations and
   exercises, it will be preserved. Our religion must be part and parcel
   of our daily life and then the whole of our life will be preserved from
   the destroyer. Does not the Scripture say, "Whether you eat or drink,
   or whatever you do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus"?

   "But," says one, "are we not to have amusements?" Yes, such amusements
   as you can take in the fear of God. Do whatever Jesus would have done.
   This is liberty enough for one who aspires to be like Jesus. There is
   happiness enough in things which are pure and right--and if not, we
   will not do evil to find more! We find pleasure enough without hunting
   for it in the outskirts of sin. There are joys which are as far above
   the pleasures of folly as the feasts of kings are above the husks of
   swine. At times our inner life flames up into a blaze of joy and if
   usually it burns lower, there is at least a steady fire of peace upon
   our hearth which makes our life such that we envy no one. It is not
   slavery that I set before you when I say that we are, first of all, to
   seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness--there is a present
   recompense which justifies the choice. And as for the eternal future,
   it pleads for it with a voice of thunder.

   It is time that I changed the subject and dwelt upon a further theme.
   HERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROPER

   POSITION OF TRUE RELIGION. "Seek you first the Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness."

   Let the word, "first," indicate to you the order of time. You know
   those venerable city gentlemen. I hope you reverence them as I do,
   since they are the embodiment of wisdom. One of these said to his son,
   "William, I am pleased to see you incline towards religion. But take my
   advice and be reasonable. I have been in business, now, for 40 years,
   and my advice is--stick to trade and make money and then attend to
   religion." Now, the young man, as young men are apt to do, had begun to
   think for himself and, for a wonder, his thoughts ran in the right
   groove and, therefore, he replied, "Father, I am always grateful to you
   for your good advice, but this time you must excuse me if I differ from
   you, for the Scripture says, 'Seek you first, the Kingdom of God, and
   His righteousness' and, therefore, I cannot go in for making money
   first, but I must at once serve God, and yet, I hope I may be none the
   less attentive to business." It is a good rule to begin as you mean to
   go on. That son was wiser than his counselor!

   My Lord Mayor will not say that he was wrong, I am quite sure. Nor will
   anybody here who has tried what it is to seek first, the Kingdom of
   God, while engaged in business. True godliness is as good for this life
   as for the next. If I had to die like a dog, I would still wish to be a
   Christian! Place religion first in the order of time. Begin each week
   by carefully consecrating the first day to rest and holy worship. Begin
   each day by giving the dew of the morning to communion with Heaven.
   Begin your married life by seeking the blessing of the great Father and
   choosing for a partner one that will agree with you in the fear of God.
   In opening a new business, sanctify the venture with the supplications
   of godly friends and in all fresh enterprises be guided of the Lord. If
   we begin, continue and end with God, our way will be strewn with
   blessings.

   Seek, also, the Kingdom of God first in order of preference. If it
   should ever become a choice between God and Mammon, never hesitate. If
   wealth and righteousness run counter to each other, let the gold perish
   and hold fast to righteousness. Follow Christ, however dear it costs
   you. Blessed is that man who never deliberates because his mind is made
   up, rather, to "suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy
   the pleasures of sin for a season." Blessed is the man who knows no
   policy but that of thorough consecration to God and righteousness--who
   is not careful to answer in this matter, but has his mind decided once
   and for all. This is his motto--

   "Tis done! The great transaction's done-- I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine!" We have lifted our hands unto the Lord and we cannot go back.

   "Well," cries one, "But, you know, we must live." I am not sure about
   that. There are occasions when it would be better not to live. An old
   heraldic motto says, "Better death than false of faith." I am, however,
   quite clear about another necessity--we must die--and we had better
   take that, "must," into consideration and not quite so often repeat the
   cant phrase, "We must live."

   But we shall live, Brothers! We shall live without grinding the poor,
   or stooping to questionable finance, or lying to the public by a false
   prospectus. We shall live without dishonor. We young men--we shall live
   without lowering our colors to please those who jest at godliness. Here
   stands one who has run the gauntlet of public criticism for more than
   30 years and he has not suffered thereby--certainly he has not been
   forced to hide his faith, or recant his teachings. Silly stories, jests
   and sarcasms, have not killed us, nor even robbed us of our sleep!
   Younger Brethren, never fear--if you are right, nothing can harm you!
   Stand your ground and keep it. Say, "I shall do what I feel it right to
   do, God helping me." Any little difficulties which now arise will soon
   come to an end if you are firmly conscientious. Never be a coward--

   "I had as lief not be, as live to be In awe of such a thing as I
   myself." Let none of us ever raise a question about whether we shall
   please or displease by doing right, but let us "seek first the Kingdom
   of God."

   Let godliness be first in intensity. It is to be feared that many give
   their force to their worldly pursuits and their feebleness to their
   religion. They are "all there" during banking hours, but they are not
   "all there" at the hour of prayer. They remind me of one whose voice in
   our assemblies for prayer was exceedingly low and well near inaudible.
   But in the shop he could be heard almost too well. Should it be so,
   that self should have our energies and Christ should have our
   lukewarmness? If ever we grow ardent and enthusiastic, it should be in
   the noblest of all causes, in the service of the best of Masters! In
   that work, we cannot be too earnest! Seldom enough do we meet with a
   person who verges upon excess of zeal in this matter. For Him who has
   redeemed us with His precious blood, we cannot do too much! Our heart
   complains that we cannot do enough! Alas, the comparative sizes of the
   Bible and the ledger are frequently symbolical--a neat little Bible is
   buried under a huge ledger. I claim for things Divine a different
   place--let that be first which is first--throw your whole soul into the
   love and service of the Lord!

   "Is your father a Christian?" said a Sunday school teacher to a child.
   The girl answered, "Yes, I believe that Father is a Christian, but he
   has not worked much at it lately." No doubt there are many of that
   sort. Their religion has taken a holiday and they, themselves, have
   gone up to a sluggard's bed. Let them be awakened, for it is high time
   to awaken out of sleep!

   Seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness first, by giving to true
   religion a sovereignty over your lives. The helm by which life is
   steered should be in the hands of God. To glorify God and promote
   righteousness should be our master passion. This Aaron's rod should
   swallow up all other rods! Be first a man of God--after that a banker,
   or a merchant, or a working man. I like to see our public men, first
   Christians, then Englishmen, then Conservatives, or Liberals, or
   Radicals, as their convictions sway them--but in any case, let a man be
   first a man of God. I would to God that our politics, our merchandise,
   our literature, our art were all saturated with this idea--"First a
   Christian." Then the secondary character would rise in excellence and
   nobility! Science, social laws, trade usages, domestic life would all
   be the better for coming under the supremacy of living religion. The
   fear of God should be the foundation and the top stone of the social
   edifice. "Christ first" and other things in their due order! Over and
   above all, let consecration to God shine forth even as the pillar of
   fire in the wilderness covered and illuminated the entire camp of
   Israel.

   I may honestly claim five minutes more to complete the hour allotted to
   this service and I will spend it by TAKING

   ACCOUNT OF THE PROMISE HERE MADE TO THOSE WHO "SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM
   OF GOD, AND

   HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS." Does anyone demand, "What will become of our
   business if we place godliness first?" The answer is in the text--"All
   these things shall be added unto you." A young man beginning life
   resolving that he will do everything in the fear of God and that as God
   helps him, he will do nothing that is contrary to the mind of the Lord
   Jesus Christ--shall he prosper? He shall get on so far as this--he
   shall have bread to eat and raiment to put on--all that is necessary
   for this life "shall be added to him."

   "Alas!" sighs one, "I am out of place and I know not how to provide for
   myself and my household." Are you sure that this trial has come without
   your own fault? Then be not of doubtful mind, for the Lord will provide
   for you. He has

   said, "Trust in the Lord and do good; so shall you dwell in the land,
   and verily you shall be fed." David's experience was, "I have been
   young and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken." The
   drunk, the vicious, the idle, the dishonest may suffer hunger and it
   will be well for them if such discipline amends them. But to the
   upright there arises light in the darkness. They that serve God shall
   not have to complain of His deserting them. In the reign of Queen
   Elizabeth, a certain merchant of this great city was desired by her
   Majesty to go abroad for her upon affairs of State. He pleaded that his
   own business would suffer, whereupon her Majesty replied, "Sir, if you
   will mind my business, I will mind your business." Rest assured that
   God will care for you if you make His service your delight! "All these
   things shall be added unto you."

   The blessings of this life come to gracious men in the best shape and
   form, for they come by Divine promise. Suppose that it were now put
   into the power of each one of us to be rich? I suspect that the most of
   us would be eager to avail ourselves of the opportunity and yet it is a
   moot point whether it would be best for certain of us to have the
   burden of wealth. It is a question whether some people, who behave
   splendidly where they now are, would be half as good, or a 10th as
   happy if they were lifted to higher positions. I have seen heroes
   drivel under the influence of luxury. Many are the creatures of
   circumstances and make but poor creatures when their circumstances
   allow of self-indulgence! We do not know what is best for us. It is
   sometimes very much better for us to suffer loss and disappointment
   than to obtain gain and prosperity.

   When that eminent servant of God, Mr. Gilpin, was arrested to be
   brought up to London to be tried for preaching the Gospel, his captors
   made mirth of his frequent remark, "everything is for the best." When
   he fell from his horse and broke his leg, they were specially merry
   about it, but the good man quietly remarked, "I have no doubt but that
   even this painful accident will prove to be a blessing." And so it was,
   for, as he could not travel quickly, the journey was prolonged and he
   arrived at London some days later than had been expected. When they
   reached as far as Highgate, they heard the bells ringing merrily in the
   city down below. They asked the meaning and were told, "Queen Mary is
   dead and there will be no more burnings of Protestants." "Ah!" said
   Gilpin, "you see, it is all for the best." It is a blessing to break a
   leg if thereby life is saved! How often our calamities are our
   preservatives! A less evil may ward off a greater. Many a man might
   have soared into the clouds of folly if his wings had not been clipped
   by adversity. Better struggle and be honorable than become wealthy by
   disgraceful deeds. Agur's prayer, "Give me neither poverty nor riches,"
   was a wise one, but our Lord's is still better, "Not as I will, but as
   You will."

   "All these things shall be added unto you," and the measure of the
   addition shall be arranged by Infallible Wisdom. Temporal things shall
   come to you in such proportion as you would, yourself, desire them if
   you were able to know all things and to form a judgement according to
   Infinite Wisdom. Would you not prefer a lot selected by the Lord to one
   chosen by yourself? Do you not joyfully sing with the Psalmist, "You
   shall choose my inheritance for me"?

   Does not the promise also imply that necessary things shall come to the
   Believer without vexatious worry and consuming labor? While others are
   worrying, you shall be singing! While others rise in the morning and
   cry, "How shall we live through the day?" you shall wake to a secure
   provision and you shall have a happy enjoyment of it. Your place of
   defense shall be the munitions of rocks. Your bread shall be given you
   and your water shall be sure. Contentment with your lot and confidence
   in God will make life peaceful and happy--a dinner of herbs with
   content will yield a flavor of satisfaction unknown to those who eat
   the stalled ox. It is better to be happy than to be rich--and happiness
   lies in the heart rather than in the purse. Not what a man has, but
   what a man is will decide his bliss or woe in this life and the next.
   Oh yes, if God Himself adds to you the things of this life while you
   are serving Him, the lines will fall to you in pleasant places and you
   will have a goodly heritage.

   The wording, of the text, "All these things shall be added unto you,"
   reminds me that the acquisition of property often decreases a man
   rather than adds to him. Have you not seen a man become visibly smaller
   as his riches grew greater? It is a wretched sight which has often
   pained me. I have distinctly seen a man become "the architect of his
   own fortune" and the destroyer of himself! He has built up a palatial
   estate upon the ruins of his own manhood. It is a pity when a man
   bricks himself up with his growing gains. Look at that hole in the
   wall. The man stands in it and greedily cries for bricks and mortar! He
   must have golden bricks and silver mortar. They bring him the
   materials. He cries eagerly for more! He cannot be content unless he
   builds himself in. The wall which shuts him out from his fellow men and
   from the light of peace and true joy, rises higher and higher, month by
   month and year by year. His sympathies and charities are bricked

   up, for the wall is more than breast high. Still he pines for more
   metallic material! At last he is built in, buried beneath his own
   gatherings, lost to all manhood through his accumulations. You see his
   house; you see his carriage and his horses; you see his broadcloth and
   his broad acres, but you cannot see the man. Heart, soul, aspiration,
   spirituality-- they are all gone--and nothing remains but a vault of
   greed and care to be buried, itself, under a monument bearing these
   words, "He died worth half a million."

   A far more desirable idea is for a man to rise above his possessions,
   elevating life upon steppingstones of these dead gains; building with
   them a pedestal above which the inner manhood rises!

   This is what God intends to do in Providence to the man who serves Him
   heartily. He will add to him the things of this life. These shall be
   thrown in as supplements to the Divine heritage. I incur certain little
   outlays in connection with my study. We need a few matters which may be
   paid for out of petty cash, but I have never seen, as far as I
   recollect, a single penny for string and brown paper because, as a
   reader and writer, I buy books and then the string and brown paper are
   added to me! My purchase is the books, but the string and brown paper
   come to me, added as a matter of course. This is the idea of our
   text--you are to spend your strength on the high and noble purpose of
   glorifying God--and then the minor matters of, what shall we eat? And,
   what shall we drink? And, how shall we be clothed? are thrown in as
   supplements! Earthly things are but the brown paper and string--and I
   pray you never think too much of them.

   Some people get so much of this brown paper and string that they glory
   in them and expect us to fall down and worship them. If we refuse this
   homage, they are foolish enough to adore themselves. It must not be so
   among the servants of God. To us, the man is the man, and not the
   guinea's stamp. "All these things" are, to us, small matters. The real
   life of the soul is all in all. Do not slice pieces out of your manhood
   and then hope to fill up the vacancies with bank notes. He who loses
   manliness or godliness to gain gold is a great cheater of himself. Keep
   yourselves entirely for God and for His Christ--and let all other
   matters be additions, not subtractions! Live above the world. Its goods
   will come to you when you do not bid high for them. If you hunt the
   butterfly of wealth too eagerly, you may spoil it by the stroke with
   which you secure it. When earthly things are sought for as the main
   objective, they are degraded into rubbish and the seeker of them has
   fallen to be a mere man with a muckrake, turning over a dunghill to
   find nothing! Set your heart on nobler things than pelf!

   Cry with David, "I will lift up my eyes to the hills where comes my
   help." Men and brethren, let us so live that it will be safe for God to
   add to us the blessings of the life that now is, but that can only be
   done with safety when we have learned to keep the world under our feet.
   May the Lord enable us to live to high and noble purposes, so that we
   may meet in the Glory Land and hear the approving voice of Jesus, our
   Savior and Captain, saying to us, "Well done, good and faithful
   servants."

The Nobleman's Faith

   (No. 1865)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 11, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "There was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he
   heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto Him,
   and besought Him that He would come down, and heal his son: for he was
   at thepoint of death. Then said Jesus unto him, Except you see signs
   and wonders, you will not believe. The nobleman said unto Him, Sir,
   come down before my child dies. Jesus said unto him, Go your way, your
   son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him
   and he went his way. And as he was now going down, his servants met
   him, and told him, saying, Your son lives. Then inquired he of them the
   hour when he began to mend. And they said unto him, yesterday at the
   seventh hour the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at the
   same hour in which Jesus said unto him, Your Son lives: and he
   believed, and his whole house." John 4:46-53.

   THIS narrative illustrates the rise and progress of faith in the soul.
   While I try to speak of it, I pray that we may experimentally follow
   the track, desiring that such faith may have a rise in our hearts, may
   make progress in our spirits and may become even stronger in us than it
   was in this nobleman. The point, my Brothers and Sisters, is not to
   hear about these things, only, but to have them repeated in your own
   soul. We need to come to real business and to make the things of God
   matters of downright fact to ourselves. We need not only to hear about
   this nobleman from Capernaum, or anybody else--but to see in our own
   souls the same work of Grace as was worked in him. The same living
   Christ is here and His help we as greatly need as ever did this
   nobleman. May we seek it as he sought it and find it as he found it!
   Thus will the Holy Spirit, who inspired the narrative before us, be
   found writing it over again, not upon the pages of a book, but upon the
   fleshy tablets of our hearts!

   Observe then, at the commencement, that trouble, first of all, led this
   courtly person to Jesus. Had he been without trial, he might have lived
   forgetful of his God and Savior. But sorrow came to his house and it
   was God's angel in disguise. It may be, dear Friend, that you are in
   trouble this morning and, if so, I pray that affliction may be the
   black horse upon which Mercy shall ride to your door! It is a sad, sad
   thing with some men that the better the Lord deals with them in
   Providence, the worse return they make. On the other hand, there are
   hearts that turn to the Lord when He smites them. When they drift into
   deep waters, when they can scarcely find bread to eat, when sickness
   attacks their bodies and especially when their children are smitten,
   then they begin to think of God and better things. Blessed is the
   discipline of the great Father in such a case! It is well for the
   troubled if their tribulation bruises their heart to repentance and
   repentance leads them to seek and find pardon.

   The particular form of trial which visited this nobleman was the
   sickness of his child. He had a little son whom he dearly loved and who
   was down with a deadly fever. The father appears to have been a
   naturally kind and affectionate person. His servants evidently took a
   great interest in him and in the domestic affliction which grieved him,
   for you observe with what eagerness they came to meet him, to tell him
   of the recovery of his child. The father's heart was sadly wounded
   because his dear boy was at the point of death. No doubt he had tried
   all the remedies known to the times, had sent for every physician that
   could be found within miles of Capernaum and now, having heard of one,
   Jesus of Nazareth, who at Cana had turned water into wine and at
   Jerusalem had done many mighty works, he resorts to Him with eager
   petition and desperate hope.

   He might never have thought of seeking Jesus if it had not been for
   that dear dying boy. How often does it happen that children, though
   they are not angels, yet are used to do better work than angels could
   accomplish, for they sweetly

   lead their parents to God and Heaven! They twine themselves about our
   hearts and then, if we see them sicken and mark their pains, our
   sympathetic hearts are wrung with anguish and we cry, "O God, spare my
   child! Lord, have mercy upon my little one!" The first prayers that
   come from many hearts are, under God, fetched forth by grief for little
   ones most dearly loved. Is it not written, "And a little child shall
   lead them"? It was so with this man--he was brought to Jesus by
   trouble--brought to Jesus by anxiety about a child. I have it strongly
   upon me, at this moment, that I am speaking to certain persons who are
   not converted, but they have come here because they are in great
   sorrow--possibly a dear little one is pining away--and their hearts are
   crying to God that, if possible, the precious life may be spared. In
   the House of Prayer they feel somewhat comforted, but their hearts are
   ready to break because of the loss they so much dread. How much I pray
   our Lord to make this trouble a means of Grace!

   Trial was the occasion, the preface to the work of Divine Grace. We
   will now proceed to look upon the saving part of it, namely, the faith
   which was born in this nobleman's heart. We will first spy out the
   spark of faith; then the smoldering fire of faith--much heaped over and
   dampened, so as to be smoke rather than fire. Then, thirdly, we will
   look upon the flame offaith, or faith at last showing itself decidedly.
   And fourthly, the conflagration of faith, when faith, at last, blazed
   up in the man, fired his whole nature and spread to his whole
   house--"And he believed, and his whole house." Again, I say, let us try
   to follow in fact as well as in meditation.

   I. I want you carefully to mark THE SPARK OF FAITH, all the while
   saying--I am going to look and see if I have such a spark of faith. And
   if I find it, I will prize it much and pray the Holy Spirit to breathe
   softly upon it, that it may rise to something more permanent and
   powerful.

   The faith of this nobleman rested, at the first, entirely upon the
   report of others. He lived at Capernaum, down there by the sea. And
   among the newsmongers it was common talk that there had risen a great
   Prophet who was working great wonders. He himself had never seen Jesus,
   nor heard Him speak, but he believed the report of others and he was
   right in doing so, for they were credible persons. No doubt many were
   in the early stages of faith--they have heard friends say that the Lord
   Jesus receives sinners. That He puts away sin. that He calms the
   conscience. That He changes the nature; that He hears prayer; that He
   sustains His people under trouble. These things they have heard from
   persons of good repute, whom they esteem and, therefore, they believe
   them.

   Friend, are you saying to yourself, "I have no doubt it is all true,
   but I wonder whether it would be true for me. I am in trouble this
   morning--will the Lord Jesus help me? I have a present pressure upon my
   spirit--will prayer to Him relieve me?" You cannot say that you know,
   from anything you have ever seen of Him, that Jesus would thus bless
   you, but you infer that He will do so from what friends have told you.
   Well, faith often begins in that way. Men believe the report which is
   brought to them by well-known persons who have experienced the power of
   Divine Love and thus, at first, like the Samaritans, they believe
   because of the woman's report. In future time they will come to believe
   because of having heard, seen, tasted and handled for themselves, but
   the beginning is good. This faith which comes of a report by others is
   a spark of true fire. Take care of it! May God grant you Grace so to
   pray about it, that that spark may increase into a flame!

   Observe that this faith was such a little faith that it only concerned
   the healing of the sick child. The nobleman did not know that he needed
   healing in his own heart--he did not perceive his own ignorance of
   Jesus and his own blindness to the Messiah. He did not, perhaps, know
   that he needed to be born again. Neither did he understand that the
   Savior could give him spiritual life and light. He had little knowledge
   of the Savior's spiritual power and thus his faith had a very narrow
   range. What he did believe was that the Lord Jesus, if he would come to
   his house, could prevent his child from dying of the fever. He had
   reached as far as that--and such faith as he had, he turned to
   practical use at once. Friend, you do not as yet know how great my Lord
   is and what wonderful things He does for those who put their trust in
   Him. But you are saying, "Surely He could help me, this morning, in my
   present trial, and deliver me out of my present difficulty." So far, so
   good. Use what faith you have. Bring before the Lord the trial of the
   hour. Let me encourage you to do so. If you cannot come to Him for
   heavenly things, you may, for the present, begin with the sorrows and
   trials of earth.

   If you cannot come to Him for an eternal blessing, you may come to Him
   for a passing favor and He is ready to hear you. Though your prayer is
   only about worldly things and nothing more than a merely natural
   prayer, yet pray it, for, "He hears the young ravens when they cry,"
   and I am sure they do not pray spiritual prayers! All that ravens can
   ask for will be for worms and flies--and yet He hears them and feeds
   them! And you, a man, though you may but pray at this

   time for a very commonplace mercy--one of the slighter blessings--yet
   you may pray with confidence if you have any faith in the gracious
   Lord. Though that faith is only a spark and nothing more, I would not
   blow it out, nor will the Lord Jesus do so, for He has said that a
   smoking flax He will not quench. If you have any desire towards Him and
   any degree of faith in Him, let it live and lead you to the dear
   Master's feet!

   The nobleman's faith was so feeble that he limited the power of Jesus
   to His local Presence. Hence his prayer was, "Sir, come down before my
   child dies." If he could but induce the Lord Jesus to enter the room
   where the sick child lay, he believed that He would speak to the fever
   and the fever would be cured--but he had no idea that the Lord Jesus
   Christ could work at the distance of 25 miles! He had no notion that
   the Word of the Lord could operate apart from His Presence. Still, it
   was better to have that limited faith than to have none at all! You,
   children of God, when you get to limiting the Holy One of Israel, are
   guilty of gross sin! But if those who are seeking the Lord, through
   ignorance and weakness of faith, are found limiting Him, it is far more
   excusable in them. The Lord Jesus treats it graciously and removes it
   by a gentle rebuke. It is not the same thing for a beginner to be weak
   of faith as for you who have enjoyed long experience of God's goodness,
   to fall into mistrust of Him. Therefore I say to you, in whom the Lord
   is beginning to work, if you have no more faith than just to say, "The
   Lord Jesus could heal me if He were here--the Lord would help me and
   answer my cry if He were here"--it is better to have such a faith than
   to be unbelieving! Your narrow faith limits Him exceedingly and shuts
   Him up in a very close place and, therefore, you may not expect Him to
   do many mighty works for you-- and yet, up to the measure of your
   faith, He will go with you and bless you.

   As a matter of unpromised Sovereign Grace, He may even do exceeding
   abundantly above what you ask or even think. Therefore I would treat
   your faith like a little babe--I would nurse it until it can stand
   alone and hold out my finger to help it till its tottering steps become
   firm. We will not blame the babe because it cannot run or leap, but we
   will cherish it and urge it to greater strength--to which strength it
   will come in due time. Our Lord Jesus Christ deserves the largest faith
   from each one of us. Grieve Him not by suspicions of His ability! Give
   Him what faith you have and ask for more.

   The nobleman's faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, though it was only a
   spark, yet influenced him. It led him to take a considerable journey to
   find our Lord. From Capernaum he went up the hills to Cana that he
   might plead with Jesus. And he went personally. This is the more
   remarkable because he was a man of rank and position. I do not know
   whether he was Chuza, Herod's steward. I should not wonder if he were
   because we do not hear of any other noble family being on the side of
   Christ. But we do hear of the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, as among
   those that ministered to our Lord of their substance. We hear, also, of
   Manaen, foster-brother to Herod. It may have been one of these. We do
   not know, but noblemen were scarce birds in the Church in those days
   as, indeed, they are now! We naturally expect, therefore, to hear of
   such a person as this again. And as we have honorable mention of those
   two, we are not very rash in conjecturing that this nobleman may have
   been one of them.

   Now noblemen do not, as a rule, think of taking journeys themselves
   while they have so many servants at their disposal. But this nobleman
   came to Christ, himself, and personally sought Him that He would come
   and heal his son. If your faith is weak in some respects and yet strong
   enough in others to drive you personally to Christ, personally to pray
   to Him, it is faith of an acceptable order! If it leads you to pray to
   our Lord with all your heart, beseeching Him, then your faith is of the
   right sort. If it leads you to beseech Christ to have mercy upon you,
   it is the faith which saves the soul! It may be little as a grain of
   mustard seed, but its importunity shows that there is pungency in
   it--it is true mustard! Dear Sir, are you beginning to pray, at this
   time, because of sorrow? In the silence of your soul are you crying, "O
   God, save me today! I have come up to London to see other things and I
   have dropped in here, this morning--oh, that this may be the day in
   which I shall be helped out of my trouble and myself be saved"? If your
   faith brings you to prayer, it is the acknowledged child of Grace, for
   true-born faith always cries! Your faith helps you to lay hold of Jesus
   with a resolute grip, saying, "I will not let You go, except You bless
   me!" It may be little faith, but it is true faith. It is worked in your
   soul by the Spirit of God and it will bring a blessing with it. You
   shall be saved by this faith, to our Lord's Glory and to your own
   comfort!

   I notice that this man's faith taught him how to pray in the right
   style. Notice the argument he used. He sought Him that He would come
   down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. He urged no
   merit, but pleaded the misery of the case. He did not plead that the
   boy was of noble birth--that would have been very bad pleading with
   Jesus. Nor did

   he urge that he was a lovely child--that would have been a sorry
   argument. But he pleaded that he was at the point of death. His
   extremity was his reason for urgency. The child was at Death's door
   and, therefore, his father begs that Mercy's door may open. When you,
   my Friend, are taught by Grace to pray aright, you will urge those
   facts which reveal your own danger and distress--and not those which
   would make you appear rich and righteous. Remember how David prayed.
   "Lord," he said, "pardon my iniquity, for it is great." That is
   evangelical pleading. Most men would have said, "Lord, pardon my
   iniquity, for it was excusable and by no means reached to the
   heinousness of my fellow men." David knew better. His cry is, "Pardon
   my iniquity, for it is great." Plead with God, poor Sinner, the
   greatness of your necessity, the direness of your needs! Say that you
   are at the point of death. Say that the matter about which you plead is
   a matter of life and death--this will be an argument calculated to move
   the heart of Infinite Compassion.

   Any tint of goodness that your pride would tempt you to throw into the
   picture would spoil it. Lay on the black colors thick and three-fold.
   Plead with God for His mercy's sake, for mercy is the only attribute
   which you can hopefully address while you are an unforgiven sinner! You
   cannot ask the Lord to bless you because of any desert or merit you
   have, for you have no trace of any such thing! But you will be wise to
   plead your necessities. Cry, "O God, have mercy upon me, for I need
   mercy!" State your child's case and say, "For he is at the point of
   death." This is the key which opens the door of Mercy!

   Do you follow me, dear Hearers, you that are not yet converted? Is
   there, at any rate, in you some desire to come to the Lord Jesus
   Christ, though it is only because a temporal trouble is pressing you
   sorely? A horse does not need a dozen spurs to make it run. The one
   which now wounds your flank is sharp enough and it is plunged in so
   deep that you must feel it. Yield to it, lest there should be need of
   whip as well as spur to make you stir. If you are the Lord's chosen,
   you will have to come and the more readily you do so, the better will
   it be for you. Come at once! Be you not as the horse or as the mule
   which have no understanding--but come to Jesus while He gently draws.
   Though it is with such a feeble faith that you fear it is rather
   unbelief than faith, yet draw near to Him! Come just as you are and
   look up to Jesus and pray--for in that prayer shall lie the hope, no,
   the certainty of relief! The great heart of Jesus will feel your prayer
   and say, "Go in peace."

   II. Thus have we seen faith in the spark. We will now look at THE FIRE
   OF FAITH struggling to maintain itself and gradually increasing. Let us
   see how the fire smolders, the heap begins to smoke and thus betrays
   the inner fire.

   This man's faith was true as far as it went. That is a great thing to
   say. He stood before the Savior resolved not to go away from Him. His
   only hope for his child's life was in this great Prophet of Nazareth
   and, therefore, he did not intend to leave Him till his request was
   granted. He does not, at first, get the answer that he wants, but he
   perseveres and pleads on. This showed that his faith had heart and
   vitality in it. It was no whim or sudden impulse, but a real persuasion
   of the power of Jesus to heal. What a mercy it is to be delivered from
   all sham faith! Better to have little faith and that faith real, than
   to possess a great creed and give the Lord Jesus no hearty credit! Tell
   me, my Hearer, have you any real practical faith in the Lord Jesus?

   The nobleman's faith was true as far as it went--but it was hindered by
   a desire for signs and wonders. Our Lord, therefore, gently chided him,
   saying, "Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe." Now I
   know that many of you believe that the Lord Jesus can save, but you
   have fixed in your mind the way in which He must do it. You have been
   reading certain religious biographies and you find that such a man was
   driven to despair, had horrible thoughts and so on--therefore you
   settle it in your minds that you must have similar horrors or you will
   be lost. You lay it down as a program that you must be saved in that
   way, or not at all. Is this right? Is this wise? Do you mean to dictate
   to the Lord?

   Perhaps you have read or heard that certain eminent persons were
   converted through amazing dreams, or by remarkable movements of
   Providence and you say to yourself, "Something equally singular must
   happen to me, or I will not believe in the Lord Jesus." In this you err
   like the nobleman! He expected the Savior to come down to the house and
   perform some act peculiar to His prophetic office! In fact, this
   nobleman is the New Testament reproduction of Naaman in the Old
   Testament! You remember how Naaman said, "Behold, I thought he would
   surely come out to me and stand, and call on the Lord, His God, and
   strike his hand over the place and recover the leper"?

   Naaman had planned it all in his own mind and had, no doubt, arranged a
   very proper and artistic performance! And, therefore, when the Prophet
   simply said, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times," he could not
   receive so simple and bald a Gospel--it was too commonplace, too free
   from ritual! Many persons, by their mental prejudices, would bind

   the Lord of Mercy to such and such a way of saving them! But our Lord
   will not be thus laid under constraint! Why should He? He will save
   whom He wills and He will save as He wills. His Gospel is not, "Suffer
   so much horror and despair, and live," but, "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and you shall be saved." He comes to many and calls them
   effectually by the soft whispers of His love--they do but trust Him and
   they enter into immediate rest. With little striking feeling, either
   horrible, or ecstatic, they quietly exercise a child-like confidence in
   their Crucified Lord and they find eternal life! Why should it not be
   so with you? Why should you keep yourself out of comfort by laying down
   a program and demanding that the Holy Spirit should pay attention to
   it? Let Him save you as He wills! Away with foolish prejudices!

   Yet this is to be said of the nobleman's faith--it could endure a
   rebuff. Think of the Master only saying to this poor anguished father,
   "Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe." It was sadly
   true, but it sounded honestly sharp. Oh, the dear lips of Jesus! They
   are always like lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh! Myrrh, you know,
   is bitter to the taste and there was a seeming bitterness about this
   speech to the nobleman. Yet the father did not give up his suit and
   turn on his heels and say, "He treats me harshly." He said within
   himself, "to whom should I go?" and, therefore, he went not away. He
   was like that woman for whom the Lord's lips dropped a far more pungent
   morsel of myrrh, as He said, "It is not meet to take the children's
   bread, and to cast it to dogs." Yet she found a sweet smell in that
   myrrh and perfumed her prayer with it as she said, "Truth, Lord, yet
   the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." This
   man answered our Lord by still greater importunity. He would not go
   away, not he! Oh, dear Heart, may you have such faith in Christ that
   though He should rebuke you, you will not leave Him! Jesus is your only
   hope, therefore do not turn away from Him. Imitate Bunyan when he spoke
   words to this effect--"I was driven to such straits that I must of
   necessity go to Jesus. And if He had met me with a drawn sword in His
   hand, I would sooner have thrown myself upon the edge of His sword than
   have gone away from Him, for I knew Him to be my last hope." O Soul,
   cling to your Lord, come what may!

   Then see how passionately this man pleaded. He cried, "Sir, come down
   before my child dies." As much as if he had said, "Lord, do not
   question me just now about my faith. O my Lord, I pray you do not think
   of me at all, but heal my dear child, or he will be dead! He was at the
   point of death when I left him: do hurry down and save him." Limited
   was that faith, for he still asks Christ to come down and seems to
   think it essential that our Lord should make a journey to Capernaum to
   work the cure. But note how intense, how eager, how persevering was his
   pleading! If His faith failed in breadth, it excelled in force! Dear
   anxious Friend, keep close to the example now before us! Pray and pray
   again! Hold on and hold out! Cry on and cry out! Never cease till the
   Lord of Love grants you an answer of peace.

   III. We come to a higher stage and watch THE FLAME OF FAITH. The spark
   increased as a smoldering fire and now the fire reveals itself in
   flame. Observe that Jesus said to the petitioner, "Go your way, your
   son lives." And the man truly believed--and went his way.

   Here note that he believed the Words of Jesus over the head of all his
   former prejudices. He had thought only that Christ could heal if He
   came down to Capernaum, but now He believes, though Jesus remains where
   He is and only speaks the Words. Friend, will you, at this moment,
   believe the Lord Jesus Christ on His bare Word? Without laying down any
   rules as to how He will save you, will you trust Him? You have
   prescribed dark convictions, or vivid dreams, or strange
   sensations--will you cease from such folly? Will you believe in Jesus
   Christ as He is revealed in the Scriptures? Will you believe that He
   can and will save you right now upon your simple trust? Have you not
   heard of His passion and death upon the Cross for the guilty? Have you
   not heard it said that all manner of sin and of iniquity shall be
   forgiven unto men if they believe in Him? Do you not know that he that
   believes in Him has everlasting life? Will you have done with your
   nonsense about, "Come down and save me," or, "Make me feel this and I
   will believe You"? Will you believe in Him, now, despite all your
   former thoughts, pretensions and desires--and just say, "I will trust
   my soul with Christ, believing that He can save me"? You shall be saved
   as surely as you do thus trust!

   The next thing this man did to prove the sincerity of his faith was
   that he at once obeyed Christ. Jesus said to him, "Go your way," that
   is, "Go home"--"your son lives." If the man had not believed the Words,
   he would have lingered there and kept on pleading and looking for
   favorable signs. But as he has believed, he is satisfied with the Word
   of the Lord and goes his way without another word. "Your son lives" is
   enough for him! Many of you have said, when you have heard the Gospel
   preached, "you tell us to believe in Christ, but we will continue in
   prayer." That is not what the Gospel

   commends you. Do I hear you say, "I shall continue to read my Bible and
   attend the means of Grace"? That is not the precept of the Savior. Are
   you not satisfied with His Word? Will you not take that Word and go
   your way? If you believe in Him, you will go your way in peace--you
   will believe that He has saved you and act as if you knew it to be
   true. You will joy and rejoice in the fact that you are saved. You will
   not stop to quibble and to question, or to follow after all kinds of
   religious experiences and feelings but you will exclaim, "He tells me
   to believe Him and I believe Him. He says, 'He that believes on Me has
   everlasting life' and I do believe in Him and, therefore, I have
   everlasting life! I may not feel any peculiar emotion, but I have
   eternal life! Whether I see my salvation or not, I am saved! It is
   written, 'Look unto Me, and be you saved, all you ends of the earth.'
   Lord, I have looked and I am saved. My reason for believing it is that
   You have said it. I have done as You have bid me and You will keep Your
   promise." This mode of reasoning is due to the Lord Jesus. He deserves
   to be taken at His Word and trusted in real earnest.

   Now, the nobleman's faith has flamed up, indeed. He believes not upon
   mere report, but upon the Word of Jesus. He does not wait for a sign,
   but he hears the Word and on that Word he hangs his confidence. Jesus
   said, "Your son lives; go your way"--and he goes his way that he may
   find his son alive! O seeking Soul, may God, the Holy Spirit, bring you
   to this state at once, that you may now say, "O Lord, I will wait no
   longer for any sort of feeling, or evidence, or sign, but on Your Word,
   Your blood has sealed, I will trust my everlasting all, for I do now
   accept Your promise and since I believe it, I will go my way in peace."

   Still, I am bound to say, concerning this man's faith at this stage,
   that it still fell somewhat short of what it might have been. It was a
   great thing for him to have come so far, but he had farther yet to go.
   He expected less than he might have expected and, therefore, when he
   saw his servants, he asked them when the dear child began to mend. He
   was overjoyed when they virtually said, "He never did begin to mend.
   The fever left him all at once; at the seventh hour he recovered." You
   see, he expected a gradual restoration. He looked for the ordinary
   course of Nature, but here was a miraculous work! He received far more
   than he reckoned on. How little we know of Christ and how little we
   believe in Him, even when we do trust Him! We measure His boundless
   treasure by our scanty purses. Yet the faith that saves is not always
   full-grown--there is room for us to believe more and to expect more of
   our blessed Lord. Oh, that we would do so!

   But one thing I want to mention here, though I do not quite understand
   it--perhaps you can make it out. The father traveled with the leisure
   of confidence. It was about 25 or 30 miles to Capernaum and I have no
   doubt the good man started off as soon as the Master said, "Go your
   way." No doubt he would go at once in obedience to such a command and
   make progress on the road home. But we read that the servants met him.
   Did they start as soon as the child was cured? If so, they might meet
   him half-way, or thereabouts. It was uphill. Say, therefore, that they
   came 10 miles and that 15, or even 20, remained for the nobleman to
   travel. The servants said, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
   left him." The seventh hour was about one o'clock in the day and that
   day was "yesterday." I know that the day closed at set of sun, yet one
   would hardly talk of "yesterday" without a night between.

   Did the nobleman take 15 or 16 hours for that partial journey? If so,
   he did not travel with any excessive speed. It is true that 25 miles
   was a good day's journey for a camel, for in the East the roads are
   very bad, but still, it seems to me that the happy father moved with
   the ease of a Believer rather than with the hurry of an anxious parent!
   A nobleman's usual progress through the villages was slow and he did
   not alter the usual pace because he would not even seem to hurry, now
   that his mind was believingly at rest. He felt quite sure that his son
   was all right and, therefore, the fever of anxiety left the father,
   even as the fever had left his child! Anxious minds, even when they
   believe, are in a hurry to see--but this good man was so sure, he would
   not allow parental love to make him act as if the shadow of a doubt
   remained! It is written, "He that believes shall not make haste" and in
   him it was literally fulfilled!

   He journeyed on in such style as a member of the royal household would
   be expected to travel, accompanied by a fitting retinue, and thus all
   saw that his mind was at ease about his son. I like this consecrated
   restfulness. It befits a solid faith. I want you all, when you believe
   in Jesus Christ, to believe right up to the hilt. Give Him not a half
   faith, but a whole faith--whether about a child, or about
   yourself--believe in earnest. Say, "'Let God be true, but every man a
   liar.' On His bare Word, my soul reposes. I will 'rest in the Lord and
   wait patiently for Him.' What, though no amazing joys flash through my
   spirit? God has said, 'He that believes on Me has everlasting life'
   and, therefore, I have everlasting life! What if I do not rise up and
   dance for joy? Yet will I sit still and sing within my soul because God
   has visited His believing servant. I will wait until high joys shall
   come to me, but meanwhile I will trust and not be afraid."

   Dear Hearer, are you accompanying me in all this? Are you ready, in
   this manner, to exercise a substantial, restful confidence in Jesus?

   IV. So far, the nobleman's faith has grown, but now we shall see it
   become THE CONFLAGRATION OF FAITH. As he went home, his servants met
   him with good news. In the quietude of his faith, he was exceedingly
   delighted when they said, "Your son lives." The message came upon him
   like the echo of the Words of Jesus. "I heard that," he said,
   "yesterday, at the seventh hour, for then Jesus said, 'Your son lives.'
   Another day has come and, behold, my servants salute me with the same
   words, 'Your son lives.'" The repetition must have astonished him! I
   often notice about the preaching of the Word of God, how the sentences
   strike you as to their very words when God blesses them. People say to
   me, "You said, Sir, the same thing that we were talking of when we were
   on the road--you described our cases even to our thoughts and you
   mentioned certain expressions which had been used in our
   conversation--surely God was speaking through you." Yes, it is often
   so. Christ's own Words find many echoes from the mouths of His
   commissioned servants. The Lord's Providence rules words as well as
   deeds and makes men say the right words without their knowing why they
   say them! God is so graciously Omnipresent that all things reveal Him
   when they are bid to do so.

   Now the nobleman's faith is confirmed by the answer to his prayers. His
   experience has come in to the aid of his faith. He believes in a more
   assured sense than he did before. He has proven the truth of the Lord's
   Words and, therefore, he knows and is persuaded that He is Lord and
   God. The faith of a sinner coming to Christ is one thing. The faith of
   a man who has come to Christ and has obtained the blessing is another
   and stronger matter! The first faith, the simpler faith, is that which
   saves, but the further faith is that which brings comfort, joy and
   strength into the spirit.

   "My prayer is heard," he said and then he spoke to the servants, and
   after enquiry his faith was sustained by each detail. He cried, "Tell
   me all about it: when was it?" When they replied, "At the seventh hour
   the fever left him," he remembered that at that very moment, when over
   there above the hills at Cana, the Lord Jesus Christ had said, "Go your
   way; your son lives." The more he studied the case, the more wonderful
   it became! The details were singularly confirmatory of his confidence
   and, by their means, he rose to a clearer and firmer faith. Brothers
   and Sisters, how many such confirmations some of us have had! Doubters
   attempt to argue with us about the simplicities of the Gospel and they
   want to fight with us upon their own ground of mere speculative
   reasoning. Dear Sir, this is hardly fair to us! Our own ground is of
   quite another kind! We are not strangers to the business of faith, but
   adepts in it--and you ought to allow something for our personal
   experience of the faithfulness of the Lord our God!

   We have a thousand treasured memories of happy details which we cannot
   tell you. We do not call you swine, but at the same time we dare not
   throw our pearls before you! We have a host of things laid by, but we
   cannot repeat them, for to us they are too sacred--thus we are not able
   to use those reasons which to our own hearts are the most convincing!
   We have other arguments than those which we choose to bandy in open
   court. Be not surprised if we seem obstinate--you do not know how
   intensely sure we are. You cannot argue us out of our secret
   consciousness--you might as well try to argue our eyes out of their
   sockets! We know and are sure, for we have seen, heard, tasted and
   handled of the good Word of the Lord. Certain things are so
   intertwisted with our lives that we are anchored by them.
   "Coincidences," you say. Ah well! Say what you please--to us they are
   other than to you! Our soul has cried out, time after time, "This O
   Sir, this seems a very cold-blooded remark!"

   If you had been where I have been and experienced what I have
   experienced, you would acknowledge that the Lord stretched out His hand
   and saved His servant! You would have the same solemn conviction as I
   have that God was there, working out salvation. I know that I cannot
   create those convictions in you by telling you my story. If you are
   determined not to believe, you will not accept my testimony, but will
   think me a deluded person, though I am no more apt to be deluded than
   you are. However, whether you are inclined to believe or to disbelieve,
   I am in no such hesitation. I am forced to believe, for the more
   carefully I examine my life, the more I am convinced that God must have
   been at work with me and for me.

   At the same moment that Christ said, "Your son lives," the nobleman's
   son did live! The same word that Jesus used to the father was used,
   also, by the servants who had been 30 miles away and, therefore, the
   father felt that something more than human had crossed his path. Do you
   wonder at it? Besides, that dear boy, whom he found sound and well, was
   a potent argument. You could not argue the happy father out of a faith
   which had brought him such joy. The child was

   at the point of death till faith received the Words of the Lord
   Jesus--and then the fever left. The father must believe-- would you
   have him doubt?

   Strengthened in his faith by his experience, after having believed the
   bare Words of Jesus, the good man now sees that Word fulfilled and he
   believes in Jesus in the fullest sense. He believes for everything--for
   his body and for his soul--for all that he is and for all that he has.
   From that day forth he becomes a disciple of the Lord Jesus! He follows
   Him, not only as a Healer, nor only as a Prophet, nor only as a Savior,
   but as his Lord and his God! His hope, his trust and his confidence are
   fixed upon Jesus as the true Messiah.

   What follows is so natural and yet so joyous, that I pray it may be
   true to all of you--his family also believe! When he gets home, his
   wife meets him. Oh, the delight that sparkles in that woman's eyes!
   "The dear boy is well," she said, "He is as well as ever he was in his
   life. He did not need to lie in bed for weeks to recover his strength
   after the weakening influence of the fever! The fever is all gone and
   the boy is well. Oh, my dear Husband, what a wonderful Being this must
   be who has heard your prayers and at all that distance has spoken our
   child into health! I believe in Him, Husband. I believe in Him." I am
   sure she would speak in that fashion! The same processes which had been
   working in her husband had been working in her by God's Grace!

   Now, think of the little boy. Here he comes, so happy and cheerful. And
   his father tells him all about his fever and his going to see that
   wonderful Prophet at Cana, and how He said, "Your son lives." The
   little boy cries, "Father, I believe in Jesus! He is the Son of God."
   Nobody doubts the dear child's faith--he was not too young to be healed
   and he is not too young to believe! He had enjoyed a special
   experience, more personal than even that of his father and mother. He
   had felt the power of Jesus--and it was no marvel that he believed.
   Meanwhile, the father is rejoicing to find that he will not be a
   solitary Believer, for there are his wife and boy also confessing their
   faith. But we are not at the end of the matter, for the servants
   standing around exclaim, "Master, we cannot help believing in Jesus,
   also, for we watched the dear child and saw him recover, and the power
   which healed him must have been Divine."

   One and all, by His Grace, they emulate their master's faith in Jesus.
   "I sat up with the dear boy," says the old nurse. "I would not go to
   sleep, for I felt that if I did sleep, I might find him dead when I
   awoke. I watched him and just at the seventh hour I saw a delightful
   change come over him and the fever left him." "Glory be to Jesus!"
   shouted the old woman, "I never saw or heard of such a thing! It is the
   finger of God." All the other servants were of the same mind. Happy
   household! There was a grand Baptism soon after, when they all went to
   confess their faith in Jesus. Not only was the child cured, but the
   whole household was cured! The father did not know, when he went
   pleading about his boy, that he, himself, needed to be saved--the
   mother, also, probably thought only of her son--but now salvation has
   come to the whole family and the fever of sin and unbelief is gone away
   with the other fever!

   May the Lord work such a wonder as that in all our houses! If any of
   you are groaning under a burden of grief, I trust you will be so
   relieved that when you tell your wife of it, she will believe in Jesus,
   too. May the dear child of your care believe in Jesus while yet a
   child--and may all who belong to your domestic circle also belong to
   the Divine Lord! Grant, at this time, Your servant's desire, O Lord
   Jesus, for Your Glory's sake! Amen.

The Sunday School and the Scriptures

   (No. 1866)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 18, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are
   able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
   Jesus." 2 Timothy 3:15.

   HOW very remarkably the times repeat themselves! As I said just now, in
   the reading of the chapter, the warning which Paul gave concerning his
   own times is quite as necessary for this present age. Again darkness
   thickens and the mists hang heavily around our footsteps. Evil men and
   seducers wax worse and worse and very many have turned away their ears
   from the Truth of God to listen to fables. Nor do we wonder that it is
   so. History must repeat itself so long as we have the same human nature
   to deal with, the same sins to ensnare mankind, the same Truth to be
   trifled with and the same devil to stir men up to the same mischief.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, when the same evils come, we must apply to
   them the same remedies. When a disease appears which has done deadly
   mischief in past times, physicians inquire for medicines which, on a
   former occasion, curbed the enemy. We are bound to do the same in
   spiritual matters. We must see what Paul did in his day when the
   malaria of false doctrine was in the air. It is remarkable how very
   simple, as a rule, everything is that is really effective. If a
   discovery is made in science or machinery, it is complicated, at first,
   and that for the very reason that it is imperfect. But all improvements
   are in the direction of simplicity. It is just the same with spiritual
   teachings. When we get at reality, we cut off superfluity. Let us not
   talk of inventing wise measures for the present distress in the
   spiritual world, but let us use the great remedy which was so effectual
   in Paul's day! Paul, himself, taught young Timothy the Gospel--he made
   him not only hear his doctrine, but see his practice. We cannot force
   the Truth of God upon men, but we can make our own teaching clear and
   decided--and make our lives consistent therewith. Truth and holiness
   are the surest antidotes to error and unrighteousness. The Apostle said
   to Timothy, "Continue in the things which you have learned and have
   been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them."

   He then dwelt upon another potent remedy which had been of great
   service to the young preacher, namely, the knowing of the Holy
   Scriptures from his earliest childhood. This was, to young Timothy, one
   of his best safeguards. His early training held him like an anchor and
   saved him from the dreadful drift of the age. Happy young man, of whom
   the Apostle could say, "From childhood you have known the Holy
   Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through
   faith which is in Christ Jesus!"

   Brothers and Sisters, to be prepared for the coming conflict, we have
   only to preach the Gospel and to live the Gospel--and also to take care
   that we teach the children the Word of the Lord! This last is
   especially to be attended to, for it is by the mouth of babes and
   sucklings that God will still the enemy. It is idle to dream that human
   learning must be met by human learning, or that Satan must cast out
   Satan. No! Lift up the bronze serpent wherever the fiery serpents are
   biting the people and men shall look to it and live. Bring the children
   out and hold them up--and turn their little eyes towards the divinely
   ordained remedy, for still there is life in a look--life as against the
   varied venoms of the serpent which are now poisoning the blood of men!
   There is no cure, after all, for midnight but the rising sun. No hope
   remains for a dark world but in that Light of God which lightens every
   man. Shine forth, O Sun of Righteousness, and mist, cloud and darkness
   must disappear. Brothers, keep to the Apostolic plans and rest assured
   of Apostolic success! Preach Christ! Preach the Word in season and out
   of season--and teach the children. One of God's chief methods for
   preserving His fields from tares is to sow them early with wheat. Upon
   that I am going to speak, this morning, as the Holy Spirit shall help
   me.

   In tracing the gracious work of God upon the heart of Timothy and upon
   others who are favored as he was, I shall notice that this work
   commenced with early instruction--"From childhood you have known the
   Holy Scriptures." And secondly, it was quickened and made effectual by
   saving faith--"The Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise unto
   salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." Then we shall notice
   that the effect of this early teaching upon Timothy was that it created
   a solid character and, furthermore, that it produced great usefulness.

   I. The work of God's Grace in Timothy COMMENCED WITH EARLY
   INSTRUCTION--"From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures."

   Note the time for instruction. The expression, "from childhood," might
   be better understood if we read it, "from a very child" or, as the
   Revised Version has it, "from a babe." It does not mean a well-grown
   child, or youth, but a child just rising out of infancy. From a very
   child Timothy had known the sacred writings. This expression is, no
   doubt, used to show that we cannot begin too early to imbue the minds
   of our children with Scriptural knowledge. Babes receive impressions
   long before we are aware of the fact. During the first months of a
   child's life, it learns more than we imagine. It soon learns the love
   of its mother and its own dependence--and if the mother is wise, it
   learns the meaning of obedience and the necessity of yielding its will
   to a higher will. This may be the keynote of its whole future life. If
   it learns obedience and submission early, it may save a thousand tears
   from the child's eyes and as many from the mother's heart. A special
   vantage ground is lost when even babyhood is left uncultured.

   The Holy Scripture may be learned by children as soon as they are
   capable of understanding anything. It is a very remarkable fact which I
   have heard asserted by many teachers, that children will learn to read
   out of the Bible better than from any other book. I scarcely know why.
   It may, perhaps, be on account of the simplicity of the language--and I
   believe it is so. A Biblical fact will often be grasped when an
   incident of common history is forgotten. There is an adaptation in the
   Bible for human beings of all ages and, therefore, it has a fitness for
   children. We make a mistake when we think that we must begin with
   something else and lead up to the Scriptures. The Bible is the book for
   the peep of day. Parts of it are above a child's mind, for they are
   above the comprehension of the most advanced among us. There are depths
   in it where leviathan may swim--but there are also brooks in which a
   lamb may wade. Wise teachers know how to lead their little ones into
   the green pastures beside the still waters.

   I was noticing, in the life of that man of God whose loss presses very
   heavily upon many of our hearts, namely, the Earl of Shaftesbury, that
   his first religious impressions were produced by a humble woman. The
   impressions which made him Shaftesbury, the man of God and the friend
   of man, were received in the nursery! Little Lord Ashley had a godly
   nurse who spoke to him of the things of God. He tells us that she died
   before he was seven years of age--clear proof that early in life his
   heart had been able to receive the seal of the Spirit of God--and to
   receive it by humble instrumentality. Blessed among women was she whose
   name we know not, but who worked incalculable service for God and man
   by her holy teaching of the chosen child! Young nurses, note this.

   Give us the first seven years of a child, with God's Grace, and we may
   defy the world, the flesh and the devil to ruin that immortal soul!
   Those first years, while yet the clay is soft and plastic, go far to
   decide the form of the vessel. Do not say that your office, you who
   teach the young, is in the least degree inferior to ours, whose main
   business is with older folks. No, you have the first of them and your
   impressions, as they come first, will endure last--oh that they may be
   good and only good! Among the thoughts that come to an old man before
   he enters Heaven, the most plentiful are those that before visited him
   when he sat upon his mother's knee. That which made Dr. Guthrie ask for
   a "bairn's hymn" when he was dying is but an instinct of our nature
   which leads us to complete the circle by folding together the ends of
   life. Childlike things are dearest to old age! We shuffle off a portion
   of the coil that surrounds and hampers us and go back, again, to our
   more natural selves and, therefore, the old songs are on our lips and
   the old thoughts are in our minds! The teachings of our childhood leave
   clean cut and sharp impressions upon the mind which remain after 70
   years have passed. Let us see that such impressions are made for the
   highest ends.

   It is well to note the admirable selection of instructors. We are not
   at a loss to tell who instructed youthful Timothy. In the first chapter
   of this Epistle, Paul says, "When I call to remembrance the unfeigned
   faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and
   your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you, also." No doubt
   grandmother Lois and mother Eunice united in teaching the little one.
   Who should teach the children but the parents? Timothy's father was a
   Greek and probably a heathen, but his child was happy in having a
   venerable grandmother, so often the dear-

   est of all relatives to a little child. He had also a gracious mother,
   once a devout Jewess and afterwards, also, a firmly believing Christian
   who made it her daily pleasure to teach her own dear child the Word of
   the Lord.

   O dear mothers, you have a very sacred trust reposed in you by God! He
   has, in effect, said to you, "Take this child and nurse it for Me and I
   will give you your wages." You are called to equip the future man of
   God, that he may be thoroughly furnished unto every good work. If God
   spares you, you may live to hear that pretty boy speak to thousands and
   you will have the sweet reflection in your heart that the quiet
   teachings of the nursery led the man to love his God and serve Him!
   Those who think that a woman detained at home by her little family is
   doing nothing, think the reverse of what is true! Scarcely can the
   godly mother quit her home for a place of worship, but dream not that
   she is lost to the work of the Church--far from it--she is doing the
   best possible service for her Lord! Mothers, the godly training of your
   offspring is your first and most pressing duty! Christian women, by
   teaching children the Holy Scriptures, are as much fulfilling their
   part for the Lord as Moses in judging Israel, or Solomon in building
   the Temple!

   Nowadays, since the world has in it, alas, so few of Christian mothers
   and grandmothers, the Church has thought it wise to supplement the
   instruction of home by teaching held under her fostering wing. Those
   children who have no such parents, the Church takes under her maternal
   care. I regard this as a very blessed institution. I am thankful for
   the many of our Brothers and Sisters who give their Sabbaths--and many
   of them a considerable part of their week evenings, also--to the
   teaching of other people's children who somehow grow to be very much
   their own. They endeavor to perform the duties of fathers and mothers,
   for God's sake, to those children who are neglected by their own
   parents--and therein they do well. Let no Christian parents fall into
   the delusion that the Sunday school is intended to ease them of their
   personal duties. The first and most natural condition of things is for
   Christian parents to train up their own children in the nurture and
   admonition of the Lord.

   Let holy grandmother's and gracious mothers, with their husbands, see
   to it that their own boys and girls are well taught in the Book of the
   Lord. Where there are no such Christian parents, it is well and wisely
   done for godly people to intervene. It is a Christly work when others
   undertake the duty which the natural doers of it have left undone. The
   Lord Jesus looks with pleasure upon those who feed His lambs and nurse
   His babes, for it is not His will that any of these little ones should
   perish. Timothy had the great privilege of being taught by those whose
   natural duty it is, but where that great privilege cannot be enjoyed,
   let us all, as God shall help us, try to make up to the children the
   terrible loss which they endure. Come forward, earnest men and women,
   and sanctify yourselves for this joyful service!

   Note the subject of the instruction. "From childhood you have known the
   Holy Scriptures"--he was led to treat the Book of God with great
   reverence. I lay stress upon those two words, "Holy Scriptures." One of
   the first objects of the Sunday school should be to teach the children
   great reverence for these holy writings, these Inspired Scriptures. The
   Jews esteemed the Old Testament beyond all price and though,
   unfortunately, many of them fell into a superstitious reverence for the
   letter and lost the spirit of it, yet were they much to be commended
   for their profound regard to the Holy Oracles. Especially is this
   feeling of reverence needed nowadays. I meet with men who hold strange
   views, but I do not care one-half so much about their views, nor about
   the strangeness of them, as I do about a certain something which I spy
   out at the back of this novel thinking. When I find that, if I prove
   their views to be unscriptural, I have, nevertheless, proved nothing to
   them, for they do not care about Scripture--then I have found out a
   principle far more dangerous than mere doctrinal blundering!

   This indifference to Scripture is the great curse of the Church at this
   hour! We can be tolerant of divergent opinions, so long as we perceive
   an honest intent to follow the Statute Book. But if it comes to this,
   that the Bible, itself, is of small authority to you, then we have no
   need of further parley--we are in different camps and the sooner we
   recognize this, the better for all parties concerned. If we are to have
   a Church of God at all in the land, Scripture must be regarded as holy
   and to be had in reverence. This Scripture was given by Holy
   Inspiration and is not the result of dim myths and dubious traditions!
   Neither has it drifted down to us by the survival of the fittest as one
   of the best of human books. It must be given to my children and
   accepted by ourselves as the Infallible Revelation of the Most Holy
   God! Lay much stress upon this--tell your children that the Word of the
   Lord is a pure Word, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified
   seven times. Let their esteem for the Book of God be carried to the
   highest point!

   Observe that Timothy was taught not only to reverence holy things in
   general, but especially to know the Scriptures. The teaching of his
   mother and his grandmother was the teaching of Holy Scripture. Suppose
   we get the children to-

   gether on the Sabbath and then amuse them and make the hours to pass
   away pleasantly? Or instruct them, as we do in the weekdays, in the
   elements of a moral education--what have we done? We have done nothing
   worthy of the day, or of the Church of God! Suppose that we are
   particularly careful to teach the children the rules and regulations of
   our own Church and do not take them to the Scriptures? Suppose that we
   bring before them a book which is set up as the standard of our Church
   but do not dwell upon the Bible--what have we done? The aforesaid
   standard may or may not be correct and we may, therefore, have taught
   our children the Truth of God or have taught them error! But if we keep
   to Holy Scripture, we cannot go aside. With such a Standard we know
   that we are right. This Book is the Word of God and if we teach it, we
   teach that which the Lord will accept and bless.

   O dear teachers--and I speak here to myself, also--let our teaching be
   more and more Scriptural! Fret not if our classes forget what we say,
   but pray them to remember what the Lord says. May Divine Truths about
   sin, righteousness and judgement to come be written on their hearts!
   May revealed Truths of God concerning the love of God, the Grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit never be forgotten by
   them! May they know the virtue and necessity of the atoning blood of
   our Lord, the power of His Resurrection and the Glory of His Second
   Coming! May the Doctrines of Grace be engraved as with a pen of iron
   upon their minds and written as with the point of a diamond upon their
   hearts--never to be erased! Brothers and Sisters, if we can secure
   this, we have not lived in vain. The generation now ruling seems bent
   on departing from the eternal Truths of God, but we shall not despair
   if the Gospel is impressed upon the memory of the rising race.

   Once more upon this point--it appears that young Timothy was so taught
   as a child that the teaching was effectual. "You have known the Holy
   Scriptures," says Paul. It is a good deal to say of a child that he has
   "known the Holy Scriptures." You may say, "I have taught the children
   the Scriptures," but that they have known them is quite another thing.
   Do all of you who are grown up, know the Scriptures? I fear that
   although knowledge in general increases, knowledge of the Scriptures is
   far too rare! If we were now to hold an examination, I am afraid that
   some of you would hardly shine in the lists at the end. But here was a
   little child who knew the Holy Scriptures! That is to say, he had a
   remarkable acquaintance with them. Children can get that--it is by no
   means an impossible attainment. God blessing your efforts, dear
   Friends, your children may know all of Scripture that is necessary to
   their salvation. They may have as true an idea of sin as their mother
   has. They may have as clear a view of the Atonement as their
   grandmother can have. They may have as distinct a faith in Jesus as any
   of us can have!

   The things that make for our peace require no length of experience to
   prepare us for receiving them--they are among the simplicities of
   thought. He may run that reads them--and a child may read them as soon
   as he can run! The opinion that children cannot receive the whole Truth
   of the Gospel is a great mistake, for their child-condition is a help
   rather than a hindrance! Older folk must become as little children
   before they can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Do lay a good groundwork
   with the children. Let not Sunday school work be slurred, nor done in a
   slovenly manner. Let the children know the Holy Scripture! Let the
   Scriptures be consulted rather than any human book.

   II. Our second need was to be that this work was QUICKENED BY SAVING
   FAITH. The Scriptures do not save, but they are able to make a man wise
   unto salvation. Children may know the Scriptures and yet not be
   children of God. Faith in Jesus Christ is that Grace which brings
   immediate salvation. Many dear children are called of God so early that
   they cannot precisely tell when they were converted--but they were
   converted--they must, at some time or other, have passed from death to
   life. You could not have told this morning, by observation, the moment
   when the sun rose, but it did rise--and there was a time when it was
   below the horizon and another time when it had risen above it. The
   moment, whether we see it or not, in which a child is really saved, is
   when he or she believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. Perhaps for years
   Lois and Eunice had been teaching the Old Testament to Timothy while
   they, themselves, did not know the Lord Jesus. And, if so, they were
   teaching him the type without the antitype--the riddles without the
   answers--but it was good teaching, for all that, since it was all the
   Truth of God which they then knew.

   How much happier, however, is our task, since we are able to teach
   concerning the Lord Jesus so plainly, having the New Testament to
   explain the Old! May we not hope that even earlier in life than
   Timothy, our dear children may catch the thought that Christ Jesus is
   the Sum and Substance of Holy Scripture and, so, by faith in Him may
   receive power to become the sons of God? I mention this, simple as it
   is, because I want all teachers to feel that if their children do not
   as yet know all the doctrines of the Bible and if there are certain
   higher or deeper Truths of God which their minds have not

   yet grasped, still, children are saved as soon as they are wise unto
   salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus! Faith in the Lord
   Jesus, as He is set forth in Scripture, will surely save. "If you
   believe with all your heart, you may," said Philip to the eunuch--and
   we say the same to every child--you may confess your faith if you have
   any true faith in Jesus to confess. If you believe that Jesus is the
   Christ and so put your trust in Him, you are as truly saved as though
   gray hairs adorned your brow.

   Notice that by this faith in Christ Jesus, we continue and advance in
   salvation. The moment we believe in Christ we are saved, but we are not
   at once as wise as we may be and hope to be. We may be, as it were,
   saved unintelligently. I mean, of course, comparatively so, but it is
   desirable that we should be able to give a reason for the hope that is
   in us and so be wise unto salvation. By faith, children become little
   disciples and, by faith, they go on to become more proficient. How are
   we to go on to wisdom? Not by quitting the way of faith, but by keeping
   to that same faith in Christ Jesus by which we began to learn. In the
   school of Grace, faith is the great faculty by which we make advances
   in wisdom. If by faith you have been able to say A, B and C, it must be
   by faith that you shall go on to say D, E and F, until you shall come
   to the end of the alphabet and be an expert in the Book of Wisdom. If
   by faith you can read in the spelling book of simple faith, by the same
   faith in Christ Jesus you must go on to read in the classics of full
   assurance and become a scribe well instructed in the things of the
   Kingdom of God. Keep, therefore, close to the practice of faith from
   which so many are turning aside.

   In these times men look to make progress by what they call thought, by
   which they mean vain imagination and speculation. We cannot advance a
   step by doubt--our only progress is by faith. There are no such things
   as "steppingstones of our dead selves." Unless, indeed, they are
   steppingstones down to death and destruction! The only steppingstones
   to life and Heaven are to be found in the Truths of God revealed to our
   faith. Believe God and you have made progress! So let us pray for our
   children, that they may constantly know and believe more and more, for
   the Scripture is able to make them wise unto salvation, but only
   through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Faith is the result to aim at.
   Faith in the appointed, anointed and exalted Savior. This is the anchor
   to which we would bring these little ships, for here they will abide in
   perfect safety!

   Observe that the text gives us a plain intimation that by faith,
   knowledge is turned into wisdom. Exceedingly practical is the
   difference between knowledge and wisdom. See it in the text, "From a
   child you have known." But it is faith, faith alone, that turns that
   knowledge into wisdom--and thus the Holy Scriptures are "able to make
   wise unto salvation." "Knowledge is power," but wisdom is the
   application of that power to practical ends! Knowledge may be bullion,
   but wisdom is the minted gold, fit for circulation among men! You can
   give your children knowledge without their having faith, but they must
   have faith given them of the Holy Spirit before that knowledge can
   become wisdom! Scriptural knowledge is wisdom when it influences the
   heart, when it rules the mind, when it affects the daily life, when it
   sanctifies the spirit, when it renews the will. O Teachers, pray for
   your dear children that God would give them faith in Christ Jesus so
   that the knowledge which you have given them may turn to wisdom! Go as
   far as you can go with the teaching, but always cry mightily unto the
   Lord that His Holy Spirit may work regeneration, create faith, impart
   wisdom and give salvation.

   Learn yet, again, that faith finds her wisdom in the use of knowledge
   conferred by the Scriptures. "From childhood you have known the Holy
   Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through
   faith." Faith never finds her wisdom in the thoughts of men, nor in
   pretended revelations. She resorts to the Inspired Writings for her
   guidance. This is the well from which she drinks, the manna on which
   she feeds. Faith takes the Lord Jesus to be her wisdom. The knowledge
   of Christ is, to her, the most excellent of the sciences. She asks
   only--What is written? And when that question is answered, her
   difficulties are ended! I know it is not so with this unbelieving age
   and this it is which causes me to go mourning and lamenting. Alas for a
   Church which rejects the testimony of the Lord! As for us, we abide by
   the Word of the Lord and from it we will not stir an inch!

   See then, my Hearers, what is needed for all of you who are
   unconverted. The Holy Scriptures must be made the means of your
   salvation through faith. Know the Bible, read the Bible, search the
   Bible--and yet the Bible, alone, will not save you! What did our Lord,
   Himself, say? "You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you
   have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me; and you will
   not come unto Me that you might have life." If you come not to Jesus,
   you will miss eternal life! Searching the Scriptures is able to make
   you wise unto salvation "through faith which is in

   Christ Jesus"--but not without that faith! Pray, you Sunday school
   teachers, that you may see this faith worked in the children whom you
   teach! What a blessed groundwork for faith, your teaching of the Holy
   Scriptures will be! But never mistake it for the building, itself,
   which is of faith alone!

   III. Time fails me. I cannot dwell as I would upon other points, but I
   beg you to notice, in the third place, that sound instruction in Holy
   Scripture, when quickened by a living faith, CREATES A SOUND CHARACTER.
   The man who, from childhood has known the Holy Scriptures, when he
   obtains faith in Christ, will be grounded and settled upon the abiding
   principles of the unchanging Word of God. I wish it were so with the
   bulk of those who profess and call themselves, "Christians." In these
   days we are surrounded by unsettled minds, "ever learning, but never
   coming to a knowledge of the Truth of God." These are carried about by
   every wind of doctrine. What numbers of professors I have known who go
   into one place of worship and hear one form of doctrine and apparently
   approve it because the preacher is "a clever man!" They hear an
   opposite teaching and they are equally at home, because, again, it is
   "a clever man!" They join with a Church and you ask them, "Do you agree
   with the views of that community?" They neither know nor care what
   those views may be--one doctrine is as good as another to them. Their
   spiritual appetite can enjoy soap as well as butter! They can digest
   bricks as well as bread!

   These religious ostriches have a marvelous power of swallowing
   everything--but they have no spiritual discernment, no appreciation of
   the Truth of God. They follow any "clever" person and, in this, prove
   that they are not the sheep of our Lord's pasture, of whom it is
   written, "A stranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice
   of strangers." We desire to build up a Church with those who know what
   they know and can give a reason for what they believe. The true
   Believer's great reason for his faith is, "It is written." Christ our
   Master met the tempter in the wilderness with, "It is written." Though
   He was, Himself, Inspired, yet His teaching was full of the Old
   Testament--He was always quoting the Words of the Inspired Book and,
   therein, setting us an example.

   If you and I would contend with Satan and with an evil world, so as to
   overcome in the conflict, we must take care to take our stand squarely
   and firmly upon the Scriptures! Let us treat our opponents to volleys
   of Scripture! Let us fire point-blank with sacred texts! These are
   arguments which wound and kill! Our own reasonings are mere paper
   pellets, but Scriptural proofs are bullets of steel! Our opponents will
   find it useless to try to lead us away from the old faith when they
   perceive that we will not budge an inch from Holy Scripture. We are
   bomb-proof when we shelter beneath the Word of the Lord. The cunning
   craftiness of deceivers is foiled by the clear simplicity of, "Thus
   says the Lord."

   Those who know the Scriptures and so believe in Jesus, are pillared
   upon a personal acquaintance with the foundations of their faith. "From
   childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures"--they were not treated
   with an ignorant reverence, but with an intelligent homage. How much I
   desire that each one of you may be a personal student of the Holy
   Scriptures! We need to know them for ourselves! Personally grasping
   them as a Revelation of God to himself, the godly man loves them,
   studies them, feels them, lives upon them and so knows them! By this
   means he becomes as independent of other men. Paul is to die. Poor
   Timothy! Yes, it will be, "poor Timothy!" if he carries his faith in
   Paul's bosom and has none in his own heart! But Timothy's Bible is not
   going to die! Timothy's knowledge of Scripture is not going to be taken
   from him, nor is the Holy Spirit about to depart from him!

   Look at some of our Churches--while a well-instructed Gospel minister
   leads the way, the Brethren abide in their steadfastness. The good man
   dies and where is the Church? No doubt, those who are instructed in the
   Scriptures remain in their places, but the more ignorant are scattered
   like chaff! There are numbers, now, in this part of London, wandering
   about, who were once zealous for the faith, but are now almost
   indifferent to it. I will not mention names, but I could do so readily
   enough--I mean the names of esteemed Brethren who gathered an earnest
   following about them, but they are gone--and with their going, numbers
   of their followers have gone, too! I fear there could not have been a
   sound knowledge of the Word of God, or these people would have survived
   the great loss of their teacher. Oh, to have a good personal building
   up upon the solid Word of God! Then you will know what you know and you
   will hold fast to it--and there will be no driving you away from the
   standards of the faith. I labor for this among you and I pray that I
   may not labor in vain.

   The man that has been taught the Scripture from his youth is anchored
   by the Divine influences of that Scripture. It has so operated upon him
   that he knows for himself its Divine power. He knows the difference
   between the Truth of God and error by the effect produced on his heart
   and life. Without any boasting, he is able to discern between things
   that

   differ because about Scriptural Truth there is a strange, mysterious
   unction which does not attend the teachings of the most learned of men.
   I cannot explain to you what this unction is, but every child of God
   knows it. When I read a text of Scripture, even if I do not now it to
   be a text of Scripture by memory, I perceive its Divine origin at once
   by a mystic influence which it exerts over my heart. The most striking
   passages of any sermon are well-placed texts. A sentence from the mouth
   of God will have more permanent power over a Christian man than the
   best composed of human statements! God's Word is living, powerful and
   has a power to enter the heart beyond that of any other word! The Words
   of the Bible strike and stick--they enter and abide.

   He that has been taught in Scripture, steeped in Scripture, saturated
   with Scripture--is conscious of its permeating influence and it gives
   him permanence of conviction. Like the crimson dye in cloth, the tint
   of Scripture is not to be gotten out of the soul when once fixed there!
   It is dyed ingrain--it enters into the very nature of the man! Bible
   Truths influence his thoughts, words and deeds--it is all-pervading--he
   begins to eat, drink and sleep Holy Scripture. The man's heart is fixed
   on God, fixed in the Truths of God and fixed in holy living. He will
   stand fast, however evil the days. Though all the rest should
   apostatize, this man cannot, for the Divine Word, through faith, has
   bound him to the Altar of the Lord and, in the Truth of God he must and
   will both live and die, come what may.

   Besides, a man that has once been taught in the Scripture and to whose
   soul the Spirit has blessed that teaching, has come to yield himself to
   the supremacy of Scripture and this must operate to the shaping of his
   character. I confess that sometimes I come across a text which does
   not, at first blush, agree with other teachings of Scripture which I
   have already received--and this startles me for the moment. But one
   thing is settled in my heart, namely, that I will follow the Scripture
   wherever it leads me and that I will renounce the most cherished
   opinion rather than shape a text or alter a syllable of the Inspired
   Book. It is not mine to make God's Word consistent, but to believe that
   it is so! When a text stands in the middle of the road, I drive no
   further. The Romans had a god they called, "Terminus," who was the god
   of landmarks. Holy Scripture is my sacred landmark and I hear a voice
   which threatens me with a curse if I remove it! Sometimes I say to
   myself, "I did not think to find this Truth to be just so, but as it is
   so, I must bow. It is rather awkward for my theory, but I must alter my
   system, for the Scripture cannot be broken." "Let God be true, but
   every man a liar."

   We want our children to have this deep reverence for Scripture, even as
   we have it ourselves. There it stands! The eternal pen has written it
   and we accept it! If God has said it, we have no desire to question it,
   lest the Scripture should say to us, "No but, O man, who are you that
   replies against God?" We must bow before the Infallibility of the Holy
   Spirit and say, "Lord, teach me what this means. What I know not, teach
   me." He who goes through the world with an intense reverence for
   Scripture will be a man, indeed. The Lord will make good in him that
   Word--"Them that honor Me I will honor." Angels and men, before long,
   reverence the man who reverences the Word of God. Feed your mind on the
   pulse of Scripture and, like Daniel and his comrades, your countenance
   shall appear fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who eat
   the portion of the king's meat from the philosophic tables of the
   world.

   While on this point, I would also say that this kind of instruction
   will hold a man fast against the differing seductions of the age. Here
   I go into one place of worship and I see a pretty little dolls' house
   at the far end and people are bowing down before some paper flowers and
   candlesticks! Around the building I see pictures of virgins and saints,
   but he who has read his Bible enters not into this modern idolatry! A
   priest once said to a poor Irishman, "There will be no good come of
   your reading the Bible." "Why," replied the man, "it is written,
   'Search the Scriptures.' Please, your Reverence, I was just reading,
   'you shall read it to your children' and the priests have no
   children--how can you account for that?" "Ah!" replied the priest, "the
   likes ofyou cannot understand the book." "Well," said the man, "if I
   cannot understand it, it will do me no harm, but if I can understand
   it, it will do me great good."

   Just so! The Bible is a very dangerous book to superstition, but to
   nothing else! Spread it, then, to the winds of Heaven and read it,
   every one of you! To the Law and to the Testimony! If we speak not
   according to this Word, it is because there is no Light of God in us!
   He that holds to the Bible will be equally free from the dangers of
   rationalism which are now so abundant and he will keep himself clean
   from the ravings of anarchy which now sound like the cries of dragons
   from the dark places of the earth! People are beginning to forget the
   Commandment, "you shall not steal," and they are planning various
   methods of political thievery by which the foundations of society will
   be shaken. Love of Holy Scripture will be the sheet anchor of the State
   as well as of the Church! If men are thoroughly grounded in Holy Scrip-

   ture, we shall undergo political changes with great advantage--but if
   not, there is mischief brewing. The Bible is the cornerstone of our
   future hope.

   IV. Now, lastly. As this early teaching creates a fine solid character,
   so will it PRODUCE GREAT USEFULNESS. I will say nothing more than just
   this. Thus Timothy became above all others a choice companion for Paul,
   one upon whom Paul looked with love and remembered with joy. Companions
   for Apostles are only to be produced in the school of Holy Scripture.
   Those who have communed with Moses, David and the Prophets, are fit to
   associate with an Apostle. It is something to produce out of a child a
   comrade for a veteran servant of the living God! Let a man of God get
   side by side with a youth who knows the Scriptures and he feels, "This
   is fit company for me." Paul, worn with years of persecution, strokes
   his gray beard and his eyes light up with joy as he looks on that young
   Timothy! What is there about him more than about any other? Why, only
   that he knows the Scriptures and they have made him wise unto
   salvation!

   There were, no doubt, fine young fellows to be found who gloried in
   preferring the advanced thought of philosophers to the stereotyped
   teachings of Holy Scripture. But had they begun to talk to the Apostle
   upon their new theories, Paul would have dismissed them with words of
   warning. He knew nothing of them or of their "other Gospel," except
   that they troubled him and the Churches. Without Scriptural training, a
   convert has no grit, no backbone and no soul in him. But when Paul
   looked on a gracious youth who knew the Scriptures and held fast to
   them, he thanked God and took courage.

   This young man became a minister and an Evangelist. He was a preacher
   of such a sort that we should have been glad to have heard him. God
   send us many such! Perhaps we might have said, "The young man's
   opinions were rather crude and his expressions were somewhat rough, but
   we can put up with that from so young a man. On the other hand, what a
   richness of Scripture there was in him! What depth of thought! Did you
   not notice he had not got through a dozen sentences before he had
   quoted Scripture? And when he came to prove his point, he did not give
   half-a-dozen rationalistic arguments, but he brought out a single Word
   from the Lord and the point was settled." You must agree with a man who
   is at home with his Bible. This is the kind of preacher that we need
   more of! Instruct your children well, beloved Teachers, that they,
   also, may become Scriptural teachers in due time.

   Timothy became, also, a great champion for the faith. He came forward
   and in the midst of all those who were preaching false doctrine, he
   stood firm to the end--he was steadfast, unmovable, courageous--because
   as a child he had known the Scriptures! O Teachers, see what you may
   do! In your schools sit our future Evangelists. In that infant class
   sits an Apostle to some distant land! There may come under your
   training hand, my Sister, a future father in Israel! There shall come
   under your teaching, my Brother, those that are to bear the banners of
   the Lord in the thick of the fray! The ages look to you each time your
   class assembles!

   Oh, that God may help you to do your part well! We pray with one heart
   and one soul that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with our Sunday schools
   from this day and till He comes. Amen and Amen!

Untitled Sermon

   (No. 1867)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 25, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord,
   and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea. The
   Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation: He is my
   God, and I willprepare Him an habitation, my father's God, and I will
   exaltHim." Exodus 15:1,2.

   THIS is the first song unto the Lord which is recorded in Holy
   Scripture. In Jacob's blessing of his children there are verses which
   may be regarded as songs, but they are mere fragments and can scarcely
   be said to be sung unto the Lord. There are other couplets in the Book
   of Genesis, but this is the first connected song upon record. I should
   think that Abraham often sang unto the Lord, but we have no record of
   it. We can hardly doubt but that Isaac had his quiet Psalm, as Enoch
   had--and Noah and others who called upon the name of the Lord. But none
   of these hymns are left to us. This is the very first of those sacred
   songs preserved in Scripture and, in some respects, it is first in
   merit as well as in time. At any rate, its august occasion lifts it
   into the highest place among patriotic hymns.

   The Song of Moses appears to have been chanted by an exceedingly great
   multitude. Miriam, the Prophetess, took her timbrel and led the
   strain--all the daughters of Israel going forth with her with their
   timbrels and dances--and the whole multitude of the people taking up
   the strain. Never had the shores of the Red Sea, or any other sea,
   heard such a song! There were at least 600,000 men, beside women and
   children. What an assembly! Millions made up that choir! Though their
   voices were little tuned to music, yet as they lifted them up, each one
   throwing his whole strength into the strain, it must have sounded like
   the noise of many waters, especially when they repeated the refrain,
   "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his
   rider has He thrown into the sea."

   We saw just now, in our reading in the 15th Chapter of Revelation, that
   the Song of Moses, the servant of God and of the Lamb, will be sung
   toward the close of this dispensation when those who have gotten the
   victory over the beast and his image shall stand on the sea of glass,
   having the harps of God. Before the seven last plagues shall be poured
   out upon the earth and God shall overthrow the hosts of Antichrist once
   and for all, then shall this song be heard, sung, not by the Israelite
   nation, but by that higher Israel who have escaped by the Grace of God
   from the power of the spiritual Pharaoh and have washed their robes and
   made them white in the blood of the Lamb! How sweetly will they
   together take up the song, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously! Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty."

   It is obvious, then, from the plentiful allusions to this song in Holy
   Scripture, that it is full of deep spiritual significance. It teaches
   us not only to praise God concerning the literal overthrow of Egypt,
   but to praise Him concerning the overthrow of all the powers of evil
   and the final deliverance of all the chosen. It is God's intent that
   from the day of Moses, downward, even to the hour when flames of fire
   shall lick up the works of men and the heavens, themselves, shall be
   dissolved with fervent heat, that this shall be the song of the chosen
   people everywhere, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously."

   The first verse of this song was quoted by David. I think you will find
   it in almost the same words three times in the Psalms, but especially
   in the 118th Psalm you have the exact words, "The Lord is my strength
   and song, and is become my salvation." As if the Holy Spirit, when He
   furnished Isaiah with his noblest minstrelsy, could not excel the
   earlier strains of Moses. Isaiah himself, in Chapter 12, has the same
   words--"Jehovah is my strength and my song; He also is become my
   salvation." It is evident that this patriotic song was interwoven with
   the life of Israel and that when good and gra-

   cious men would express themselves in praise at their very best, they
   fell back upon this Song of Moses and they sang unto the Lord who had
   triumphed gloriously! So full of significance, then, as this song is,
   there is something for us to learn from it this morning. May God the
   Holy Spirit, who dictated this song to Moses, now write it afresh upon
   His people's hearts! Breathe on us, Holy Spirit, that we, also, may be
   filled with the praises of Jehovah!

   First, I shall want you to notice the time for singing this song. The
   text begins, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song."
   Secondly, I shall want you to observe the tone of this song--it is
   worthy to be sung in Heaven itself--it is, indeed, high and lofty! And
   thirdly, we will consider the first clauses of the song itself--"The
   Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation: He is my
   God, and I will prepare Him an habitation; my father's God, and I will
   exalt Him."

   I. It will be instructive to notice THE TIME OF THE SINGING OF THIS
   SONG. To everything there is a season and a time for every purpose
   under Heaven--there is a time of the singing of birds and there is a
   time for the singing of saints. "Then sang Moses."

   It was, first of all, at the moment of realized salvation. "The Lord
   saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw
   the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore; and Israel saw that great work
   which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord,
   and believed the Lord, and His servant Moses. Then sang Moses and the
   children of Israel this song unto the Lord." There was no singing in
   Egypt. Sighing, crying, groaning lamentation abounded there, till the
   Lord said, "I have surely heard the cry of My people." There was no
   singing that I know of even at the celebration of the paschal supper on
   that dreadful night when they ate the lamb in haste with their loins
   girded and their staves in their hands. Its first observance was upon a
   night almost too solemn for song. I do not read that they sang when
   they came to Succoth, or reached their first encampment.

   I doubt not that they sang snatches of songs when they found themselves
   free from their daily tasks and from the Egyptian rod. No doubt there
   were individual songs, but the masses did not unite in concerted
   music--they were too hurried and too much in fear of pursuit. No poet,
   as yet, had arisen to write a lyric in which all would join. The hour
   of their complete deliverance had not yet fully come. They marched on
   steadily, but they had hardly reached the time for timbrels. When they
   had crossed the sea and the waters thereof rolled between them and the
   house of their bondage, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel
   this song unto the Lord." Their previous lives had been one long-drawn
   sigh, or one discord of anguish and fear and woe. But when their
   slavery was altogether a thing of the past, then sang Moses. The depths
   have covered the Egyptian host--there is not one of them left--"Then
   sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord."

   You will have noticed, perhaps, in reading the previous chapter, that
   Moses had said to the people (14:14), "The Lord shall fight for you and
   you shall hold your peace." But now that God had fought for them, they
   are not commanded to hold their peace any longer! The battle is fought,
   the victory is won and, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel
   this song unto the Lord." How could they help it? Surely, "if these
   should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."

   What does that teach us, Brothers and Sisters, but that we cannot sing
   in the land of bondage while under the dominion of sin and Satan? How
   shall we sing the Lord's song in that strange land? We do not even sing
   in the first moments of our spiritual life, when our question is how to
   escape destruction through the sprinkling of the blood! Nor do we,
   perhaps, sing in those first hurried steps when we fly from the power
   of sin and Satan, endeavoring to escape out of bondage. But, oh, when
   we see that Christ has saved us! When we understand that he that
   believes in Him has everlasting life--then we sing! When we learn that,
   "He that believes is justified from all things from which he could not
   be justified by the Law of Moses," and hear the Word of the Lord
   declaring, "To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become
   the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name," then we sing
   unto the Lord! Who could stop us? It would be unnatural for us to be
   silent after sin is put away! When we are reconciled to God by the
   death of His Son, the dumb devil is cast out of us. "Then sang Moses
   and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord."

   Our early days, when we first saw how complete was the redemption of
   Christ, were days of constant praise, and I think, today, if we see
   afresh how perfect is the righteousness of Christ, how fully accepted
   is the great Atonement, how secure is our standing by virtue of our
   union with the Son of God, we shall return to our music and make this
   house resound with grateful Psalms! When we doubt our salvation, we
   suspend our singing, but when we realize it--when we get

   a grip of it, when we see clearly the great work that God has done for
   us--then we sing unto the Lord who has for us, also, triumphed
   gloriously! I say again, how can we help but sing? How can our joy of
   heart any longer be pent up? It must pour itself forth in floods of
   harmony, in tunes of realized salvation!

   So is it, also, in times of distinct consecration. You may not see this
   at first, but I would remind you that the Apostle assures us that all
   Israel were "baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea." When
   Pharaoh and his hosts had been destroyed, Israel stood, for the first
   time, as a nation separated from Egypt. The Red Sea was a most
   effectual division. Israel became a distinct people, a race redeemed
   from among men--they would never again feel the yoke of Mizraim-- they
   would not return to Egypt, nor would Pharaoh, again, pursue them. They
   were now a distinct people consecrated unto Jehovah. To them God would
   reveal Himself and among them He would dwell. That passage through the
   Red Sea was the type of their death, their burial and their
   resurrection to a new life. It was their national baptism unto God and,
   therefore, they sang, as it were, a new song.

   Do you wonder that they did so? It is the happiest thing that can ever
   happen to a mortal man, to be dedicated to God! It is the grandest
   posture in which a creature can stand, to be fully consecrated to his
   Creator! It is the sweetest and happiest condition in which a heart can
   be, when it feels that it is redeemed of the Lord and, therefore, is
   not its own, but bought with a price. No song among sweet pastorals can
   exceed in sweetness that heavenly Canticle, "I am my beloved's, and my
   beloved is mine." There is no greater joy than to know that the Lord
   has chosen us unto Himself to be His peculiar heritage! Conscious of
   redemption by blood and separation unto Jehovah, their God, "Then sang
   Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord."

   Oh you that hope that you are Christians but have never yet taken the
   distinct step to declare yourselves to be wholly the Lord's! Oh you
   that have never come clean away from Egypt and made the waters to roll
   between you and a guilty world--you have delayed a joy which, I trust,
   you may not longer miss, lest that dreadful text is fulfilled in you,
   "Whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My Words in this adulterous and
   sinful generation; of him, also, shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when
   He comes in the Glory of His Father with the holy angels." "Then"--in
   the day of realized salvation. "Then"--in the day of distinct
   consecration they sang this song unto the Lord!

   Brethren, it was also a day of the manifest display of God's power. Our
   hearts are heavy. At least mine is so, when God seems to put His right
   hand into His bosom and not to vindicate His own cause. I am most sad
   because I see error prevalent everywhere! Falsehood reigns and Jannes
   and Jambres withstand Moses--and the Prince of this world disdainfully
   demands, "Who is Jehovah?" Many plagues are upon us--the earth swarms
   with errors as if the dust were turned into lice throughout all the
   land. Heresies, like frogs, are croaking everywhere! They have come up
   into the King's chambers. The Lord has sent a thick darkness over all
   the land, even darkness that may be felt. The people loathe to drink of
   the waters of our sanctuaries, for a curse is upon them in many a
   place. Our heart feels bowed down and we go mourning and say, "Why have
   You made us to drink the wine of astonishment?"

   But when we hear of conversions! When we see God blessing the work of
   the Sunday school! When we hear of sinners turning to Christ and
   seeking mercy! When we notice the children of God diligent in service!
   When we see the work of the Lord worked with vigor--then is our heart
   exceedingly glad, and then, like Moses and the children of Israel--we
   sing unto the Lord! How can we be silent when God's arm is made bare? A
   revival is our joyous holiday! If we had our choice of all the
   benedictions that God can give us on earth, it would be to see the
   Church revive, His truth prevail and His Kingdom come! It is not, with
   some of us, a matter of indifference whether the Truth of God is
   preached or error is proclaimed! No, it is our life to see the Gospel
   conquer! We live if you stand fast in the faith, but our spirit
   distinctly sickens in proportion as the Church of God decays. When the
   Church is strong and God is with her, then is our heart revived and our
   song bursts forth, "The Lord is my strength and my song, and He is
   become my salvation."

   But this song may be sung at all times throughout the life of faith.

   I want to put it to the people of God here whether it is good to save
   up our songs for special occasions of great joy, or for times when we
   have something visible to sing about. Should not the Believer sing by
   faith as well as live by faith? Do you not think that the Song of Moses
   and the children of Israel at the Red Sea was, after all, a poor affair
   as far as faith is concerned? The bulk of the Israelites had very
   little faith, indeed, and loud as was the song, there was more noise
   than faith in it--for within a day or two they began to murmur against
   God! Sing in fine weather! Any bird can do that. Praising God when all
   goes well is commonplace work. Everybody marks the nightingale above
   all other birds because

   she sings when the other minstrels of the woods are silent and
   asleep--and thus does faith praise God under the cloud. Songs in the
   day are from man, but God Himself gives songs in the night!

   O come, let us sing unto the Lord under the clouds! Let us pour forth
   His praises in the fires! Let us praise Him under depressions--let us
   magnify Him when our heart is heavy. Faith believes in God when there
   is nothing to support her but the bare promise. That man was highly
   commended who did not despair of the Roman Republic--let us never
   despair of the Redeemer's Kingdom! That is the true Christian who can
   say when everything grieves him, "Nevertheless, with joy will I draw
   water out of the wells of salvation; for I will sing unto the Lord as
   long as I live." "Therefore will we not fear, though the earth is
   removed, and though the mountains are carried into the midst of the
   sea." I ask, today, from every heavy heart and every downcast spirit,
   from every man that contends earnestly for the faith once delivered to
   the saints, and trembles for the Ark of the Lord, that in the midst of
   his trembling and grief, he should burst into song! Rob not God of His
   Glory, but let it be said, this day, "Then sang Moses and the children
   of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto
   the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has
   He thrown into the sea."

   Thus we have spoken upon the time for singing. I think that time is
   NOW. Let your hearts begin to ring all their bells and let not their
   sweet chimes cease forevermore!

   II. Notice, secondly, THE TONE OF THIS SONG. "Then sang Moses and the
   children of Israel this song unto the

   Lord."

   Note, first, that the tone is enthusiastic. There is not a dull line,
   there is not a dreary sentence all through! It is full of force, life,
   power--it is Luther's Old Hundredth Psalm and more! It rises to a
   height of intense enthusiasm which cannot be excelled. The words are,
   "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously," and the
   singers endeavor to sing gloriously, too!

   The tone is also congregational, being intended for every Israelite to
   join in. Though Moses began by saying, "I will sing unto the Lord," yet
   Miriam concluded with, "Sing you to the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously." This is a hymn for every child of God--for all that have
   come out of Egypt. Should not there be praise from every one of you?
   You in the back settlements, you that bear the mark of Egypt's lash and
   smart from wounds still unhealed. You that remember well the taskmaster
   and the iron furnace, yet sing you unto the Lord! From Egypt lately
   come, sing you unto the Lord! There should be sent up unto God by His
   Church a perfectly unanimous harmony of praise! "Oh that men would
   praise the Lord for His goodness!" Let all the redeemed of the Lord say
   so! "O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to
   the Rock of our salvation." Let the song be enthusiastic and unanimous!

   Yet please notice how very distinctly personal it is. It is strikingly
   so. "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously. The
   Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation; He is my
   God, and I will prepare Him an habitation; my father's God, and I will
   exalt Him." Do not lose yourself in the throng. It is not egotism to
   resolve that if nobody else will sing, you will say with David, "I will
   sing unto the Lord as long as I live." The fact is that unanimity
   cannot become fact if each mind is not active in praise. We cannot have
   a perfect accord unless each child of God feels that he must make his
   own distinct music melodious in the ears of the Most High. I tell you,
   Brothers and Sisters, if you will not praise the Lord this day, I will!
   Do you not say the same? Does not each Brother and Sister here say, "If
   no others feel bound to gratitude, yet I have such reason for
   thanksgiving that I will praise the Lord while I have any being"? In my
   case the Lord has "triumphed gloriously" and if others will not take
   Him to be their God, yet this God is my God forever and ever! He shall
   be my Guide even unto death! I like the personality of this song and
   would urge you to follow it.

   Some of you cannot sing unto God because you have no personal enjoyment
   of Grace from Him and do not know God for yourselves. Oh, if this is
   your case, do not let the sun go down until you know this God and so
   can offer your own peculiar song to Him!

   Note, again, the tone of this song is exceedingly confident. There is
   not a shadow of doubt in it--it is all the way through most positive in
   its ascriptions of praise. The lips do not quiver, the mind does not
   waver. It begins, "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously." It declares a fact about which there can be no doubt--"The
   horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea"--and it goes on to make
   statements which are not qualified with hopes, desires and "ifs," or,
   "buts," but are bold assertions which cannot be challenged! "The Lord
   is my strength and my song, and He is

   become my salvation." That is the kind of singing! I do not mind,
   occasionally, singing with Cowper when he is down in the dumps, for
   some of his dreary hymns admirably express the experience of the weaker
   members of the family. But I would not always keep to the minor key. Oh
   no! Let us sing songs of joy and victory! Doubts and fears ill become
   the children of God. The full assurance of understanding is our
   privilege and our duty--why should we not have it? When we come before
   God, why should we bring Him such broken-legged worship? No, let us
   bring Him perfect praises, the firstlings of our bullocks, even as
   David says, "Then shall they offer bullocks upon Your altar." God
   should be worshipped with the best we have! His mercy is so sure, so
   true, that He ought to have our fullest faith. Where is room for doubt?
   Let us sing with confidence unto the Lord!

   And this song is exceedingly comprehensive. It sings of what God has
   done and then of what God will do in bringing His people into the
   Promised Land. Nor does it finish till it rises to that loftiest strain
   of all--"The Lord shall reign forever and ever." I think I hear them
   repeating that verse again and again--"The Lord shall reign forever and
   ever. Hallelujah." Sing to the Lord, not only of the past, but of the
   present and the future! Sing of the Second Coming! Sing of the Glory to
   be revealed! Sing of high Heaven and the City that needs no candle,
   neither light of the sun! Sing of the victories of Christ when the
   armies of Heaven shall ride forth on their white horses and He shall
   lead them whose name is written on His vesture and on His thigh--King
   of kings, and Lord of lords. There is matter enough for eternal music
   if our hearts are right with God!

   Note, too, all through, that this song is immeasurably joyous. The
   Israelites were slaves enjoying new liberty-- children let out to play!
   How merrily did they disport themselves! They did not know how to be
   glad enough! Let us give to God our unlimited joy. David said, "God is
   my exceeding joy." I know of no greater word than that word,
   "exceeding," because, however far you go, if your joy is, "exceeding,"
   it is above the highest--and however brave the description, if your joy
   is, "exceeding," it surpasses all language! Believers ought to be
   unutterably happy. Men redeemed with the precious blood of Christ ought
   always to be almost too happy to live! Men that are children of God and
   heirs of the Covenant--and are soon to be where Jesus is in the
   ineffable splendor of Jehovah's light--ought to feel their soul
   overflowing with delight! The pulse of the Believer should beat
   hallelujahs, every heaving of the lungs should raise a Te Deum! Oh, if
   our minds could but rise into the heavenlies, where we ought to be, we
   should not only be happy as the days are long, but we should enjoy the
   days of Heaven upon the earth!

   Yet I must say, however enthusiastic that song was and however full of
   joy it was, it was only such a song as was due unto the Lord. If those
   people on that day had sung to the Lord some dull, heavy tune, I think
   if I had been there I would have said, "Change that note! Awaken
   yourselves to ardor! Awake, awake, put on strength!" The new tunes of
   the present age are constructed upon the principle of, "Let us sing and
   rattle through the words as hard as we can go." I like weightier music
   moving swiftly, but yet grandly. Such was the Song of Moses, full of
   solemnity, but full of heart--a tune into which everyone could throw
   the full volume of his voice without fear of spoiling the delicacy of
   tone. But, Brothers and Sisters, the tribes of Israel did not even,
   then, praise the Lord half as He should be praised. If all the angels
   in Heaven had left their seats and descended to the Red Sea shore--and
   if cherubim and seraphim had joined the lofty song--it had not been
   more than meet for the occasion!

   So today, if we could awaken all on earth and all in Heaven, as well as
   all that is within us, to bless and magnify the Lord, the song would
   not be equal to the majesty of the Divine goodness! It would be but a
   faint expression of what God deserves from each one of us. Therefore,
   let us sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously!--

   "Sound the loud timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea!

   Jeho vah has triumphed, His people are free!

   Sing--for the pride of the tyrant is broken,

   His chariots, his horsemen, all splendid and brave,

   How vain was their boasting. The Lord has but spoken,

   And chariots and horsemen are sunk in the wave!" III. We are to dwell
   for a few minutes upon THE FIRST CLAUSES OF THIS SONG. "The Lord is my
   strength and song, and He is become my salvation: He is my God, and I
   will prepare Him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt Him."

   Notice the song is all of God. There is not a word about Moses. Read
   this song through and neither Moses, nor Aaron, nor Miriam are in
   it--God is All in All--"I will sing unto Jehovah." That is blessed
   praise when self lies with

   the Egyptians at the bottom of the sea--when everything that is in us
   that is commendable is traced to the Grace of God and the Lord is
   magnified for it! All for the glorification of Jesus and none but
   Jesus! Brothers and Sisters, we spoil our music by diverting our
   thoughts to man. Let us forget men, forget earth, forget time, forget
   self, forget this mortal life and only think of our God! The song shall
   be all for You, O Lord, for You are All in All and if we have one note
   that is determined to go astray, we will this day bind it with cords,
   even with cords to the horns of Your Altar, O Jehovah!

   Observe, the song dwells upon what God has done--"The horse and his
   rider has He thrown into the sea." There is nothing concerning the
   deeds of Moses and Aaron, or the pride of Pharaoh, or the craft of
   Jannes and Jambres. No, the whole is consecrated to the doings of the
   Lord. Let us trace all the mercies we get to our God, for He has worked
   all our works in us. He has chosen us, He has redeemed us, He has
   called us, He has quickened us, He has preserved us, He has sanctified
   us and He will perfect us in Christ Jesus! The Glory is all the Lord's.
   Let us sing of what the Lord has done. When you read human history,
   read it to see the finger of God in it--trace all along through human
   story the silver line of Covenant working--observe how the Lord casts
   the horse and his rider into the sea when they come out against Him or
   His people.

   The song also declares what the Lord will yet do. It is not about what
   evil men are doing, or what we are afraid will happen through their
   malice, but of what the Lord, alone, will do. He says, "You will surely
   bring them in." He pictures the whole affair finished and Israel
   settled in the Promised Land--and this is His song. Come, Brothers and
   Sisters, let us sing the music of the future, the music of what God
   will do! Do you believe that the Lord will be defeated in the long run?
   Do you fear that at the end, Jehovah's everlasting purpose will
   fail--that Christ will have died in vain? Do you think the eternal
   Truths of God promulgated in this Bible will be driven out of the earth
   by modern thought? Or that our old Christianity, for which our fathers
   bled, will become extinct? By no means! We shall yet conquer in the
   great name of Jehovah! Therefore let us take heart of hope to ourselves
   and sing of what the Lord has done so often, for, again and again, "The
   horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea."

   Take up the first note--"The Lord is my strength." What a noble
   utterance! Poor Israel had no strength! She had cried out by reason of
   her sore bondage, making bricks without straw. Poor Israel was weakness
   itself! but Jehovah drew near in power. The Lord is my strength when I
   have no strength of my own! By the strength of the Lord, Israel came
   forth with a high hand and an outstretched arm. Egypt was glad when
   they departed and the Egyptians gave them jewels of silver and jewels
   of gold that they might wish them well in departing--for God had given
   them honor in the sight of the people. Thus the Lord is our strength
   when we are at the extremity of weakness.

   The Lord was also Israel's strength against strength. Pharaoh was
   exceedingly mighty. The kings of the earth trembled at the neighing of
   his warhorses! The rattling of his chariots made the very heavens to
   resound! But God was more than a match for him. When strength comes out
   against God's people, God meets it with His Omnipotence! What is
   Pharaoh's strength when matched against Jehovah's might? A paper pellet
   thrown against a wall of brass! The enemy said, "I will pursue; I will
   overtake; I will divide the spoil" and so on--but Jehovah had only to
   blow with His wind and the sea covered them! Thus will the Lord be our
   strength when the mighty are against us.

   It is well to say, "The Lord is my strength" when we are weak and the
   enemy is strong, but we must mind that we say the same when we are
   strong and our enemies are routed. Suppose Israel had stood on the
   shore and cried, "The Egyptian power is broken by the sons of Jacob.
   Israel has cut Rahab and wounded the dragon." Suppose the nation had
   boasted itself--it would have been guilty of a treasonable attempt upon
   God's Glory! Lo, Israel is strong enough to make the dukes of Edom
   tremble and the mighty men of Moab to be afraid--but she must not sing
   unto her own honor! "Give unto the Lord, O you mighty, give unto the
   Lord, Glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the Glory due unto His
   name." Let this, then, be our song when we are weak and our song when
   we are strong--"The Lord is my strength."

   Note, the word is not, "The Lord gives me strength," but, "The Lord is
   my strength"! How strong is a Believer? I say it with reverence, he is
   as strong as God--"The Lord is my strength." God, the infinite Jehovah,
   in the infinity of His Nature, is our strength.

   The next is, "The Lord is my song," that is to say, the Lord is the
   giver of our songs. He breathes the music into the hearts of His
   people. He is the Creator of their joy! The Lord is also the Subject of
   their songs--they sing of Him and of all that He does on their behalf.
   The Lord is, moreover, the Object of their song--they sing unto the
   Lord. Their praise is meant for Him alone. They do not make melody for
   human ears, but unto the Lord. "The Lord is my song." Then I

   ought always to sing! And if I sing my loudest, I can never reach the
   height of this great argument, nor come to the end of it. This song
   never changes. If I live by faith, my song is always the same, for "the
   Lord is my song." Our song unto God is God Himself! He alone can
   express our most intense joy. O God, You are my exceeding joy! Father,
   Son and Holy Spirit, You are my hymn of everlasting delight!

   "The Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation." The
   Father, in His eternal purpose, is my salvation. The Son, in His
   complete redemption, is my salvation. No, not in His redemption, only,
   but in His life, His death, His Resurrection, His intercession, His
   Second Coming He has become my salvation. And the Holy Spirit
   indwelling in me, quickening me, instructing me, illuminating me,
   perfecting me, keeping me--He is become my salvation! Triune God, it is
   not alone that You save me, but You are my salvation. I look for
   nothing but what is in You and if You give Yourself to me, You have
   given me a perfect salvation--salvation from bondage, salvation from
   worldliness, salvation from death and Hell, salvation into light,
   liberty, love and joy--salvation that shall culminate in eternal Glory!
   A full salvation is God to His people.

   Next "He is my God." Perhaps this is the most joyous note of all. "He
   is become my salvation"--this is very sweet. "He is my God"--this is
   the sweetest of all! "He is my God," I choose Him to be my God, but I
   choose Him of necessity. I can do no other. Who else can be my God? In
   the Revised Version it is, "This is my God," and a very proper
   translation, too--as if Israel saw what God did at the Red Sea and then
   exclaimed, "This is my God." This God of justice, this God of vengeance
   and power is my God. Beloved, choose Jehovah to be your God--whom else
   can you choose? Let your hearts cling to Him!

   But then comes the added word, "He is my Father's God," that is to say,
   the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob--a God by Covenant, the God
   who has given Himself to us by His own purpose and promise and,
   therefore, is our God--not by any right or merit on our behalf, but
   solely by the gift of His free, rich, Covenant Grace! Let us praise the
   Triune God of Free Grace, for He belongs to each one of us! There is
   nothing in God that is not mine; there is no high and lofty attribute
   that is not mine; there is no deep and dark decree that is not mine.
   You have neither Cross nor crown, O Jesus, which is not mine. He has
   given Himself over to us to be our God forever and ever. Come, let us
   exult in His name! Have you lost your goods? You have not lost your
   God! Have you nothing on earth? Yet you can say, "Whom have I in Heaven
   but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire but You." This is a
   holy portion, a happy portion, a heavenly portion, a sure portion, an
   endless portion, a portion which makes us feel rich to all the intents
   of bliss! This God is our God forever and ever. Let us praise and bless
   His name!

   Note, once more, that as Moses said, "He is my strength, my song, my
   salvation, my God," now He adds, "He is my praise." The text in the Old
   Version is, "I will prepare Him as an habitation." This jars a little
   on my ear--it rather sinks the majesty of the majesty for Israel to
   think so soon of Jehovah as One for whom she could prepare a
   habitation. Building a habitation was rather the idea of David in his
   hour of decline, than of Israel in the day of her astonishment and
   victory. The Revised Version of the Old Testament, which is infinitely
   superior to the Revised Version of the New Testament, renders it--"This
   is my God: I will praise Him." The fact is, there are two words so
   nearly alike that it is hard to tell which is correct--"habitation," or
   "praise." Some of the oldest versions of all have it, "He is my
   praise." I never like meddling with the Old Version, however, so we
   will take them both and make sure that we do not miss the meaning.

   Does not the Lord inhabit the praises of Israel? We will prepare Him a
   habitation of praise. As soon as Israel had got clear of the Red Sea,
   clear of Egypt, clear of Pharaoh by the power of Jehovah, then she
   said, "I will praise Him." O God, it shall be the business of Your
   people from now on to praise You! We have no bricks to make, but we
   will praise You! we have no whips to fear, but we will praise You
   freely! We are not slaves, now, but we are bound to You forever and we
   will praise You! Then the people seem to say, "We will praise the Lord
   by regular and abiding worship." Inasmuch as in order to worship, a
   place is needed, the thought comes up, "We will prepare Him an
   habitation." We will habitually praise our God for this great
   deliverance. Let us build our God a house of praises! Let us lay the
   deep foundations in love, set up the pillars with gratitude and roof in
   the whole with joyous hallelujahs!

   The thought of care comes before me in the Authorized Version--"I will
   prepare Him an habitation," as if Israel said, "I will take pains to
   praise God. I will do it intelligently and with my best powers. He
   shall have the best I can give Him. My best is poor compared with His
   deserts, but the preparation of my heart shall be His. I will lay
   myself out that everything shall be done decently and in order for the
   praise of this most High God. I will prepare Him an habitation of

   praise. Does it not look as if Israel said, "The Lord has come here to
   this Red Sea to fight my enemies and I pray that He may abide with me.
   I will prepare an habitation that He may remain. Lord, be not as a
   wayfaring man that tarries but for a night--let Your Presence be always
   with me and I will praise You always." To have abiding fellowship with
   God is the natural desire of every redeemed soul. O Brothers and
   Sisters, let us import our own desires into Israel's words. Let us

   say--

   "Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell By faith and love in every
   breast! Then shall we know, and taste, and feel The joys that cannot be
   expressed." Never leave us, nor even hide Your face from us, O Lord,
   our God! Dwell in us that we may dwell in You! Reside in these bodies
   and make them your Temples. Abide with us! Manifest Yourself to us as
   You do not to the world!

   The verse closes with, "He is my father's God, and I will exalt Him.''"
   How can we exalt Him who is already high above all thought? We cannot
   really make God any greater, but we can make Him greater in the
   estimation of our fellow men. Let it be the business of our lives to
   magnify Him. Let us tell our friends that which will make the Lord
   appear more glorious in their estimation. Let us lay ourselves out, by
   pen, tongue and life, to make our Lord Jesus Christ more honorable
   among those who surround us. Say, "I must and will exalt Him. Perhaps I
   have groaned too much over my trials. Perhaps I have been too depressed
   and heavy in spirit. But from this day on I will exalt my Lord and
   sound forth His praises! If He will permit me, I will make the Glory of
   the Lord the one objective of my being."

   Come, you young men and maidens, you old men and fathers, let us praise
   the Lord on the high-sounding cymbals, and spend the rest of our days
   in crying, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously." Amen.

Death and Life--the Wage and the Gift

   (No. 1868)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 1, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:23.

   IN the fifth chapter of this Epistle, Paul had shown, at considerable
   length, our justification from sin through the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ our Savior. Our Apostle goes on to speak of our sanctification
   in Christ, that as by the righteousness of Christ we have been
   delivered from the guilt and penalty of sin, so by the power and life
   of Christ in us we are delivered from the dominion of sin, so as not to
   live any longer therein. His objective is to show that true servants of
   God cannot live in sin--that by reason of our newness of life in
   Christ, it is not possible that we should continue to yield our
   members, instruments unto iniquity. We have passed out of the realm of
   death. We have come into the domain of life and, therefore, we must act
   according to that life and that life--being in its essence, pure, holy
   and heavenly--we must proceed from righteousness unto holiness.

   While he is driving at this argument, our Apostle incidentally lets
   fall the text which may be regarded as a Christian proverb, a golden
   sentence, a Divine statement of Truth worthy to be written across the
   sky! As Jesus said of the woman who anointed Him to His burial,
   "Wherever this Gospel shall be preached, in the whole world, there
   shall also, this, what this woman has done, be told for a memorial of
   her." And so I may say, "Wherever the Gospel is preached, there shall
   this golden sentence which the Apostle has let fall, be repeated as a
   proof of his clearness in the faith." Here you have both the essence of
   the Gospel and a statement of that misery from which the Gospel
   delivers all who believe! "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of
   God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

   First, it will be my painful duty to dwell, for a while, upon death as
   the wages of sin. And then, more joyfully, we shall close our morning's
   meditation by considering eternal life as the gift of God.

   I. First, DEATH IS THE WAGES OF SIN. The Apostle has, in his mind's
   eye, the figure of a soldier receiving his pay. Sin, the captain, pays
   his hired soldiers a dreadful wage. The original word signifies,
   "rations," or some translate it "stipend." It means the payment which
   soldiers receive, put in the plural as wages, because pay can be given
   in different forms--soldiers might be paid in meat, or in meal, or in
   money, or in part by their clothing, or by lands promised when the time
   of service came to an end. Now that which sin, the grim captain, pays
   to those who are under him, is comprehended in this terrible term,
   "death." It is a word as full as it is short. A legion of terrors are
   found around this "king of terrors." Death is the rations which sin
   pays to those who enlist beneath its banner!

   Now "sin is any want of conformity to, or transgression of the Law of
   God." Sin is that evil power which is in the world in rebellion against
   the good and gracious power of righteousness which sits upon the Throne
   of God. This evil power of unholiness, untruth, sin, contrariety to the
   mind of God, holds the great mass of our fellow men beneath its sway at
   this hour. The rations with which it rewards the most desperate valor
   of its champions is death.

   To set forth this terrible fact, I shall make a few observations.
   First, death is the natural result of all sin. When man acts according
   to God's order, he lives, but when he breaks his Maker's laws, he
   wrecks himself and does that which causes death. The Lord warned Adam
   thus--"In the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die." Dying
   does not mean ceasing to exist, for Adam did not cease to exist, nor do
   those who die. The term, "death," conveys to me no such idea as that of
   ceasing to exist, or how could I understand that word in 1 John
   3:14--"He that loves not his brother abides in death"? How could a man
   abide in annihilation? A grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies,
   but it does not cease to be! No, rather, it brings forth much fruit.
   That Adam did die in the day when he ate of that fruit is certain, or
   else the Lord spoke not the truth. His nature was wrecked and ruined by
   separation from God and by a fall from that condition

   which constitutes the true life of man. When any man commits sin, he
   dies to holiness and purity. No transgression is venial, but every sin
   is mortal and genders death.

   The further a man goes in lust and iniquity, the more dead he becomes
   to purity and holiness--he loses the power to appreciate the beauties
   of virtue, or to be disgusted with the abominations of vice. Our
   nature, at the very outset, has lost that delicacy of perception which
   comes of healthy life and, as men proceed in unchastity, or injustice,
   or unbelief, or sin of any kind, they enter deeper and deeper into that
   awful moral death which is the sure wage of sin. You can sin yourself
   into an utter deadness of conscience and that is the first wage of your
   service of sin.

   All desire after God and all delight in Him die out where sin reigns.
   Death is the separation of the soul from God. Alas, this death has
   passed upon all men! Can two walk together except they are agreed? Man
   may continue to believe in the existence of God, but for all practical
   purposes God, to him, is really non-existent. The fool has said in his
   heart, "No God"--he does not desire God--indeed, he wishes there were
   no God. As for seeking after God and delighting himself in the
   Almighty, the sinner knows nothing thereof--his sin has killed him
   towards all desire for God, or love to Him, or delight in Him. He is to
   God dead while he lives. "To be carnally minded is death."

   As there is, through sin, a death to God, so is there a death to all
   spiritual things. "The natural man receives not the things of the
   Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know
   them, because they are spiritually discerned." The man does not
   perceive and discern spiritual things, for he is dead to them. Talk to
   him of the sorrows of the spiritual life--he has never felt them and he
   despises them as mean cant! Speak to him of the joys of the spiritual
   life and you will soon discover that you are casting your pearls before
   swine--he has never sought such joys--he does not believe in them and
   he thinks you a fanatic for talking such nonsense! He is as dead to
   spiritual realities as a mole is blind to astronomy, or a stone is dead
   to music! To him it is as though there were neither angel, nor spirit,
   nor God, nor Mercy Seat, nor Christ, nor holiness, nor Heaven, nor
   Hell. Giving himself up to the dominion of sin, the sinner receives,
   more and more, the result of his sin, even as the Apostle says, "Sin,
   when it is finished, brings forth death." "He that sows to his flesh
   shall of the flesh reap corruption."

   Inasmuch as in holy and spiritual things dwells the highest happiness
   of our manhood, this man becomes an unhappy being. At first by
   deprivation of the joy which spiritual life brings with it and,
   afterwards, by suffering the inevitable misery of spiritual death. God
   has justly appointed that if a man will not be conformed to God, he
   shall not taste of happiness. And if a man will follow after that which
   is evil, that evil shall, of necessity, bring with it sorrow and
   unrest-- Romans 2:9. Since sin as naturally brings spiritual death upon
   men as fire brings burning, death is spoken of as the wages of sin.

   I would observe next, that the killing power of some sins is manifest
   to all observers, for it operates upon the body and the mind as well as
   upon the spirit. This spiritual death of which I speak may not strike
   some of you with fear--you may think it a small matter, though to me, I
   confess that Hell, however painted, is never so terrible a thing as the
   death which fills it! Some sins are murderous to a degree which is
   clear to all. For instance, if a man takes to drunkenness, or if he
   indulges in lasciviousness, it is manifest even to the unspiritual that
   the wages of sin is death. See how by many diseases and deliriums the
   drunk destroys himself--he has only to drink hard enough and his grave
   will be dug. The horrors which attend upon the filthy lusts of the
   flesh I will not dare to mention, but many a body rotting above ground
   shall be my silent witness. All know, or ought to know, the mischief
   which is occasioned to men and women by the violation of that Law which
   commands us to be pure!

   I spoke, the other day, to an aged Brother who feels the result of
   natural decay, but is, in all other respects, sound and healthy. I
   congratulated him upon retaining so much vigor at such an age. "Yes,"
   he replied, "I owe it to the Grace of God that I never abused myself in
   my younger days and, therefore, I have a store of strength in my old
   age." How many, on the contrary, feel the sins of their youth in their
   bones and in their flesh! We have all known that sins of the flesh kill
   the flesh and, therefore, we may infer that sins of the mind kill the
   mind. Death in any part of our manhood breeds death to the whole. Death
   drags man down from the power, beauty and joy of life to the wretched
   existence, the feebleness, the abominableness of death! The man is no
   more a man, but the wreck of a man--and his body is not the house of
   his soul, but a ruin in which his poor spirit seeks in vain for
   comfort. A withered heart, a blinded mind, a blasted being--such is the
   death which comes of sin. The wage of sin is openly death when it
   assumes certain forms and it is always really so, take what form it
   may.

   Now this tendency is in every case the same. "The wages of sin is
   death" everywhere to everyone! It is so not only where you can see it
   operating upon the body, but where you cannot see it. I may, perhaps,
   startle you when I say that the wages of sin is death even in the man
   who has eternal life. Sin has the same deadly character to one as to
   the other, only an antidote is found. You, my Christian Brothers and
   Sisters, you cannot fall into sin without its being poison to you, as
   well as to anybody else! In fact, to you it is more evidently poison
   than to those hardened to it! If you sin, it destroys your joy, your
   power in prayer, your confidence towards God. If you have spent
   evenings in frivolity with worldlings, you have felt the deadening
   influence of their society. What about your prayers at night? You
   cannot draw near unto God. The operation of sin upon your spirit is
   most injurious to your communion with God. You are like a man who has
   taken a noxious drug, whose fumes are stupefying the brain and sending
   the heart into slumber! If you, being a child of God, fall into any of
   the sins which so easily beset you, I am sure you will never find that
   those sins quicken your Grace or increase your faith--on the contrary,
   they will work you evil, only evil and that continually.

   Sin is deadly to any man and every man, whoever he may be! And were it
   not for the mighty curative operation which the indwelling Spirit of
   God is always carrying on upon the Believer's nature, not one of us
   would survive the deadly effects of even those sins of infirmity and
   ignorance into which we fall. I wonder not that Paul cried aloud, "O
   wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" If a man takes poison, if it does not absolutely kill him, it
   injures him and thus proves its killing tendency. In certain places the
   air is pestilential and though a very healthy man may pass through them
   and seem none the worse, yet this does not disprove the general deadly
   tendency of the malarious district, nor does it even prove that the
   healthy person is not secretly but really injured by having been there.
   Evils caused by sin may be too deep to be at once visible, just as the
   most serious of diseases have their periods of incubation during which
   the person affected has no idea of the ill which is hatching within
   him. Sin is, in itself, an unmitigated evil root which bears wormwood.
   Sin is death! Wonder not, therefore, that the Apostle says, "the wages
   of sin is death." As the sparks fly upward and as the rain fall to the
   ground, so sin leads to death. As the river takes its leap in the
   thundering cataract, so must the stream of sin create the fall of
   death!

   Moreover, when we read of anything being a wage, what does it mean? It
   means that it is a reward for labor. Death is sin's due reward and it
   must be paid. An employer employs a man and it is due to that man that
   he should receive his wages. If his employer did not pay him his wages,
   it would be an act of gross injustice. Now, if sin did not bring upon
   man death and misery, it would be an injustice! It is necessary for the
   very standing of the universe that sin should be punished. It must be
   so! They that sow, must reap. The sin which hires you must pay you.
   Wrong cannot produce right. Iniquity, transgression and sin must, in
   the nature of things, become darkness, sorrow, misery, death. Every
   transgression and disobedience must receive its just recompense of
   reward. There is no use in attempting to alter it so long as God and
   justice reign--those who do sin's work must receive sin's wages--and
   "the wages of sin is death."

   Now, observe, that this death, this wage of sin, is in part received by
   men, now, as soldiers receive their rations, day by day. It is a
   terrible thing that they so receive it. The Scripture says, "If you
   live after the flesh, you shall die"--such a life is a continued dying.
   Again, it is written, "She that lives in pleasure is dead while she
   lives." The wrath of God abides on him that believes not on the Son of
   God--it is there already. I would that men here who are not converted
   would remember where they now are--they are "dead in trespasses and
   sins!" O Sirs, you are not merely sick, but you are "dead in your
   sins!" You are already dead to the highest spiritual enjoyments and can
   never know them except by passing from death unto life! You cannot
   rejoice in God, you cannot know spiritual Truth, you cannot taste of
   spiritual bliss, for your sin deadens you to these things every day
   that you live in it. To all that which is worthy of a man, to all that
   which is the true life of manhood, you are dead through sin!

   But then a Roman soldier did not enlist merely for his rations. His
   chief pay often lay in the share of the booty which he received at the
   end of a war. He expected to share in his captain's triumph and to be a
   partaker in the spoil. Death is the ultimate wage of sin. The death
   which is here intended is the eternal loss and wreckage of the soul,
   the destruction of all about it that is worth having, the drifting of
   the guilty being forever upon the full tide of those evil tendencies
   which caused his sin and were further increased by sin. When all comes
   to all, this is where sin will drive you--it will perpetuate itself and
   so, forever kill the soul to God, goodness, joy and hope. You will
   enter upon a world in which the highest enjoyments which even God,
   Himself, can provide for men will be revealed, but they will be hidden
   from your eyes because you will be utterly incapable of knowing,
   appreciating and enjoying them!

   Being under the ever-growing power of sin, it will become more and more
   a hopeless thing that you should escape from the death which thus
   settles down upon you. All the agencies which could have recovered you
   from the clutches of death have failed to bless you in the life which
   has come to an end--and now, in eternity, neither the death of Christ,
   nor the Holy Spirit, nor the ministry of the Word of God, will ever
   again operate upon you. Till your last moments, you chose sin, and
   through eternity you will still choose it--for this death is the reward
   of your sin! Our Lord Himself said, "These shall go away into
   everlasting punishment." Then you shall come to know to the fullest
   what that awful word, "death," really means as God intends it.
   Meanwhile, if you would escape this dreadful doom, read your Bible and
   see how the result of sin is expounded. As our Savior taught, that
   future death includes within itself the fire which never shall be
   quenched, the worm that never dies, the outer darkness, the weeping and
   wailing and gnashing of teeth and the departure into everlasting fire
   which begins with a curse from the lips of Love!

   Alienation from God is death and can never be otherwise. The Holy
   Spirit, speaking of the ungodly, says, "In flaming fire taking
   vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the Gospel of our
   Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction
   from the Presence of the Lord and from the Glory of His power." This
   will be the ultimatum of sin! As surely as rivers run into the sea, so
   surely must sin run into death--there is no help for it! The hard and
   impenitent heart heaps up for itself wrath against the day of wrath and
   revelation of the righteous judgement of God. Sin inevitably pays to
   all who are its servants the death by which bondage to its power is
   sealed forever! O my God, grant us Grace to see what a wretched service
   this is which pays such terrible rations, now, and gives such a
   terrible dividing of the spoil in the end!

   I shall not longer dwell upon it, the subject is so distressing to me,
   except that I must add a few solemn words. The misery of the misery of
   sin is that it is earned. Every pang that shall fall upon the ungodly,
   either in this life or in the life to come, will have this for its
   sting--that it was duly earned! The sinner may well say, "I worked for
   this; I laid myself out to earn this; I now feel the misery of what I
   willfully did." Death is the result of being out of gear with God. But
   the sinner puts himself into that condition. If men, in the world to
   come could say, "this misery of ours has come upon us by an arbitrary
   arrangement on the part of God, quite apart from its just results,"
   then they would derive from that fact some kind of comfort to their
   conscience, some easement of their biting remorse. But when they will
   be obliged to acknowledge that all their woe was their own choice in
   choosing sin--and is still their own choice in abiding in sin--this
   will scourge them, indeed!

   Their sin is their Hell! The worm which gnaws at the heart of the lost
   soul is its own willful hate of God and love of evil. O lover of sin,
   you are under the power of this death--this worse than death! You are
   dead to God, dead to holiness, dead to love and dead to true
   happiness--and you have brought this death upon yourself, every part
   and particle of it! You have chosen that which has made you a wreck and
   a ruin--and that in the teeth of many warnings and admonitions! It must
   be so that "the wages of sin is death," and the terror of that death is
   that it comes as a wage! Why will you die? Why will you earn death? Why
   will you choose your own delusions? Have you wickedly determined to
   prove what outer darkness means? Have you turned your back on God just
   to see how a man must fare who wars with his Maker? Have not enough
   dashed themselves to pieces on the rock of sin? Why will you do the
   same? If you will do so, this shall be the misery of your misery--that
   you brought it on yourselves and that you rejected the one remedy
   provided by the Lord in the Person of His Son, Jesus Christ!

   Note, next--and I speak with the truest compassion--that it will be the
   folly offollies to go on working for such wage. Up to now, they that
   have worked for sin have found no profit in it. What fruit have you
   had, any of you, in the things in which you have cause to be ashamed?
   Has sin ever brought you any real benefit? Come, now, and let us reason
   to-gether--up till now has doing wrong ever worked for your health, or
   your happiness? Are you the better for hate, or greed, or lust, or
   drink? Has sin ever developed your inner self into anything worth
   calling life? You know it has not! It has rather destroyed you than
   improved you--and you know it. Why, then, will you go further in sin?
   Have you not learned enough, already, of the deadly nature of evil? Why
   will you press further into this barren region which will become more
   and more a howling wilderness to you as you advance into it? Why will
   you go where it will be more and more difficult to return? Oh, may
   God's infinite mercy prevent our being such madmen as to labor in the
   very fire to earn nothing else but death! God forbid that we should
   plunge from sin to sin by an inventiveness of rebellion--only to
   discover more and more what it is to be dead forever to God, Heaven,
   hope and everything that is to be desired!

   Let me add, it ought to be the grief of griefs to each of us that we
   have sinned. Oh, misery, to have worked so long in a service which
   brings such terrible wages! Though I have known the Lord, now, these 36
   years, I still regret most deeply every sin that I have ever committed
   against the perfect Law of the Lord. I take it that repentance is not
   the temporary act of a certain period of time, but it is the spirit of
   the whole life after conversion. When we know we are forgiven, we
   repent all the more that we ever loved that sin which is so abominable
   unto God and so evil in every way. Evil seems most evil when we have
   the clearest sense of Divine Goodness. Its constant wage is death and
   only death--and our lamentation is that we harbored this assassin, yes,
   even became its slave! Let us humble ourselves before God because we
   have played the fool exceedingly by sinning against Him. We have
   wounded, injured and destroyed ourselves--and all for nothing-- our
   only wage being a still deeper destruction!

   Oh you that have never repented, but are still abiding in this
   spiritual death, how I long that the voice of Jesus may echo in that
   sepulcher of sin in which you now lie asleep! May it awaken you and
   make you dread the death that never dies! Oh that you may turn over, as
   it were, in your grave and begin to moan, "O God, deliver me!" If there
   is such a thought as that in your soul, I shall hope that the Spirit of
   God has begun to bring life into your spirit. But what an awful thing
   it is to have spent all these days--and some of you are getting
   gray--in only doing that which is your undoing, in giving life to that
   which is your death! The sole wage that some of you have yet earned is
   death. Is not this a poor reward for all the risk, labor and
   perseverance with which you have served sin? God help you to see your
   folly and repent of

   it!

   One thought more before I leave this point, and that is it must
   certainly be a miracle of miracles if any sinner here does not remain
   forever beneath the power of sin. Sin has this mischief about it, that
   it strikes a man with spiritual paralysis-- and how can such a palsied
   one ward off a further blow? It makes the man dead--and to what purpose
   do we appeal to him that is dead? I have tried to describe what a
   dreadful thing it is to be dead to God, purity and happiness--but the
   dead man does not know or care for these things. Our preaching may well
   be called foolishness, since it is addressed to ears that cannot, or,
   rather, will not, hear. What a miracle of miracles it is when the
   Divine Life comes streaming down into the heart that sin has chilled
   into death! What a blessedness it is when God interposes and finds a
   way by which the wage most justly due shall not be paid!

   It is a necessity that every transgression should have its recompense,
   but in the Person of the Lord Jesus, such an expiation is made that sin
   pays its wage of death to Him who did not earn it, while those who did
   earn it go free! O Sinner, none can save you but the God who made you!
   You, as dead in sin, are in such a state that you will rot into
   corruption and go on forever rotting into a yet fouler and filthier
   corruption throughout the ages--and none can prevent it but Almighty
   God, Himself! Only one power is capable of affording you the help you
   need! And that power works through the Lord Jesus, who is, at this
   moment, mighty to save. Oh, that the miracle of miracles might be
   worked upon you! But if not, there it stands, "The wages of sin is
   death." Alas, I fear that sin will pervert even the ministry of the
   Word of God and make it a savor of death unto death! This is the first
   teaching of the text and I pray the Holy Spirit to impress it on every
   conscience!

   II. And now I am glad to pass into liberty and joy while I speak on the
   second subject--ETERNAL LIFE IS THE GIFT OF GOD.

   Note well the change--death is a wage, but life is a gift. Sin brings
   its natural consequences with it, but eternal life is not the purchase
   of human merit, but the free gift of the love of God. The abounding
   goodness of the Most High, alone, grants life to those who are dead by
   sin. It is with clear intent to teach us the Doctrine of the Grace of
   God that the Apostle altered the word here, from wages, to gift.
   Naturally he would have said, "The wages of sin is death, but the wages
   of righteousness is eternal life." But he wished to show us that life
   comes upon quite a different principle from that upon which death
   comes. In salvation all is of free gift--in damnation everything is of
   justice and desert. When a man is lost, he has earned it--when a man is
   saved, it is given him!

   Let us notice, first, that eternal life is imparted by Grace through
   faith. When it first enters the soul, it comes as God's free gift. The
   dead cannot earn life--the very supposition is absurd! Eternal life
   enjoyed on earth comes to us as a gift. "What!" says one, "do you mean
   to say that eternal life comes into the soul here?" I say yes, here, or
   else never! Eternal life must be our possession now, for if we die
   without it, it will never be our possession in the world to come, which
   is not the state of probation, but of fixed and settled reward! When
   the flame of eternal life first drops into a man's heart, it is

   not as the result of any good works of his which preceded it, for there
   were none. Nor was it the result of any feelings of his, for good
   feelings were not there till the life came. Both good works and good
   feelings are the fruit of the heavenly life which enters the heart and
   makes us conscious of its entrance by working in us repentance and
   faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. "Eternal life is the gift of God in
   Jesus Christ." By faith we come consciously into Christ. We trust Him,
   we rest upon Him, we become one with Him and thus eternal life
   manifests itself.

   Has He not said, "I give unto My sheep eternal life"? And again, "He
   that believes in Him has everlasting life"? O Beloved, you that have
   been quickened by the Spirit of God, I am sure you trace that first
   quickening to the Grace of God! Whatever your doctrinal views may be,
   you are all agreed in the experimental acknowledgment that by the Grace
   of God you are what you are. How could you, being dead, give yourself
   life? How could you, being the slave of sin, set yourself free? But the
   Lord, in mercy, visited you as surely as the Lord Jesus Christ visited
   the tomb of Lazarus. And He spoke with His almighty voice and bade you
   come to life--and you arose and came to life at His bidding! You
   remember well the change that came upon you. If any man here could have
   been literally dead and then could have been made to live, what a
   wonderful experience his would have been! We should go a long way to
   hear the story of a man who had been dead and then was made alive
   again!

   But I tell you, his experience, if he could tell it, would not be any
   more wonderful than our experience as quickened from death in sin, for
   we have suffered the pains that come through the entrance of life into
   the soul and we know the joys which afterwards come of it! We have seen
   the light that life brings to the spiritual eyes! We have felt the
   emotions that life brings to the quickened heart! We have known the
   joys which life and, only life, can bring to the entire man! We can
   tell you something about these things, but if you want to know them to
   the fullest, you must feel them for yourselves. "You must be born
   again." We bear our witness that eternal life within our spirit is not
   of our earning, but the gift of

   God!

   Beloved, since we received eternal life, we have gone on to grow and we
   have made great advances in the Divine Life--our little trembling faith
   has now grown to be full assurance! That zeal of ours which burned so
   low that we hardly dared to attempt anything for Jesus has now flamed
   up into full consecration so that we live to His praise! From where has
   this growth come? Is it not still a free gift? Have you received an
   increase of life by the Law, or has it come to you as the free gift of
   God? I know what you will say! And if any of you have so grown in Grace
   that you have become ripe Christians. If any of you have been taught of
   God so that you can teach others. If any of you have been led by the
   Holy Spirit so that your sanctification is known unto all men and you
   have become saintly men and women--I am still sure that your holiness
   and maturity are gifts received--not wages earned! I will put the
   question to you again--Did this abundant life come to you by the works
   of the Law, or by Grace through faith which is in Christ Jesus? Your
   instantaneous answer is, "It is all of Grace, in the latter as well as
   in the earlier stages." Yes, in every degree, the gift of God is
   eternal life ill Christ Jesus!

   Yes, and when we get to Heaven and the eternal life shall there be
   developed as a bud opens into a full-blown rose-- when our life shall
   embrace God's life and God's life shall encompass ours; when we shall
   be abundantly alive to everything that is holy, Divine, heavenly,
   blessed and eternally glorious--oh, then we shall confess that our life
   was all of the Grace of God, the free gift of God in Jesus Christ our
   Lord! I am sure that our heavenly education will only make us know more
   and more fully that while death is the well-earned wages of sin,
   eternal life is, from beginning to end, the gift of infinite Grace.

   Beloved, observe gratefully what a wonderful gift this is--"the gift of
   God"--the gift which Jesus bestows upon every Believer, for, "to as
   many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God,
   even to as many as believed on His name; which were born, not of blood,
   nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." How
   express is our Lord's statement--"He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life;
   but the wrath of God abides in him"! What a life this is! It most be of
   a wonderful sort because it is called, "life," par excellence,
   emphatically, "life," true life, real life, essential life! This does
   not mean mere existence, as some vainly talk. There never was a greater
   blunder than to confuse life with existence, or death with
   non-existence! These are two totally different and distinct ideas. The
   life of man means the existence of man as he ought to exist--in union
   with God and, consequently, in holiness, purity, health and happiness!

   Man, as God intended him to be, is man enjoying life--man, as sin makes
   men--is man abiding in death. All that man can receive of joy and
   honor, the Lord gives to man to constitute eternal life in the world to
   come. What a life is this! The life that is imparted to us in
   regeneration is God's own life, brought into us by "the living and
   incorruptible seed which lives and abides forever." We are akin to God
   by the new birth and by loving union with His Son, Jesus Christ. What
   must life mean in God's sense of it?

   Moreover, we have life eternal, too, never ending. Whatever else may
   end, this never can. It can neither be killed by temptation, nor
   destroyed by trial, nor quenched by death, nor worn out by the ages.
   The gift of the eternal God is eternal life! Those who talk about a man
   having everlasting life and losing it, do not know the force of
   language. If a man has eternal life, it is eternal and cannot,
   therefore, end or be lost! If it is everlasting, it is "everlasting!"
   To lose it would prove that it was not everlasting. No, if you have
   eternal life, you can never perish! If God has bestowed it upon you, it
   will not be recalled, "for the gifts and calling of God are without
   repentance." This eternal life is evidently a free gift, for how could
   any man obtain it in any other way? It is too precious to be bought,
   too Divine to be made by man! If it had to be earned, how could you
   have earned it? You, I mean, who have already earned death! The wage
   due to you, already, was death--and by that wage you were effectually
   shut out all possibility of ever earning life. Indeed, the earning of
   life seems to me to be, from the beginning, out of the question. It has
   come to us as a free gift--it could not come in any other way.

   Furthermore, remember that it is life in Jesus. The, "through," of our
   version is, "in," in the original. We are in everlasting union with the
   blessed Person of the Son of God and, therefore, we live! To be in
   Christ is a mystery of bliss. The Apostle felt, again, that this was an
   occasion for rehearsing our blessed Master's names and titles of
   honor--"in Jesus Christ our Lord." I noted to you on a former occasion
   how, at certain seasons, the various honors and titles of great men are
   proclaimed by heralds with becoming state and so here, to the praise of
   the Lord Jesus, Paul writes His full degree--"Eternal life in Jesus
   Christ our Lord." He writes at large the august name before which every
   knee shall bow and he links our life with Him. Here we read the
   cheering and precious name of Jesus! By that name He is nearest to
   man-- when He was born into our nature, He was named Jesus, "for He
   shall save His people from their sins." The life which comes in
   connection with Him is salvation from sin! In this Savior is life.

   The next name is, "Christ," or, Anointed, by which name He is nearest
   to God being sent forth and anointed of God to treat with us on God's
   behalf. He is the Lord's Christ and our Jesus. Next, He is called, "Our
   Lord." Herein lies the Glory of our anointed Savior--we, through Grace,
   becoming servants, participate in the life and Glory of our Lord. He
   reigns as our Lord and by His reigning power He shows Himself to be the
   Lord and Giver of life. "All live unto Him." Our Lord has life in
   Himself and breathes it into us! What a life this is--a life saved from
   sin, a life anointed of the Holy Spirit, a life in union with Him who
   is Lord of All! This is the life which is peculiarly the gift of God.

   Thus I have set forth this doctrine and I desire to apply it by adding
   a little more of practical importance. First, let us come at this time,
   one and all, and receive this Divine Life as a gift in Christ Jesus. If
   any of you have been working for it by going about to establish your
   own righteousness, I beseech you to end the foolish labor by submitting
   yourselves to the righteousness of God! It you have been trying to feel
   so much, or to pray so much, or to mourn so much, forbear from thus
   offering a price and come and receive life as a free gift from your
   God! Pull down the idol of your pride and humbly sue for pardoning
   Grace on the plea of mercy! Believe and live! You are not called upon
   to earn life, but to receive it-- receive it as freely as your lungs
   take in the air you breathe! If you are dead in sin at this moment, yet
   the Gospel of Life has come near to you. With that Gospel, there comes
   the life-giving wind of the Eternal Spirit. He can call you out of your
   ruin, wreckage and death--and make you live. This is His word, "Awake,
   you that sleep, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give you
   life."

   Will you have it as a gift? If there is any true life in you, your
   answer will be quick and hearty. You will be lost if you do not receive
   this gift! Your earnings will be paid into your bosom and dread will be
   the death which will settle down upon you. The acceptance of a free
   gift would not be difficult if we were not proud. Accept it--God help
   you to accept it at once! Even that acceptance will be God's gift, for
   the will to live is life--and all true life, from beginning to end, is
   entirely of the Lord!

   Beloved, have we accepted that free gift of eternal life? Let us abide
   in it. Let us never be tempted to try the Law of Merit. Let us never
   attempt to live by our earnings. No doubt eternal life is a reward in
   one sense, but it is always a re-

   ward of Grace, not a reward of debt. The Lord shall give us a crown of
   life at last as a reward, but even then we shall confess that He first
   gave us the work by which the crown was won! The Lord first gives us
   good works and then rewards us for them (Eph. 2:10)! The labor of love
   is, in itself, a gift of love! Grace reigns all along--not only in
   removing sin, but in working virtue.

   Finally, are we now abiding in eternal life, trusting in the Son of God
   and clinging to His garment? Then let us live to His Glory. Do we know
   that because He lives, we shall also live? If so, let us show, by our
   gratitude, how greatly we prize this gift! We dwell in a world where
   death is manifesting itself in various forms of corruption everywhere
   -- therefore let us remember from what the Lord has delivered us! Let
   no man boast in his heart that he is not subject to the vile influences
   which hold the world in its corruption. Let no pride, because of our
   new life, ever cross our spirit. Chase every such thought as that away
   with detestation! If our life is of Grace, there is no room for
   boasting, but much space for soul-humbling. When you walk the streets
   and hear the groans of the dead in the form of oaths and blasphemies,
   thank the Lord that you have been taught a more living language! Think
   of drunkenness and lust as the worms that are bred of the putridity of
   the death which comes of sin! You are disgusted and horrified, my
   Brothers and Sisters, but these things would have been in you, also,
   but for the Grace of God! We are like living men shut up in a
   morgue--wherever we turn we see the dreary works of death--but all this
   should make us grateful to the sacred Power which has brought us out of
   death into spiritual life.

   As for others, let us anxiously ask the question--"Can these dry bones
   live?" Then let us be obedient to the heavenly vision when the Divine
   Word says to us, "Son of man, prophesy upon these bones." We must
   cherish the faith which will enable us to do this! Moreover, a sight of
   the universal death of unrenewed nature should drive us to prayer, so
   that we cry, "Come from the four winds, O Breath, and breathe upon
   these slain, that they may live." This prayer being offered, we should
   live in hopeful expectancy that the Lord will open the graves of His
   people and cause them to come forth and live by His Spirit. Oh for
   Grace to prophesy believingly upon these bones and say, "O you dry
   bones, hear the Word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God unto these
   bones, Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall
   live." Beloved, we shall yet see them stand up an exceedingly great
   army, quickened of the Lord our God! He delights to burst the bonds of
   death! Resurrection is one of His chief glories. He heralds
   resurrection work with trumpets, angels and a glorious high throne
   because He delights in it!

   The living Jehovah rejoices to give life and especially to give it to
   the dead. Corruption flies before Him! Grave clothes are cut and
   sepulchers are broken open. "I am the resurrection and the life," says
   Jesus, and so He is, even at this hour! O God, save this congregation
   to the praise of the Glory of Your Grace, wherein You have made us to
   live and to be accepted in Your well-beloved Son! Amen and Amen.

Hagar at the Fountain

   (No. 1869)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 8, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her,
   You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees: for she said, Have I, also, here looked after
   Him who sees me? Therefore the well was called Beer-Lahai-Roi." Genesis
   16:13,14.

   You know the story of Hagar. I am not going to deal with the
   allegorical meaning of it--that would be apart from our subject this
   morning. I shall speak of the incident simply as it stands, but even
   then I shall not use it strictly as a case of sure conversion, for I am
   not certain that it was such. I suppose Hagar to have been an Egyptian
   woman, probably one of the maidservants who were given by the King of
   Egypt to Abram at that unhappy time when Abram's faith failed him and
   he went down into Egypt and requested Sarai to conceal the fact that
   she was his wife. Sin, whenever it is committed by the child of God, is
   sure to involve him in sorrow. In the long run, the result of any false
   dealing comes home to the Believer and it does so in very unexpected
   ways. Hagar became the special maid of Sarai. God had promised to Abram
   that he should have a son and that thus he should be the father of
   nations. That blessing did not appear likely to come to him, for there
   were no children born to Sarai, nor did there seem to be the
   possibility of any.

   Husband and wife were both old and well stricken in years. No special
   mention had been made of Sarai in the promise as it then stood and,
   therefore, it was not clear to Abram but what some other might be the
   mother of the expected seed. And when, in her unbelief, Sarai proposed
   that her maid should become his secondary wife, Abram listened to her.
   According to the custom of the times and of oriental nations, this act
   was right enough, but as it was not really right, in itself, and showed
   littleness of faith on Abram's part. Sorrow soon came of it. Hagar
   began to behave herself proudly towards her mistress and her mistress,
   finding herself despised, complained to Abram and began, also, to
   behave harshly towards her.

   The wrong element would not work in Abram's family. It might do very
   well for the Canaanites around him, but in a house where God was
   feared, it was an evil principle and could not work for peace or
   holiness. Hagar's high Egyptian spirit, finding herself likely to be
   famous in the house, would not brook the rule of her mistress, nor
   could Sarai, the quiet, but queenly matron, put up with the insults of
   her slave. The mistress became hard and harsh to her handmaid. Worked
   into a frenzy, Hagar flies from the tent and makes the best of her way
   on the road to Egypt, where she originally came. But what could a lone
   woman do in her condition, all alone in the wilderness?

   Wearied with her journey, she spies a fountain and sits there. It was
   the likeliest place for any passing traveler to find her and she sits
   down, there, in her proud despair. Perhaps they will send for her.
   Abram may repent his yielding to Sarai and send for her. She will wait
   there and if no one comes to her aid, she will die rather than return.
   She does not appear, at that time, to have lifted up her heart in
   prayer to God. She had lived in a godly household, but possibly, as she
   thought herself ill-treated, she had conceived a dislike towards the
   God of her mistress. Such harsh treatment as she had received was not
   likely to incline her towards the religion of those from whom she had
   fled! She was godless and hopeless. Do you not see her crouching at the
   fountain, half mad with pride and vexation and, at the same time,
   stricken with a sullen despair? She knows not what she is to do,
   neither does any way of hope open before her. Alas, poor Hagar!

   But although there was no prayer of hers for God to hear, another voice
   spoke in His ear. The Angel who suddenly appeared to her said, "The
   Lord has heard your affliction." That is a very beautiful sentence. You
   have not prayed. You have been willful, reckless and, at last,
   despairing and, therefore, you have not cried unto the Lord. But your
   deep sorrow has cried to Him! You are oppressed and the Lord has
   undertaken for you. You are suffering heavily and God, the All-Pitiful,
   has heard your affliction. Grief has an eloquent voice when Mercy is
   the listener. Woe has a plea which Goodness

   cannot resist. Though sorrow and woe ought to be attended with prayer,
   yet even when supplication is not offered, the heart of God is moved by
   misery, itself. In Hagar's case the Lord heard her affliction--He
   looked forth from His Glory on that lone Egyptian woman who was in the
   deepest distress in which a woman could well be placed--and He came
   speedily to her help.

   We have not much difficulty in deciding who the Angel was that appeared
   to her. We are sure that this Angel of the Lord was that great
   Messenger of the Covenant who was, afterwards, to appear in actual
   flesh and blood, but who many a time before He was born at Bethlehem,
   anticipated His descent to earth and visited it in human form. His
   delights were always with the sons of men and so when there was a
   message to be brought to men, that Blessed One, the Second Person of
   the Divine Unity condescended to be the bearer of it! In the present
   instance I discern foreshadowing of the Son of Man! I perceive sure
   traces of the Christ who, in a later age, would dwell among mankind!
   Read a little before the text and you will find it written, the Angel
   of the Lord "found her"--it is the deed of the good Shepherd to find a
   lost sheep! I see before me that Son of Man who came to seek and to
   save that which was lost. Surely this is that great Shepherd of the
   sheep who goes after His sheep until He finds it! He has come far into
   the waste after her and He rested not until He found her. Great
   gladness filled His heart, as when a merchantman finds a pearl of great
   price. I see high joy in the Countenance of this Angel of Jehovah. We
   read in verse seven, "The Angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of
   water." Significant place! Can you forget how, when that Blessed One
   was here in flesh and blood, He found another woman at the well. "Jesus
   being wearied, sat thus on the well. There comes a woman of Samaria to
   draw water. Jesus says unto her, Give Me to drink." Does not this story
   of Hagar read like a rehearsal of that Samaritan incident? "He found
   her by a fountain of water."

   This fountain is further said to be "in the wilderness." Note that.
   Remember those words of His when He actually became Incarnate--"What
   man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not
   leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he
   finds it?" Again we read, "He found him in a desert land, and in the
   waste howling wilderness." This wonderful appearance of the Christ
   before He actually assumed our flesh, has a likeness to His actual
   Incarnation of the most delightful kind. 'Tis He! We are sure it is He!
   All the tones of the voice and the modes of the speech are His. That
   this Angel of the Lord was God, we also know, for our text says, "She
   called the name of Jehovah that spoke unto her,
   You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees." The all-seeing God had veiled Himself in
   that angelic form! That Divine One, whom we adore as the Son of God and
   the Son of Man, condescended to be the Messenger of mercy to a poor
   slave woman who had run away from her mistress!

   None but God would have thus condescended. The world had no pity in
   those days for slaves of any kind, much less for those who had left
   their master's house. Here the Lord of Love found a noble opportunity
   by revealing His gracious Nature to a forlorn one. No eye pities her
   and no hand brought her deliverance--"Now will I arise, says the Lord."
   The Angel found her and it is of that finding and of what came of it,
   that I am going to speak this morning. May the Holy Spirit cause the
   words to be with power!

   I. In speaking of Hagar, I shall first dwell for a little upon HER
   REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE. I pray that to some daughter of sorrow a similar
   experience may come. May your case be mirrored in that of Hagar, as
   when one sees his face in a looking glass.

   Observe that Hagar had outlawed herself. No doubt she had much to put
   up with, but she had been insolent and provoking to her mistress and,
   at last, she had, in her impatience, deliberately left the house of
   Abraham and left the abode of the chosen family. Whatever that house
   may have been, it was the best place, then, upon the earth! It was
   almost the only spot under Heaven where the Lord God was known. You
   might have said of Abraham's family, "you are of God, little children,
   and the whole world lies in the Wicked One." She, an Egyptian, once
   benighted by the superstitious worship of her country, had enjoyed the
   light of the knowledge of the true God for a while. But now she had
   turned her back on it. She could not but have marked Abraham's high
   character and sincere devotion. She must have seen his true and real
   faith in God and the way in which he endeavored to order his household
   aright. Whatever faults she may have perceived there--whatever errors
   she may have suffered from--she could not but have noticed that there
   was a great difference between Abraham's tent and the abodes of Egypt!

   But now she quits her place of privilege, she renounces the high hopes
   which surrounded her and, in her fierce passion, she rushes, she cares
   not where! The untamable spirit which afterwards showed itself in her
   son, Ishmael, raged in

   her bosom. So, too, have we met with those who have deliberately left
   the ways of God and the people of God and all semblance of goodness
   because they have thought themselves badly used. They have happened to
   suffer somewhat and, in the bitterness of their spirit, they have
   resolved to take no more of it. They vow that they will have nothing to
   do with God, or with His people--they will turn their backs upon
   everything that is religious and they will mix with the world in its
   most ungodly form. They do not, indeed, care what becomes of them--they
   would flee from the Presence of God, Himself, if they could. Friends,
   relatives, good men and the circle of blessing they would quit and roam
   in a wilderness, hoping to be forgotten. Now their hand is against
   every man and every man's hand is against them--and in their high
   spirit they are prepared to defy the universe to subdue them!

   While she was there, in the moment of her desperation, she was found by
   the Angel. He had come on purpose to seek her out and find her and He
   had not failed in His search, as, indeed, He never does. This was the
   last thing she thought of. She may have hoped to have been found by
   some merchants going towards Egypt, or to be picked up by certain of
   the wandering gypsies of the wilderness--but she had not thought that
   God, Himself, would come after her! What was there about her that
   Jehovah should come out of His place to seek her? Yet He came in
   unexpected Grace, as He is known to do. He remembered the low estate of
   His handmaiden and because His mercy endures forever, He found her by
   the fountain in the wilderness.

   When the Angel of the Lord found Hagar, He dealt graciously with her.
   Indeed, this was the objective of His finding her! He came in pity, not
   in wrath. His first act was to awaken conviction within her. He said to
   her, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, from where have you come? And where will you
   go?" This language is singularly like the Lord Jesus Christ's mode of
   address. The name of the person is mentioned. This forcibly brings to
   my mind the speech of our Lord when He said unto the woman, "Mary," and
   she turned and said unto Him, "Rabboni." He says, "Hagar, Sarai's
   maid"--His words are personal words and she cannot mistake them. Is not
   this the Lord's way in other cases? Has He not said, "I have called you
   by your name"? He adds her description and reminds her that whatever
   else she might be, she was "Sarai's maid." How surprised she must have
   been! She had never seen the august Personage before, but evidently He
   had seen her, before, and knew all about her, for His words searched
   her through and through.

   Then, further to bring her to her right senses, the Angel asks her,
   with touching pathos of tone--"From where have you come?" What have you
   left behind you? What have you given up? All your hopes lie in
   Abraham's tent and you have left the place. For you, there is a high
   destiny, and you are flying from it. You are, after all, a favored
   woman and you know it not. You are flying away from that which will be
   your blessedness! This is the question of the Holy Spirit to every
   runaway rebel. O wandering Sinner, what are you doing? In fleeing from
   goodness, God, hope and Grace, do you know what you are leaving?

   Again, He asks her, "Where will you go?" Her crouching form is before
   Him. She lifts up her eyes, all red with tears, and she weeps anew as
   He says, "And where will you go?" "Will you go further into the
   wilderness and die there of thirst and hunger? Will you go down into
   Egypt, back to all the cruelties of that benighted land? Where will you
   go?" It is thus the Lord meets runaway sinners that are bent upon their
   own destruction. He calls to them by name and asks, "From where have
   you come? What are you leaving? What are you losing? What are you
   rejecting? What are you turning your back upon? And where will you go?
   What can be the end of such a life as yours? Where can it carry you but
   to destruction? Where will you go by this course of desperate sin? Can
   you face the Eternal and the Judgement Seat and the curse that withers
   the ungodly? From where have you come and where will you go?"

   It is thus, I say, that the Covenant Angel met with many of us when He
   awakened our consciences and made us pause in our headlong rush of sin.
   Some of us heard the warning voice many years ago and we can never
   forget it--the call rings in the chambers of our memory even now. It is
   thus that the Lord met with some of you a short time ago and you are at
   this moment filled with gratitude for the interposition. I believe that
   this morning the Lord will thus meet with some who are in this
   congregation, whom I know not, but whom He knows right well, for His
   eyes are resting on them now and His voice is speaking to them through
   my voice. Like as He said of old, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, from where have
   you come? And where will you go?" so does He speak at this hour, and
   asks you why you are bent upon destroying your own souls!

   This worked in her mind conviction, after a certain sort--and where the
   Son of God spiritually speaks to the heart, a deep and piercing
   conviction is felt! His Word lays sin bare and open--and makes the
   guilty conscience feel that nothing

   is hidden from God, but that all things are naked and open to the eyes
   of Him with whom we have to do. As when the butcher hangs up the body
   of a beast and, with a stroke, lays bare the heart and inwards of the
   creature, so with a single Word, the Angel of the Covenant reveals the
   heart of Hagar. Thus, also, the convincing Spirit deals with the sinner
   and lays him bare even to the backbone, till all the secrets of his
   soul are revealed and he cries, "You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees!" The Word of
   the Lord, by revealing the thoughts and intents of the heart, proves
   its own Divine origin to him who feels its operation and thus God,
   Himself, is made known as speaking by the Word.

   When He had thus worked conviction in her, the Angel who had found
   Hagar, next gave her an exhortation. He said to her, "Return unto your
   mistress and submit yourself under her hands." A hard message, as it
   seemed to her in her pride, no doubt. "Return," however hard the way!
   "Submit yourself," however humiliating the deed! Hagar is not
   spared--the Angel puts His words very plainly. If it were kindness to
   say, "Return," it is still greater kindness to say severely, but
   truthfully, "Return to your mistress." Mark, not to your master, only,
   but, "to your mistress." He also says, "Submit yourself under her
   hands," to show that the submission must be entire and absolute. Put
   yourself back into your right place and then Grace can deal with you.
   When the Covenant Angel deals with any man or woman among us, He will
   say, "Return, return, return. Repent and be converted. Turn you; turn
   you. Why will you die?"

   The Gospel does not spare the sinner the pangs of repentance. It calls
   him to sorrow after a godly sort. You must abhor your sins and flee
   from them, or your sins will be your ruin! You must so repent of your
   sins as to make such restitution as may be possible. You must replace
   stolen goods and recall false words. You must humble yourself where you
   have been insolent. You must bow yourself down before God and submit to
   man, also, so far as you have wronged him. God the Holy Spirit, when He
   deals with a proud, unrighteous heart, lays justice to the line and
   righteousness to the plummet--and sweeps away as with hail every refuge
   of lies. He cries, "Return! Submit!" and puts the matter so closely
   home that there is no misunderstanding it! He bids the man confess and
   forsake his sins and gives him no hope of mercy unless he will do so.
   God has not met with you, Friend, if you go on in your sins! God in
   mercy has not met with you if sin remains sweet to you and repentance
   is unknown to your heart. You must go back to the place from where you
   came and you must submit yourself, or nothing will go right with you.

   When the Angel of the Lord had thus spoken with Hagar, calling her by
   her name, working conviction in her heart and pointing out her duty, He
   then added rich promises--promises which, to her mind, must have been
   very unexpected and consoling. She was a runaway slave girl, but He
   says to her, "I will multiply your seed exceedingly, that it shall not
   be numbered for multitude, and you shall bear a son, and shall call his
   name Ishmael." That name signifies, "God hears me," because the Lord
   had heard her affliction. The Angel went on to tell her what this child
   should be who would be the joy of her heart. Little does a sinner know
   what blessings are in store for him, if he repents and submits to the
   Lord's will. He is come to the borders of the wilderness of death, but
   God intends to bring him back to peace, joy and happiness! Oh, if only
   the proud sinner knew what God's Grace will do for him, it would break
   his heart to think he had been so rebellious! Oh, if the obstinate know
   what a place there is at the Father's board and in the Father's heart
   for the returning prodigal and how much he is still beloved,
   notwithstanding all his naughtiness, he would quicken his footsteps and
   wish to have wings upon his heels, that he might fly back to his
   Father's house and his Father's bosom!

   O Soul, I do pray that Jesus Christ may find you this morning and say
   to you, "Return unto Me, for I have blotted out your sins like a cloud,
   and like a thick cloud your iniquities. Return unto Me, for I have
   loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore with loving kindness have
   I drawn you."

   So you see, Hagar's experience was a very remarkable one, although by
   no means peculiar to herself. Blessed be God, it has happened to tens
   of thousands, that where sin abounded, Grace did much more abound! When
   they have run away and outlawed themselves, Grace has followed them,
   Grace has convicted them, Grace has admonished them and Grace has made
   large promises to them. Their proud heart has yielded and their spirit
   has become gentle as that of a little child, as Hagar's spirit was, and
   they have returned to the great Father's house and submitted
   themselves. And rich blessings have become theirs. Is it not written,
   "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land"?
   Though Ha-gar had banished herself away from the house of Divine favor,
   yet the Lord devised means for restoring her and she was restored! Thus
   much on her remarkable experience.

   II. Now, I want you to notice HER DEVOUT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. When that
   which we have described happened to her, she acknowledged the living
   God. My text says, "She called the name of the Lord that spoke unto
   her, You-

   Are-the-God-Who-Sees." She spoke to Him that spoke to her--after this
   fashion do we all begin our communion with God. Oh, when God speaks to
   you, you will soon find a tongue to speak to Him! I do not mean when I
   speak to you in His name--for what am I? You ought to hear us if we
   truly speak for God, since it is of His kindness that He sends His
   servants to speak to you. But if the Covenant Angel comes, Himself, and
   if He speaks to the heart, then He unstops the deaf ears and loosens
   the dumb tongue. Men soon speak to Christ when Christ speaks to them!
   Did you but know the power of the Almighty Word of Grace, you would
   understand that as darkness gave place to light when He said, "Let
   there be light," so do men's hearts quit their sin when Jesus speaks to
   them in tones of effectual Grace. Hagar knew no speaking to God till
   God spoke with her, but after He had spoken to her, there was no
   silence!

   What did she say? She acknowledged Him to be God. "She called the name
   of the Lord that spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees." It is one
   thing to believe there is a God, but it is quite another thing to know
   it by coming into personal contact with Him! They give you books to
   prove that there is a God--all well and good--be convinced by them.
   They tell you to walk abroad and see God in His works. Do so. You
   cannot better employ yourselves, for God is everywhere. His breath
   perfumes the flowers and His pencil paints them. But you will not learn
   God in this fashion if you use this method by itself. To go from Nature
   up to Nature's God is a long step for broken legs--we are so mangled by
   the Fall that we never take that step without Divine help. But, oh, if
   the Lord meets with you! If He reveals Himself to your heart! What
   assurance! What certainty!

   Think not I am talking, now, of things that are not--I speak what I,
   myself, have felt. God has met with some of us as surely as ever one
   spirit has met with another! Men have so spoken to us at times that we
   can never forget their speech, but never has human voice come with such
   force as that of the Lord of Hosts, the accents of whose Words we shall
   hear as long as memory holds her place and reason sits on her throne!
   We may forget the words of father, mother, wife, or friend, but not the
   voice of the God of Love! "When You said, Seek you My face; my heart
   said unto You, Your face, Lord, will I seek." None doubt the existence
   of God when God has come into contact with their spirit. When we have
   felt His power and tasted His love--and known His overwhelming
   influence--then have we said, "Jehovah, He is the God," and we have
   bowed in solemn worship before Him!

   I do not know that Hagar had ever thought of God before, but she
   discerns Him now and speaks wisely. No doubt she had heard of Jehovah,
   for she had joined in the devotions of Abraham's family, but now, for
   the first time in her life, she recognizes in deed and of a truth that
   the Lord lives for her and, therefore, she speaks to Him and calls Him,
   "The-

   God-Who-Sees."

   Observe, dear Friends, that she acknowledged His observant love. She
   could not help acknowledging it, for it flashed before her eyes! I do
   not think when she said, "You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees," that she meant
   merely that God is Omniscient and therefore that He saw her, but she
   meant this, "You see me with a special observation. You see me with
   eyes of tender concern and loving care. You know me in my adversity."
   She felt in her inmost soul that eyes of thoughtful love were fixed on
   her. "Hagar, Sarai's maid," knew that she was especially under watchful
   care. Those holy eyes had noticed all her sin which had been brought to
   her remembrance. Those eyes had seen her duty which she was now willing
   to resume. Those eyes had spied out the promise for her, which promise
   had brought a warm comfort to her poor, chilled spirit. "Oh," she said,
   "what a God You are--the God-Who-Sees, who knows, who considers and
   thinks of me!" Now she has a God, not in theory, but in fact!

   You that only know God as One who made the heavens and earth, do not,
   indeed, know Him at all. He must be personally a God to you, or He will
   not be your God at all. To us, the true God is the God who sees us.
   Does not His Law begin, "I am the Lord your God, which have brought you
   out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage"? His special
   care is the mark by which we know Him. It was so in Hagar's case--God's
   watchful care towards her made Him real to her. She knew that He must
   be God! She could not doubt it, for she had been so strangely found out
   by Him. In the extremity of her lost estate, when she had gone to the
   uttermost of sin and sorrow, He had found her out and so she calls Him,
   "The-God-Who-Sees me."

   In the Presence of that God she felt overpowered and ready to yield.
   She was so overwhelmed that no rebellion remained within her. She girds
   her garments about her and she makes the best of her way home to the
   tent of Sarai. Her mistress is hard, but sin is harder. She will go
   back and bear the reproach and rebuke, for she has a promise hidden in
   her heart to sustain he. She shall yet be the glad mother of a father
   of nations who shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. She

   returns surrounded with God. Bathed in the sense of the Divine
   oversight, she resigns herself to her work. Though Abram should not
   encourage her and Sarai should not acknowledge her, yet the Lord's eyes
   would be upon her and God's favor was preparing great things for her.
   Her heart was light within her, because of the Divine favor, and in
   that spirit she was subdued unto the will of God.

   That is what I want to happen to many a poor soul this morning in a
   still fuller and more spiritual sense. Pray, you people of God, that it
   may be so! If you are here, this morning, Mistress Sarah, let me put in
   a gentle word for your poor maid. If she does come back to you, do not
   treat her harshly again. Do not drive her away again, but receive the
   runaway and make the best of her. Let the past be buried. Say, "If an
   angel has appeared to you, and taught you to know the Lord, I will
   gladly receive you and show the kindness of God unto you."

   III. Let me now call to your notice THE MANIFEST AMAZEMENT of this
   woman, for in her glad surprise she uttered a sentence which runs as
   follows--"Have I, also, here looked after Him who sees me?" This is a
   sentence very hard to be understood. Not because it is hard to make out
   a meaning, but because it is so full of meaning! It reads like an
   oracle. Expositors will tell you that as many senses may be given to
   this sentence as there are words in it--and each one of these senses
   will bear a measure of decent defense. I shall not go into them all,
   but I think I see clearly that she was amazed that God should care for
   her. "You, God see me. Have I, also, here looked after Him who sees
   me?" Does He see me? Do I see Him? If I had loved God when I was in
   Sarai's tent, I could have understood His following me here. If I had
   sought Him when I was with Abram and had known my master's God in
   Canaan, I could have understood that He should remember me now. But I
   was a wild Egyptian! I would not bow my knee to Jehovah. No, I had no
   wish nor thought for the living God--yet has He looked after me, the
   slave girl for whom nobody cared? He has spoken to me concerning things
   to come."

   Brethren, it is a great wonder to me, this day, that ever my God should
   think of me. Brothers, Sisters, do you not share that feeling, each one
   for yourself? Do you not say, "Why me, my Lord? Why me"? Sit still in
   holy wonder and adore and bless the Lord!

   I think her next amazement was that she should have been such a long
   time without ever thinking of Him who had thought so much of her. She
   says, "Have I also here looked unto Him who sees me?" "What? Have I
   been these years with Abraham and heard about the God who has been
   looking at me in love--and have I never glanced a thought to Him?" Her
   ungodliness astounds her! Brothers and Sisters, when you are brought to
   God, it will strike you as though a dart went through your flesh, that
   you should so long have done despite to God and heavenly things! Then
   will you say, "Have I forgotten Christ? Have I forgotten God? Has He
   had designs of love to me and purposes of Grace for me, and yet have I
   rebelled against Him? Did He die for me and did I refuse to live for
   Him? Did He bleed His life away on the Cross for me and have I been,
   all these years, thoughtless and careless of Him?"

   It will stagger you! You will feel ready to sink into the dust when you
   once feel the folly and meanness of your course. You can bluster, you
   can be proud and careless when you know not God--but when you once
   fully meet with Him, you will be ready to bite your tongue to think you
   could have lived so long in ignorance and neglect of your God! Hagar
   was evidently startled as she remembered that she had never, up till
   that time, looked to the observing One.

   But next, she is amazed still more to think that at last she does look
   unto God. In effect she cries, "What? Has it come to this? Have I,
   also, here looked after Him who sees me? Is Hagar at last converted?
   When I had bread to eat I never looked after God and now that I have
   come into this wilderness, do I seek and find Him? No creature can hear
   my call and do I now call upon my Creator? I am alone, alone, alone!
   There is nothing here but this well, and lo, the Angel of Jehovah has
   found me and spoken with me and now, in this wild place, I, for the
   first time, look after the Lord who has looked after me! Is this the
   place, the spot of ground where I must close in with my Maker and know
   that there is a God and believe His promise--and begin to live in
   expectation of its fulfillment?"

   It might well astound her! Perhaps somebody has come into this service
   this very day, almost driven to desperation. You have acted so
   wrongly--I cannot tell how wrongly--and now you are smarting from the
   consequences of your foolishness. If God is meeting with you, this
   morning, you will cry out in astonishment, "What? Have I come here to
   find God? Have I come into this miserable condition that I might be
   driven to look after Him? This is surprising Grace!"

   An old man in the country was a gracious father and brought up his
   children in the fear of the Lord--but his son, while yet a youth, must
   see life in London and, therefore, he came to the great city and
   plunged into all sorts of sin. He

   cared nothing for the Sabbath and even felt glad to escape from the
   weariness of the Meeting House to which he had been taken from his
   infancy. It was no design of his to ever find God, but God found him in
   the most unlikely of all the places in the world, namely, in a low
   play-house. A scene occurred in which a mutinous sailor was to be
   hanged and, asking for a glass of spirits, he was represented as
   drinking to his own health in the words--"Here's to my immortal soul."
   "Immortal soul," thought the foolish youth, "Immortal soul!" He had
   almost forgotten that he had an immortal soul. It was a shot fired at
   the center of the target--it struck him home--he was ready to drop! He
   sought the open air and a place where to weep. The next Sabbath found
   the young scapegrace at a Prayer Meeting, seeking his father's God,
   and, before long he found peace through the blood of Jesus! He began
   preaching the Gospel which he had so grievously abused. God knows how
   to get at the heart of sinners!

   Remember Colonel Gardiner about to commit a foul offense? He made an
   appointment and reached the spot an hour too soon. While he waited, he
   saw, or thought he saw, his Savior, and heard a voice accusing him of
   ingratitude. He fled the place of his temptation, sought pardon and
   became eminent as a saint. What a surprise it must be to rebels to be
   thus seized in the arms of Grace and transformed into friends of the
   King! I ask God that such a surprise may await souls who are here
   today! May you, also, inquire in amazement, "Have I here, also, looked
   after Him who sees me?"

   One other surprise Hagar had, and that was the surprise to think that
   she was alive. It was the common conviction of that age that no man
   could see God and live. She knew that she had seen Him in angelic form
   and she marveled that she found herself alive and able to look up with
   hope. The awakened sinner, when he is met with by the God of Grace,
   wonders that he has not been cut down as a cumberer of the ground! If
   the Lord had met with me in a way of vengeance and caused me to wither
   away from the root like the fruitless fig tree, I could not have
   wondered--but to bless me in infinite compassion is a wonder, indeed!
   If He had sentenced me to depart to the lowest Hell, I could not have
   complained. But to meet me in love--to pardon, relieve and save
   me--this is a miracle of Grace! Does the Lord say, "I receive you to My
   heart, and I intend to bless you from now on and forever"? Then does He
   act like a God! Who but He would speak thus? His Grace awakens an
   amazement which is not soon forgotten or easily expressed. The soul
   cries in surprise and delight--

   "Depth of mercy, can there be Mercy still reserved for me? Can my God
   His wrath forbear? Me, the chief of sinners, spare? I have long
   withstood His Grace, Long provoked Him to His face. Tell it unto
   sinners, tell, I am, I am out of Hell!"

   IV. My time has fled, or I should have asked you to notice HER HUMBLE
   WORSHIP. Her humble worship was expressed by her using an expressive
   name for the Angel of the Lord. She worshipped God heartily and
   intelligently, according to her knowledge. She did not use the first
   word that came to hand, but she spoke fitly, thoughtfully and well. She
   knew that the Lord was the seeing God, for He had seen her, and so she
   worshipped Him under that title, "You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees." We cannot
   worship "The Unknown God"--at least, such worship lacks eyes and light
   and is fitter for owls and bats than for man.

   Yet be it observed that she worshipped beyond her knowledge, according
   to her apprehension, for she said, "Have I here also looked after Him?"
   As if she knew that she had not fully seen the Lord, but had only
   looked at Him as He retreated from her. Like Moses, in a later day, she
   had only beheld the back parts of God, the skirts of His garments--His
   face she had not seen. The Hebrew has that force. Hagar felt there was
   much more of God than she had seen and, in that belief, she worshipped
   and adored with lowliest reverence.

   Her worship was wonderfully personal. It is not "God sees," but
   "You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees." And it is not, "Has God looked after His
   creature?" but, "Have I here, also, looked after Him who sees me?" True
   religion is always personal, but it becomes wonderfully so when a man
   is specially arrested by Sovereign Grace, for then he adores as if he
   were the only man in the universe and beholds God as if no other eyes
   throughout all the ages had ever beheld Him. Oh, it is wonderful to
   feel alone with the Lord, while the Lord is searching you through and
   through!

   Remark, again, that her worship proved itself deeply true, for it was
   followed by immediate practical obedience to the command of the Lord.
   Obedience is the best of worship! She returned to her mistress and was
   subject to her. Oh for Grace, this morning, if God meets with us, not
   to tarry a single minute in rebellion, but to return at once to
   subjection to the Lord! Oh, to cry with Thomas, "My Lord and my God,"
   and then to live as in His sight! It were well to keep the finger
   forever in the print of the nails, that we might never lose our
   fellowship with Jesus, nor our joy in the great Father, nor our
   subjection to the ever-blessed Spirit of all Grace.

   V. We will conclude by glancing, for an instant, at the well which
   became THE SUGGESTIVE MEMORIAL of this special manifestation and
   singular experience. That well--we do not know what it had been called
   before--but that beer, or well, was henceforth called Beer-Lahai-Roi,
   or, The Well-of-Him-Who-Lives-and-Sees. Will we not all, at this time,
   drink of that well? It was a very happy thought to attach a holy name
   to a well, so that every traveler might learn of God as he refreshed
   himself. When a person comes to drink at certain fountains, he reads
   "Drink, gentle traveler, drink and pray." The inscription is most
   suitable. It is fit that men should pray when they receive so precious
   a refreshment as pure water. It was specially meet that travelers
   should henceforth and forever pray at a spot where the Lord, Himself,
   had been and had called to Himself a wanderer who had felt compelled to
   cry, "God lives and God sees."

   Brothers and Sisters, there is a God and we know it. He is not an
   abstraction far away, but He is a reality and sees and observes--and
   takes care of men and women. Many of us have proven this to be a fact.
   Now next time you eat, worship Him that lives and sees! Next time you
   drink, worship Him that lives and sees! Let our tables and our wells
   remind us of Him who removes our hunger and quenches our thirst.

   Better still, let this very name of God--"The Living and The Seeing
   One"--be as a well of water to you for the comfort of your hearts. By
   this may your griefs be assuaged. "Mother is dead!" What a loss is the
   death of a mother to many a girl and to many a young man! "Mother is
   dead" is the token of temptation without defense. Such a stay and
   holdfast, Mother often is, that when she is gone, Satan gets a dire
   advantage over a young soul. Yet if Mother is gone, the Lord lives--and
   all the gentleness and kindness of a mother are treasured up in Him!
   God lives--think of that and be comforted. This well is never dry. Your
   father is dead, or your dear, kind brother is dead and you are left
   alone to bear the buffetings of a cruel world. Never mind. Let not your
   heart fail you. Do not run away. God lives and sees. He in whom is all
   fatherhood, all friendship and all kindness, still stands near you,
   watching for your good. Come and drink at this well! The waters are
   cool and clear. Drink and live!

   Did I hear you cry out in anguish, "Nobody cares for me"? Do you say,
   "Nobody knows me in this terrible city. Here I am in this great London
   as much deserted as Robinson Crusoe on his lone island"? I know what
   you mean. London is worse than a wilderness to many. A man may lay
   himself down and die in these streets and nobody will care for him. The
   millions will pass him by--not for lack of kindness, but from lack of
   thought! There is no such horrible wilderness as a wilderness of men.
   Yet, take comfort--the living God sees you! He sees not as man sees,
   with a mere gaze of cold notice, but His heart goes with His eyes. You
   have not prayed yet, but He hears your affliction. Oh, begin to pray
   and He will speedily deliver! Spread your case before Him and He will
   regard your petition!

   I would encourage you to get alone, if you are in sorrow and sin, and
   tell it all out before God and see if He does not deliver you. Some of
   us have gone to Him in plights as terrible as yours and we have ordered
   our cases before Him--and He has answered us. We can truly say, "He has
   delivered us" and, therefore, we encourage you to seek His face in the
   same manner. May the Lord bring you to seek Him at once, for His great
   love's sake, and then to Him shall be Glory forever and ever. Amen.

But a Step

   (No. 1870)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 29, 1885.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON SEPTEMBER 13, 1885.

   "There is but a step between me and death." 1 Samuel 20:3.

   THIS was David's description of his own condition. King Saul was
   seeking to destroy him. The bitter malice of that king would not be
   satisfied with anything short of the blood of his rival. Jonathan did
   not know this. He could not believe so badly of his father as that he
   could wish to kill the champion of Israel, the brave, true-hearted
   young David. And so he assured David that it could not be so--that he
   had not heard of any plots against him. But David, who knew better,
   said, "It is certainly so. Your father seeks my blood and there is but
   a step between me and death."

   Now, it was by knowing his danger that David escaped. Had he remained
   as ignorant of his own peril as his friend Jonathan had been, he would
   have walked into the lion's mouth and he would have fallen by the hand
   of Saul. But to be forewarned is to be forearmed--he was, therefore,
   able to save his life because he perceived his danger. It would have
   been a very unwise person who would have said, "Do not tell David about
   it. You see that he is very happy in Jonathan's company. Do not disturb
   him. It will only make him fret. Do not tell him about Saul's anger."
   But a true and wise friend would acquaint David of his danger, in order
   that he might seize the opportunity to escape. So also, tonight,
   somebody might say, "Many people now present are in great danger and do
   not dare to think about death. Do not mention the unpleasant subject to
   them."

   Well, Sirs, if my objective were to please you; if my desire were to
   seem as one who plays a merry tune upon a goodly instrument, I
   certainly would not speak to you of death and danger. But, then, it
   would be infamous to allow men and women to stand in infinite jeopardy
   and not to warn them! And it is kindness to speak to those who are
   carelessly at ease and tell them salutary truth. It will not put them
   in danger, but it may, God blessing it, be the means of their escaping
   from eternal ruin. So, I pray you, while I talk upon this theme which
   may seem to be a sad one, ask God to make it a great blessing to those
   who, up to now, have been sporting upon the brink of fate without
   thinking of the solemnities of eternity.

   It is rather a notable state of things, is it not, for David to be
   conscious of danger and to be telling his friend Jonathan that he is in
   danger? I do not often meet with the case! If I am the Jonathan, I have
   to keep on warning David of his danger, and I find it very difficult to
   wake up my friend to a sense of that danger. I would like to live to
   see the day in which David would come to Jonathan--I mean in which men
   in danger would come to me--and say, "There is but a step between me
   and death." We love to see care for the soul and concern about a future
   state. Whenever God's Holly Spirit is at work, we see it--sinners begin
   to be aware of their condition and they come and tell us of their
   danger and inquire for the way of escape. It is the simplest thing in
   the world to tell the awakened sinner how he may find peace--the
   difficulty lies in awakening the sinner!

   To cheer those who are alarmed is such good work that we would sit up
   all night at it! We can never have too much of it! To bind up the
   broken in heart when the Master gives us His Gospel is the most
   pleasant duty out of Heaven. The worst of it is that we cannot persuade
   them that they need to be broken in heart, or lead them to feel that
   they are in peril--but still shutting their eyes to all the Truths of
   God, they will go wildly on, determined not to know. Too many act as if
   it were folly to look a few days ahead--as if it were a work of
   supererogation to foresee the evil--a needless sorrow to think of
   eternity!

   Tonight I want to press the truth home, as far as it is the Truth of
   God, upon each person here present, that there is, or there may be, but
   a step between him and death.

   First, in some sense this is true of everybody--"There is a step, and
   but a step, between me and death." Secondly, to some it is peculiarly
   true. There are many persons--and some of them are here tonight--who
   might say with emphasis, "There is but a step between me and death."
   When I have spoken upon those two things, I shall then ask, "Suppose
   that it is not so?"--and conclude by asking, "Suppose that it is so?"

   I. First, then, there is a sense in which this text is no doubt
   literally TRUE OF EVERY MAN--"There is but a step between me and
   death," for life is so short that it is no exaggeration to compare it
   to a step. Suppose that we should live to threescore years and 10, or
   even fourscore years, or to be, as some few of our friends are, here
   tonight, even past their fourscore years--yet life will occupy a very
   short time. Life is long to look forward to, but I appeal to every aged
   person whether it is not very short to look back upon! I confess to my
   own experience that a week is now a hardly appreciable space of time to
   me. There seems to be very little breathing room between one Sunday and
   another. One has scarcely preached before one has to again prepare some
   other word with which to address you. As we grow older, time very
   sensibly quickens its pace.

   I know that this is an exceedingly trite observation, but I mention it
   all the more earnestly because the certainty of it should force it home
   with power upon our minds. You young people look to a month as being
   quite a period of time, but when you are getting 40, or 50, or 60, you
   will look upon a whole year as no more than a brief interval. Indeed, I
   do not wonder that Jacob said his years were few. Because he was an old
   man, he thought life short. If he had been a young man, he would have
   said that his days were comparatively many and would have tried to make
   himself feel that he had lived a long while. But when a man grows old,
   his days seem fewer than they were--and the older he gets, the shorter
   his life seems to have been! There are many ways of calculating time
   and its length or brevity lies more in idea than in fact. I have
   sometimes noticed it--I dare say you have--that an hour has seemed to
   me very long, indeed. In certain states of mind I have looked to the
   clock again and again and I have thought that I never lived such a long
   hour.

   But often and often does it occur to me that I sit down to write and
   that I go on writing--and when I lift up my head an hour has passed and
   I think to myself--"It cannot be. There is a mistake. Somehow that
   clock has made a mistake!" I have even referred to my watch and I have
   found that it was even so, but where that hour went, I do not know.
   When one is very busy, the hours glide away, so that you say, "Time is,
   after all, only a dream." Time may appear to be long, while it is
   short, and it may be really short when, according to human calculation,
   it is long. But all men, when they come to die, confess that their life
   has been brief--that it was but a step. Yesterday I was born; today I
   live; tomorrow I must die! Ephemera are born and die in the space
   between the rising and the setting sun--their life is a fair picture of
   our own. We are shadows and we come and go with the rising and the
   setting sun. Truly, "there is but a step between me and death." O my
   God, if my life is so short, prepare me for its end! Help me to stand
   ready for its close, so that I may give in my final account with joy.

   But, in another sense, there is but a step between us and death,
   namely, that life is so uncertain. How unexpectedly it ends! Strong and
   hearty men, if I might make a judgement from observation, seem to be
   among the first to fail. How often have I seen the invalid, who might
   almost long for death, draw out a long existence of continuous
   pain--while the man who shook your hand with a powerful grip and stood
   erect like a column of iron, is laid low all of a sudden and is gone!
   No man can reckon upon the full term of life--not one among us can be
   sure of reaching threescore and ten. We cannot be sure that we shall
   see old age! A bubble is more solid than human life and a spider's web
   is as a cable compared with the thread of our existence. There is but a
   step between us and death.

   And this is all the more true when we consider that there are so many
   gates to the grave. We can die anywhere, at any time, by any means. Not
   only are we in danger abroad, but at home in security we are still in
   peril. I am in my pulpit now, but I am not secure in this citadel from
   all-besieging Death! I remember a dear servant of God in a country
   town, on a certain Sabbath morning, stood up and repeated as the first
   hymn of the morning, the sacred song which I gave out just now--

   "Father, I long, I faint to see The place of Your abode: I'd leave Your
   earthly courts and flee Up to Your seat, my God"

   and he fell back and was gone! His wish was granted. He saw the place
   of God's abode, I do not doubt. There is no safety from death in the
   pulpit, nor in your own house!

   Dr. Gill, who was noted for always being in his study, said one day to
   a friend, "Well, at least if a man is in his study he is safe." Someone
   had been killed in the street through a falling chimney-pot or
   tile--and this gave emphasis to the doctor's pleasantry. But it so
   happened that, soon after, the doctor went to visit a member of his
   Church and while he was away, a stormy wind blew and blew down a stack
   of chimneys into his study--into the very place where he would have
   been sitting if he had not been called away. So he said to his friend,
   "Verily, I see I must not boast of being safe in my study, for we are
   secure nowhere." In times of battle, men may shelter behind trees or
   walls, and so escape rifle-shot, but where can you get to escape from
   the arrows of death? Wherever you are, not alone in the crowded,
   thronging streets, but up there in your own chamber, or on the edge of
   your bed, you may slip, you may fall and suffer fatal injury! At your
   table you may eat and drink and die. Wherever you are, you may well
   feel, "There is but a step between me and

   death."--

   "Dangers stand thick through all our path

   To push us to the tomb!

   And fierce diseases wait around

   To hurry mortals home."

   Therefore I would say, as I leave this point, let nobody here reckon
   upon life. Let him never postpone what ought to be done, at once, to
   some future time. I do not know whether any Brother here remembers old
   Mr. Timothy East. I knew him well in his old age. He was a man of
   careful observation and retentive memory and, in his later days, he was
   full of stories which had happened in his pastoral experience. He used
   to tell this one--A certain woman was very much attached to his
   ministry, but still a very foolish woman. She used to sit regularly on
   the pulpit stairs and she did so for many years, while Timothy East
   preached the Gospel. One thing seemed to shut her heart against all his
   appeals. She told a neighbor that if she had five minutes before she
   died, she so understood the way of salvation that she would get all
   right in that time. She told her minister that and Timothy said to her,
   "Oh, that will never do! You may not have that five minutes in which to
   set things right. Be right at once."

   Amazingly enough, one day as Mr. East went down the street, a child
   came to him and said, "Please, Sir, come and see Grandmother. Come and
   see Grandmother." He turned in and there was grandmother struck for
   death. She looked at him with an entreating glance, and said, "I am
   lost! I am lost!" She died then and there, before Mr. East could say a
   word to her about her salvation. Dear Friend, I do beseech you not to
   imitate her folly, but rather say to yourself, "There is but a step
   between me and death. Therefore, now, God help me, I will lay hold upon
   eternal life and seek and find in Christ the salvation that shall fit
   me to live and fit me to die--and fit me to rise again and fit me for
   the Judgment Day, and fit me for eternal Glory."

   There is but a step between me and death. There shall not be a step
   between me and Christ.

   II. But, dear Friends, I now turn to further remark that TO SOME, THIS
   IS ESPECIALLY TRUE. Will you bear with me when I remark that to persons
   who have reached a ripe old age this is most certainly true--"There is
   but a step between me and death"? It is inevitable in the order of
   Nature that you should not live long. Now, do not object to think about
   it and talk about it. It is only foolish persons who will not mention
   death. If you are all right with God, it can be no trouble to you to
   remember that as your years multiply, there must be so many the fewer
   in which you are to abide here below. Those also have but a step
   between them and death who are touched with some incurable disorder.
   Some are warned that they have a heart problem. If that is the case I
   may fairly say, "There is but a step between you and death." If you are
   consumptive and are gradually melting away, you are in the same case.
   What a blessing it is that this form of death gives us notice of its
   approach and does not impair the mind, so that a person may calmly seek
   and find eternal life if that disease has marked him for its own! But
   there is only a step between the consumptive and death. Those who
   follow dangerous trades are in a similar condition. The traveler across
   the deep, the fisherman, the soldier, the miner and others are
   frequently at Death's door. I need not go into the details of all those
   various processes by which men earn their bread which have so much
   danger about them that there is but a step between those who follow
   them and death.

   Besides this, there are some--and probably some in this
   congregation--who, whether it is by disease or not, will die in the
   course of a few weeks. The probabilities, if they are calculated, will
   show that out of six or 7,000 persons gathered

   here, there are certainly some, beyond all guesswork, who will not see
   the month of November--who certainly will never pass into the next
   year! There is but a step between such and death.

   I should like you to be able to think about death. If you do not like
   to think about it at all, my dear Friends, I think that there is
   something wrong with you and you ought to take warning from your own
   dislike. He that is afraid of solemn things has probably solemn reason
   to be afraid of them. It is greatly wise to talk about our last hours.
   A man who is going to a certain place should think about the place to
   which he is going and make some preparation for it. If he is a wise
   man, he will do so. I should like you to attain to such a state that
   you could feel as Dr. Watts did. He said to a friend when he was an old
   man, "I go to my bed each night with perfect indifference as to whether
   I shall wake up in this world or the next." That is a beautiful state
   of mind to be in. Or, as the old Scot minister said when someone asked
   him, "Is this disease of yours fatal?" and he replied, "I do not know,
   and I do not wish to know, for I do not think that it can make much
   difference to me, for if I go to Heaven I shall be with God, and if I
   stay here, God will be with me." Oh, is not that a sweet way of putting
   it? There is not so much difference, after all, between being with God
   and God's being with us!

   Old George the Third, who, whatever the faults of his early days, was
   undoubtedly a godly man in his old age, would have a mausoleum prepared
   for himself and family. And when Mr. Wyatt, the architect, went to see
   him by his own order, he did not know how to speak to the old king
   about his grave. But George said, "Friend Wyatt, do not mind speaking
   about my tomb. I can talk as freely to you about the preparation of a
   place for me to be buried in as I could about a drawing room for me to
   hold my court in, for I thank God that I am prepared to do my duty if I
   live--and to sleep in Jesus if I die." There are but few, I think, of
   his rank, who could talk so. But every wise man ought to see to it
   that, as he must die, he is ready for it--ready for the bar of God.
   "Ready, yes, ready," says the sailor as he grinds his cutlass and let
   the Christian say the same! Ready, yes, ready, to live to an extreme
   old age patiently waiting, or to depart out of the world unto the
   Father which is far better! In any case, finding it Heaven enough to do
   the will of God and to trust in Jesus Christ whom He has sent!

   Thus I have mentioned the cases of those of whom it may especially be
   said, "There is but a step between me and death." "Oh," said someone,
   "you are on the wrong side of 60, Mr. Jones." "No," answered Jones, "I
   am on the right side of 60, for I am on the Heaven side of it." And
   that is the way to look at our age. We say--

   "Nearer, my God, to You,"

   and then we do not like to grow old--that is absurd! No, let us rather
   rejoice that we are getting nearer the desired haven, nearer our
   everlasting rest!

   III. I am to close by asking, first, SUPPOSE IT IS NOT SO? Young
   Friends, you that are here, suppose it is not true that there is only a
   step between you and death? Suppose it is not so? There may be some
   here that will live to a very great age. I may be addressing some
   persons who will rival Sir Moses Montefiore! Possibly you may. Well,
   what then? If so, I should recommend you to follow the Scriptural
   advice, "Seek you first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness." The
   first things should come first--the best things should have the best of
   our thoughts. A prince who had been warned of assassination, gaily
   exclaimed, "Serious things tomorrow!" But before tomorrow he was slain.
   Yet had he not been slain, his speech would have been an unwise one
   for, however long we live, we ought not to push serious matters into a
   corner. If we are to live, let us live to noble purpose. It would be a
   great pity to lose a single year, much less a long life. If you are
   going to live a hundred years, begin them with God! If you are going to
   have long life, why not spend it for Him?

   There was a storm at sea, once, and there was a young man on board who
   was not used to storms. He fell into a fearful state of mind. He was
   not of much use on board the ship through his fears. He crept into a
   corner and knelt down to pray, but the captain, on coming along, could
   not stand that. He shouted, "Get up, you coward, say your prayers in
   fine weather." He did get up, saying to himself, "I only hope that I
   shall see fine weather to say my prayers in." When he landed, the words
   the captain said remained in his mind. He said, "That is quite correct,
   I will say my prayers in fine weather." I would say to you who hope to
   live a hundred years, say your prayers in fine weather. The young man
   was so impressed with those words that he went to hear the Gospel, was
   converted and became a minister of Christ! One Sunday morning, while he
   was preaching in one of the most notable pulpits in New York, that
   captain came into the Chapel and the preacher looked him in the face
   and said, "Say your prayers in fine weather." The captain was
   astonished, as he perceived that the very man whom he had addressed as
   a coward was now preaching from the pulpit and giving out, at the
   commencement of his sermon, the advice which he had given him! I trust
   the captain took his own medicine!

   I want to give that advice to all who do not think that they are going
   to die yet. Say your prayers in fine weather. Begin with God now. Oh,
   come and give my Lord Jesus the prime of your youth, the best of your
   days! I came to Christ when I was fifteen. I was a minister of the
   Gospel when I was 16 years of age. I have gone on preaching Christ ever
   since. I wish that I could have begun 16 years before! I do not regret
   of coming to Him so early and I urge you, young Friends, while yet the
   marrow is in your bones, your brain is clear and your eyes are
   true--before you have dishonored yourself and weakened your body by
   sin--come and yield yourselves up to Jesus Christ, that you may spend a
   whole life in that blessed service which is joy and peace! May the Holy
   Spirit of His great love make it so with many here present!

   Suppose that it is not true that there is but a step between you and
   death? Nevertheless, while death is at a distance, health and strength
   furnish the best time for coming to Christ. Do not imagine that when
   you are ill and near death it will be the best time to turn. I remember
   the striking words of Philip Henry, the father of the famous Matthew
   Henry. When he was dying, his friends stood round about his bed and he
   said, "What a blessing it is, Matthew, that I have not to make my peace
   with God now! My body is full of pain and my mind is greatly disturbed
   by reason of it. Oh," he said, "if that were undone and had now to be
   done, how could it be done?" What a mercy when that great transaction
   is complete! Now come pain or weakness, come long sleep, come
   broken-down spirit--what does it matter? It is all well! It is all
   well!

   That having to make our peace with God when we die is a poor business.
   I do not like the expression. I like, far better, the language of a
   poor bricklayer who fell from a scaffold and was so injured that he was
   ready to die. The clergyman of the parish came and said, "My dear man,
   I am afraid you will die. You had better make your peace with God." To
   the joy of the clergyman the man said, "Make my peace with God, Sir?
   That was made for me upon Calvary's Cross 1,800 years ago and I know
   it!" Ah, that is it--to have a peace that was made by the blood of
   Christ all those years ago--a peace that never can be broken! Then,
   come life, come death, yes, or come a lengthened life and ripe old age,
   the best preparation for a lengthened life is to know the Lord! The
   best encouragement and comfort for the decrepitude of extreme old age
   is to have a good hope through Christ! There is nothing like it!

   Why, some old folks that I have known, so far from being unhappy, have
   been the very happiest people that I have ever met with! And though
   they have lived long, they have come not to court long life, but they
   have been willing to depart! Dr. Dwight, the famous tutor, had a mother
   who lived to be over a hundred years of age and, one day, when the son
   heard the bell toll for a neighbor, the old lady said with tears in her
   eyes, "Won't it soon toll for me? Will they not soon toll for me?" Dear
   Mr. Rowland Hill used merrily to say, when he got old, that he hoped
   that they had not forgotten him. That is how he came to look at death.
   And he would go to some old woman, if he could, and sit down and say
   "Now, dear Sister, if you go before I go, mind that you give my love to
   John Bunyan and the other Johns. Tell them that Rowley is staying
   behind a little while, but he is coming on as fast as he can."

   Oh, it is a sweet thing to gradually melt away and have the tenement
   gently taken down and yet not to feel any trouble about it, but to know
   that you are in the great Father's hands--and you shall wake up where
   old age and infirmities will all have passed away, and where, in
   everlasting youth, you shall behold the face of Him you love! That is
   suppose that it is not so.

   IV. But now SUPPOSE THAT IT IS SO? Suppose that it is so and suppose,
   as yet, that you have no good hope. Dear Friend, there is a word that I
   would like to drop into your ear. If there is but a step between you
   and death, yet there is only a step between you and Jesus. There is
   only a step between you and salvation! God help you to take that step
   tonight. You know the description of the way to Heaven--"Take the first
   on the right by the Cross and keep straight on." May you take that step
   tonight! It is not a step even, it is only a look--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One." Why delay it? Since
   faith in Christ will put you beyond danger and will put you beyond the
   dominion of sin, so that you will live a godly life which shall
   continue to the end, why not believe in Jesus now? Why not cast
   yourself upon Him now? For suppose it is so? Suppose that it is written
   in the book, "you shall die, and not live"--then is it not your wisdom
   that you should at once close in with Christ and find eternal salvation
   in Him?

   Suppose that it is so, that you are soon to die? Then set your house in
   order. Get everything ready with regard to your temporal affairs. Mind
   that! A world of sorrow comes through people not having made their
   wills. Have everything in order. Trim the ship when a storm is
   expected. Be ready, for you are about to die. Now sit loose by all
   earthly things. You must assuredly part with them soon--do not hold
   them tightly. "Set not your affection upon things on earth," or

   you will weep when you lose your idols. If you harbor any anger in your
   heart, turn it out at once, for you are going to die. If there is any
   quarrel between you and anybody else, go home and settle it. Whether
   you are going to live or die, I advise you to do that. Hold no ill-will
   to anyone, for you are so soon to die. I remember well the story of a
   husband who had grieved his wife. I do not know what had happened--some
   little awkward word or deed. He went out of the house. He had to fell
   timber that day and he turned back and said, "Wife, I am very sorry.
   Let us part good friends. Give me a kiss." Alas, she turned away! All
   day long she sorrowed, for she loved him well and she grieved to think
   that he was gone without that kiss of love. He never came back again
   alive. Four men brought him home a corpse. She would have given a
   thousand worlds if they had not parted so!

   Now, do not part with anybody that you love with any kind of tiffs or
   quarrellings. End all that, for death is near. If there is but a step
   between you and death--if the Judge is at the door--go and wind up your
   little difficulties. You that have family quarrels, wipe them out. You
   that have got any malice in your heart, turn it out. Oh, if it is only
   a step between us and death, then you that are unprepared, it is only a
   step between you and Hell! Escape, I pray you, by the living God! As
   you love your souls, flee for your lives and lay hold on Christ. But if
   you are in Christ, it is only a step between you and Heaven! You may
   well desire that you might take that step right speedily! I shall never
   forget one summer afternoon, when I was preaching in a village Chapel
   about the joys of Heaven, that an elderly lady sitting on my right kept
   looking at me with intense delight.

   Some people's eyes greatly help the preacher. A telegraph goes on
   between us. She seemed to say to me, "Bless God for that. How I am
   enjoying it!" She kept drinking in the Truth of God and I poured out
   more and more precious things about the Eternal Kingdom and the sight
   of the Well-Beloved, till I saw what I thought was a strange light pass
   over her face. I went on and those eyes were still fixed on me. She sat
   still as a marble figure and I stopped and said, "Friends, I think that
   yon Sister over there is dead." They said that it was even so and they
   bore her away. She had gone. While I was telling of Heaven, she had
   gone there! And I remember saying that I wished that it had been my
   case as well as hers. It was better not, perhaps, for many reasons, but
   oh, I did envy her!

   I am always looking for the day when I shall see her again! I shall
   know those eyes, I am sure I shall! I shall remember that face, if in
   Heaven she is anything like what she was here, or bears any marks of
   identification. I shall not forget that inward fellowship which existed
   between a soul that stood with wings outspread for Glory and the poor
   preacher who was trying to talk of that which he knew but little of
   compared with her. Well, well, it will soon be my turn. Good night,
   poor world! It will soon be your turn and then you shall say, "Good
   night." Let us meet in Glory! Let us meet in Glory, for Jesus Christ's
   sake. Amen.

Love's Transformations--a Communion Meditation

   (No. 1871)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON SEPTEMBER 4, 1881.

   "If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go unto the
   Father." John 14:28.

   THE loving Jesus saw a shade of sadness fall upon the faces of the 12
   while He talked to them of His departure. Though He was, Himself, to
   die, with His usual self-forgetfulness He only thought of them and He
   desired to comfort them--to comfort them about the present sorrow of
   His departure. See how skillfully, how wisely He drew upon their love
   for their comfort. The most common and usual source of comfort is
   Christ's love to us, but in this instance the most applicable and the
   most influential source of comfort was their love to Him. He said,
   therefore, to them, "If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said,
   I go unto the Father." It was well and wisely spoken, for He touched
   them upon a point in which they were very tender--if anything could
   move them to comfort, it would be His appeal to their loyal love. He
   had appealed to that, before, when He said, "If you love Me, keep My
   commandments," but now, in softer, sweeter, more tender tones, He seems
   to say, "If you love Me, cease your sorrow and begin to rejoice."

   The Lord may give us drink from that same spring. It is a lower spring
   compared with the upper spring of His own sweet love, but He may cause
   it to flow most preciously so that when we are not bold enough to drink
   of the higher stream, we may taste of this. If we are able to say, "You
   know all things, You know that I love You," we may be cheered by that
   Truth of God. "So surely as you do love Me," says Christ, "you will
   rejoice rather than sorrow because I said, I go unto My Father." Oh,
   what a blessed Master we serve, who quotes our love, not to blame us
   for its feebleness, but to draw a happy inference from it! So much does
   He desire our peace, our restfulness in His own dear Self, that even
   the love we give to Him, He gives back to us and bids us find comfort
   in it!

   Let that stand as a preface. And now I shall deal with the text by way
   of making some three or four observations upon it.

   I. And the first is this--IT WILL BE MUCH FOR OUR COMFORT TO TRY TO SEE
   THINGS IN CHRIST'S LIGHT. Notice the expression, "If you loved Me, you
   would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father."

   Christ had told them that He was about to die. He had said in very
   plain language on a former occasion, "The Son of Man shall be betrayed
   unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn Him
   to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to
   scourge, and to crucify Him." But now He looks at the matter in another
   light. His present view of it is, "I go unto the Father." Their view of
   it was, "Jesus is to die." His view of it was, "I go unto My Father."
   Oh, how often our hearts would grow happy if we could but see things in
   Christ's light! Let us try to do so.

   For, here observe, that Christ sees through things. You and I look at
   them and we see Pilate, Herod, the judgement seat, the scourge, the
   Cross, the spear, the sepulcher--but Jesus looks through them and He
   sees the Father's Throne and Himself exalted upon it. Could we not,
   sometimes, try to see affairs in Christ's light by looking through
   them? Come, Brothers and Sisters, that present affliction which seems
   not to be joyous but grievous, nevertheless, afterwards yields the
   peaceable fruits of righteousness! Can you not look at the,
   "afterwards," and thus discern the end as the Lord does? Your present
   estate is tossed about and troubled, for you are on a stormy sea, but
   you are being tossed towards the port and driven, even, by the storm,
   towards your desired haven! Can you not see through matters as Jesus
   did? Why dwell always on this life? Can you not see what it leads to?
   "The way may be rough, but it cannot be long." And then comes an
   eternity of joy! Can you not spy this out? Your Lord did, for though
   His passage into Glory was infinitely rougher than yours--though He had
   to swim through seas of blood and breast the breakers of Hell, itself,
   in His death-pangs--yet He

   looked beyond all and said, "I go unto the Father." See things in
   Christ's light! See the end as well as the beginning and the
   middle--and you will be comforted!

   Do you not see, too, that the light in which Christ sees things is such
   that He notices the bearing of things? He says, in effect, "If you
   could see My death as I see it--as a going unto the Father--you would
   rejoice." He sees the ultimate result and bearing of things. Oh, if we
   could always do the same and perceive what will come of our present
   sorrow! And if we just understood what it tends to and what God means
   to bring out of it all, then we should not so much see the fire as the
   pure ingot that comes forth of it! Then we should not so much see the
   plowing and the scattering of the seed to be buried beneath frost and
   snow, but we should hear the shouts of harvest and see the yellow
   sheaves gathered into the garner. Oh, to see Providences in Christ's
   light!

   But I do not mean to dwell upon this. I only want to throw out the
   thought so that every troubled one may now think of his own case as
   Christ would think of it. If you have a sorrow, how would Jesus deal
   with this sorrow if it were His own? If you are, just now, in darkness,
   what would be Christ's outlook from the window of faith? What would He
   see as coming out of this affliction? There is no better rule for
   Christian conduct than, "What would Jesus do?" I was much struck when I
   saw that question hanging up in our Orphanage girls' school--"What
   would Jesus do?" Friend, this is what you should do! What does Jesus
   think about trial?--for according to the measure of your capacity, my
   Brothers and Sisters, that is what you should think of it. Try this
   holy rule and you will find the major part of your sorrows transformed
   into joys. A clear understanding of the nature of our trial would lead
   us to glory in tribulation! All that has to do with Jesus is joyous
   when seen in His light! If you understood His passion, you would see
   His Glory. If you understood His tomb, you would see His Resurrection.
   If you understood His death, you would see His Throne.

   II. Our second observation is this--OUR LOVE OUGHT TO GO TOWARDS OUR
   LORD'S PERSON. "If you loved Me, you would rejoice." Come, my dear
   Friends, gather up your thoughts a minute while I remind you that the
   best love that we have should go to Jesus Christ, Himself--not so much
   to His salvation, as to Himself, should our hearts fly. "If you loved
   Me, you would rejoice." We do well to love Christ's house, His day, His
   Bible, His Church, His service, His blood and His Throne--but we must,
   above all these things, love His Person. That is the tender point; "we
   love Him" and other things in Him. We love His Church for His sake; His
   truth because it is His truth; His Cross because He bore it for us and
   His salvation because purchased by His blood. I counsel you to pull up
   the sluices of your love and let the full tide flow towards Jesus.

   For, first, He is the source of all benefits. Therefore, in loving Him
   you value the benefits, but you trace them to their fountainhead.
   Should we love the gift better than the giver? Should the wife love her
   jewels better than the beloved one who gave them? It must not be so!
   Love the very Person of Jesus--the God, the Man, Emmanuel, God With Us.
   Realize Him as a distinct Existence. Let Him stand before you now "with
   scars of honor in His flesh and triumph in His eyes" as we sang just
   now. Love Him as the Source of your hope, your pardon, your life, your
   future Glory!

   Loving Him, we learn to prize all His gifts the more, for he that loves
   the giver values the smallest gift for the giver's sake. Your love to
   the Person of Jesus will not make you think less of the benefits which
   He bestows, but infinitely more. Shoot at the center of the target.
   Love Him and, loving Him, you will value all that He gives.

   Loving Jesus, we have Him for our own and that is a great blessing. A
   man may love gold and not have it. A man may love fame and not have it.
   But he that loves Christ has Christ, for certainly there was never yet
   a hand of love stretched out to embrace Him unlawfully! He is the
   property of all who lay hold of Him with their hearts.

   Love Him, and then you will sympathize with Him. His work will awaken
   your greatest interest. When His cause seems to decline, you will
   grieve with Him. And when He wins the day, you will shout the victory
   with Him. Love Him and you will love the souls of men. Love Jesus and
   you will seek to bring sinners to Him. Nothing can do you so much good
   and fit you so well for His service as to love Him. Love Him and you
   will love His people, for never heart did love Christ and hate His
   Church. He that loves the Head loves the members. "Everyone that loves
   Him that begat, loves him, also, that is begotten of Him. We know that
   we love Jesus when we love the Brethren.

   Love Christ and you will have a possession which will last forever, for
   other things expire, but love never fails. "Whether there are
   prophecies, they shall fail; whether there are tongues, they shall
   cease." But he that loves, possesses a coin that is current in the
   skies. He shall go on to love forever. When the sun shall be darkened
   and the stars shall fall from Heaven like withered leaves, he that
   loves Jesus shall still go on to love and find in that love his Heaven!

   Remember, if you love the Son, the Father will love you. That is a
   precious Word of His which you will find in the 16th Chapter of John,
   at the 27th Verse. There is a common Object of love between the
   Believer and the Father. When you glorify Christ, the Father says,
   "Amen," to what you do. There is no lover of the Christ equal to the
   Father. "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His
   hands." Therefore love the Son and yield all honor to Him, even as the
   Father does.

   If you love Him you may well do so. It is necessary--absolutely
   necessary--that you should love your own Lord, for I will tell you a
   secret thing, only to be whispered in the believing ear--you are
   married to Him--and what is the marriage state without love? What,
   then, would the Church be to Christ if she loved Him not? What a
   wretched farce this union would be if there were no love between the
   soul and Christ to whom it is united! You are a member of His body--
   shall not the hand love the Head? Shall not the foot love the Head? God
   forbid that we should be without love to Jesus Christ--love to His own
   altogether lovely Self. May God the Holy Spirit work in us abundantly
   to love Jesus who tenderly says, "If you loved Me, you would rejoice!"

   III. My third observation is that SOMETIMES OUR SORROWS PUT A QUESTION
   ON OUR LOVE. Do you not notice that it was because they were very
   sorrowful, not seeing things in the Master's light, that Jesus said,
   "If you loved Me, you would rejoice"? Let us try, tonight, to check the
   sorrow which may be in our bosoms at this hour, since it may cast an,
   "if," upon our love to Christ.

   Notice that if sorrow about the loss of an earthly thing eats into your
   heart, it puts an, "if," upon your love to Christ. Many are the cries
   of woe--"Alas, I have lost my property! I have lost the old house in
   which my fathers lived. I have lost my job! I have lost my dearest
   friend!" Is it, therefore, true that because of this loss, you have no
   joy left? Have you lost your Savior? I thought you called Him your
   Best-Beloved and you said that He was your All--is He also gone? Did I
   not hear you say, "Whom have I in Heaven but You? And there is none
   upon earth that I desire beside You"? Is that true? Oh, over-burdened
   heart! Oh, heavy spirit! Do you love Jesus? Then why are you
   disconsolate? An, "if," comes up when we think of your despair.

   So, too, when we too much repine under personal affliction, a question
   is suggested. You may be ill, tonight, or you may be fearing that an
   illness is coming. Or you may be in pain or weakness. Because you fear
   that consumption is upon you, your heart is very heavy. Truly, it is a
   sad thing to be diseased, but who sent you this? Whose will is it that
   it should be so? Who is the Lord of the house? Is not the grief your
   Lord's will, your Savior's will? You say you love Him and yet you will
   not let Him have His way and are in a pet with Him and would dispute
   His love in sending this affliction! Is that so, my Brother? Does not
   that murmuring of yours put an, "if," of question upon your love to
   your blessed Savior?

   You say, too, that you have been trusting Him and yet you have fallen
   into difficulties and straits. You do not know which way to turn and
   you suspect that His Providence is not wise. Do you think so? If you
   loved Him as you should, would you think so? Is there not an, "if,"
   somewhere? I do not mean an, "if," about your loving Him, but about
   your loving Him as you ought! I think if you loved Him as He deserves,
   you would say, "The King can do no wrong. My King is kind, wise,
   loving. I yield everything into His blessed hands."

   And so your sorrow is occasioned by the fear of death! You go burdened
   every day about death, do you? That is a poor compliment to the
   Well-Beloved. I thought you loved Him! Love Him--and not wish to see
   His face? It is a dark passage, is it? Oh, if the way were still
   darker, since He is on the other side, let us pass through it with a
   song! To be with Him where He is--are you reluctant? Reluctant to
   behold His face? Reluctant to be forever in His bosom? Is there not an,
   "if," somewhere?

   No, your grief is not about your death--it is about those that have
   died whom you loved. You cannot forgive God for taking away those you
   loved so well. Who has them, Friend? Who has them? I will tell you. It
   is One who, when He was here, said, "Father, I will that they, also,
   whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am." He prayed for them! He
   died for them! And now He has His own and you are displeased? Do you
   stand fretting because Christ has His own? What? Are you pettish
   because what He lent you, for a while, He has taken back? Were not your
   dear ones always more His than yours? Do you love Him, then, and grudge
   your child, your baby to Jesus? Do you grudge your mother, your
   brother, your wife, your husband to Him that bought them with His
   blood? Oh, I say again, it puts an, "if," upon your love--not on the
   existence of it, but on the degree of it. If you loved Him, you would
   rejoice that He sees the travail of His soul and has His saints with
   Him in Glory.

   IV. That brings me to the closing remark, which contains the gist of
   the text. All the rest is meant to lead up to it, namely, this--that
   OUR LOVE TO OUR DIVINE LORD OUGHT TO BE SUCH THAT HIS EXALTATION,

   THOUGH IT SHOULD BE OUR LOSS, SHOULD, NEVERTHELESS, GIVE US UNFEIGNED
   DELIGHT. I will put

   this very simply before you. There is a daughter of yours in Christ and
   she is fading away by consumption. She is very happy in the Lord and
   full of joyful expectation. She is about to die and you are all round
   the bed. You, her dear mother, stand there weeping most of all. Now,
   your dear girl shall give you an explanation of my text. She says,
   "Mother, do you not know that I shall soon be with the angels and shall
   see the face of God, without fault? If you loved me, Mother, you would
   rejoice to think that I shall be away from all this weakness and this
   pain. If you love me, you will be glad to think that your child shall
   be in Glory." Your girl's sweet words shall tell you what Jesus meant.
   He meant, "If you loved Me very much. If you loved Me--not merely My
   Presence and the comforts that I bring you, and the charm with which I
   invest your earthly life--but if you loved Me, you would say, 'Blessed
   Lord, we readily deny ourselves Your company and all the joy it brings
   because it is better for You to be gone to the Father. It is more
   glorious for You to be in Heaven than here and, therefore, we rejoice
   in Your exaltation.'"

   You see how it was with those disciples. I need not enlarge upon their
   case. When Jesus had died and risen again-- and had gone away from His
   disciples, He took upon Himself the Glory which He had laid aside. The
   Glory which He had with God before the world was, He reassumed at the
   time when He entered Heaven! Then, too, as the God-Man, He was invested
   with a new splendor. The Father said, "Let all the angels of God
   worship Him," and they adored Him. New songs went up from every golden
   street and all Heaven rang with, "Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!" as Christ
   ascended to His Throne, To the Throne He ascends and there He sits,
   King and Priest, forever enthroned until His enemies are made His
   footstool. No more the bloody sweat--no more the cruel spear--no more
   the dark and lonesome tomb! He is exalted above all exaltation, higher
   than the kings of the earth, far above all principalities and powers
   and every name that is named! We ought to be glad of this--exceedingly
   glad. These disciples were bound to be glad if they loved Christ, for
   though they could no more enjoy His company, could not sit at the table
   with Him, could not walk through the streets with Him any more, yet it
   was good for Him to be gone to Glory and, therefore, they were
   compelled to rejoice!

   I want, in conclusion, to draw one or two parallel cases which may be
   practically applicable to yourselves.

   Suppose, Beloved, that it should always be for Christ's Glory to leave
   you in the dark? Would you not rejoice to have it so? A little while
   ago it was so with me. A few years ago I remember preaching to you from
   the text, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me," and I think that
   if ever soul of mortal man knew the biter meaning of that cry, I did. I
   preached hearing the clanking of my own chains while I spoke to you. It
   was sad work. That night, before I went home, I knew the reason. There
   came into the vestry a man as nearly insane as man could be. Despair
   hung like a cloud over his countenance and, as he took my hand, he
   said, "I have never met a man before that seemed to know where I am.
   Talk with me." I saw him the next day and several days and, by God's
   help, saved him from self-destruction. Then did I rejoice because I saw
   that Christ was glorified! I would lose my Master's company, dark as
   the day would be to me without it--lose it, yes, by the months
   together--if it would make Him glorious in the heart of one poor
   downcast man, or bring a single sinner to His feet!

   Be willing to say the same, Brothers and Sisters. Love Christ and be
   willing for Him to give you the cold shoulder instead of the kiss of
   His lips if He might be more glorified! God bring us to reach that
   state of self-denial to be willing to forego that greatest luxury of
   Heaven for which angels themselves pine--the Presence of the Lord--if
   thereby Jesus may be the better served.

   Well, now, suppose that you are going to be laid aside, afflicted,
   troubled and it should be God's intent that by this you should become
   more useful and more fitted for His service? If you love Him, you will
   rejoice at this. You will accept chastisement with thankfulness and
   say, "Lay on the stripes! Multiply the pain! Only fashion me so that I
   can glorify You! Make no account of anything else but this--that You
   may be exalted in my mortal body whether I live or whether I

   die!"

   It is possible, dear Friend, that you are going to be eclipsed by one
   who has a brighter light than any God has yet given you. None of us
   like this. Somebody is coming forward who will preach better than you.
   That Sunday school teacher is going to teach better than you. Somebody
   near you will display more Grace and more gifts than you. What then? If
   you love Jesus you will rejoice that it should be so! Do you remember
   what Paul did? There were some who

   preached Christ out of contention and ill-will and wanted to get the
   better of Paul. They desired that their names would be cried up above
   the Apostles. "Ah," said Paul, "so long as Christ is preached I
   rejoice, yes, and will rejoice!" Well spoken, Paul!

   I like the valor of the soldier who helped to fill the ditch with his
   dead body that his captain might march to victory. Throw yourselves
   into oblivion that Jesus may triumph! It were a small sacrifice for all
   the Church to die a martyr's death if Jesus were but raised one inch
   the higher among men! Let us exhibit the self-denying spirit which is
   born of love. "If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go
   unto the Father."

   Suppose that it should also happen that some of you are going to be
   deprived of all the privileges of hearing the Gospel because you are
   going away to a foreign land? You are extremely sorry, but suppose that
   Jesus means to make use of you to advance His Glory among the
   heathen--by naming His name where it was never known before? Then you
   may rejoice in banishment, rejoice to deny yourselves Gospel
   privileges, rejoice to be scattered far and wide by mountain, stream
   and sea so that you might bring forth a harvest to His Glory!

   Brethren, if you should be sinking lower and lower in your own esteem,
   be not sorry for it. If Christ is rising higher and higher in your
   esteem, count it all gain! Sink, O self, down to death and the abyss!
   Sink, sink, till there is nothing left of you! Go down, pride,
   self-conceit, self-trust, self-seeking! Go even though your going
   should cause despondency, so long as Christ is crowned! Sink, sink,
   Soul, if Jesus rises! If you can trust Him better, love Him better and
   admire Him more, so let it be!

   As you come to His Table, say in your hearts, "Lord, make me glad, or
   make me sad, so long as You are exalted! Lord, let me have Your
   presence, but let me be without it, so long us You are exalted and
   extolled!"

My Comfort In Affliction

   (No. 1872)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON JULY 7, 1881.

   "This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your Word has quickened me."
   Psalm 119:50.

   IT is almost needless for me to say that, in some respects, the same
   events happen unto all men alike--in the matter of afflictions it is
   certainly so. None of us can expect to escape trial. If you are
   ungodly, "many sorrows shall be to the wicked." If you are godly, "many
   are the afflictions of the righteous." If you walk in the ways of
   holiness, you shall find that there are stumbling blocks cast in the
   way by the enemy. If you walk in the ways of unrighteousness, you shall
   be taken in snares and held there even unto death. There is no escaping
   trouble! We are born to it as the sparks fly upward. When we are born
   the second time, though we inherit innumerable mercies, we are
   certainly born to another set of troubles, for we enter upon spiritual
   trials, spiritual conflicts, spiritual pains and so forth--and thus we
   get a double set of distresses, as well as twofold mercies.

   He who wrote this 119th Psalm was a good man, but assuredly he was an
   afflicted man. Many times did David sorrow and sorrow sorely. The man
   after God's own heart was one who felt God's own hand in chastisement.
   David was a king and, therefore, it would be folly on our part to
   suppose that men who are wealthier and greater than we are, are more
   screened from affliction--it is quite the reverse. The higher up the
   mountain, the more boisterous the winds. Depend upon it, that the
   middle state for which Agur prayed, "Give me neither poverty nor
   riches," is, upon the whole, the best! Greatness, prominence,
   popularity, nobility, royalty bring no relief from trial, but rather an
   increase of it. Nobody who consulted his own comfort would enter upon
   dignities attended with so much labor and sore travail. Child of God,
   remember that neither goodness nor greatness can deliver you from
   affliction! You have to face it, whatever your position in
   life--therefore face it with dauntless courage and extort victory from
   it.

   Yet, even if you do face it, you will not escape it. Even if you cry to
   God to help you, He will help you through the trouble, but He will
   probably not turn it aside from you. He will deliver you from evil, but
   He may yet lead you into trial. He has promised that He will deliver
   you in six troubles and that in seven there shall no evil touch you,
   but He does not promise that either six or seven trials shall be kept
   from you. One like unto the Son of God was with the three holy children
   in the fire, but He was not with them till they were in the fire--at
   least not visibly--and He was not so with them as either to quench the
   flame, or to prevent their being cast into it. "I am with you, Israel,
   passing through the fire," may well describe the Covenant assurance.

   May we realize the fire if only thus we can realize the Divine
   Presence! Gladly may we accept the furnace if we may but find the
   company of the Son of God with us there. Every child of God among you
   can, with the Psalmist, speak of my affliction. You may not be able to
   speak of my estate, my heritage, my wealth, my health--but you can all
   speak of my affliction. No man is a monopolist of misery. A portion of
   the black draught of sorrow is left for others. Of that cup we must all
   drink, little or much, and we must drink of it as God ordains. So far,
   then, one event happens to all.

   My objective at this time is to show the difference between the
   Christian and the worldling in his affliction. First, Believers have in
   their affliction a peculiar comfort--"This is my comfort in my
   affliction." Secondly, that comfort comes from a peculiar source--"For
   Your Word has quickened me." And, thirdly, that peculiar comfort is
   valuable under very special trials such as are mentioned in the
   context.

   I. First, then, Believers have their PECULIAR COMFORT under affliction.
   "This," says David, "is my comfort in my affliction." "This"--dwell on
   the word, "this," as different from the consolations of other men. The
   drunk takes his cup and he quotes Solomon, "Give strong drink unto him
   that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that are of heavy

   hearts." And, as he quaffs his cup, he says, "This is my comfort in my
   affliction." The miser hides his gold, takes down his purse, and chinks
   it. Oh, the music of those golden notes! And he cries, "This is my
   comfort in my affliction." Men mostly have some comfort or other. Some
   have allowable comforts, though they are but of minor quality. They
   find comfort in the sympathy of men, in domestic kindness, in
   philosophic reflection, in homely content--but such comforts generally
   fail--always fail when the trial becomes exceedingly severe.

   Now, just as the wicked man and the worldly man can say of this or
   that, "This is my comfort," the Christian comes forward and, bringing
   with him the Word of God brimming with rich promises, he says, "This is
   my comfort in my affliction." You put down your comfort and I put down
   mine. "This is my comfort"--he is evidently not ashamed of it. He is
   evidently ready to set forth his solace in preference to all others.
   And while others say, I derive consolation from this, and I from that,
   David opens the Holy Scripture and cheerfully exclaims, "This is my
   comfort." Can you say the same? "This" in opposition to everything
   else--this promise of God, this Covenant of His Grace--"This is my
   comfort."

   Now read, "this" in another sense, as indicating that he knew what it
   was. "This is my comfort." He can explain what it is. Many Christian
   people get a comfort out of God's Word, out of believing in Christ and
   out of religious exercises, but they can hardly tell what the comfort
   is. A rose smells sweetly to a man who does not know the name of the
   rose. A rose-grower tells me, "This is the Marshal Niel." Thank you,
   dear Sir, but I do not know who Marshal Niel is, or was or why the
   flower bears his name. But I can smell the rose all the same. So, many
   people cannot explain doctrines, but they enjoy them. After all,
   experience is better than exposition. Yet it is a splendid thing when
   the two go together, so that the Believer can say to his friend,
   "Listen, I will tell you, 'This is my comfort.'"

   "I saw how happy you were, dear Friend, when you were in trouble. I saw
   you sick the other day and I noticed your patience. I knew you to be
   slandered and I saw how calm you were. Can you tell me why you were so
   calm and self-contained?" It is a very happy thing if the Christian can
   turn round and answer such a question fully. I like to see him ready to
   give a reason for the hope that is in him with meekness and fear,
   saying--"This is my comfort in my affliction." I want you, if you have
   enjoyed comfort from God, to get it packed up in such a form that you
   can pass it on to a friend! Get it explained to your own understanding
   so that you can tell others what it is, so that they may taste the
   consolation with which God has comforted you. Be ready to explain to
   young beginners--"This is my comfort in my affliction."

   Again, "this" is used in another sense, that is, as having the thing
   near at hand. I do not like speaking of my comfort from God and saying,
   that is my comfort, that is the solace which I enjoyed long ago. Oh,
   no, no! You need a comfort that you can press to your bosom, and say,
   "This is my comfort," this which I have here at this present time!
   "This" is the word which indicates nearness. "This is my comfort." Do
   you enjoy it now? You were so happy once. Are you as happy now?--

   "What peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How sweet their memory still!"
   Yes, that is very well, Cowper, but it would be better to sing--

   "What peaceful hours I now enjoy! How sweet the present hour"?

   "This is my comfort." I still have it with me--as my affliction is
   present with me, so my consolation is present with me!

   You have heard, the classic story of the Rhodian who said that at such
   and such a place he had made a jump of many yards. He bragged till a
   Greek, who stood by, chalked out the distance and said, "Would you mind
   jumping half that length now?" So I have heard people talk of what
   enjoyments they once had, what delights they once had. I have heard of
   a man who has the roots of depravity dug out of him and, as for sin, he
   has almost forgotten what it is! I would like to watch that brother
   when under the influence of rheumatism. I do not want him to have it
   long, but I should like him to have a twinge or two, that I might see
   whether some roots of corruption do not remain. I think that when he
   was tried in that way, or if not just in that way, in some other, he
   would find that there was a rootlet or two still in the soil. If a
   storm were to come on, perhaps our brave dry-land sailor might not find
   his anchor quite so easy to cast overboard as he now thinks it is. You
   smile at the talk of modern perfectionism and so do I, but I am sick of
   it! I do not believe in it. It is so utterly contrary to that which I
   have to learn every day, of my own unworthiness, that I feel a contempt
   for it. Do have your comforts always handy--pray God that that which
   was a consolation years ago may still be a consolation, so that you may
   say, "This is my comfort in my affliction."

   Again, I think the word, "this," is meant as pleading it in prayer. Let
   me read the previous verse, "Remember the Word unto Your servant upon
   which You have caused me to hope." That is Your promise which you have
   made me to hope upon, Lord--fulfill it to me--for this, Your promise,
   is my comfort in my affliction and I plead it in prayer! Suppose,
   Brothers and Sisters, you and I are enabled to take comfort out of a
   promise. We have, in that fact, a good argument to plead with God. We
   may say, "Lord, I have so believed this promise of Yours that I have
   been persuaded that I had in my possession the blessing promised to me.
   And now, shall I be ashamed by this, my hope? Will You not honor Your
   Word, seeing You have caused me to rest upon it?" Is not this good
   pleading? "Remember Your Word unto Your servant, upon which You have
   caused me to hope, for this is already my comfort. And You will have
   given me a false comfort and led me into error if Your Word should
   fail. O my Lord, since I have sucked my comfort out of the expectation
   of what You are about to do, surely by this You are pledged and bound
   to Your servant--that You will keep Your Word!" Hence the word "this"
   is seen to be a very comprehensive word. May the Spirit of God teach
   each of us to say of our priceless Bible, "This is my comfort in my
   affliction."

   II. We pass on to note, secondly, that this comfort comes from A
   PECULIAR SOURCE--"This is my comfort, for Your Word has quickened me."
   The comfort, then, is partly outward, coming from God's Word, but it is
   mainly and preeminently inward, for it is God's Word experienced as to
   its quickening power within the soul.

   First, it is God's Word that comforts. Why do we look anywhere else for
   consolation but to God's Word? Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I am ashamed
   to have to say it, but we go to our neighbors, or relatives and we cry,
   "Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends!" and it ends with
   our crying, "Miserable comforters are you all!" We turn to the pages of
   our past life and look there for comfort, but this may also fail us.
   Though experience is a legitimate source of comfort, yet when the sky
   is dark and lowering, experience is apt to minister fresh distress! If
   we were to go at once to God's Word and search it till we found a
   promise suitable to our case, we should find relief far sooner. All
   cisterns dry up--only the fountain remains. Next time you are troubled,
   reach down to the Bible. Say to your soul, "Soul, sit still and hear
   what God the Lord will speak, for He will speak peace unto His people."

   You read one promise, and you feel, "No, that hardly meets the case.
   Here is another, but it is made to a special character and I am afraid
   I am not that character. Here, thank God, is one that just fits me, as
   a key fits the wards of a lock." When you find such a promise, use it
   at once. John Bunyan beautifully pictures a pilgrim laid by the heels
   in Giant Despair's castle and there beaten with a crab tree cudgel till
   one morning he puts his hand into his bosom and cries to his brother,
   Christian, "What a fool have I been to lie rotting in this noisome
   dungeon, when all this time I have a key in my bosom which will open
   every door in Doubting Castle!" "Say you so, my Brother," says
   Christian, "pluck it out, and let us use it at once!" This key, which
   is called Promise, is thrust into the first lock and the door flies
   open! And then it is tried upon the next and the next with quick
   results. Though the great iron gate had a rusted lock in which the key
   did terribly grate and grind, yet it did open and the prisoners were
   free from the vile durance of their mistrust! The Promise has always
   opened the gate and every gate--yes, the gates of despair shall be
   opened with that key called Promise, if a man does but know how to hold
   it firmly and turn it wisely till the bolt flies back.

   "This is my comfort in my affliction," says the Psalmist--God's own
   Word. Dear Friends, fly to this comfort with speed in every time of
   trouble--get to be familiar with God's Word so that you may do so. I
   have found it helpful to carry "Clarke's Precious Promises" in my
   pocket, so as to refer to it in the hour of trial. If you go into the
   market and are likely to do a ready-money business, you always take a
   checkbook with you. So carry precious promises with you, that you may
   plead the Word of God which suits your case. I have turned to promises
   for the sick when I have been of that number, or to promises to the
   poor, the despondent, the weary and such like, according to my own
   condition, and I have always found a Scripture fitted to my case. I do
   not need a promise made to the sick when I am perfectly well. I do not
   need balm for a broken heart when my soul is rejoicing in the Lord--but
   it is very handy to know where to lay your hands upon suitable Words of
   cheer when necessity arises. Thus the external comfort of the Christian
   is the Word of God.

   Now for the internal part of his consolation. "This is my comfort in my
   affliction, for Your Word has quickened me." Oh, it is not the letter,
   but the Spirit which is our real comfort! We look not to that Book
   which consists of so much binding, so much paper and so much ink, but
   to the living Witness within the Book! The Holy Spirit embodies Himself
   in these blessed Words of God and works upon our hearts so that we are
   quickened by the Word! It is this which is the true comfort of the
   soul.

   When you read the promise and it is applied with power to you. When you
   read the Law and it works with force upon your conscience. When you
   read any part of God's Word and it gives life to your spirit--then it
   is that you get the comfort of it! I have heard of persons reading so
   many chapters a day and getting through the Bible in a year--a very
   admirable habit, no doubt--but it may be performed so mechanically that
   no good, whatever, may come of it. You need to pray earnestly over the
   Word, that it may quicken you, or otherwise it will not be a comfort to
   you. Let us think of what our comfort is in the time of affliction from
   our soul's being quickened by the Lord. Comfort comes thus--God's Word
   has, in past days, quickened us. It has been a Word of Life from the
   dead. In our affliction we, therefore, remember how God has brought us
   out of spiritual death and made us alive--and this cheers us. If you
   can say, "Whatever pain I suffer, whatever grief I endure, yet I am a
   living child of God," then you have a wellspring of comfort! It is
   better to be the most afflicted child of God than to be the happy
   worldling. Better be God's dog than the devil's darling. Child of God,
   comfort yourself with this--if God has not given me a soft bed, nor
   left me a whole skin, yet He has quickened me by His Word and this is a
   choice favor. Thus our first quickening from spiritual death is a sunny
   memory.

   After we are made alive we need to be quickened in duty, to be
   quickened in joy, to be quickened in every holy exercise and we are
   happy if the Word has given us this repeated quickening. If, in looking
   back, dear Friend, you can say, "Your Word has quickened me. I have had
   much joy in hearing Your Word. I have been made full of energy through
   Your Word. I have been made to run in the way of Your Commandments
   through Your Word"--all this will be a great comfort to you. You can
   then plead--"O Lord, while You may have denied me much of the joy that
   some people have, yet You have often quickened me. Oh, be it so again,
   for this is my comfort!" I hope I am speaking to many experienced
   Christians who can say that God's Word has very frequently refreshed
   them when they have been in the depths of distress and fetched them up
   from the gates of the grave. And if they can bear this testimony, they
   know what comfort there is in the quickening of the Word of God and
   they will ask to feel that quickening influence, again, so they may be
   of good comfort.

   Brothers and Sisters, it is a very strange thing that when God wills to
   do one thing, He often does another. When He wants to comfort us, what
   does He do? Does He comfort us? Yes, and no. He quickens us and so He
   comforts us. Sometimes the roundabout way is the straight way. God does
   not give the comfort we ask for by a distinct act, but He quickens us
   and so we obtain comfort. Here is a person very low and depressed. What
   does a wise doctor do? He does not give strong drink to act as a
   temporary stimulus to his spirits, for this would end in a reaction in
   which the man would sink lower. No, he gives him a tonic and braces him
   up. And when the man is stronger, he becomes happier and shakes off his
   nervousness. The Lord comforts His servants by quickening them--"This
   is my comfort in my affliction, for Your Word has quickened me."

   I speak to some of you who have endured long affliction and it is a joy
   to see you out, again, tonight. Has not God's Word often quickened you
   in affliction? Perhaps you have been sluggish when in health, but
   affliction has made you feel the value of the promise, the value of the
   Covenant blessing--and then you have cried to God for it. You may have
   been worried about worldly cares, but you have been obliged to drop
   them in the time of affliction and your only care has been to get
   nearer to Christ and to creep into your Lord's bosom!

   Sometimes in prosperity you could hardly pray, but I guarantee you, you
   prayed when you were ready to perish and pined at death's door! Your
   affliction quickened your prayers. There is a man trying to write with
   a quill pen--it will not make anything but a thick stroke--so he takes
   a knife and cuts fiercely at the quill till it marks admirably. So we
   have to be cut with the sharp knife of affliction, for only then can
   the Lord make use of us! See how sharply gardeners trim their vines.
   They take off every shoot till the vine looks like a dry stick. There
   will be no grapes in the spring if there is not this cutting away in
   the autumn and winter! God quickens us in our afflictions through His
   Word. Our sorrows are made to have a salutary action on our souls. We
   receive by them spiritual revival and health and, therefore, comfort
   flows in to us. It would not be wise to pray to be altogether delivered
   from trial, though we should like to be. It would be a pleasant thing
   to have a grassy path all the way to Heaven and never to find a stone
   in the road--but though pleasant, it might not be safe. If the way were
   a fine turf cut every morning with a lawnmower and made as soft as
   velvet, I am afraid we should never get to Heaven at all, for we should
   linger too long upon the road!

   Some animals' feet are not adapted for smooth places and, Brothers and
   Sisters, you and I are of a very slippery-footed race! We slip when the
   roads are smooth! It is easy to go down hill, but it is not easy to do
   so without a stumble.

   John Bunyan tells us that when Christian passed through the Valley of
   Humiliation, the fight he had there with Apollyon was very much due to
   the slips he made in going down the hill which descended into the
   valley. Happy is he who is in the Valley of Humiliation, for, "He that
   is down need fear no fall." But his happiness will largely depend upon
   how he came down. Gently, you that are on the hilltops of delight and
   prosperity. Gently, lest, perhaps you slip with your feet and mischief
   come of it! Quickening is what we need and if we get it, even if it
   comes to us by the sharpest tribulation, we may gladly accept it. "This
   is my comfort in my affliction, for Your Word has quickened me."

   III. Lastly, and very briefly, there are certain PECULIAR TRIALS of
   Christians in which this peculiar comfort is specially excellent.

   Kindly look at the Psalm and notice, in the 49th verse, that the
   Psalmist suffered from hope deferred. "Remember Your Word unto Your
   servant, upon which You have caused me to hope." Long waiting for the
   promise to be fulfilled may make the soul grow weary--and hope deferred
   makes the heart sick. At such a time this is to be our comfort-- "Your
   Word has quickened me." I have not yet obtained that which I prayed
   for, but I have been quickened while I have been praying. I have not
   found the blessing I have been seeking, but I am sure I shall have it,
   for already the exercise of prayer has been of service to me--this is
   my comfort under the delay of my hope, that Your Word has already
   quickened me!

   Notice the next verse, in which the Psalmist was suffering the great
   trial of scorn. "The proud have had me greatly in derision." Ridicule
   is a very sharp ordeal. When the proud are able to say something
   against us that stings--when they laugh, yes, and laugh greatly, and
   treat us like the mire in the streets--it is a severe affliction and
   under it we need rich comfort. If at that time we feel that if man's
   word stings, yet God's Word quickens, then we are comforted! If we are
   driven more to God by being scorned by men, we may very cheerfully
   accept their contempt and say, "Lord, I bless You for this persecution
   which makes me a partaker of Christ's sufferings." I say it becomes a
   comfort to us to be quickened by the Word when the ungodly are
   despising us.

   At the 53rd verse you will see that David was under the trouble of
   living among great blasphemers and doers of open wickedness. He says,
   "Horror has taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake Your
   Law." He was horrified at their vices--he wished that he could get away
   from and never see or hear that which distressed him so much. But if
   the very sight and sound of sin drives us to pray and forces us to cry
   to God, the result is good, however painful the process may be! If men
   never swore in the streets, we should not so often be driven to cry to
   God to forgive their profanity. If you and I could always be shut up in
   a glass case and never see sin or hear of it, it might be a bad thing
   for us. But if, when we are compelled to see the wickedness of men and
   hear their curses and reviling, we can also feel that God's Word is
   quickening us, even by our horror at sin, it is good for us! We have
   great comfort in this peculiar species of affliction, though it is
   exceedingly grievous to tender-hearted, pure and delicate minds who
   dwell near to God.

   Just read the 54th verse, and you will see another of David's trials
   indicated. "Your statutes have been my song in the house of my
   pilgrimage." He had many changes. He had all the trials of a pilgrim's
   life--the discomforts ofjourneying in places where he had no abiding
   city. But, "This," he says, "has been my comfort in my affliction."
   Your Word has told me of a city that has foundations. Your Word has
   assured me that if I am a stranger upon earth, I am also a citizen of
   Heaven. "Your Word has quickened me." I have felt myself so
   strengthened by Your Word that I have been glad to feel that this is
   not my rest. I am glad to feel that I must be away to a better land and
   so my heart has been happy and, "Your statutes have been my songs in
   the house of my pilgrimage."

   Lastly, in the 55th verse, you see David was in darkness. He says, "I
   have remembered Your name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept Your
   Law." Even in the night he could derive comfort from the quickening
   influence which often comes to the soul from the Scriptures--even when
   we are surrounded by darkness and sorrow. I will not go over that
   ground, again, but certain it is that when our soul is shrouded in
   distress, it often becomes more active and gracious than when it is
   basking in the sunlight of prosperity.

   All along, then, dear Friends, your comfort and mine is the Word of
   God, laid home by God, the Holy Spirit, to our hearts, quickening us to
   an increase of spiritual life! Do not try to flee from your troubles.
   Do not fret under your cares. Do not expect this world to bring forth
   roses without thorns. Do not hope to prevent the springing up of briers
   and thistles. Ask for quickening! Ask for that quickening to come, not
   by new revelations nor by fanatical excitement, but by

   God's own Word quietly applied by His own Spirit! So shall you conquer
   all your troubles, overcome your difficulties and enter into Heaven
   singing hallelujahs unto the Lord's right hand and holy arm which have
   gotten Him the victory!

The Dream of the Barley Cake

   (No. 1873)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 22, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when Gideon had come, behold, there was a man that told a dream
   unto his companion and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake
   of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent,
   and smote it thatit fell, and overturned it, that the tentlay along.
   And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else sa ve the sword
   of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God
   delivered Midian, and all the host." Judges 7:13,14.

   THE Midianites were devastating the land of Israel. These wandering
   tribes purposely kept away during the times of plowing and sowing and
   allowed the helpless inhabitants to dream that they would be able to
   gather in a harvest. But no sooner did there come to be anything
   eatable by man or beast, than these Bedouin hordes came up like locusts
   and devoured everything! Imagine a country like Israel which had, at
   one time, been powerful, so greatly reduced as to be unable to keep off
   these desert rangers! They were brought so low that the cities and
   villages were empty and the inhabitants were hidden in the hills, in
   the watercourses and in the huge caverns of the rocks. God had forsaken
   them for their sins and, therefore, their own manhood had forsaken them
   and they hid themselves from enemies, whom, in better days, they had
   despised.

   In her extremity, the guilty nation began to cry to Jehovah, her God,
   and the answer was not long delayed. An angel came to Gideon and
   announced to him that the Lord had delivered Midian into his hands and
   that he should smite them as one man. Gideon was a man of great
   faith--his name shines among the heroes of great faith in the 11th
   Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews--and you and I will do well if we
   attain to the same rank in the peerage of faith as he did. But for all
   that, the best of men are men at the best--and men of strong faith are
   often men of strong conflicts--and so it was with Gideon. This man's
   great faith and great weakness of faith both showed themselves in a
   desire for signs. Once assure him that God is with him, and Gideon has
   no fear but hastens to the battle, bravest of the brave!

   With a handful of men, he is quite prepared to go against a host of
   adversaries, but he pines for a sign. Again and again he asks for it.
   The anxious question seems to be constantly recurring to him, "Is the
   Lord with us? If the Lord is with us, where are all His miracles which
   our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from
   Egypt?" Therefore his frequent prayer is, "If now I have found Grace in
   Your sight, show me a sign." He began with this, and this ill beginning
   colored his whole career. I have known many persons like this son of
   Joash--they say, "Let me but know that God is with me and my fear is
   gone." But their repeated question is, "Is the Lord with me? Is Jesus
   mine and am I His? Let me but know that I am a true Believer and I am
   sure that I shall not perish, for God will not forsake His own-- but
   then, am I a Believer? Have I the marks and evidences of a child of
   God?"

   Hence the practice of severe self-examination and therefore,, also, the
   weakening habit of craving for tokens and feelings. How many are
   crying, "We see not our signs," when they ought to say, "But we see
   Jesus!"? How many are praying, "Show me a token for good," when the
   Lord Jesus has given Himself for them and has, thereby, given the best
   token of His Grace?

   So it happened to Gideon, that the Lord, knowing his hunger for signs
   and yet knowing the sincerity of his faith, bade him, on the night of
   the great battle which was to rout Midian, go down as a spy into the
   camp with his servant. And there Gideon would receive a token for good
   which would effectually quiet all his fears.

   I picture Gideon and his attendant creeping down the hill in the
   stillness of the night when the camp was steeped in slumber. It was
   about the end of the first watch, when they were soon to change
   sentinels. The two brave men, with stealthy footsteps, drew near the
   pickets and even passed them. From long habit they had learned to make
   no more sound with their footsteps than if they had been cats. As they
   move along, they come near to a couple of men who are talking,
   together, and they listen to their conversation. Whether they were
   inside the tent, lying on their beds, or whether they were sitting by
   the campfire whiling away the last half-hour of their weary watch, we
   do not know. But there they were and Gideon remained breathless to hear
   their talk. One of them told his companion that he had dreamed a dream
   and he began the telling of it. Then the other ventured an
   interpretation and Gideon must have been awe-stricken when he heard his
   own name mentioned and his own success foretold!

   Do you not see him with streaming eyes and clasped hands silently
   worshipping God? His assurance overflows and, motioning to his servant,
   they steal away through the shadows and quietly ascend the hill to the
   place where the little band of three hundred lay in hiding. They look
   down upon the sleeping camp and Gideon cries, "The Lord has delivered
   into your hands the hosts of Midian." Obedient to their leader, they
   descend with their trumpets and with torches covered with pitchers. At
   a signal they break the pitchers, display the lights, sound the
   trumpets and shout, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon." Imagining
   that a vast army is upon them, the tribes of the desert run for their
   lives and, in the darkness, fall foul of one another. Midian is
   scattered! Israel is free!

   In quiet contemplation let us now play the part of spies. With all our
   wits about us, let us thread our way among the sleepers and listen to
   this dream and the interpretation thereof.

   I. The first thing that I shall bring under your observation is THE
   STRIKING PROVIDENCE which must have greatly refreshed Gideon. Just as
   he and Phurah stealthily stole up to the tent, the Midianite was
   telling a dream, bearing an interpretation so appropriate to Gideon. It
   may appear to be a little thing, but an occurrence is none the less
   amazing because it appears to be insignificant. The microscope reveals
   a world of marvels quite as surprising as that which is brought before
   us by the telescope. God is as Divine in the small as in the
   stupendous--as glorious in the dream of a soldier as in the flight of a
   seraph!

   Now observe, first, the Providence of God that this man should have
   dreamed just then and that he should have dreamed that particular
   dream. Dreamland is chaos, but the hand of the God of order is here!
   What strange romantic things our dreams are!--fragments of this and
   broken pieces of the other strangely joined together in absurd
   fashion--

   "How many monstrous forms in sleep we see, That neither were, nor are,
   nor ever can be!" Yet observe that God holds the brain of this sleeping
   Arab in His hand and impresses it as He pleases. Dreams often come of
   previous thoughts--see, then, the Providence which had taken this man's
   mind to the hearth and the cake baking. The Lord prepares him when he
   is awake to dream aright when he is asleep. God is Omnipotent in the
   world of mind as well as in that of matter--He rules it when men are
   awake--and does not lose His power when men fall asleep. The heathen
   ascribed dreams to their gods. We read of one, that--

   "Pallas poured sweet slumbers on his soul, And balmy dreams, the gift
   of soft repose." Thin as the air, inconstant as the wind, the stuff
   that dreams are made of is vanity of vanities! And yet the Lord
   fashions it according to His own good pleasure. The man must dream,
   must dream then and there, and dream that dream which should convey
   confidence and courage to Gideon! Oh, believe it, God is not asleep
   when we are asleep! God is not dreaming when we are! I admire the
   Providence of God in this--do not you? Is it not especially well
   ordered that this man shall dream and therein declare a truth as deep
   as any in the compass of philosophy?

   Further, I cannot but admire that this man should be moved to tell his
   dream to his companion. It is not everybody that tells his dream at
   night--he usually waits till morning. We are grossly foolish,
   sometimes, but we are not always so and, therefore, we do not hurry to
   tell such disjointed visions as that which this Arab had just seen.
   What was there in it? Many a time, no doubt, this son of the desert
   would have cried, "I have had a dream--past the wit of man to say what
   dream it was." But this time he cannot shake it off. It burdens him and
   he must tell it to his comrade by the campfire! Look into the face of
   Gideon as he catches every syllable. Now, if this dream-telling had
   been arranged by military authority and if it had been part of a
   program that Gideon should be present in the nick of time to hear it,
   there would have been a failure somehow or other.

   If the man had known that he had a listener, he might not have been
   punctual with his narrative. But he did not know a word about being
   overheard and yet he was punctual to the tick of a clock! God rules
   men's idle tongues as well

   as their dreaming brains and He can make a talkative soldier in the
   camp say just as much and just as little as will subserve the purposes
   of wisdom.

   It is remarkable that the man should tell his dream just when Gideon
   and Phurah had come near. Just think a minute of the many chances
   against such a thing! We are on the side of the hill and we glide down
   among the trees and the great rocks till we are nearly in the
   grasslands in the valley. Here lie the Midianites in their long lines
   of black tents and the hush of deep slumber is over all, but where a
   few maintain a sleepy watch. Why does Gideon go to that particular part
   of the camp? Going there, why does he happen to drop on this particular
   spot where two men are talking? If he was spying out the camp, he would
   naturally wander along where there was most quiet, in order that he
   might not be discovered, for if the warriors had suddenly started up
   and snatched their spears, these two men would have had small chance of
   life. It was amazing that out of tents so countless Gideon should
   alight upon the very one in which were the two wakeful sentinels and
   that he should come just as they were talking to one another about
   Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel!

   Considering that there were 50,000 other things that they might have
   talked of and, considering that there were 50,000 other soldiers upon
   whom Gideon might have lighted, there were so many chances against
   Gideon's hearing that singular talk that I do not hesitate to say,
   "This is the finger of God!" If this were but one instance of the
   accuracy of Providence, it might not so much surprise us. But history
   bristles with such instances! I mean not only public history, but our
   own private lives. Men sometimes make delicate machines where
   everything depends upon the touching of a certain pin at a certain
   instant--and their machinery is so arranged that nothing fails. Now,
   our God has so arranged the whole history of men, angels and the
   regions of the dead, that each event occurs at the right moment so as
   to effect another event--and that other event brings forth a third--and
   all things work together for good.

   I think if I had been Gideon, I would have said to myself, "I do not so
   much rejoice in what this dreamer says as I do in the fact that he has
   told his dream at the moment when I was lurking near him! I see the
   hand of the Lord in this and I am strengthened by the sight. Verily, I
   perceive that the Lord works all things with unfailing wisdom and fails
   not in His designs. He that has ordered this matter can order all other
   things." O child of God, when you are troubled, it is because you fancy
   that you are alone, but you are not alone--the Eternal Worker is with
   you! Listen and you will hear the revolution of those matchless wheels
   which are forever turning according to the will of the Lord! These
   wheels are high and dreadful, but they move with fixed and steady
   motion and they are all "full of eyes roundabout." Their course is no
   blind track of a car of Juggernaut, but the eyes see, the eyes look
   towards their end, the eyes look upon all that comes within the circuit
   of the wheels!

   Oh for a little heavenly eye salve to touch our eyes that we may
   perceive the Presence of the Lord in all things! Then shall we see the
   mountain to be full of horses of fire and chariots of fire round about
   the Prophets of the Lord. The stars in their courses are fighting for
   the cause of God! Our allies are everywhere. God will summon them at
   the right moment.

   II. But now, secondly, I want to say something to you about THE
   COMFORTABLE TRIFLE which Gideon had thus met with. It was a dream and,
   therefore, a trifle or a nothing--and yet he took comfort from it. He
   was solaced by a dream, a gypsy's dream and a poor dream at that. He
   took heart from an odd story of a barley cake which overturned a tent!
   It is a very curious thing that some of God's servants draw a very
   great deal of consolation from comparatively trivial things. We are all
   the creatures of sentiment as well as of reason and, therefore, we are
   often strongly affected by little things. Gideon is cheered by a dream
   of a barley cake. When Robert Bruce had been frequently beaten in
   battle, he despaired of winning the crown of Scotland, but when he lay
   hidden in the loft among the hay and straw, he saw a spider trying to
   complete her web after he had broken the thread many times. As he saw
   the insect begin again and yet again, until she had completed her net
   for the taking of her prey, he said to himself, "If this spider
   perseveres and conquers, so will I persevere and succeed." There might
   not be any real connection between a spider and an aspirant to a
   throne, but the brave heart made a connection and, thereby, the man was
   cheered. If you and I will but look about us, although the adversaries
   of God are as many as grasshoppers, yet we shall find consolation. I
   hear the birds sing, "Be of good cheer," and the leafless trees bid us
   trust in God and live on, though all visible signs of life are
   withered! If a dream were sufficient to encourage Gideon, an everyday
   fact in Nature may equally serve the same purpose to us!

   But what a pity it is that we should need such little bits of things to
   cheer us up when we have matters of far surer import to make us glad!
   Gideon had already received, by God's own angel, the word, "Surely I
   will be with you and you shall smite the Midianites as one man." Was
   not this enough for him? Where is it that a boy's dream comforts him
   more

   than God's own Word? O child of God, how you degrade yourself and your
   Master's Word when you set so much store on a small token! Your Lord's
   promise--is that little in your eyes? What surer pledge of love do you
   desire than the blood of Jesus spilt for you? When Jesus says, "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you," what more can you require? Is not the Word of
   the Lord absolute Truth? What seal do you need for the handwriting of
   God? The Lord may grant us further tokens for good, but we ought not to
   require them.

   I have said that our gracious God does condescendingly grant us even
   trifles, when He sees that they will cheer us-- and this, I think,
   calls for adoring gratitude--and also for practical use of this
   comfort. God grant us Grace to do great things as the result of that
   which, to others, may seem a trifle. Let us not make a sluggard's bed
   out of our tokens, but let us hasten to the fight as Gideon did. If you
   have received a gleam of comfort, hasten to the conflict before the
   clouds return! Go to your consecrated labor before you have lost the
   fervor of your spirit. May the Holy Spirit lead you to do so.

   III. I have been brief upon that point because I want you to notice,
   thirdly, THE CHEERING DISCOVERY. Gideon had noticed a striking
   Providence. He had received a comfortable trifle. But he also made a
   very cheering discovery-- which discovery was that the enemy dreamed of
   disaster! You and I sometimes think about the hosts of evil and we fear
   we shall never overcome them because they are so strong and so secure.
   Listen--we overestimate them! The powers of darkness are not so strong
   as they seem to be! The most subtle infidels and heretics are only men.
   What is more, they are bad men, and bad men at bottom are weak men! You
   fret because in this war you are not angels--be comforted to think that
   the adversaries of the Truth of God are also men! You sometimes grow
   doubtful and so do they. You half despair of victory and so do they.
   You are, at times, hard put to it--so are they. You sometimes dream of
   disaster--so do they. It is natural to men to fear and doubly natural
   to bad men.

   It must have been a great comfort to Gideon to think that the
   Midianites dreamed about him and that their dreams were full of terror
   to themselves. He did not think much of himself--he reckoned himself to
   be the least of all his father's house and that his father's house was
   little in Israel--but the foes of Israel had taken another gauge of
   Gideon--they had evidently the notion that he was a great man whom God
   might use to smite them and they were afraid of him. He that
   interpreted the dream made use of the name of, "Gideon, the son of
   Joash," evidently knowing a great deal more about Gideon than Gideon
   might have expected. "This," said the soldier, "is the sword of Gideon,
   the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered
   Midian and all the host." Notice how his words tallied with those which
   the Lord had spoken to Gideon. The enemy had begun to dream and to be
   afraid of him who now stood listening to their talk! A dread from the
   Lord had come upon them. Let us say to ourselves, "Why should we be
   afraid of sinners? They are afraid of us!"

   A Christian man, the other day, was afraid to speak about his Lord to
   one whom he met. It cost him a deal of trouble to get his courage up to
   speak to a skeptic. But when he had spoken, he found that the skeptic
   had all along been afraid that he would be spoken to! It is a pity when
   we tremble before those who are trembling because of us. By lack of
   faith in God, we make our enemies greater than they are!

   Behold the host of doubters, heretics and revilers who, at the present
   time, have come up into the inheritance of Israel, hungry from their
   deserts of rationalism and atheism! They are eating up all the corn of
   the land! They cast a doubt upon all the Truths of our faith. But we
   need not fear them, for if we heard their secret counsels, we should
   perceive that they are afraid of us! Their loud blustering and their
   constant sneers are the index of real fear. Those who preach the Cross
   of our Lord Jesus are the terror of modern thinkers! In their heart of
   hearts they dread the preaching of the old-fashioned Gospel and they
   hate what they dread! On their beds they dream of the coming of some
   Evangelist into their neighborhood. What the name of Richard was to the
   Saracens, that is the name of Moody to these boastful intellects! They
   wish they could stop those Calvinistic fellows and those evangelical
   old fogies! Brothers and Sisters, so long as the plain Gospel is
   preached in England, there will always be hope that these brigands will
   yet be scattered and the Church be rid of their intrusion. Rationalism,
   Socinianism, Ritualism and Universalism will soon take to their legs if
   the clear, decided cry of, "the Sword of the Lord and of Gideon" be
   once more heard!

   There is nothing of which a child of God need be afraid either on the
   earth or under it. I do not believe that in the lowest depths of Hell
   we should hear or see anything that need make a Believer in the Lord
   Jesus to be afraid. On the contrary, tidings of what the Lord has
   worked have made the enemy to tremble! Goodness wears in her innocence
   a breastplate of courage, but sin genders cowardice. Those who follow
   after falsehood have a secret monitor within which tells

   them that theirs is a weak cause and that the Truth of God must and
   will prevail over them. Let them alone--the beating of their own hearts
   will scare them. The Lord lives and while He lives let none that trusts
   in His Word suffer his heart to fail him, for the mountains shall
   depart and the hills be removed, but the Word of the Lord endures
   forever! Our adversaries are neither so wise, nor so brave, nor so
   influential as we think them to be. Only have courage and rely upon God
   and you will overcome them! David, you need not fear the giant because
   of his size--the vastness of his shape will only make him an easier
   target for your smooth stone. His very bulk is his weakness--it were
   hard to miss so huge a carcass! Be not afraid, but run to meet him--the
   Lord has delivered him into your hands!

   Why should the servants of the Lord speak doubtfully when their God
   pledges His honor that He will aid them? Let us change our manner of
   speech and say with the Psalmist, "Ascribe you strength unto God: His
   excellency is over Israel. Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered;
   let them, also, that hate Him flee before Him." We have received a
   kingdom which cannot be moved! We have believed the faith once
   delivered unto the saints and we will display it as a banner because of
   the Truth of God! Yet shall this song be sung in our habitations--"The
   Lord gave the Word: great was the company of those that published it.
   Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided
   the spoil."

   IV. Lastly, and most important of all, let us think for a little of THE
   DREAM, ITSELF, AND OF ITS INTERPRETATION.

   The Midianite in his dream saw a barley cake. Barley cakes were not
   much valued as food in those days, any more than now. People ate barley
   when they could not get wheat, but they would need to be driven to such
   food by poverty, or famine. Barley meal was rather food for dogs or
   cattle than for men and, therefore, the barley cake would be the emblem
   of a thing despised. A barley cake was generally made upon the hearth.
   A hole was made in the ground and paved with stones. In this a fire was
   made and when the stones were hot, a thin layer of barley meal was laid
   upon them, covered over with the ashes, and thus quickly and roughly
   baked. The cake, itself, was a mere biscuit. You must not interpret the
   dream as having in it a large loaf of barley bread tumbling down the
   hill and smashing up the tent with its own weight. No, it was only a
   cake, that is to say, a biscuit--of much the same form and thinness as
   we see in the Passover cakes of the Jews.

   It may have been a long piece of thin crust and it was seen in the
   dream moving onward and waving in the air something like a sword. It
   came rolling and waving down the hill till it came crashing against the
   pavilion of the prince of Midian, and turned the tent completely over,
   so that it lay in ruins. Perhaps driven by a tremendous wind, this
   flake of barley bread cut like a razor through the chief pole of the
   pavilion and over went the royal tent. That was his vision--an odd,
   strange dream enough! His companion answered, "The dream means mischief
   for our people. One of those barley-cake eaters from the hills will be
   upon us before long. That man Gideon, whom we have heard of lately, may
   fall upon us all of a sudden and break down our power." That was the
   interpretation--the barley biscuit was the ruin of the pavilion.

   Now, what we have to learn from it is just this, God can work by any
   means. He can never be short of instruments. For His battles, He can
   find weapons on the hearth, weapons in the kneading trough, weapons in
   the poor man's basket. Omnipotence has servants everywhere! For the
   defense of His cause, God can enlist all the forces of Nature, all the
   elements of society, all the powers that be! His kingdom cannot fail,
   since the Lord can defend it even by the cakes which are baking upon
   the coals! Gideon, who threshes corn, today, will thresh the Lord's
   enemies tomorrow. Preachers of the Word are being trained everywhere!

   God can work by the feeblest means. He can use a cake which a child can
   crumble to smite Midian and subdue its terrible power. Alas, Sirs, we
   often consider the means to be used and forget to go onward to Him who
   will use them! We often stop at the means and begin to calculate their
   natural force and thus we miss our mark. The point is to get beyond the
   instruments to the God who uses the instruments! I think I have heard
   that a tallow candle fired from a rifle will go through a door--the
   penetrating power is not in the candle, but in the force impelling it.
   So in this case, it was not the barley biscuit, but the almighty
   impulse which urged it forward and made it upset the pavilion. We are
   nothing, but God with us is everything. "He gives power to the faint;
   and to them that have no might He increases strength."

   By using weak means, our Lord gets to Himself all the Glory and hides
   pride from men. The Lord had said to Gideon in the early part of this
   chapter, "The people are yet too many for Me to give the Midianites
   into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying, My
   own hand has saved me." Their oppression was a punishment for sin and
   their deliverance must be an act of mercy! They must be made to see the
   Lord's hand and they cannot see it more clearly than

   by being delivered by feeble means! Out of jealousy for His own Glory,
   it often pleases God to set aside likely means and use those which we
   looked not for.

   Now I know how it is today--men think that if the world is to be
   converted it must be done by learned men, men of noble family or at
   least of eminent talent! But is this the Lord's usual way? Is there
   anything in the Acts of the Apostles, or in the life of Christ, that
   should lead us to look to human wisdom, or talent, or prestige? Does
   not everything look in the opposite direction? The lake of Galilee was
   Christ's Apostolic College. Has not God always acted upon His own
   declaration that He has hid these things from the wise and prudent--and
   has revealed them unto babes? Is it not still true that the Lord has
   chosen the weak things of the world to confuse the things which are
   mighty? And base things of the world and things which are despised has
   God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things
   that are? Are we not on the wrong track altogether when we look to men
   and means and measures instead of considering the right hand of the
   Most High? Brothers and Sisters, let us never forget that out of the
   mouth of babes and sucklings has the Lord ordained strength because of
   His enemies, that He might still the enemy and the avenger!

   The Lord employs feeble means so that He may have an opening for you
   and for me! If He used only the great, the wise, the strong, we should
   have to lie in the corner. Then might the men of one talent be excused
   for hiding it. But now the least among us may, through God's Grace,
   aspire to usefulness! Brothers, let not your weakness keep you back
   from the Lord's work--surely you are at least as strong as barley
   cakes! I find that the original text suggests a noise, such as might be
   made by chestnuts or corn when roasting in the fire. The dreamer marked
   that it was a noisy cake which tumbled into the host of Midian. More
   noise than force, one would say. It was like a coal which dies out of
   the fire, makes a little explosion, and is never more heard of. Thus
   have many of God's most useful servants been spoken of at first. They
   were nine-day wonders, mere flashes in the pan, much ado about nothing
   and so forth. And yet the Lord smites His enemies by their feeble
   means!

   My Brother, perhaps you have begun to make a little stir by faithfully
   preaching the Gospel and this has opened the mouths of the adversaries
   who are indignant that such a nobody as you should be useful. "Why,
   there is nothing in the fellow! It is sheer impudence for him to
   suppose that he has any right to speak!" Never mind. Go on with your
   work for the Lord. Cease not because you are of such small account, for
   by such as you, God is pleased to work! Never are His adversaries so
   shamefully beaten as when the Lord uses feeble instrumentality. The
   Lord smote the hosts of Jabin by the hand of a woman and the hosts of
   Philistia by the hand of Shamgar the plowman! It was to their
   everlasting reproach that the Lord put His foes to the rout with
   pitchers and trumpets in the hand of the little band who followed the
   thresher of Abiezer. The Lord will tread Satan under our feet shortly,
   even under our feet, who are less than the least of all saints!

   Note, next, God uses unexpected means. If I wanted to upset a tent, I
   certainly would not try to overturn it by a barley cake! If I had to
   cannonade an encampment, I should not bombard it with biscuits! Yet how
   wonderfully God has worked by the very persons whom we should have
   passed over without a thought. O Paganism, your gigantic force and
   energy, with Caesar at their head, shall be vanquished by fishermen
   from the sea of Galilee! God willed it so and so it was done. Papal
   Rome met as signal a downfall from Reformers rude of speech and poor in
   estate! Expect the unexpected! Thus the Lord works to call men's
   attention to what He does. If He does what men commonly reckon upon,
   they take no notice of His doings, however splendid they may be in
   themselves. But if He steps aside and does that which none could have
   looked for, then is their attention arrested and they consider that the
   hand of the Lord is in it! Then, also, they admire and feel somewhat of
   awe of Him.

   For the tent to fall seems nothing, but for the tent to fall by being
   smitten with a barley cake is something to be marveled at. For souls to
   be saved is, in itself, remarkable, but for them to be saved by some
   simple child-like Evangelist who can scarcely speak grammatically--this
   is the talk of the town! For the Lord to call out a thief or a
   blasphemer and speak by his lips is a thing to make men feel the
   greatness of God! Then they cry, "How unsearchable are His ways!" For
   an error to be blasted and dried up, is a blessed thing--and yet it is
   all the more miraculous when this is done, not by reasoning, nor by
   eloquent argument, but by the simple declaration of Gospel Truth! O
   Sirs, we never know what the Lord will do next! He can raise up
   defenders of the faith from the stones of the river! I despair not for
   the grand old cause. No, I hope against hope. Driven back as we may be,
   I see the very dust breeding warriors and the grass of the field
   hardening into spears. Courage! Courage! Stand still and see the
   salvation of God!

   But the dream has more in it than this--God uses despised means. This
   man, Gideon, is likened to a cake, and then only to a barley cake, but
   the Lord styles him "a mighty man of valor." God loves to take men whom
   others despise and use them for His glorious ends. "He is a fool," they
   say, "an uneducated man, one of the very lowest class of minds. He has
   no taste, no culture, no thought. He is not a person of the advanced
   school." My dear Brother, I hope no one among you will be influenced by
   this kind of silly talk! The "mashers" in our churches talk in this
   fashion, but who cares for their proud nonsense? It is time that men
   who despise others should be, themselves, despised, and be made to know
   that they are so! Those who boast of their intellect are of small
   account with God. The whole tenor of this Inspired Book is that way--it
   speaks kindly of things that are despised--but it has no word of
   reverence for the boastful and pretentious. Therefore, you despised
   ones, let the proud unbelievers laugh at you and sing concerning you,
   their song of a barley cake--but you in patience possess your souls and
   go on in the service of your Lord! They think to render you
   contemptible, but the scorn shall return upon the scorners! You shall
   yet, by the Lord's strength, have such force and vigor put into you
   that you shall put to flight the armies of the aliens. Say you with
   Paul, "When I am weak, then am I strong." "Fear not, little flock; for
   it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." "He has put
   down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree."

   But, then, God always uses effectual means. This cake of barley bread
   came unto a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned it. The
   Lord never does His work by halves. Even if He works by barley cakes,
   He makes a clean overthrow of His enemy. A cannonball could not have
   done its work better than did this barley cake! Friend, if the Lord
   uses you for His own purpose, He will do His work by you as effectually
   and surely as if He had selected the best possible worker! He lifts our
   weakness out of itself and elevates it to a level of power and efficacy
   little dreamed of by us. Therefore, be not afraid, you servants of God,
   but commit yourselves into the hands of Him who, out of weakness, can
   bring forth strength!

   I have done when I have made an application of all this to certain
   practical purposes. Brothers and Sisters, do you not think that this
   smiting of the tent of Midian by the barley cake and, afterwards, the
   actual overthrow of the Midia-nite hordes by the breaking of the
   pitchers, the blazing of the torches and the blowing of the trumpets
   all tends to comfort us as to those powers of evil which now cover the
   world? I am appalled, sometimes, as I think of the power of the enemy,
   both in the matter of impurity and falsehood. At this present moment
   you seem as if you could do nothing--you cannot get in to strike a
   blow. Sin and error have so much the upper hand that we know not how to
   strike them! The two great parties in England, the Puritan and the
   Cavalier, take turns about and, just now, the Cavalier rules most
   powerfully!

   At one time sound doctrine and holy practice had sway, but in these
   days loose teaching and loose living are to the fore. But our duty
   clearly lies in sticking to the Word of the Lord and the Gospel of our
   fathers. God forbid that we should Glory except in the Cross of our
   Lord Jesus Christ! By this sign we shall yet conquer. The impurity of
   the age will never be cleansed except by the prevalence of the Gospel!
   The infidelity of the period will never die before any assault but that
   of the pure Truth of the living Lord! We must tell of pardon bought
   with blood, of free forgiveness according to the riches of Divine Grace
   and of eternal power changing fallen human nature and making men new
   creatures in Christ Jesus! They call this a worn-out doctrine--let us
   put its power to the test on the largest scale--and we shall see that
   it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes! As for
   me, I shall preach the Gospel of the Grace of God and that only, even
   if I am the only one left!

   The hosts of Israel are melting away and they will melt much more. As
   in Gideon's day, out of the whole host, 22,000 have gone altogether
   away from true allegiance to the cause and many more have no stomach
   for the fight. Let them go! The thousands and the hundreds. Let the
   30,000 who came at the trumpet call decrease to the 300 men that lap in
   haste as a dog laps, because they are eager for the fray! When we are
   thinned out and made to see how few we are, we shall be hurled upon the
   foe with a power not our own! Our weapon is the torch of the old
   Gospel, flaming forth through the breaking of our earthen vessels! To
   this we add the trumpet sound of an earnest voice. Ours is the midnight
   cry, "Behold He comes!" We cannot get victory by any might or skill of
   ours and yet, in the end, the foe shall be defeated and the Lord,
   alone, shall be exalted! Were things worse than they are, we would
   still cry, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon" and stand, each man,
   in his place till the Lord appeared in strength.

   Another lesson would I draw from the text as to our inward conflicts.
   Dear Friend, you are feeling in your heart the great power of sin. The
   Midianites are encamped in your soul. In the little valley of Esdraelon
   which lies within your bosom, there are countless evils and these, like
   the locusts, eat up every growing thing and cause comfort, strength and
   joy to cease from your experience. You sigh because of these invaders.
   I counsel you to try what faith can do. Your own earnest efforts appear
   to make you worse--try faith! Neither tears, nor prayers, nor vows, nor
   self-denials have dislodged the foe--try the barley cake of faith!
   Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! In Him you are saved! In Him you have
   power to become a child of God! Believe this and rejoice. Poor sinner,
   try faith! Poor backslider, try faith! Poor desponding heir of Heaven,
   try faith! This barley cake of faith will smite the power of sin, break
   the dominion of doubt and bring you victory!

   Remember that ancient Scripture, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble,
   and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me"? Make bold to
   believe! Say at once--

   "I do believe, I will believe, That Jesus died for me."

   This seems a very poor means of getting the victory, as poor as the
   barley cake baked on the coals--but God has chosen it and He will bless
   it--and it will overthrow the throne of Satan within your heart and
   work holiness and peace in you.

   Once again, still in the same vein, let us, dear Friends, try
   continually the power of prayer for the success of the Gospel and the
   winning of men's souls. Prayer will do anything--will do everything! It
   fills the valleys and levels the mountains. By its power men are raised
   from the door of Hell to the gate of Heaven! What is to become of
   London? What is to become of heathen nations? I listen to a number of
   schemes, very visionary and very hard to work out. But I put these
   aside. There remains to Believers but one scheme--our Lord has said,
   "Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature."
   This, therefore, we must do and, at the same time, we must cry mightily
   unto God by prayer that His Holy Spirit may attend the proclamation of
   the Word.

   Let us more and more prove the power of prayer, resting assured that
   the Lord is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or even
   think. Let each man stand with the flaming torch of the Truth of God in
   his hand and the trumpet of the Gospel at his lips--and so let us
   compass the army of the aliens! This is our war cry--Christ and Him
   crucified! God forbid that we should know anything else among men, but
   the death, the blood, the Resurrection, the reign, the coming, the
   Glory of Christ!

   Let us not lose faith in our calling, nor in our God, but rest assured
   that the Lord reigns and His cause must triumph! Where sin abounded
   Grace does much more abound! We shall see better and brighter days than
   these. Grant it, O Lord, for Your Son's sake. Amen.

A Discourse Upon True Blessedness Here and Hereafter

   (No. 1874)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 13, 1885.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 2, 1885.

   "Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them
   that love Him." James 1:12.

   THE text is a Beatitude. It begins with BLESSED. We should all like to
   be blessed. What a more than golden word that "blessed," is! It begins
   the Psalms of David--there is sweetest poetry in it. It begins the
   sermon of the Son of David. It is the end of all holy teaching.
   "Happiness" is the earthly word. "Blessedness" is the heavenly one.
   Happiness may prove to be a superficial appearance, but blessedness is
   deep as the abyss. Happiness ripples like a flowing brook, but
   blessedness is a springing well. Happiness may be wholly human, but
   blessedness has the Divine element in it. Happiness is transient;
   blessedness is eternal! Happiness may lie in our own conception of
   things; blessedness is God's verdict, God's truthful statement of a
   man's condition! Happiness may prove but tinsel--blessedness is solid
   gold. Oh, to be blessed! Blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and
   earth!

   Where are these blessed men? There are such still upon the earth, for
   the text says, "Blessed is the man." It speaks not of a phantom, but of
   a man. It treats not of an ideal man, but of one who is tried and made
   to endure temptation. I hear in this verse the echo of the music of
   many a Psalm which was chanted by the saints hundreds of years ago!
   James took pen in hand concerning blessed men and of the same persons,
   David, long before, had sung of men well known to him. There are such
   persons as blessed men, or the eminently practical James would not have
   written concerning them. It is true the curse has fallen on the world
   and man is born to endure toil and suffering in tilling a thorn-bearing
   earth and earning his bread with the sweat of his face, but for all
   that, there are blessed men--men so blessed that the wilderness and the
   solitary place are glad for them--and by their presence the desert is
   made to rejoice and blossom as the rose!

   Where are these blessed men? Can we be of their number? Is there any
   way by which we can enter their ranks and become members of their
   glorious peerage? Blessed men! From this day on we will not rest until
   we are initiated into this sacred fellowship!

   Great mistakes are made as to the persons who are happy and blessed.
   Some suppose that the wealthy must be blessed--but if their lives were
   written, it could be proven, without a doubt, that some of those who
   have had the largest possessions have had the very least of
   blessedness, especially when those possessions have brought with them
   the curses of the oppressed and the wailings of the down-trodden. It
   must be an awful thing to have tons of cankered gold and silver
   pressing upon the soul--and burying the true life beneath the accursed
   load! Yes, and when wealth comes justly, it often brings such care,
   such burdensomeness with it, that it is well described in the
   Scriptures as a load of thick clay! In addition, there may be such a
   lack of power to enjoy it that the man may be rather cursed than
   blessed by his possessions. Well may we pity the man who has pictures
   but no sight, music but no ear, meat but no appetite, estates but no
   health with which to enjoy them.

   Are there not thousands of such? Certainly they are not blessed by
   their fortunes. Moreover, riches are uncertain things. Like the
   hoarfrost of the morning, they are gone when the sun is up. Do but clap
   your hands and the birds that cover the fields fly away--and so do
   riches--they "take to themselves wings and fly away." How should such
   fleeting things bring blessedness to the fields on which they light for
   so short an hour? No, look not in gold mines for blessedness, for it
   gleams not among the nuggets. Blessedness cannot be gotten for all the
   treasures of the miser, or the wealth of nations.

   But, surely, it is to be found in positions of eminence and power!
   These are greatly coveted and men will sell their souls to win them.
   But I suppose from what I have read of history that if I were to select
   the most unhappy set of men beneath the vault of Heaven, one would only
   have to select statesmen, emperors and kings! Surely on the day of his
   installation, the great man may well says, "Farewell peace!" I should
   certainly not search among the lofty glaciers of yonder Alps to find
   the flowers of happiness. All is chill and cold and tempestuous in the
   high places of the earth. And if one had the choice of such a place, he
   might accept it out of a self-denying wish to do good, but otherwise he
   were unwise to have it as a gift. Not the high but the holy are
   blessed--not those who sit with the great, but those who serve with the
   good are marked out by the Lord as blessed.

   Nobler natures feel no greed for gold and pine for no distinction of
   rank. They count those blessed who know and are stored with wisdom.
   Surely to pry into the secrets of Nature and read the pages of
   philosophy must be pleasure of a lofty kind. Therefore ambitious youth
   burns the midnight oil--and the oil from the marrow of life as
   well--hoping that in search and study the mystery of blessedness will
   be discovered. But is it so? Does he that increases knowledge increase
   joy? Does he not, rather add to his sorrow? If knowledge were bliss,
   the devil would be in Heaven! Should we possess the gift of prophecy
   and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, yet these would profit
   us nothing in the trade of happiness. Telescopes, microscopes, air
   pumps and calculating machines are not the instruments of that alchemy
   which brings happiness out of all conditions! In another school than
   that of Plato we must learn in whatever state we are to be content.
   Blessedness is not the bookworm of the library, but a spirit which
   descends from above!

   But some think that, surely, blessedness may be had by a combination of
   dignity and wisdom and riches. Put these together and a man might
   surely be blessed! And yet it does not seem so. I should think that no
   mortal that ever lived had finer opportunities than Solomon. He began
   with a blessed heritage from a father who was a man after God's own
   heart. He gathered riches like the sand of the sea and he had a
   capacious mind like the sea itself! None of that age could be thought
   of as his rival and, perhaps, none since have altogether equaled this
   many-sided man. He denied himself no luxury. He abstained from no
   pleasure. He tried everything that could be tried, both serious and
   comic.

   There was nothing from which he stayed his hand. He cast everything
   into the crucible and he brought out of it, not gold, but ashes!
   "Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, all is vanity." This is the
   conclusion of Solomon's life as well as of Solomon's discourse. No, you
   cannot find blessedness on a throne nor in making many books, nor in
   seeking out many inventions, nor in enjoying all luxuries. These things
   all cry, "It is not in me!" Blessedness is a thing which is not
   discoverable beneath the moon, apart from Him who sits above this world
   and looks down--and by His Spirit influences human minds after the best
   things. Apart from Him you may have health and wealth and talent and
   eminence and power and dignity--and yet be written down among the most
   wretched of mankind!

   If you want blessedness, hear Him speak who knows. That is, hear the
   Holy Spirit speak by the mouth of His servant James--"Blessed is the
   man that endures temptation." The subject for tonight shall be the
   blessed man in his worldly state and, secondly, the blessed man in the
   world to come.

   I. We are going to find him first, in this present world, and consider
   him in this present life. Let us behold THE BLESSED IN THIS LIFE.
   "Blessed is the man that endures temptation."

   It does seem very startling, at first sight, that the blessed man
   should be described in this way. Notice, it does not say, "Blessed is
   the man that is tempted," nor, "Blessed is the man that is beset by
   temptation." No. "Blessed is the man that endures temptation." That is
   to say, the man who bears up under it, survives it, is not led aside by
   it, but endures it as gold endures the fire.

   But observe, first, that it does not say, "Blessed is the man who is
   never tempted." I am sure that word has often been ready upon our lips
   when we have been in the sharp fire of the enemy. We have said,
   "Blessed is that man who is never tried, never afflicted, never
   tempted. Oh when shall we get to the place where there shall be none of
   these trials and temptations?" But James says not, "Blessed is the man
   who is not tempted," but, "Blessed is the man that endures temptation."

   Look, Sirs, suppose we are professing Christians tonight and, as such,
   think that we have genuine faith in Christ-- that we have a bright hope
   of Heaven--that we have a pure and fervent love to God--that we have,
   in ourselves, received the gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit and that
   we are certainly the children of God? These are flattering beliefs and
   tend greatly to our present comfort.

   But suppose none of these have been tried? It would be a very
   presumptuous and unwise thing for us to pronounce ourselves blessed,
   for when such trial shall come--and come it will to us all in life or
   in death--suppose all our happy signs and cheering tokens should fail
   us? We cannot say that we are blessed till our Graces have been tried
   and proven-- and when they have been tried and proven and we have
   endured the test in God's great proof-house, then are we blessed, but
   not till then! Here is a man who has received a file of what looks to
   be bank notes and he thinks he is very rich. Have you tried to pass one
   of them? Have you taken one of them to a bank? No, poor fool! He does
   not wish to have his fine fortune tried, but he gets angry when you
   suggest a doubt. And yet his wealth is mere fiction! Those flimsy
   papers are bank notes of the Bank of Elegance and if he were to attempt
   to pass them, he might rather be suspected to be a thief, than be
   judged to be a rich man! Much faith in this world is no better than
   that--and he is not blessed, but blinded-- that possesses it!

   He is blessed who has tried his faith, who has gone to God with a
   promise and received an answer to his prayer. He is blessed who has had
   his faith tried--who, having been put into the furnace, has by that
   faith in God been made to walk safely amid the flaming coals and to
   come out unharmed. Untried faith is questionable faith. Is it faith at
   all? Was there ever in this world a Believer altogether without
   trouble, or a grain of faith which had undergone no trial?

   Blessed, then, is the man that endures trial. I would not like to have
   everything about me untried. You would hardly like to sleep in a bed
   concerning which you were not sure that it might not be damp and cause
   your death. One would not like to buy a house that he had never seen,
   or a yoke of oxen that he had never tried, or even a cheese which he
   had not tasted. One feels like David when he put on Saul's armor.
   Though it was royal armor, he did not like it any the better for that,
   for he had never seen the go of it, nor tried how far he could move and
   fight in it. It fitted him a great deal too much and he could hardly
   find himself within its ample scope. At last he made up his mind to
   have none of it--he must have it off and, therefore, he cried "I cannot
   go with these, for I have not proven them!" He had well tried that bit
   of hide which made his sling, though--he knew what he could do with
   that and a smooth stone--and, therefore, he felt at ease with tried
   weapons. But as for Saul's armor--well, he had not tried it. If your
   religion has never been tested, you can hardly be described as
   "blessed." "Blessed is the man that endures temptation."

   It may seem a fine thing to have a religion that you lay aside on
   Monday morning after having carefully brushed it. It may seem correct
   and proper to put your Sunday religion into a box with a sprig of
   lavender or something to keep away the moth. But it is an awful farce.
   Your godliness will come out again on Saturday evening with your clean
   linen and you will be very gracious on Sunday morning when you have put
   on your suit and your sanctity, your hat and your heavenly-mindedness.
   As for the week--well, you do not need to wear your religion out too
   soon and, therefore, you do not use it on Monday! You have other
   manners for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. This is
   a wretched comedy! O Sirs, the sooner you burn such religion, the
   better! You need to have a religion which is tested every day in the
   week and which stands you in good stead because it can endure the test!
   You are blessed if you have a religion which God gives, which God
   tries, which God sustains, which God accepts! As an uncultivated garden
   is no garden, so untried godliness is no godliness! A faith that will
   not bear strain and test is no faith! A love that cannot endure a
   temptation is no love to God at all! See, then, he is not blessed who
   is screened from temptation, but he is blessed whose faith, hope, love
   and every Grace will bear the trial.

   In these times, we need not wish for more temptations, for they are all
   around us. Men who live in London need not go across the street to meet
   the devil. The very atmosphere of a great city is close and hot with
   the reek of sin. As flies in summer, so will temptations torment you,
   go where you may. Men of business, you need not ask for
   temptations--they are thick in every trade and they multiply like
   gnats. They swarm in the factory, the counting-house, the exchange and
   the shop. The Christian man in public needs not sigh for
   temptations--they will not be ashamed to solicit him in the open
   streets. This age tests the backbone of every Christian. A man had
   necessarily be a man at such an hour as this! We must not be dwarfs nor
   spiritual consumptives! We have come into the very thick of the fight
   and woe to that man who cannot endure temptation--but blessed is the
   man who can bear it even to the end!

   Dear Sister in Christ, you think yourself very patient. Have you any
   pain? Have you endured the loss of children or husband? If not, be not
   too sure of your patience. But blessed are they whose patience has
   endured the open grave, the constant gnawing at the heart, the
   bitterness of poverty and the agony of an everyday struggle for bread.
   The men who bear affliction in a gracious manner, these are the blessed
   people, for they have a patience that has been tested, a faith

   that has passed the ordeal, a love that has been more than a conqueror
   in trial! These, according to our text, are the blessed people! The
   Holy Spirit pronounces them such.

   And they are blessed among other things for this reason--because they
   have endured temptation through their love to God. Read the text again,
   "Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised--"to them
   that endure temptation"? No, "to them that love Him." So that those who
   endure temptation rightly, endure it because they love God. They say to
   themselves, "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"
   They cannot fall into sin because it would grieve Him who loves them so
   well and whom they love with all their hearts! To abstain from sin for
   any reason is, so far, good. But you may abstain from sin from a motive
   which will lend no virtue to your abstinence! Some abstain from sin
   from fear of men, or from hope of gain--as the thief is honest when he
   sees a policeman and the beggar becomes pious when a meal is to be had
   at church. One sin will often kill another sin, as the miser shuns
   profligacy because he is too mean to spend his money riotously.

   But to abstain from sin because you love God--yes, that is the thing!
   To cease from evil ways because the Lord Jesus Christ has loved you and
   given Himself for you and you have been led to put your sole trust in
   the merit of His precious blood--this is a genuine work of Grace! You
   love Him because He first loved you and then you say, "Now will I, with
   holy earnestness, keep myself clean from every sin and fly from
   everything that is not upright, true, honest, kind, good and pure. I
   will purge myself, by the help of God's Divine Spirit, from all
   filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit." When you endure temptation
   out of love to God, then you are blessed!

   "Well," says one, "I do not yet see the peculiar blessedness of that."
   You would, dear Friend, if you had ever possessed it! I do not need,
   for a moment, to explain to the child of God what a blessed condition
   he is in who has endured temptation out of love to God--for there is,
   first, a main element of blessedness in the fact that it is a blessed
   thing to love God. I cannot see how a man can be unhappy who really
   loves God. If you love God, you cannot be cast into Hell because there
   can be no Hell in the heart that loves God! Love to God is, in itself,
   such a delightful emotion that before long the indulgence of it
   perfumes the whole mind with happiness. To love You, my God! To love
   You, my God! Surely if You give me no more than this I will bless You
   forever and ever! It is Heaven enough for such a poor creature as I am
   to be permitted to love the Lord my God with all my heart, soul and
   strength!

   Then there arises out of the endurance of temptation a sense of God's
   acceptance. The text says, "Blessed is the man that endures temptation,
   for when he is approved"--that is the new version--and a very correct
   one, too. Not so much when he is tried, but when he has been
   tried--when he has been put into the refining pot and has come out
   certified to be real unalloyed gold. When he is proven and, therefore,
   approved--then he shall receive the crown of life.

   After the tried man has stood against temptation, God says of him "Now
   I know that you fear Me," as he said concerning Abraham after He had
   tried him. "Now I know that you fear God." This approval of God breeds
   a holy delight in the soul. The soul becomes conscious of the
   approbation of God and, I venture to say, that any man who has felt
   that approbation in his heart knows the beginning of Heaven! Blessed is
   that man who consciously enjoys his Maker's approval, who can stand up
   before the infinitely Holy One and say, "Although I have sinned, my
   Lord Jesus has washed me in His blood and the Holy Spirit has helped me
   to resist the temptations which once overcame me. And I know that the
   gracious Father approves me." This is, indeed, blessedness! I know of
   nothing to exceed it. Blessed is the man that steadfastly endures
   temptation, for the Lord Himself is well pleased with Him!

   There comes over the back of this a number of things to help to make
   such a man blessed, for he has great thankfulness in his soul. "O God,"
   he says, "I thank You that I have been kept while passing through those
   temptations." He is as glad as one who has been taken out of a burning
   house! I have known what it is to escape from a strong temptation
   without falling into it and I think that I have felt as grateful to God
   as a man would be who had seen a shark after him--and had been almost
   between its jaws and had just slipped away as he heard the monster
   close his mouth with a snap! I remember standing under a building which
   was in course of building and seeing a mass of stone fall from a great
   height just in front of me. What a thud it made! How narrow was my
   escape! How I started! But what joy filled my heart! So it is when one
   is delivered from temptation--from temptation which began to overpower
   the heart. As David said, "My feet had almost gone--my steps had well
   near slipped."

   You remember Bunyan's description of the feelings of Christian when he
   had passed through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and was able to
   look back by the morning light? He was struck with awe to think that he
   had ever

   passed through such a war as that, with an abyss on one side and a
   quagmire on the other. The road was haunted with sprites and hobgoblins
   and beset with traps and snares beyond all count--and yet he had
   actually come through that way in safety! When he saw what he had
   escaped, what could he do but fall down on his knees and bless God with
   all his heart that he had been protected through so great a peril? It
   helps to make a man blessed when his mind is filled with holy gratitude
   to God who has preserved him--

   "Kept alive with death so near, I to God the Glory give," says the man.
   And he is blessed by the thankfulness which he so gladly expresses!

   Besides, another feeling comes over him--that of deep humility. "Oh,"
   he says, "what a wonder of Grace I am! However is it that I have
   escaped such peril? With such a base nature as mine, how have I been
   kept from destruction? I shall perish and fall tomorrow unless the
   Lord, Himself, is still my Helper." Putting his trust in God, that
   sense of his own nothingness, accompanied with a sense of his perfect
   security in God, makes him feel exceedingly happy! A little rabbit,
   hunted and pursued, rushes through a narrow crevice under the rock and
   enters the place where he has his burrow. How quiet he is when he is
   once there! He hears many noises, but he knows that he is quite
   safe--not because he is so big or so strong, but because he is so
   little and so weak that he has been able to hide himself away under a
   rock where nobody can get at him. Such a feeling is blessedness to the
   child of God--to be nothing, but for Christ to be everything to him--to
   be weak to the last degree, but for God's strength to be his
   everlasting security! Therefore, such a man who has been hunted by
   temptation and driven into the cleft of the Rock, Christ Jesus, enjoys
   a very singular and remarkable blessedness!

   And, once more, he enjoys a fearlessness of heart. It must be an awful
   thing to go about the world and feel, "I fell under that temptation the
   other day and I would not have it known for all the world. I fell into
   that vile deed on such and such an occasion and if it were known, where
   should I be?" Poor wretch! I have heard of a toad under a harrow and I
   have often admired that situation without wishing to be in it--but that
   would be Heaven to the position of men who are conscious that they have
   not been true to conscience or true to God and yet have kept up a
   flaming profession! What poor creatures are those jackdaws who strut
   about in feathers which are not their own! A guilty conscience is the
   back door to Hell! But he that knows that, before God, he has stood
   though tempted and that though often assailed he has never been
   vanquished, can walk through the world and care for no man! The forked
   tongue of slander has no power with him! He has an antidote against the
   venom of malice. The noise and strife of this world can little distress
   him, for innocence walls him up against the onslaught of the enemy! He
   stands like a rock in the midst of the raging billows, for God has
   given him steadfastness of soul--and is not that blessedness?

   If it is not, I cannot tell what is! Young men beginning the Christian
   life, pray that you may be helped to endure temptation, for in that
   endurance lies blessedness like a pearl within a rough oyster shell!
   All of you that take the name of Christ upon you, ask for Grace to
   stand fast in your integrity, for as the beauty of the palm is its
   uprightness, so is integrity the Glory of the man! Ask for power to
   stand against every wind and wave because you have heard Christ's Words
   and, by His Grace, have practiced them and are, therefore, like houses
   that are built upon rocks! Ask for Grace that your piety may be such as
   will stand every assault of the world, the flesh and the devil, for,
   "blessed is the man that endures temptation."

   So ready are we to sin, that to prevail over one temptation is a great
   joy! To have overcome many temptations is a multitudinous blessedness!
   To have overcome them all will be an infinite Heaven! The poet Spenser
   seems to anticipate that we shall all be overcome if the battle lasts
   long enough, just as a famous politician was known to say that every
   man has his price. At any rate, it will be a great rapture to fight out
   the last conflict and conquer in it. Oh to be victorious in our last
   Armageddon! It will be a joy worth worlds to disprove the Spenserian
   stanza which I have alluded to, which may well make the most bold
   tremble--

   "But all in vain; no fort can be so strong,

   No fleshly breast can armed be so sound,

   But will at last be won with battery long,

   Or unawares at disadvantage found.

   Nothing is sure that grows on earthly ground,

   And who most trusts in arm of fleshly might

   And boasts in beauty's chain not to be bound

   Does soon fall in disadventurous fight

   And yields his wretched neck to victors most despite." With this dark
   prophecy ringing in our ears, we can truly call him blessed who endures
   right on, and never starts aside, let the test be what it may!

   Thus I have set before you what the blessed man is on earth.

   II. Just a few words on WHAT THE BLESSED MAN IS TO BE, BY-AND-BY. "When
   he is approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has
   promised to them that love Him"

   He shall receive a crown. Of course the allusion is to the Grecian
   games. See how the man runs! Every muscle is strained. There is not a
   part of his body but what is violently exercised. He tries to pass his
   fellows. He flies to the goal; he reaches it and then he receives a
   crown. A crown of laurel, or of ivy, or, perhaps, of parsley, is put
   upon his head. It has no value in itself. The Greeks were so little
   honest that a man could not have kept his crown in his house if it had
   been worth a penny. Strong rooms and iron safes had not, then, been
   dreamed of and, therefore, they gave the athletic Greek a crown of
   fading leaves--and yet many men threw away health and even life to gain
   that paltry wreath! Though it was intrinsically worthless, it had about
   it a meaning which made each leaf inexpressibly precious to him who
   labored for it and obtained it. Now, if we live through faith in
   Christ, by God's Grace, a life that shall be full of purity and
   holiness, God will give us a crown, not of laurel, nor of parsley, nor
   even of gold and rarest gems, but a, "crown of life that He has
   promised to them that love Him." Very wonderful, is it not, that God
   should reward our poor endeavors? Yet so He will!

   Let us dwell, just for a minute, upon the figure of a crown. What did
   that crown mean? It meant something done--a race finished, a battle
   fought, a prize poem written with care and accepted by the Greek world.
   It recorded and rewarded something done. Oh it will be glorious, at
   last, for Christ to say, "Well done!" That crown which is promised us
   is not for talk, nor thought, nor vow, but it records something done.

   It was something appreciated--appreciated by him that gave the crown.
   It will be no small Heaven for God, Himself, to appreciate our poor
   lives! We think little of them if we are gracious, but God thinks much
   of them because He is gracious. It is ours to humble ourselves for our
   imperfections, but it is God's, despite the imperfections, to see what
   we desire to be and what in heart we really are. It is our blessedness
   both now and forever to be accepted in Christ Jesus. A crown signifies
   something done and that something appreciated.

   A crown meant reward. Now, in the Gospel system there is room for a
   reward, though it is not of debt, but of Grace. The child of God, like
   Moses, has "respect unto the recompense of the reward." He does not run
   to win a crown by his own merit, but he runs knowing that there will be
   a crown given to him according to the love and goodness of the God of
   Grace. It is not difficult for a child of God to hate legality and yet
   to expect a reward at the last. He knows how the great Lord who saves
   us by His Grace does also reward us according to His Grace! God grant
   us, then, Brothers and Sisters, to be living so as to receive the
   gracious reward of a holy life.

   There is a crown for me. Does it make you laugh? I think I seldom think
   of it without beginning to laugh. Shall you and I wear crowns? Shall it
   be that our poor limping will yet win the race--that our staggering
   struggles will yet overcome and that we shall be crowned? O you dear
   Christian people that live in poverty and obscurity, I have a reverence
   for your heads which are already anointed with Grace, for your heads
   that are yet to be crowned with Glory! You run-- often run better than
   the greatest and most observed of your fellow Christians--and you shall
   not miss your reward! There is a crown laid up, not only for Paul, "but
   for all them that love our Lord's appearing." Therefore, laugh to
   yourselves, not with unbelief as Sarah did, but with a holy joy, as
   Abraham did! Shall I have a crown? Shall this aching brow be decked
   with a crown? Shall this forehead be decked with a tiara? O my God,
   will You set a coronet upon my head? Then will I gird up my loins and
   quicken my pace, since the crown is so sure to those who run with
   patience!

   Now go an inch farther in the text--"A crown of life." What must that
   be? What is a crown of life? A crown is a dead thing. There, put it
   away, put it away! Somebody may steal it if they think it worth the
   snatching, but, after all, it is a poor lifeless circlet! A crown is
   made of a somewhat rare earth which men call gold, a substance yellow
   and cold which is hammered and sold to break hearts and buy immunity
   for vice. Poor stuff! In crowns there are also jewels. Pebbles, or
   perhaps, consolidated gases which flash and blaze in a cold joyless
   light of their own. A crown is a dead hard weight. But if we serve the
   Lord aright, we are to have "a crown of life." What is life? Well, I
   thought to myself, this morning, as I

   was preaching and the multitude were listening so eagerly, "This is
   life." It was no dead work to preach! Sometimes one preaches and you
   are like a yacht out at sea without a capful of wind--and there you lie
   dead, becalmed, motionless. Many a sermon resembles a dead ship on a
   dead sea! But when the breeze is up and you fly before it merrily, then
   you say, "This is life." This kind of thing comes to us in our
   spiritual work, as well as in our everyday course.

   Life does not mean existence. Why, they say that when God promises
   eternal life to Christians, it means that they shall eternally exist.
   They always must eternally exist because God has made their souls
   immortal--but there is no blessing in eternal existence! On the
   contrary, it may curdle into a curse. The blessing is in eternally
   living--and what is living? It is not mere existing! In fact,
   existence, though it is essential to life, does not enter into the
   meaning of life, nor so much as come near it! To live means to be in
   health, to be in vigor, to be in force, to be in joy, to be in right
   and fit condition, to have one's whole self in order and to enjoy all
   that surrounds you with all that is within you. God will give to all
   His people, by-and-by, such a crown of life! There shall be no
   sickness--the inhabitant shall no more say, "I am sick." There shall be
   no weakness--even our body shall be raised with power. There shall be
   no dullness--we shall be forever fresh and young--led to living
   fountains of water!

   There shall be no emptiness, no sense of depletion, nor of need--we
   shall be forever filled with all the fullness of God. There shall be no
   pain, no misery--but a plenitude of enjoyment at His right hand where
   there are pleasures forev-ermore. We shall possess and enjoy all that
   manhood can desire. All that you can ask or think shall be yours and
   much more than that--inconceivable enjoyment, bliss, rapture and
   ecstasy--all shall be bestowed upon you by the unstinted hand of
   boundless love. Life shall crown all! All your life shall be crowned
   and all the crown shall be life! "A crown of

   life."

   Does it not mean, however, as well--is it not a sort of Hebraism for a
   living crown? The crown they gave in the Olympic games soon faded. That
   bit of parsley, or olive, or laurel was soon turned into faded leaves.
   But you shall have a living crown, that is to say, it shall never be
   taken from you, nor you from it. When yon sun grows pale with
   weariness; when his bright eye grows dim with age; when yonder moon
   shall redden into blood as her brightness is over shaded-- then shall
   your crown be as resplendent as ever! When time, itself, shall cease to
   be and visible things shall die and death, itself, shall be swallowed
   up, yet you shall not cease to be blessed, for you shall receive a
   living crown--a crown of everlasting life which cannot know an end!

   What is more, it shall be a living crown. The best thing in this world
   grows stale. If a man could have all the wealth and all the art
   treasures of this world, he would soon grow tired of it. Did you ever
   go to see any exhibition without, at last, feeling, "Well, I have had
   enough of this. I would not care to come here every day"? But the crown
   of life will be just as fresh after myriads and myriads of ages as on
   the first day of your celestial coronation! There was a dear Sister of
   ours, whom the most of us will never forget, Mrs. Bartlett. Blessed
   among women was that mother in Israel! She has been 10 years in Heaven,
   today! Did you remember that? I should like to hear her story of her
   first 10 years in Paradise. What a chapter to read if she could write
   it and send it down to us! I will guarantee you that she has not known
   a weary moment! She has not known an instant in which her Lord has
   ceased to be, to her, a fullness of delight! I believe that she is
   beginning Heaven now--it is still the New Jerusalem to her! She is just
   at the commencement of her bliss!

   Brothers and Sisters, we shall soon be with her! Our own beginnings of
   Glory are drawing near. Project yourselves through a million years till
   all that is prophesied shall be fulfilled and there you are, sitting
   among the angels. Listen! It is a new song they are singing and you are
   evidently delighted with the new melody. Did you hear those harps? They
   strike out novel music. You have heard it long, but it is quite new to
   you. Look! Look at the brightness of the seraphs! They shine as
   burningly as if their glow had only but kindled yesterday! "But as for
   myself," says a bright spirit, clothed upon with his resurrection body,
   "it is a million years since I was down on earth and sinned--and washed
   my robes in the blood of the Lamb--and I have needed no other washing!
   Come, Brother, let us sing together, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was
   slain,' for we have washed our robes and made them white in His
   precious blood and, therefore, are we before the Throne of God!" They
   are always at their beginnings in Glory, for Christ is always their
   Alpha. They have always reached the fullness of their Glory, for He is
   their Omega! O happy saints, that wear an ever living crown!

   But listen once more. Did you ever try to indulge a speculation as to
   what the crown of life shall be? I mean this-- you have a bulb in your
   hand of an unknown plant. I have had several, lately, from Central
   Africa. The missionary said, "Put it in your hothouse" and I did. It
   did not look to me worth half a farthing--it was an uncomely root. But
   it has

   developed large green leaves! It is growing rapidly and "it does not
   yet appear what it shall be." I am speculating upon the color of the
   flowers and the form of the fruit. I guess, by the delicate velvetiness
   of its leaves, that it is going to turn out something very remarkable,
   but I cannot prophesy what it will be. Man, by nature, is that uncomely
   bulb. When he dies, you know what a poor dried-up bulb he seems to
   those who lay him in his coffin. Yet even here, when God gives
   spiritual life, what a beautiful thing the Christian is! There is an
   amazing comeliness about the heavenly life even here below--yet we do
   not know what it is going to be. We know what spiritual life is, but we
   cannot guess what the flower of that life will be. Whatever it is to
   be, God will give that Glory to those who, by His Grace, endure
   temptation because they love Him.

   You gentlemen who believe in evolution, as I do not, tell us what a man
   will come to when God has sanctified him fully, by His Grace, and he
   has passed through ages of blessedness. What will he be when his life
   develops into the crown of life? We make poor guesswork of it. But I
   will tell you what I mean to do. I pray you follow me therein. I mean
   to go and see what this crown of life is like. We do not know what we
   shall be, but we have heard a soft whisper say, "When He shall appear,
   we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He is." Come, let us go to
   Jesus! First, let us hasten away to His Cross and unitedly look up, and
   say, "We trust You, Jesus." Then, from His Cross let us come down and
   take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, and say, "Jesus, we will follow
   You." Then, let us go with Him into the thick throng of temptation,
   where Satan shall try us with wealth and honor, or with necessities
   even unto hunger, as he tried our Lord. And there let us stand and say,
   "We will wrestle with temptation, O Lord Jesus, even as You did. O
   Lord, when we have done this, we will die with You! And if You come not
   soon, we will lie asleep in You! And when You say, 'Awake,' we will
   answer, 'Here we are. We will live with You forever and forever!'"

   And our joy shall be that crown of life which the Lord has promised of
   His own free, rich, Sovereign Grace to them that love Him! May every
   person in this congregation wear that crown! May you soldiers in your
   red coats over yonder win this crown and wear it forever! May you all
   be more than conquerors, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen!

The Preacher's Last Sermon for the Season

   (No. 1875)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 29, 1885,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
   saying, If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." John 7:37.

   THE officers were after our Lord and He knew it. He could spy them out
   in the crowd, but He was not, therefore, in the least bit afraid, or
   disconcerted. He reminds me of that minister who, when he was about to
   preach, was stopped by a soldier, who held a pistol to his head and
   threatened that if he spoke, he would kill him. "Soldier," he said, "do
   your duty and I shall do mine." And he went on with his preaching. The
   Savior, without saying as much in words, said so by His actions. If
   they were sent to take Him, let them take Him--as for Himself, the time
   was come to speak boldly and, therefore, He stood and cried, saying,
   "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me, and drink."

   You see, it was the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles. From the
   middle of that festival the Lord had been present and had openly taught
   the people. They had seen Him in the midst of the throng, lifting up
   His hands and proclaiming holy doctrine. But the feast was over, the
   boughs were cleared away and the tents in which they had dwelt, for a
   time, were taken down. It was the eighth day, which was spent as a
   Sabbath, but the Savior did not cease to preach because the festival
   was almost over. Till the last day He continued to instruct, invite and
   entreat. How this reminds us of His constant patience! It is but one
   instance, out of very many, of the Savior's tenacity of loving
   kindness. Though the Jews had often refused Him, He is still pleading
   with them. He has come to His own and they have not received Him, but
   He waits to be gracious! He tarries in unwearied mercy. He endures
   "even to this last" and so, on "that great day of the feast," He has
   still a note of admonition and a word of invitation for them.

   Oh, the patience of God to some here present! You have long heard the
   Gospel and although you have never given it due attention, still does
   the good Savior strive with you and press you to be considerate of your
   own best interests. Jesus urges you to live, persuades you to be saved!
   There are times when it would not be becoming to the honor of a king to
   press his favors upon those who have distinctly despised and refused
   them, but it is always the amazing Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ that
   He continues to entreat even when we continue to resist! Even to our
   own last hour does the Lord of Mercy sweetly cry, "If any man thirsts,
   let him come unto Me and drink." Repent, dear Hearer, of all your long
   delays, and come to Jesus this day, for He still invites you, saying
   evermore, "Whoever will, let Him take the water of life freely."

   Furthermore, our Lord did not only preach the Gospel till the last day
   of the feast, but because it was the last day, He manifested an
   increased ardor in so doing and, whereas His custom was to sit and
   teach the people who gathered in a ring around Him, on this closing day
   He now sought a prominent place, probably just outside the Temple, or
   in one of its outer courts, and there He stood, conspicuous before them
   all, in the attitude of one who has risen from his ease and has come to
   meet those whom he invites. He assumed a position more active, more
   pleading, more earnest than that of a seated teacher. Behold, He stands
   and pleads! That pleading is in tones both pathetic and loud--He
   "cries," "If any man thirsts, let Him come unto Me and drink!"

   It is the last time that He will look into some of their faces. They
   are leaving Jerusalem where they have kept the feast. They will get
   back to their farms and to their merchandise and if He does not strike
   the iron while He has it on the anvil, He may never have another stroke
   at it. If at this time an invitation is not pressed upon them, they
   will forget the teaching they have heard--they will probably never hear
   any more--and they will die in their sins. I think I see the Master's
   face beaming with holy affection and His eyes streaming with tears as
   He pleads as for His life with the throng which is so soon to melt
   away! It is now or never with Him and with them! He must once more free
   Himself of the blood of them

   all and, therefore, on that "last day, that great day of the feast,
   Jesus stood and cried, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and
   drink."

   I think it is noteworthy that when the Master had gathered up all the
   forces of His soul and His whole spirit was moved with intense anxiety
   for the good of men, then He especially preached the Gospel of
   salvation. I do not know that He had, before, so publicly declared
   Himself as the great Fountain and Source of salvation. He had taught
   this Truth of God to the woman at the well of Samaria with special
   plainness. And He had spoken of it to different little companies with
   great distinctness, but now, almost for the first time, on this last
   day He brings it all out before the multitude and cries, "If any man
   thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." Now is the invitation given
   most freely! Now is the cry sounded forth most loudly! O you that are
   perishing, O you that are lost, O you that need salvation, here is the
   place where you can find it--"Come unto Me and drink!" It seems to me
   that the Lord Jesus was driving only at this one thing--the getting of
   men to come to Himself. At another time He would teach them deeper
   doctrine, or Truth of a wider range, for His ministry dealt with many
   things for edification and holiness. But now, on this last day, He
   seems to put other matters to the side and His one objective is to win
   thirsty souls to come to Him and drink.

   I have deep fellowship in that spirit this morning. I remember that I
   shall not have another morning's discourse with you for some time and,
   perhaps, I may never have another. I go from you for a season and my
   voice will be silent among you. Therefore I said within my heart that I
   would preach this morning upon the one subject of coming to Christ--and
   upon nothing else. If you make mistakes about a thousand things, it
   will be very sad that you should do so--but not near as sad as if you
   fell into an error upon this matter. If, perhaps, you should not know
   this or that, it may be greatly to your detriment, but nothing compared
   with not knowing the Lord Jesus! My Brothers and Sisters, if you really
   come to Jesus and relieve the thirst of your souls by drinking of that
   Living Water which He so freely gives, the main thing will be right,
   the chief thing will be secured! We will hope that all the rest will
   come right, by-and-by, but just now we will only look to that vital
   point. O you that thirst, come unto Christ and drink! And if you do so,
   our morning's work will be fraught with untold blessedness to you! In
   my absence this shall be my solace, that my last words won your souls
   for Jesus!

   I would further call your attention to this fact, that while the Lord,
   on that last day, displayed an extraordinary ardor for men's souls and
   preached the Gospel more fully then than ever, He especially drove at
   this point, that they should come to Him. He spoke more pointedly,
   clearly and exclusively of Himself than ever for, just in proportion as
   He preached the Gospel, it was of necessity that He became a witness to
   Himself, since there is no other Gospel than that which is wrapped up
   in His own proper Person and work! The more Gospel, the more Christ,
   and the more Christ, the more Gospel! So, when our Lord says, "If any
   man thirsts," there is water to be had. He can do no other than say,
   "Let him come unto Me and drink." If that word must come forth from our
   Lord's own lips, how abundantly it ought to come from ours! Jesus
   stands up to be, Himself, a center, not alone for a congregation of
   people who hear Him, but for a crowd of thirsty folk who are to drink
   of Him! Jesus is the central Sun of salvation and from Him the true
   Light of God radiates on all sides. All who will turn their eyes to
   look unto Him shall behold the Light of Life.

   Beloved Hearers, I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole
   counsel of God as God has made it known to me, yet I feel, this
   morning, that I would gladly let all other Truths sink for the while if
   I might but so preach my Lord Jesus that every unconverted person here
   might see Him and look to Him with the glance of faith! I desire, also,
   that every converted person may again look to Jesus and continue
   steadily to look until the glance of faith on earth shall melt into the
   vision of happiness in Heaven. What a morning this would be if we all
   hastened to Jesus and drank from Him as from the sparkling fountain of
   Grace! Why should we not? "Jesus stood and cried," and His most ardent
   passion led Him to cry concerning Himself that men should come to Him
   and find in Him the supply for all their spiritual need! The more we
   love our fellow men, the more we, too, shall tell them of Jesus and of
   Jesus, only!

   This text I shall try to handle on this last Sabbath among you. May the
   Spirit of God handle it so as to make it useful to you, one and all!

   I. Notice, in the text, THE ENQUIRY FOR THE THIRSTY. Jesus stands
   amidst that mass of people from every land--the mingled tribes,
   scattered far and wide--who came up to Jerusalem to keep the feast, and
   He cries among them, "If any man thirsts." Evidently, He is seeking out
   needy, restless, longing hearts.

   Observe that He starts with a very wide enquiry--He seeks for any man
   and, consequently, for every man that thirsts. So does the Gospel at
   this hour come with a generous and wide appeal. Have you any desire
   after God? Have you any will to be rid of your sin? Have you any
   anxiety to escape from the wrath to come? Have you any weariness after
   Jesus and the rest which only He can give? Do you desire to be made
   pure? Is there a heart in you which sighs after better things? Do you
   long after a higher, holier and more heavenly life? Well, whoever you
   may be, Jesus says, "Come unto me and drink." There gathered that day
   about the Temple, not only men of Judea and Galilee, but Parthians,
   Medes, Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia. In fact, all sorts of
   people, even as on the day of Pentecost, came up to keep the feast and,
   without making any exception, whatever, in His generous invitation, our
   good Master stood and cried, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me
   and drink." Beneath the arch of Heaven that same call sounds out to
   every thirsty soul of every clime! Wherever the sound of my voice is
   heard, this morning, and wherever the printed sermon will be read, a
   sincere invitation comes, without exception, to every soul that longs
   and thirsts after God, pardon, mercy, eternal life and Heaven--"If any
   man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." Do not turn away from
   this honest invitation to eternal

   life!

   Yet there wails through our text an undertone of grief by which it is
   anxiously narrowed down. Wide as the invitation is, yet that, "If,"
   spoken in tenderly solemn tones of apprehension reminds us that many
   are called, but few are chosen. "If any man thirsts"--as if He had
   said, "The mass of you do not thirst--do any of you thirst? The
   multitudes do not thirst--only one here and there is doing so." Our
   Lord's glance sweeps over the throng. He reads their indifference and
   spiritual death and, in plaintive accents, expresses His fear that
   none, at least very few, are thirsting! Alas, the truly thirsty are as
   few as flowers in winter! Self-contentment possesses the minds of many
   and world-contentment steals over others. They are in a desert! No drop
   of dew falls about them and the water bottle that they carry has long
   since been dry! They are mocked by a mirage and they put aside their
   thirst with the fond idea that when they want to, they can drink to the
   full!

   An evil spirit has made them mad and they acknowledge not the thirst
   which devours them. You may tell them of sin and its danger, but they
   do not desire to confess it--their conscience is asleep. You talk of
   Hell and all its terrors, but either they do not believe you or else
   they are so callous that they will risk an eternity of woe for the sake
   of a poor transient pleasure! You speak of Christ and pardon bought
   with blood, but what is that to them? They go their way after the
   trifles of time and sense--the great realities of eternity do not
   trouble them. "If any man thirsts." Alas, a spiritually thirsty soul is
   a choice rarity! Where shall I find him? With what joy will I salute
   him! He is the man who will gladly receive the tidings of Jesus and His
   love!

   The mass of the people are bereft of spiritual feeling--they neither
   hunger nor thirst after righteousness--they have given themselves up to
   enjoy the brutish lives of oxen, or of dogs. They live as if the whole
   of their existence were to be spent amid the shadows of this poor,
   benighted world and as if there would never dawn upon our immortal
   natures an everlasting day! Such brutish men have no expectation of a
   Resurrection, no fear of a Judgement to come, no hope of Heaven and no
   dread of Hell. Well does the weeping Savior put it, "If any man
   thirsts."

   The invitation is, in itself, wide, and is only focused by the deep
   sorrow of the Preacher. If any man thirsts, he is bid to come to Jesus.
   If you, O man, have stolen in here this morning, discontented with the
   pleasures of the world, you are bid to come to Jesus for rest and
   satisfaction! If you are rich and increased in goods and yet are quite
   unable to enjoy your riches because your heart cannot be satisfied with
   the world, you are he to whom this invitation comes! If you are heavy
   with the burden of sin--if you would give your eyes to be rid of it. If
   you are despairing and ready to die because your struggles after better
   things have all been failures--you are he whom the Lord Jesus invites!
   With loving tenderness He puts it to all of you who need everything,
   but have no joy of anything, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me
   and drink." O man, if you have any sort of spiritual desire, any kind
   of longing after that which is good and gracious, come at once to
   Jesus, and Jesus will joyfully receive you!

   The call is painfully clear. "If any man thirsts." The thirsty know
   what thirst is--it is a self-explaining pain. A man knows whether he
   thirsts or not. Nobody need take a minute to answer the question, "Do I
   thirst?" because, as to natural thirst, it is a pain or need which is
   readily discerned. If, my Hearer, you are really thirsty, you know you
   are thirsty. Are you dissatisfied with yourself? Are you grieved on
   account of sin? Are you anxious to be right with God? Are you pining

   to find your Savior? You are the man and there is no question about it!
   Hear His voice while He graciously says, "Come unto Me and drink."

   Be it remembered that this call is being continually repeated. At this
   moment, though I speak it, my Master is with me and is using me as His
   mouth. Jesus Himself says it, and not I--"If any man thirsts, let him
   come unto Me and drink." Jesus is not standing outside the Temple at
   Jerusalem, for He is gone from us as to His bodily Presence, but from
   yonder lofty place at the right hand of God He still speaks and He
   cries, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." Jesus is
   still accessible. You may come to Him at this hour! A prayer will bring
   you to Him! A sigh will find and reach Him and if, beneath the arch of
   Heaven, in hall or cottage, in palace or prison, in the forest or on
   the sea, there is a man that thirsts, let him but come unto Jesus by
   faith and he shall have all his needs supplied. It is a blessed
   invitation, standing good at this hour to you, O Friend! Yes, it will
   hold good even to a man's dying day and this may be to you that very
   day! Jesus has not ceased to invite, nor will He cease to receive all
   that come to Him.

   Do you ask me again, "What is this thirst?" Thirst is nothing actual,
   or substantive--it is a lack, a need crying out of its emptiness. It is
   the absence of a necessity. Sinner, you need not look for any good
   thing in yourself--the thirst which is sought for is the absence of all
   good things. Thirst is a painful need. Have you not needs? Thirst is an
   emptiness, a vacuum--it is the miss of that which is essential to life.
   Have you not such a void? Thirst is conscious need, conscious to a
   painful degree--have you not this? This sense of need is your thirst.
   The need naturally begets a pain. When our system needs drink, a
   merciful Providence creates a pang so that we are driven to take notice
   that a requisite of life must be immediately supplied. Thirst rings the
   alarm and the mind and body set to work to supply the urgent demand. It
   were a dreadful thing if the system needed water and yet did not
   thirst, for we might be fatally injured before we knew that any harm
   was happening to us. The pain of thirst is a salutary warning that
   something very important is needed.

   Now, Soul, if you are suffering from fear or despondency--if your heart
   is heavy and you have disquietude of spirit--if you have a longing, a
   sighing, a pining after something better and holier, then you are
   thirsty. If you have this thirst in any measure or degree, you are bid
   to come to Christ and drink. If you have not as yet a burning thirst,
   nor a fever, but if you have any sort of thirst, you may come and
   drink. If you do, in any measure, long for mercy and renewal, you are
   included in this invitation, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me
   and drink." Do not look within yourself to find any good thing. Is
   thirst a good thing? No, thirst is an evil thing to be removed! And if
   you see in yourself only evil things to be removed, you have all that
   Jesus sets forth in this text as the description of those whom He
   permits to come to Himself. He says so much and no more--"If any man
   thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink."

   I wonder whether I have found out the thirsty person this morning? Are
   you sitting upstairs in the top gallery? Or are you among the thicker
   company below? Where are you? Find yourself out now! Turn your eyes
   inward--look not to your neighbor, but say within your own soul, "Yes,
   I thirst. Perhaps not as I should, but still I do desire. I am uneasy,
   I have an unrest, there is an absence of good in me. Oh, that my thirst
   were satisfied this morning!" Friend, you are my man! Before we go
   further, let me salute you and say, "Man, my Brother," or, "Woman, my
   Sister, the Lord Jesus says unto you, 'Come unto Me and drink.'" Thus
   much upon the enquiry after the thirsty ones.

   II. Here is, secondly, THE ONE DIRECTION FOR THE RELIEF OF ALL SUCH
   THIRSTY ONES--"Let him come unto Me and drink." There is one direction
   and that one direction points solely to one Source. All who would have
   their thirst relieved must come to one Fountain, to one Jesus. Observe,
   that Christ, who gives the water which quenches spiritual thirst,
   directs us to come to Himself. Do notice this. "Let him come unto Me
   and drink." Do you ask, "What creed am I to believe, what doctrines am
   I to receive?" We will tell you of this, by-and-by, but just now He
   that is set before you this morning is a Person--the Son of God, the
   Lord Jesus Christ. At the time when He spoke this text, He had not been
   crucified, nor dead, nor buried, nor raised from the dead, but the text
   was spoken with a foresight of all this, as you will see by reading two
   verses further on, where we are told that what Christ said took for
   granted His death and Resurrection. "The Holy Spirit was not yet given;
   because that Jesus was not yet glorified."

   In this verse our Lord speaks as if He had been dead, had risen and had
   been glorified. So then, O Soul, if your thirst is to be relieved, you
   must come to Jesus, the Son of God, who became the Son of Man! You must
   come to the One who lived, who took human sin upon Himself and died for
   it, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God! You must come to the
   One who, being dead, was taken down from the Cross and laid in the
   grave where He slept a little while and then

   arose from among the dead into newness of life! You must come to the
   One, who, after 40 days, ascended on high, leading captivity captive!

   At this hour He sits at the right hand of God, all power being given
   unto Him in Heaven and in earth. In His Glory He is, this day, able to
   save to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him. You must come to
   Him who has finished His redeeming work and lives always to make
   intercession for us. And if you will come to Him, He will give you the
   full supply of all the great needs of your nature. O, my Hearer,
   whatever your spiritual desire is, Jesus will grant it! Whatever, in
   fact, your soul requires between this place and Glory, He will give it
   to you. But you must come to Him for it and to Him, alone! You must
   come distinctly to Him and not to ceremonies, or sacraments, or
   priests, or churches, or assemblies, or creeds, or services, or doings,
   or feelings! You are not to eat or drink of the house, or of the
   servants--but the Master Himself gives you Himself to be your Bread
   from Heaven. Your salvation lies in that Divine Person whom, by faith,
   I see at this moment, clothed in the splendor of Heaven, yet still
   wearing the marks of His passion! He looks like a lamb that has been
   slain! He presents a perpetually complete Atonement and continually
   reconciles sinners to God. There lies your hope, and there alone! In
   that Person, I say, and in that Person, only, is there salvation!

   All that a sinner needs is to be found in abundance in Jesus. The Lord
   Jesus invites all who feel their thirst, to come to Him and partake,
   feeling no diffidence as to His ability to meet all their cases. "If
   any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." Though your thirst is
   like that of a panting ox upon a sultry summer's day who puts down his
   mouth to the brook and drinks as though he would leave it dry--you may
   come and feel no trembling as to the sufficiency of the Living Waters.
   Yes, you may come in your dozens, your scores, your hundreds, your
   thousands, your millions and your hundreds of millions! There shall
   never be a time when the Lord Jesus shall bid the thirsty stay away
   because the current of His Grace is exhausted! He said, "If any man
   thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink," without stint or measure--
   there is nothing to limit the draught or question the supply! In Jesus
   there is such a fullness that it never will be exhausted. Sin may be
   exhausted, the race may be numbered, time may be finished and need may
   be ended, but mercy endures forever!

   There is, in Christ Jesus, a varied supply. The thirst of the soul is
   not like the thirst of the body, which is readily quenched by any one
   liquid, for the thirst of the soul is for many things. Whatever many
   things the soul thirsts for, Jesus will supply them all! Our wonderful
   variety of needs is met by His wonderful variety of excellences. Here
   is a soul that needs peace--"this Man shall be the peace." "I am
   unhinged. I am almost driven to distraction. I am sorely troubled so
   that I cannot sleep." You shall have rest by coming to Jesus--"He gives
   His beloved sleep." "But I am so guilty! I have sinned past all pardon.
   I blush to think how grievously I have trespassed." You can have pardon
   for all your sins, though they are as glaring as scarlet and though for
   number they are as many as the sands of the sea. In Jesus the penitent
   finds perfect pardon for all his offenses. Do you believe this? It is
   certainly so. God will cast all your transgressions into the depths of
   the sea if you believe in the Lord Jesus!

   How happy is the man who, by faith in Jesus, knows that the Lord has
   fully and freely forgiven Him! "But I need purity," cries a third. "I
   am troubled with horrible thoughts. I have a strong passionate nature
   which draws me into wrong desires. I have been a drunk. I have been
   unchaste. I have been given to the use of foul language and these
   things are a source of continued defilement." Oh, my Friend, you can
   get rid of all this if you desire to do so, by coming to Jesus! He will
   give you a new heart and a right spirit! He will totally change your
   nature, so that this evil shall never more have dominion over you! "But
   where sin abounded, Grace shall much more abound." Do you hear this?
   All purity is in Christ for you. "But I," says one, "desire to make
   progress. I hope I am right and I want to be more right. I want to make
   advances in the Divine life so as to honor God and bless my fellow
   men." Come, then, to the Lord Jesus, and drink, for He gives life and
   gives it more abundantly!

   "But I need," says a Christian, "power in prayer and power to convince
   and convert my fellow men." Come, then, to Jesus, for it is concerning
   this, also, He says, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and
   drink." He will make you strong upon your knees and mighty in holy
   service if you will but surrender your will to Him. "But I need
   perseverance," cries another, "I can scarcely hold on my way; I am hard
   put to it; I faint even though I resolve to pursue." Come to Him, then,
   for persevering Grace. "He will keep the feet of His saints." Find your
   strength to stand and your ability to endure in Him alone! If any man
   thirsts for anything that is really desirable, let Him come to Jesus,
   in whom all right desires are provided for. All for sinners and all for
   saints will be found in Jesus our Lord, who is All in All!

   Still remember that it is to Jesus, only, that you must come--and you
   must bring nothing of your own with you. All you are bid to do lies in
   these two things--come and drink. Christ is accessible and you may come
   to Him. He does not stand with a gulf between Him and you, mockingly
   crying, "Come." No, He comes where you are today, in all your misery
   and sin, and He sweetly whispers, "Come." Arise, then, for He calls
   you! He shortens the way for you, no, He is Himself the Way. He comes
   to you and He says, "Come to me," not because there is now a vast
   distance to traverse, but because there is only a step and He would
   have you take it at once. Do but trust Him and you have come to Him!
   This coming is not so much an exercise of power, as the resignation of
   power. Submit yourself to Jesus. Yield to Him. Be willing that He
   should be everything to you and you have truly come to Him!

   Then you are told to drink. That is not a difficult action. Any fool
   can drink! In fact, many are great fools because they drink too much of
   poisonous liquors. Drinking is peculiarly the commonplace act of
   sinners. "Drink!" Surely you can do that! You have only to be as a
   sponge that sucks up all that comes near it. To drink is the act of a
   baby, a sick man, a wounded deer, or even a little chick. Put your
   mouth down and suck up that which flows to you in the river of Christ's
   Love. See how a newborn babe drinks from its mother's breast--be you as
   that weak babe and take in Christ according to your capacity. He bids
   you receive Him--why hesitate? You are not to bring anything to Jesus,
   but to take everything from Him, as the thirsty ground opens its mouth
   and drinks in the showers, many as they may be. Open wide your soul and
   drink in Christ, as the great northern whirlpool sucks in the sea! Pull
   up the sluices and let streams of Mercy flow through you in glorious
   torrents! It is all He bids you do. It is, in fact, to do nothing but
   to receive your God. If any man thirsts, let Him receive Christ! This,
   then, is the one direction for the relief of the burning thirst of all
   sin-sick souls.

   III. Consider, in the third place, THE PERMISSION HERE GIVEN FOR THEIR
   PARTICIPATION. I have told

   you where the water is, but the question comes, "May I drink of it?" If
   you are thirsty, drink. No limit is placed in our text. "Whoever will,
   let him take the Water of Life freely." There is no limit as to what
   you have formerly done. "Oh, but I have been so guilty, so hardened! I
   have uttered bitter words. I have even spoken against God and His
   Christ. I have denied the Deity of our Lord! I have gone aside into all
   manner of crooked ways!" Whatever you have done, if you have, now, any
   longing after God and your Savior, come freely, just as you are, for He
   bids you come and drink. "But I dare not say what I have done, Sir."
   You need not say it to me--it were better you did not. Confess it to
   God, alone, and though you are black as seven midnights and foul as
   seven Hells, you may come to Jesus, just as you are, and receive from
   Him complete absolution. "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and
   drink."

   Neither is there any limit put as to where you have gone before. I
   remember one who wanted to purchase a certain article and he called
   upon one of the chief merchants and asked his price. When this was
   given him, he went his way to half-a-dozen other traders and tried to
   buy at a cheaper rate. He did not succeed, but, on the contrary, he
   found that the first had quoted the lowest price. When he walked a
   second time into that shop, his advances were not welcomed. "No," said
   the merchant, "I shall not serve you--you have been all round the town
   and if you could have got it a farthing cheaper, you would not have
   been here. I don't care for such customers." It is not thus with our
   Lord Jesus! He makes and keeps a free trade in Grace. If you have gone
   to Moses, if you have gone to Rome, if you have gone to a priest or
   father confessor--yes, if you have gone to the devil--yet still you may
   come to Christ! Do not fear a refusal! He still says, "If any man
   thirsts" though he has been to all the wells on earth and found them
   dry, still, this Well is full and he is permitted to drink at it. "Let
   him come unto Me and drink."

   There is no limit because of any kind of need. "Oh," says one, "I am
   deficient in tenderness. I am deficient in patience!" Whatever you are
   deficient in, so much the greater is your thirst, and the Lord meets
   that thirst in all respects. If any man lacks anything, the Lord will
   supply that lack. If any man is conscious that he has a great and
   grievous lack of that which is most essential, as when one has need of
   water which is essential to life, let him come to Christ and drink!
   "Surely," says one, "I cannot be intended, for I am in peculiar
   circumstances. I am very old." Come and drink, if you have any thirst
   though you are as old as Methuselah! "But I am so poor." The poorer you
   are, the more welcome you are! Come you, in your smock frock, and
   drink! "But I cannot read." Never mind! The text does not say, "Read,"
   but "Drink." At the polling booths many are met who cannot read, but
   none who cannot drink! I have known some that could not read a letter
   who could drink a churnful--drinking is an ability which is very widely
   distributed! The power to receive is scarcely a power and yet it is the
   only power needed for salvation! Come along and take what Christ freely

   gives you. "Alas, I am so different from others!" Does the text say
   that any are shut out because they are different from others? No! Jesus
   stood and cried, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink"

   Sorrowfully I notice that some are ingeniously trying to lock the door
   against themselves with the very key that was meant to open it. "Alas,"
   one cries, "I am afraid I do not thirst!" Tell me, then, what is the
   matter with you? "Sir, I have not such a sense of need as I ought to
   have." That is to say, you are sensible that you are more needy than
   you think you are! If you are conscious that you are not fully aware of
   all your needs, then I urge you to come to Jesus, just as you are, for
   if ever there was a thirsty soul, you are one! You even need a sense of
   need--and this proves that you are horribly in need! You are the most
   needy among the needy and should be among the first to come!

   "I am afraid I do not thirst." Tell me, would you come if you did
   thirst? "That I would." Then come at once and none will cast you out
   because when you come, it will be clear that you must have thirsted,
   for no one ever comes to Jesus who does not thirst. I am reasoning with
   you in a roundabout way, as you do with me. "But I want to thirst
   more." Then come and drink and you shall thirst more--that is to say,
   you shall know more of your need of Christ than you do now, for they
   that find Christ, value Christ more than those who, as yet, have never
   found Him! Come if you thirst and come if you think you do not thirst,
   but wish you did thirst, for that wish to thirst is the very thirst you
   wish for! The sense that you have no proper sense of need is the very
   best sense that can be! Your need of a power to feel your need is your
   greatest need! Consciousness of your own unconsciousness is the truest
   consciousness! Your groaning because you cannot groan is the deepest
   groaning that ever is groaned!

   Therefore, come along with you! Keep not back through shame or fear,
   for Jesus will give you a hearty welcome and supply everything you can
   possibly require. The more unfit you feel yourself to be, the more are
   you invited to come-- your very unfitness is your fitness for coming to
   Jesus! It is not what you have that God asks for, but He invites you to
   bring before Him what you have not, that He may meet your pressing
   needs and give you all things to enjoy. He takes advantage of your
   poverty in a blessed manner. You know how men do with one another--if
   they find a man utterly reduced, they grind him down still more. Now,
   the Lord takes advantage of your poverty to lift you up! The less there
   is in you that is good, the more you need a Savior and the more readily
   does that Savior present Himself to you! If you are starved to the last
   extremity and if there is not a drop of oil in the cruse, nor a handful
   of meal in the barrel, only look to Christ and He will spread your
   table with food convenient for you! Only confess your emptiness and all
   His fullness is at your disposal.

   There is one thing I should like you to think of, and that is, when
   Christ says, "Come unto Me and drink," nobody else can say you cannot,
   for surely, the Lord Jesus is master of Himself and His guarantees run
   in His own Kingdom! If He says "come unto Me," who is to keep you away?
   If you were master of a large estate and said to a poor man, "Walk
   round it, go where you please"--and if your bailiff should meet this
   person and warn him off as a trespasser, would you not expect the poor
   man to say, "Your master gave me permission and I will not be driven
   off by you"? So, if the devil, or conscience, or anything else, says to
   you, "You must not hope in Divine Mercy, nor in any other way lay hold
   of Christ," you may boldly reply, "Your Master said I might! Jesus,
   Himself, said, 'If any man thirsts, let Him come unto Me and drink!' I
   thirsted, I came and I received--and I will never give up what I have
   received, for I have Christ's permission to have it, and keep it, I
   will."

   Oh, how I wish these words of encouragement would meet the cases of
   many before me! I thought I would have a full house this morning and if
   it had been fine weather we would have been densely crowded. But when I
   saw it raining so very heavily I fancied we would have comparatively
   few and, perhaps, it would be better to change the topic. But I said,
   "Never mind, I will preach the same sermon to the few as to the many,"
   because I remembered the morning when I found the Savior, myself. It
   was as wet and miserable a morning as the present one and, moreover,
   the ground was covered with a deep snow. Sleet was falling fast and the
   wind was blowing bitterly. I had intended to go to another place of
   worship half a mile further on, but I could not reach it through stress
   of weather, otherwise I would not have turned into the little Primitive
   Chapel. I do not suppose there were more than 20 people present that
   morning, but it did not matter. That poor man's morning's work was
   satisfactory, for the Lord blessed a youth who has since then preached
   to many thousands.

   Among a few the best success may yet be gained. Perhaps, this morning,
   I am to catch some souls who will be useful to multitudes of others.
   Yonder young man who has come here, he hardly knows why, is to be
   decided for Jesus! He

   would not have been here if it had not been so wet. He is the very man
   the Lord has need of and when he is converted, he shall be used for the
   Lord's Glory! At any rate, from this pulpit rings out the blessed
   invitation with trumpet voice, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto
   Me and drink."

   IV. We close with THE ENTREATY FOR THEIR COMING. Jesus pleads with them
   to come. "Jesus stood and cried." I cannot picture the enthusiasm of
   His soul, the passion of His heart as He spoke that morning. "If any
   man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." The tones of that
   pleading voice were both striking and wooing, forcible and tender.
   When, on that last occasion, He addressed the people, He poured out His
   whole soul pleading with them that they would come to Him, then and
   there! Dear Hearts, when I think of Christ entreating us to come, I am
   astonished that we should need such pleading and that He should give
   it! Surely the shoe should be on the other foot! Ought we not to
   entreat Him to let us come? Should we not fall on our knees and plead
   for permission to receive the Savior? Instead of that, we are cold and
   callous and it is He that is eager for us to come. He loves us better
   than we love ourselves! When a man has charity to give away, does he
   entreat people to come and accept it? No, but they come and knock at
   his door and beg him to give it to them.

   How strange is this, that you should be unwilling and Christ anxious!
   That you should be backward and Christ forward! That Jesus should cry,
   "Come," and you should sit still and decline His calls! Should you not
   come when Jesus, Himself, invites and even entreats? Is it not
   baseness? Is it not gross hardness of heart if we do not receive Him
   who speaks from Heaven and cries, "If any man thirsts, let him come
   unto Me and drink"? You have not come before--that was wrong--but the
   times of your ignorance God winked at and bids you come now. Oh, that
   His sweet Spirit would accompany my words, so that you might feel your
   hearts melting towards the Savior and might say, "Yes, we will come, we
   will trust Jesus, we will receive His Grace!"

   O my Brothers and Sisters, if this is your hearty consent to Infinite
   Love, then your sorrow is ended, your danger is over, your joy is
   begun! The Lord grant it, for His dear Son's sake. Amen.
