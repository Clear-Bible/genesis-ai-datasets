   General Introduction to Mediaeval Church History.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Sources and Literature.

   August Potthast: Bibliotheca Historica Medii Aoevi. Wegweiser durch die
   Geschichtswerke des Europäischen Mittelalters von 375-1500. Berlin,
   1862. Supplement, 1868.

   The mediaeval literature embraces four distinct branches;

   1. The Romano-Germanic or Western Christian;

   2. The Graeco-Byzantine or Eastern Christian;

   3. The Talmudic and Rabbinical;

   4. The Arabic and Mohammedan.

   We notice here only the first and second; the other two will be
   mentioned in subdivisions as far as they are connected with church
   history.

   The Christian literature consists partly of documentary sources, partly
   of historical works. We confine ourselves here to the most important
   works of a more general character. Books referring to particular
   countries and sections of church history will be noticed in the
   progress of the narrative.

   I. Documentary Sources.

   They are mostly in Latin--the official language of the Western
   Church,--and in Greek,--the official language of the Eastern Church.

   (1) For the history of missions: the letters and biographies of
   missionaries.

   (2) For church polity and government: the official letters of popes,
   patriarchs, and bishops.

   The documents of the papal court embrace (a) Regesta (registra), the
   transactions of the various branches of the papal government from a.d.
   1198-1572, deposited in the Vatican library, and difficult of access.
   (b) Epistolae decretales, which constitute the basis of the Corpus
   juris canonici, brought to a close in 1313. (c) The bulls (bulla, a
   seal or stamp of globular form, though some derive it from boulhv,
   will, decree) and briefs (breve, a short, concise summary), i.e., the
   official letters since the conclusion of the Canon law. They are of
   equal authority, but the bulls differ from the briefs by their more
   solemn form. The bulls are written on parchment, and sealed with a seal
   of lead or gold, which is stamped on one side with the effigies of
   Peter and Paul, and on the other with the name of the reigning pope,
   and attached to the instrument by a string; while the briefs are
   written on paper, sealed with red wax, and impressed with the seal of
   the fisherman or Peter in a boat.

   (3) For the history of Christian life: the biographies of saints, the
   disciplinary canons of synods, the ascetic literature.

   (4) For worship and ceremonies: liturgies, hymns, homilies, works of
   architecture sculpture, painting, poetry, music. The Gothic cathedrals
   are as striking embodiments of mediaeval Christianity as the Egyptian
   pyramids are of the civilization of the Pharaohs.

   (5) For theology and Christian learning: the works of the later fathers
   (beginning with Gregory I.), schoolmen, mystics, and the forerunners of
   the Reformation.

   II. Documentary Collections. Works of Mediaeval Writers.

   (1) For the Oriental Church.

   Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae, opera Niebuhrii, Bekkeri, et

   ... Patrum, etc. Paris, 1844-'66. The Latin series (1844-'55) has 221
   vols. (4 vols. indices); the Greek series (1857-66) has 166 vols. The
   Latin series, from tom. 80-217, contains the writers from Gregory the
   Great to Innocent III. Reprints of older editions, and most valuable
   for completeness and convenience, though lacking in critical accuracy.

   Abbé Horay: Medii AEvi Bibliotheca Patristica ab anno MCCXVI usque ad
   Concilii Tridentini Tempora. Paris, 1879 sqq. A continuation of Migne
   in the same style. The first 4 vols. contain the Opera Honori III.

   XVI. appeared 1857 in 1 vol.

   G. H. Pertz (d. 1876): Monumenta Germaniae Historica. Hannov.
   1826-1879. 24 vols. fol. Continued by G. Waitz.

   III. Documentary Histories.

   Acta Sanctorum Bollandistarum. Antw. Bruxellis et Tongerloae,
   1643-1794; Brux. 1845 sqq., new ed. Paris, 1863-75, in 61 vols. fol.
   (with supplement). See a list of contents in the seventh volume for
   June or the first volume for October; also in the second part of
   Potthast, sub "Vita," pp. 575 sqq.

   This monumental work of John Bolland (a learned Jesuit, 1596-1665),
   Godefr. Henschen (1681), Dan. Papebroch (1714), and their associates
   and followers, called Bollandists, contains biographies of all the
   saints of the Catholic Church in the order of the calendar, and divided
   into months. They are not critical histories, but compilations of an
   immense material of facts and fiction, which illustrate the life and
   manners of the ancient and mediaeval church. Potthast justly calls it a
   "riesenhaftes Denkmal wissenschaftlichen Strebens." It was carried on
   with the aid of the Belgic government, which contributed (since 1837)
   6,000 francs annually.

   Caes. Baronius (d. 1607): Annales ecclesiastici a Christo nato ad annum
   1198. Rom. 1588-1593, 12 vols. Continued by Raynaldi (from 1198 to
   1565), Laderchi (from 1566-1571), and A. Theiner (1572-1584). Best ed.
   by Mansi, with the continuations of Raynaldi, and the Critica of Pagi,
   Lucca, 1738-'59, 35 vols. fol. text, and 3 vols. of index universalis.
   A new ed. by A. Theiner (d. 1874), Bar-le-Duc, 1864 sqq. Likewise a
   work of herculean industry, but to be used with critical caution, as it
   contains many spurious documents, legends and fictions, and is written
   in the interest and defence of the papacy.

   § 2. The Middle Age. Limits and General Character.

   The Middle Age, as the term implies, is the period which intervenes
   between ancient and modern times, and connects them, by continuing the
   one, and preparing for the other. It forms the transition from the
   Graeco-Roman civilization to the Romano-Germanic, civilization, which
   gradually arose out of the intervening chaos of barbarism. The
   connecting link is Christianity, which saved the best elements of the
   old, and directed and moulded the new order of things.

   Politically, the middle age dates from the great migration of nations
   and the downfall of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century; but
   for ecclesiastical history it begins with Gregory the Great, the last
   of the fathers and the first of the popes, at the close of the sixth
   century. Its termination, both for secular and ecclesiastical history,
   is the Reformation of the sixteenth century (1517), which introduces
   the modern age of the Christian era. Some date modern history from the
   invention of the art of printing, or from the discovery of America,
   which preceded the Reformation; but these events were only preparatory
   to a great reform movement and extension of the Christian world.

   The theatre of mediaeval Christianity is mainly Europe. In Western Asia
   and North Africa, the Cross was supplanted by the Crescent; and
   America, which opened a new field for the ever-expanding energies of
   history, was not discovered until the close of the fifteenth century.

   Europe was peopled by a warlike emigration of heathen barbarians from
   Asia as America is peopled by a peaceful emigration from civilized and
   Christian Europe.

   The great migration of nations marks a turning point in the history of
   religion and civilization. It was destructive in its first effects, and
   appeared like the doom of the judgment-day; but it proved the harbinger
   of a new creation, the chaos preceding the cosmos. The change was
   brought about gradually. The forces of the old Greek and Roman world
   continued to work for centuries alongside of the new elements. The
   barbarian irruption came not like a single torrent which passes by, but
   as the tide which advances and retires, returns and at last becomes
   master of the flooded soil. The savages of the north swept down the
   valley of the Danube to the borders of the Greek Empire, and southward
   over the Rhine and the Vosges into Gaul, across the Alps into Italy,
   and across the Pyrenees into Spain. They were not a single people, but
   many independent tribes; not an organized army of a conqueror, but
   irregular hordes of wild warriors ruled by intrepid kings; not directed
   by the ambition of one controlling genius, like Alexander or Caesar,
   but prompted by the irresistible impulse of an historical instinct, and
   unconsciously bearing in their rear the future destinies of Europe and
   America. They brought with them fire and sword, destruction and
   desolation, but also life and vigor, respect for woman, sense of honor,
   love of liberty--noble instincts, which, being purified and developed
   by Christianity, became the governing principles of a higher
   civilization than that of Greece and Rome. The Christian monk Salvian,
   who lived in the midst of the barbarian flood, in the middle of the
   fifth century, draws a most gloomy and appalling picture of the vices
   of the orthodox Romans of his time, and does not hesitate to give
   preference to the heretical (Arian) and heathen barbarians, "whose
   chastity purifies the deep stained with the Roman debauches." St.
   Augustin (d. 430), who took a more sober and comprehensive view,
   intimates, in his great work on the City of God, the possibility of the
   rise of a new and better civilization from the ruins of the old Roman
   empire; and his pupil, Orosius, clearly expresses this hopeful view.
   "Men assert," he says, "that the barbarians are enemies of the State. I
   reply that all the East thought the same of the great Alexander; the
   Romans also seemed no better than the enemies of all society to the
   nations afar off, whose repose they troubled. But the Greeks, you say,
   established empires; the Germans overthrow them. Well, the Macedonians
   began by subduing the nations which afterwards they civilized. The
   Germans are now upsetting all this world; but if, which Heaven avert,
   they, finish by continuing to be its masters, peradventure some day
   posterity will salute with the title of great princes those in whom we
   at this day can see nothing but enemies."

   § 3. The Nations of Mediaeval Christianity. The Kelt, the Teuton, and
   the Slav.

   The new national forces which now enter upon the arena of
   church-history may be divided into four groups:

   1. The Romanic or Latin nations of Southern Europe, including the
   Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese and French. They are the natural
   descendants and heirs of the old Roman nationality and Latin
   Christianity, yet mixed with the new Keltic and Germanic forces. Their
   languages are all derived from the Latin; they inherited Roman laws and
   customs, and adhered to the Roman See as the centre of their
   ecclesiastical organization; they carried Christianity to the advancing
   barbarians, and by their superior civilization gave laws to the
   conquerors. They still adhere, with their descendants in Central and
   South America, to the Roman Catholic Church.

   2. The Keltic race, embracing the Gauls, old Britons, the Picts and
   Scots, the Welsh and Irish with their numerous emigrants in all the
   large cities of Great Britain and the United States, appear in history
   several hundred years before Christ, as the first light wave of the
   vast Aryan migration from the mysterious bowels of Asia, which swept to
   the borders of the extreme West. [2] The Gauls were conquered by
   Caesar, but afterwards commingled with the Teutonic Francs, who founded
   the French monarchy. The Britons were likewise subdued by the Romans,
   and afterwards driven to Wales and Cornwall by the Anglo-Saxons. The
   Scotch in the highlands (Gaels) remained Keltic, while in the lowlands
   they mixed with Saxons and Normans.

   The mental characteristics of the Kelts remain unchanged for two
   thousand years: quick wit, fluent speech, vivacity, sprightliness,
   impressibility, personal bravery and daring, loyalty to the chief or
   the clan, but also levity, fickleness, quarrelsomeness and incapacity
   for self-government. "They shook all empires, but founded none." The
   elder Cato says of them: "To two things are the Kelts most attent: to
   fighting (ars militaris), and to adroitness of speech (argute loqui)."
   Caesar censures their love of levity and change. The apostle Paul
   complains of the same weakness. Thierry, their historian, well
   describes them thus: "Their prominent attributes are personal valor, in
   which they excel all nations; a frank, impetuous spirit open to every
   impression; great intelligence, but joined with extreme mobility,
   deficient perseverance, restlessness under discipline and order,
   boastfulness and eternal discord, resulting from boundless vanity."
   Mommsen quotes this passage, and adds that the Kelts make good
   soldiers, but bad citizens; that the only order to which they submit is
   the military, because the severe general discipline relieves them of
   the heavy burden of individual self-control. [3]

   Keltic Christianity was at first independent of Rome, and even
   antagonistic to it in certain subordinate rites; but after the Saxon
   and Norman conquests, it was brought into conformity, and since the
   Reformation, the Irish have been more attached to the Roman Church than
   even the Latin races. The French formerly inclined likewise to a
   liberal Catholicism (called Gallicanism); but they sacrificed the
   Gallican liberties to the Ultramontanism of the Vatican Council. The
   Welsh and Scotch, on the contrary, with the exception of a portion of
   the Highlanders in the North of Scotland, embraced the Protestant
   Reformation in its Calvinistic rigor, and are among its sternest and
   most vigorous advocates. The course of the Keltic nations had been
   anticipated by the Galatians, who first embraced with great readiness
   and heartiness the independent gospel of St. Paul, but were soon turned
   away to a Judaizing legalism by false teachers, and then brought back
   again by Paul to the right path.

   3. The Germanic [4] or Teutonic [5] nations followed the Keltic
   migration in successive westward and southward waves, before and after
   Christ, and spread over Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Scandinavia, the
   Baltic provinces of Russia, and, since the Anglo-Saxon invasion, also
   over England and Scotland and the northern (non-Keltic) part of
   Ireland. In modern times their descendants peacefully settled the
   British Provinces and the greater part of North America. The Germanic
   nations are the fresh, vigorous, promising and advancing races of the
   middle age and modern times. Their Christianization began in the fourth
   century, and went on in wholesale style till it was completed in the
   tenth. The Germans, under their leader Odoacer in 476, deposed Romulus
   Augustulus--the shadow of old Romulus and Augustus--and overthrew the
   West Roman Empire, thus fulfilling the old augury of the twelve birds
   of fate, that Rome was to grow six centuries and to decline six
   centuries. Wherever they went, they brought destruction to decaying
   institutions. But with few exceptions, they readily embraced the
   religion of the conquered Latin provinces, and with childlike docility
   submitted to its educational power. They were predestinated for
   Christianity, and Christianity for them. It curbed their warlike
   passions, regulated their wild force, and developed their nobler
   instincts, their devotion and fidelity, their respect for woman, their
   reverence for all family-relations, their love of personal liberty and
   independence. The Latin church was to them only a school of discipline
   to prepare them for an age of Christian manhood and independence, which
   dawned in the sixteenth century. The Protestant Reformation was the
   emancipation of the Germanic races from the pupilage of mediaeval and
   legalistic Catholicism.

   Tacitus, the great heathen historian, no doubt idealized the barbarous
   Germans in contrast with the degenerate Romans of his day (as Montaigne
   and Rousseau painted the savages "in a fit of ill humor against their
   country"); but he unconsciously prophesied their future greatness, and
   his prophecy has been more than fulfilled.

   4. The Slavonic or Slavic or Slavs [6] in the East and North of Europe,
   including the Bulgarians, Bohemians (Czechs), Moravians, Slovaks,
   Servians, Croatians, Wends, Poles, and Russians, were mainly converted
   through Eastern missionaries since the ninth and tenth century. The
   Eastern Slavs, who are the vast majority, were incorporated with the
   Greek Church, which became the national religion of Russia, and through
   this empire acquired a territory almost equal to that of the Roman
   Church. The western Slavs, the Bohemians and Poles, became subject to
   the Papacy.

   The Slavs, who number in all nearly 80,000,000, occupy a very
   subordinate position in the history of the middle ages, and are
   isolated from the main current; but recently, they have begun to
   develop their resources, and seem to have a great future before them
   through the commanding political power of Russia in Europe and in Asia.
   Russia is the bearer of the destinies of Panslavism and of the, Eastern
   Church.

   5. The Greek nationality, which figured so conspicuously in ancient
   Christianity, maintained its independence down to the fall of the
   Byzantine Empire in 1453; but it was mixed with Slavonic elements. The
   Greek Church was much weakened by the inroads of Mohammedanism) and
   lost the possession of the territories of primitive Christianity, but
   secured a new and vast missionary field in Russia.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] keltoior Keltai, Celtae, Galatai, Galatae or Galati, Galli, Gael.
   Some derive it from celt, a cover, shelter; others from celu (Lat.
   celo) to conceal. Herodotus first mentions them, as dwelling in the
   extreme northwest of Europe. On these terms see Diefenbach, Celtica,
   Brandes, Kelten und Germanen, Thierry, Histoire des Gaulois, the art.
   Galli in Pauly's Realencyclopädie, and the introductions to the
   critical Commentaries on the Galatians by Wieseler and Lightfoot (and
   Lightfoot's Excursus I). The Galatians in Asia Minor, to whom Paul
   addressed his epistle, were a branch of the Keltic race, which either
   separated from the main current of the westward migration, or, being
   obstructed by the ocean, retraced their steps, and turned eastward.
   Wieseler (in his Com. and in several articles in the "Studien und
   Kritiken, " and in the "Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte," 1877 No. 1)
   tries to make them Germans, a view first hinted at by Luther. But the
   fickleness of the Galatian Christians is characterristic of the ancient
   Gauls and modern French.

   [3] Römische Geschichte, Vol. I., p. 329, 5th ed., Berlin, 1868.

   [4] The word is of uncertain origin. Some derive it from a Keltic root,
   garm or gairm, i.e. noise; some from the old German gere(guerre), a
   pointed weapon, spear or javelin (so that German would mean an armed
   man, or war-man, Wehrmann); others, from the Persian irman, erman, i.e.
   guest.

   [5] From the Gothic thiudisco, gentiles, popularis; hence the Latin
   teutonicus, and the German deutschor teutsch(which may also be
   connected with diutan, deutsch deutlich). In the English usage, the
   term German is confined to the Germans proper, and Dutch to the
   Hollanders; but Germanic and Teutonic apply to all cognate races.

   [6] The term Slav or Slavonian is derived by some from slovo, word, by
   others, from slava, glory. From it are derived the words slave and
   slavery (Sclave, esclave), because many Slavs were reduced to a state
   of slavery or serfdom by their German masters. Webster spells slave
   instead of slav, and Edward A. Freeman, in his Historical Essays (third
   series, 1879), defends this spelling on three grounds: 1) No English
   word ends in v. But many Russian words do, as Kiev, Yaroslav, and some
   Hebrew grammars use Tav and Vav for Tau and Vau. 2) Analogy. We write
   Dane, Swede, Pole, not Dan, etc. But the a in Slav has the continental
   sound, and the tendency is to get rid of mute vowels. 3) The form Slave
   perpetuates the etymology. But the etymology (slave = doulos) is
   uncertain, and it is well to distinguish the national name from the
   ordinary slaves, and thus avoid offence. The Germans also distinguish
   between Slaven, Sclaven.

   § 4. Genius of Mediaeval Christianity.

   Mediaeval Christianity is, on the one hand, a legitimate continuation
   and further development of ancient Catholicism; on the other hand, a
   preparation for Protestantism,

   Its leading form are the papacy, monasticism, and scholasticism, which
   were developed to their height, and then assailed by growing opposition
   from within.

   Christianity, at its first introduction, had to do with highly
   civilized nations; but now it had to lay the foundation of a new
   civilization among barbarians. The apostles planted churches in the
   cities of the Jews, Greeks, and Romans, and the word "pagan" i.e,
   villager, backwoodsman, gradually came to denote an idolater. They
   spoke and wrote in a language which had already a large and immortal
   literature; their progress was paved by the high roads of the Roman
   legions; they found everywhere an established order of society, and
   government; and their mission was to infuse into the ancient
   civilization a new spiritual life and to make it subservient to higher
   moral ends. But the missionaries of the dark ages had to visit wild
   woods and untilled fields, to teach rude nations the alphabet, and to
   lay the foundation for society, literature and art.

   Hence Christianity assumed the character of a strong disciplinary
   institution, a training school for nations in their infancy, which had
   to be treated as children. Hence the legalistic, hierarchical,
   ritualistic and romantic character of mediaeval Catholicism. Yet in
   proportion as the nations were trained in the school of the church,
   they began to assert their independence of the hierarchy and to develop
   a national literature in their own language. Compared with our times,
   in which thought and reflection have become the highest arbiter of
   human life, the middle age was an age of passion. The written law, such
   as it was developed in Roman society, the barbarian could not
   understand and would not obey. But he was easily impressed by the
   spoken law, the living word, and found a kind of charm in bending his
   will absolutely before another will. Thus the teaching church became
   the law in the land, and formed the very foundation of all social and
   political organization.

   The middle ages are often called "the dark ages:" truly, if we compare
   them with ancient Christianity, which preceded, and with modern
   Christianity, which followed; falsely and unjustly, if the church is
   made responsible for the darkness. Christianity was the light that
   shone in the darkness of surrounding barbarism and heathenism, and
   gradually dispelled it. Industrious priests and monks saved from the
   wreck of the Roman Empire the treasures of classical literature,
   together with the Holy Scriptures and patristic writings, and
   transmitted them to better times. The mediaeval light was indeed the
   borrowed star and moon-light of ecclesiastical tradition, rather than
   the clear sun-light from the inspired pages of the New Testament; but
   it was such light as the eyes of nations in their ignorance could bear,
   and it never ceased to shine till it disappeared in the day-light of
   the great Reformation. Christ had his witnesses in all ages and
   countries, and those shine all the brighter who were surrounded by
   midnight darkness.


   "Pause where we may upon the desert-road,

   Some shelter is in sight, some sacred safe abode."

   On the other hand, the middle ages are often called, especially by
   Roman Catholic writers, "the ages of faith." They abound in legends of
   saints, which had the charm of religious novels. All men believed in
   the supernatural and miraculous as readily as children do now. Heaven
   and hell were as real to the mind as the kingdom of France and the,
   republic of Venice. Skepticism and infidelity were almost unknown, or
   at least suppressed and concealed. But with faith was connected a vast
   deal of superstition and an entire absence of critical investigation
   and judgment. Faith was blind and unreasoning, like the faith of
   children. The most incredible and absurd legends were accepted without
   a question. And yet the morality was not a whit better, but in many
   respects ruder, coarser and more passionate, than in modern times.

   The church as a visible organization never had greater power over the
   minds of men. She controlled all departments of life from the cradle to
   the grave. She monopolized all the learning and made sciences and arts
   tributary to her. She took the lead in every progressive movement. She
   founded universities, built lofty cathedrals, stirred up the crusades,
   made and unmade kings, dispensed blessings and curses to whole nations.
   The mediaeval hierarchy centering in Rome re-enacted the Jewish
   theocracy on a more comprehensive scale. It was a carnal anticipation
   of the millennial reign of Christ. It took centuries to rear up this
   imposing structure, and centuries to take it down again.

   The opposition came partly from the anti-Catholic sects, which, in
   spite of cruel persecution, never ceased to protest against the
   corruptions and tyranny of the papacy; partly from the spirit of
   nationality which arose in opposition to an all-absorbing hierarchical
   centralization; partly from the revival of classical and biblical
   learning, which undermined the reign of superstition and tradition; and
   partly from the inner and deeper life of the Catholic Church itself,
   which loudly called for a reformation, and struggled through the severe
   discipline of the law to the light and freedom of the gospel. The
   mediaeval Church was a schoolmaster to lead men to Christ. The
   Reformation was an emancipation of Western Christendom from the bondage
   of the law, and a re-conquest of that liberty "wherewith Christ hath
   made us free" (Gal. v. 1).

   § 5. Periods of the Middle Age.

   The Middle Age may be divided into three periods:

   1. The missionary period from Gregory I. to Hildebrand or Gregory VII.,
   a.d. 590-1073. The conversion of the northern barbarians. The dawn of a
   new civilization. The origin and progress of Islam. The separation of
   the West from the East. Some subdivide this period by Charlemagne
   (800), the founder of the German-Roman Empire.

   2. The palmy period of the papal theocracy from Gregory VII. to
   Boniface VIII., a.d. 1073-1294. The height of the papacy, monasticism
   and scholasticism. The Crusades. The conflict between the Pope and the
   Emperor. If we go back to the rise of Hildebrand, this period begins in
   1049.

   3. The decline of mediaeval Catholicism and preparation for modern
   Christianity, from Boniface VIII. to the Reformation, a.d. 1294-1517.
   The papal exile and schism; the reformatory councils; the decay of
   scholasticism; the growth of mysticism; the revival of letters, and the
   art of printing; the discovery of America; forerunners of
   Protestantism; the dawn of the Reformation.

   These three periods are related to each other as the wild youth, the
   ripe manhood, and the declining old age. But the gradual dissolution of
   mediaevalism was only the preparation for a new life, a destruction
   looking to a reconstruction.

   The three periods may be treated separately, or as a continuous whole.
   Both methods have their advantages: the first for a minute study; the
   second for a connected survey of the great movements.

   According to our division laid down in the introduction to the first
   volume, the three periods of the middle ages are the fourth, fifth and
   sixth periods of the general history of Christianity.

   FOURTH PERIOD

   THE CHURCH AMONG THE BARBARIANS

   CONVERSION OF THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN BARBARIANS

   § 6. Character of Mediaeval Missions.

   The conversion of the new and savage races which enter the theatre of
   history at the threshold of the middle ages, was the great work of the
   Christian church from the sixth to the tenth century. Already in the
   second or third century, Christianity was carried to the Gauls, the
   Britons and the Germans on the borders of the Rhine. But these were
   sporadic efforts with transient results. The work did not begin in
   earnest till the sixth century, and then it went vigorously forward to
   the tenth and twelfth, though with many checks and temporary relapses
   caused by civil wars and foreign invasions.

   The Christianization of the Kelts, Teutons, and Slavonians was at the
   same time a process of civilization, and differed in this respect
   entirely from the conversion of the Jews, Greeks, and Romans in the
   preceding age. Christian missionaries laid the foundation for the
   alphabet, literature, agriculture, laws, and arts of the nations of
   Northern and Western Europe, as they now do among the heathen nations
   in Asia and Africa. "The science of language," says a competent judge,
   [7] "owes more than its first impulse to Christianity. The pioneers of
   our science were those very apostles who were commanded to go into all
   the world and preach the gospel to every creature; and their true
   successors, the missionaries of the whole Christian church." The same
   may be said of every branch of knowledge and art of peace. The
   missionaries, in aiming at piety and the salvation of souls,
   incidentally promoted mental culture and temporal prosperity. The
   feeling of brotherhood inspired by Christianity broke down the
   partition walls between race and race, and created a brotherhood of
   nations.

   The mediaeval Christianization was a wholesale conversion, or a
   conversion of nations under the command of their leaders. It was
   carried on not only by missionaries and by spiritual means, but also by
   political influence, alliances of heathen princes with Christian wives,
   and in some cases (as the baptism of the Saxons under Charlemagne) by
   military force. It was a conversion not to the primary Christianity of
   inspired apostles, as laid down in the New Testament, but to the
   secondary Christianity of ecclesiastical tradition, as taught by the
   fathers, monks and popes. It was a baptism by water, rather than by
   fire and the Holy Spirit. The preceding instruction amounted to little
   or nothing; even the baptismal formula, mechanically recited in Latin,
   was scarcely understood. The rude barbarians, owing to the weakness of
   their heathen religion, readily submitted to the new religion; but some
   tribes yielded only to the sword of the conqueror.

   This superficial, wholesale conversion to a nominal Christianity must
   be regarded in the light of a national infant-baptism. It furnished the
   basis for a long process of Christian education. The barbarians were
   children in knowledge, and had to be treated like children.
   Christianity, assumed the form of a new law leading them, as a
   schoolmaster, to the manhood of Christ.

   The missionaries of the middle ages were nearly all monks. They were
   generally men of limited education and narrow views, but devoted zeal
   and heroic self-denial. Accustomed to primitive simplicity of life,
   detached from all earthly ties, trained to all sorts of privations,
   ready for any amount of labor, and commanding attention and veneration
   by their unusual habits, their celibacy, fastings and constant
   devotions, they were upon the whole the best pioneers of Christianity
   and civilization among the savage races of Northern and Western Europe.
   The lives of these missionaries are surrounded by their biographers
   with such a halo of legends and miracles, that it is almost impossible
   to sift fact from fiction. Many of these miracles no doubt were
   products of fancy or fraud; but it would be rash to deny them all.

   The same reason which made miracles necessary in the first introduction
   of Christianity, may have demanded them among barbarians before they
   were capable of appreciating the higher moral evidences.

   § 8. The Britons.

   Literature: The works of Bede, Gildas, Nennius, Ussher, Bright, Pryce,
   quoted in § 7.

   Britain made its first appearance in secular history half a century
   before the Christian era, when Julius Caesar, the conqueror of Gaul,
   sailed with a Roman army from Calais across the channel, and added the
   British island to the dominion of the eternal city, though it was not
   fully subdued till the reign of Claudius (a.d. 41-54). It figures in
   ecclesiastical history from the conversion of the Britons in the second
   century. Its missionary history is divided into two periods, the Keltic
   and the Anglo-Saxon, both catholic in doctrine, as far as developed at
   that time, slightly differing in discipline, yet bitterly hostile under
   the influence of the antagonism of race, which was ultimately overcome
   in England and Scotland but is still burning in Ireland, the proper
   home of the Kelts. The Norman conquest made both races better Romanists
   than they were before.

   The oldest inhabitants of Britain, like the Irish, the Scots, and the
   Gauls, were of Keltic origin, half naked and painted barbarians,
   quarrelsome, rapacious, revengeful, torn by intestine factions, which
   facilitated their conquest. They had adopted, under different
   appellations, the gods of the Greeks and Romans, and worshipped a
   multitude of local deities, the genii of the woods, rivers, and
   mountains; they paid special homage to the oak, the king of the forest.
   They offered the fruits of the earth, the spoils of the enemy, and, in
   the hour of danger, human lives. Their priests, called druids, [8]
   dwelt in huts or caverns, amid the silence and gloom of the forest,
   were in possession of all education and spiritual power, professed to
   know the secrets of nature, medicine and astrology, and practised the
   arts of divination. They taught, as the three principles of wisdom:
   "obedience to the laws of God, concern for the good of man, and
   fortitude under the accidents of life." They also taught the
   immortality of the soul and the fiction of metempsychosis. One class of
   the druids, who delivered their instructions in verse, were
   distinguished by the title of bards, who as poets and musicians
   accompanied the chieftain to the battle-field, and enlivened the feasts
   of peace by the sound of the harp. There are still remains of druidical
   temples--the most remarkable at Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and at
   Stennis in the Orkney Islands--that is, circles of huge stones standing
   in some cases twenty feet above the earth, and near them large mounds
   supposed to be ancient burial-places; for men desire to be buried near
   a place of worship.

   The first introduction of Christianity into Britain is involved in
   obscurity. The legendary history ascribes it at least to ten different
   agencies, namely, 1) Bran, a British prince, and his son Caradog, who
   is said to have become acquainted with St. Paul in Rome, a.d. 51 to 58,
   and to have introduced the gospel into his native country on his
   return. 2) St. Paul. 3) St. Peter. 4) St. Simon Zelotes. 5) St. Philip.
   6) St. James the Great. 7) St. John. 8) Aristobulus (Rom. xvi. 10). 9)
   Joseph of Arimathaea, who figures largely in the post-Norman legends of
   Glastonbury Abbey, and is said to have brought the holy Graal--the
   vessel or platter of the Lord's Supper--containing the blood of Christ,
   to England. 10) Missionaries of Pope Eleutherus from Rome to King
   Lucius of Britain. [9]

   But these legends cannot be traced beyond the sixth century, and are
   therefore destitute of all historic value. A visit of St. Paul to
   Britain between a.d. 63 and 67 is indeed in itself not impossible (on
   the assumption of a second Roman captivity), and has been advocated
   even by such scholars as Ussher and Stillingfleet, but is intrinsically
   improbable, and destitute of all evidence. [10]

   The conversion of King Lucius in the second century through
   correspondence with the Roman bishop Eleutherus (176 to 190), is
   related by Bede, in connection with several errors, and is a legend
   rather than an established fact. [11] Irenaeus of Lyons, who enumerates
   all the churches one by one, knows of none in Britain. Yet the
   connection of Britain with Rome and with Gaul must have brought it
   early into contact with Christianity. About a.d. 208 Tertullian
   exultingly declared "that places in Britain not yet visited by Romans
   were subject to Christ." [12] St. Alban, probably a Roman soldier, died
   as the British proto-martyr in the Diocletian persecution (303), and
   left the impress of his name on English history. [13] Constantine, the
   first Christian emperor, was born in Britain, and his mother, St.
   Helena, was probably a native of the country. In the Council of Arles,
   a.d. 314, which condemned the Donatists, we meet with three British
   bishops, Eborius of York (Eboracum), Restitutus of London (Londinum),
   and Adelfius of Lincoln (Colonia Londinensium), or Caerleon in Wales,
   besides a presbyter and deacon. [14] In the Arian controversy the
   British churches sided with Athanasius and the Nicene Creed, though
   hesitating about the term homoousios. [15] A notorious heretic,
   Pelagius (Morgan), was from the same island; his abler, though less
   influential associate, Celestius, was probably an Irishman; but their
   doctrines were condemned (429), and the Catholic faith reëstablished
   with the assistance of two Gallic bishops. [16]

   Monumental remains of the British church during the Roman period are
   recorded or still exist at Canterbury (St. Martin's), Caerleon, Bangor,
   Glastonbury, Dover, Richborough (Kent), Reculver, Lyminge, Brixworth,
   and other places. [17]

   The Roman dominion in Britain ceased about a.d. 410; the troops were
   withdrawn, and the country left to govern itself. The result was a
   partial relapse into barbarism and a demoralization of the church. The
   intercourse with the Continent was cut off, and the barbarians of the
   North pressed heavily upon the Britons. For a century and a half we
   hear nothing of the British churches till the silence is broken by the
   querulous voice of Gildas, who informs us of the degeneracy of the
   clergy, the decay of religion, the introduction and suppression of the
   Pelagian heresy, and the mission of Palladius to the Scots in Ireland.
   This long isolation accounts in part for the trifling differences and
   the bitter antagonism between the remnant of the old British church and
   the new church imported from Rome among the hated Anglo-Saxons.

   The difference was not doctrinal, but ritualistic and disciplinary. The
   British as well as the Irish and Scotch Christians of the sixth and
   seventh centuries kept Easter on the very day of the full moon in March
   when it was Sunday, or on the next Sunday following. They adhered to
   the older cycle of eighty-four years in opposition to the later
   Dionysian cycle of ninety-five years, which came into use on the
   Continent since the middle of the sixth century. [18] They shaved the
   fore-part of their head from ear to ear in the form of a crescent,
   allowing the hair to grow behind, in imitation of the aureola, instead
   of shaving, like the Romans, the crown of the head in a circular form,
   and leaving a circle of hair, which was to represent the Saviour's
   crown of thorns. They had, moreover--and this was the most important
   and most irritating difference--become practically independent of Rome,
   and transacted their business in councils without referring to the
   pope, who began to be regarded on the Continent as the righteous ruler
   and judge of all Christendom.

   From these facts some historians have inferred the Eastern or Greek
   origin of the old British church. But there is no evidence whatever of
   any such connection, unless it be perhaps through the medium of the
   neighboring church of Gaul, which was partly planted or moulded by
   Irenaeus of Lyons, a pupil of St. Polycarp of Smyrna, and which always
   maintained a sort of independence of Rome.

   But in the points of dispute just mentioned, the Gallican church at
   that time agreed with Rome. Consequently, the peculiarities of the
   British Christians must be traced to their insular isolation and long
   separation from Rome. The Western church on the Continent passed
   through some changes in the development of the authority of the papal
   see, and in the mode of calculating Easter, until the computation was
   finally fixed through Dionysius Exiguus in 525. The British,
   unacquainted with these changes, adhered to the older independence and
   to the older customs. They continued to keep Easter from the 14th of
   the moon to the 20th. This difference involved a difference in all the
   moveable festivals, and created great confusion in England after the
   conversion of the Saxons to the Roman rite.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] The word Druid or Druidh is not from the Greek drus, oak (as the
   elder Pliny thought), but a Keltic term draiod, meaning sage, priest,
   and is equivalent to the magi in the ancient East. In the Irish
   Scriptures draiod is used for magi, Matt. 2:1.

   [9] See Haddan & Stubbs, Counc. and Eccles. Doc. I. 22-26, and Pryce,
   31 sqq. Haddan says, that "statements respecting (a) British Christians
   at Rome, (b) British Christians in Britain, (c) Apostles or apostolic
   men preaching in Britain, in the first century--rest upon either guess,
   mistake or fable;" and that "evidence alleged for the existence of a
   Christian church in Britain during the second century is simply
   unhistorical." Pryce calls these early agencies "gratuitons
   assumptions, plausible guesses, or legendary fables." Eusebius, Dem.
   Ev. III. 5, speaks as if some of the Twelve or of the Seventy had
   "crossed the ocean to the isles called British;" but the passage is
   rhetorical and indefinite. In his Church History he omits Britain from
   the apostolic mission-field.

   [10] It is merely an inference from the well-known passage of Clement
   of Rome, Ep. ad Corinth. c. 5, that Paul carried the gospel "to the end
   of the West" (epitotermatesduseos). But this is far more naturally
   understood of a visit to Spain which Paul intended (Rom. xv. 28), and
   which seems confirmed by a passage in the Muratorian Fragment about 170
   ("Profectionem Pauli ab urbe ad Spaniam proficiscentis "); while there
   is no trace whatever of an intended or actual visit to Britain. Canon
   Bright calls this merely a "pious fancy" (p. 1), and Bishop Lightfoot
   remarks: "For the patriotic belief of some English writers, who have
   included Britain in the Apostle's travels, there is neither evidence
   nor probability" (St. Clement of Rome p. 50). It is barely possible
   however, that some Galatian converts of Paul, visiting the far West to
   barter the hair-cloths of their native land for the useful metal of
   Britain, may have first made known the gospel to the Britons in their
   kindred Keltic tongue. See Lightfoot, Com. on Gal., p. 246.

   [11] Book I., ch. 4: "Lucius, king of the Britons, sent a letter to
   Eleutherus, entreating that by his command he might be made a
   Christian. He soon obtained his pious request, and the Britons
   preserved the faith, which they had received, uncorrupted and entire,
   in peace and tranquillity, until the time of the Emperor Diocletian."
   Comp. the footnote of Giles in loc. Haddan says (I. 25): "The story of
   Lucius rests solely upon the later form of the Catalogus Pontificum
   Romanorum which was written c. a. d.530, and which adds to the Vita
   Eleutherus (a. d.171-186) that 'Hic (Eleutherus)accepit epistolam a
   Lucio Britanniae Rege, ut Chrristianus efficeretur par ejus mandatum.'
   But these words are not in the original Catalogus, written shortly
   after a. d.353." Beda copies the Roman account. Gildas knows nothing of
   Lucius. According to other accounts, Lucius ((Lever Maur, or the Great
   Light) sent Pagan and Dervan to Rome, who were ordained by Evaristus or
   Eleutherus, and on their return established the British church. See
   Lingard, History of England, I. 46.

   [12] Adv. Judaeos 7: "Britannorum inaccessa Romanis loca, Christo vero
   subdita." Bishop Kaye (Tertull., p. 94) understands this passage as
   referring to the farthest extremities of Britain. So Burton (II. 207):
   "Parts of the island which had not been visited by the Romans." See
   Bright, p. 5.

   the sixth century. Milman and Bright (p. 6) admit his historic reality.

   opponents as heretical Quartodecimans (Bede III. 4); but the Eastern
   Quartodecimans invariably celebrated Easter on the fourteenth day of
   the month (hence their designation), whether it fell on a Sunday or
   not; while the Britons and Irish celebrated it always on a Sunday

   § 9. The Anglo-Saxons.

   Literature.

   I. The sources for the planting of Roman Christianity among the
   Anglo-Saxons are several Letters of Pope Gregory I. (Epp., Lib. VI. 7,
   51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59; IX. 11, 108; XI. 28, 29, 64, 65, 66,
   76; in Migne's ed. of Gregory's Opera, Vol. III.; also in Haddan and
   Stubbs, III. 5 sqq.); the first and second books of Bede's Eccles.
   Hist.; Goscelin's Life of St. Augustin, written in the 11th century,
   and contained in the Acta Sanctorum of May 26th; and Thorne's
   Chronicles of St. Augustine's Abbey. See also Haddan and Stubbs,
   Councils, etc., the 3d vol., which comes down to a.d. 840.

   II. Of modern lives of St. Augustin, we mention Montalembert, Monks of
   the West, Vol. III.; Dean Hook, Archbishops of Canterbury, Vol. I., and
   Dean Stanley, Memorials of Canterbury, 1st ed., 1855, 9th ed. 1880.
   Comp. Lit. in Sec. 7.

   British Christianity was always a feeble plant, and suffered greatly,
   from the Anglo-Saxon conquest and the devastating wars which followed
   it. With the decline of the Roman power, the Britons, weakened by the
   vices of Roman civilization, and unable to resist the aggressions of
   the wild Picts and Scots from the North, called Hengist and Horsa, two
   brother-princes and reputed descendants of Wodan, the god of war, from
   Germany to their aid, a.d. 449. [19]

   From this time begins the emigration of Saxons, Angles or Anglians,
   Jutes, and Frisians to Britain. They gave to it a new nationality and a
   new language, the Anglo-Saxon, which forms the base and trunk of the
   present people and language of England (Angle-land). They belonged to
   the great Teutonic race, and came from the Western and Northern parts
   of Germany, from the districts North of the Elbe, the Weser, and the
   Eyder, especially from Holstein, Schleswig, and Jutland. They could
   never be subdued by the Romans, and the emperor Julian pronounced them
   the most formidable of all the nations that dwelt beyond the Rhine on
   the shores of the Western ocean. They were tall and handsome, with blue
   eyes and fair skin, strong and enduring, given to pillage by land, and
   piracy by sea, leaving the cultivation of the soil, with the care of
   their flocks, to women and slaves. They were the fiercest among the
   Germans. They sacrificed a tenth of their chief captives on the altars
   of their gods. They used the spear, the sword, and the battle-axe with
   terrible effect. "We have not," says Sidonius, bishop of Clermont, [20]
   "a more cruel and more dangerous enemy than the Saxons. They overcome
   all who have the courage to oppose them .... When they pursue, they
   infallibly overtake; when they are pursued, their escape is certain.
   They despise danger; they are inured to shipwreck; they are eager to
   purchase booty with the peril of their lives. Tempests, which to others
   are so dreadful, to them are subjects of joy. The storm is their
   protection when they are pressed by the enemy, and a cover for their
   operations when they meditate an attack." Like the Bedouins in the
   East, and the Indians of America, they were divided in tribes, each
   with a chieftain. In times of danger, they selected a supreme commander
   under the name of Konyng or King, but only for a period.

   These strangers from the Continent successfully repelled the Northern
   invaders; but being well pleased with the fertility and climate of the
   country, and reinforced by frequent accessions from their countrymen,
   they turned upon the confederate Britons, drove them to the mountains
   of Wales and the borders of Scotland, or reduced them to slavery, and
   within a century and a half they made themselves masters of England.
   From invaders they became settlers, and established an octarchy or
   eight independent kingdoms, Kent, Sussex, Wessex, Essex, Northumbria,
   Mercia, Bernicia, and Deira. The last two were often united under the
   same head; hence we generally speak of but seven kingdoms or the
   Anglo-Saxon heptarchy.

   From this period of the conflict between the two races dates the Keltic
   form of the Arthurian legends, which afterwards underwent a radical
   telescopic transformation in France. They have no historical value
   except in connection with the romantic poetry of mediaeval religion.
   [21]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] The chronology, is somewhat uncertain. See Lappenberg's Geschichte
   von England, Bd. I., p. 73 sqq.

   [20] Quoted by Lingard, I. 62. The picture here given corresponds
   closely with that given in Beowulf's Drapa, from the 9th century.

   [21] King Arthur (or Artus), the hero of Wales, of the Chronicles of
   Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the romances of the Round Table, if not
   entirely mythical, was one of the last Keltic chiefs, who struggled
   against the Saxon invaders in the sixth century. He resided in great
   state at Caerleon in Wales, surrounded by valorous knights, seated with
   him at a round table, gained twelve victories over the Saxons, and died
   in the battle of Mount Badon or Badon Hill near Bath (a. d.520). The
   legend was afterwards Christianized, transferred to French soil, and
   blended with the Carlovingian Knights of the Round Table, which never
   existed. Arthur's name was also connected since the Crusades with the
   quest of the Holy Grail or Graal (Keltic gréal, old French san gréalor
   greel), i.e. the wonderful bowl-shaped vessel of the Lord's Supper
   (used for the Paschal Lamb, or, according to another view, for the cup
   of blessing), in which Joseph of Arimathaea caught the blood of the
   Saviour at the cross, and which appears in the Arthurian romances as
   the token of the visible presence of Christ, or the symbolic embodiment
   of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Hence the derivation of Grail
   from sanguis realis, real blood, or sang royal, the Lord's blood.
   Others derive it from the Romanic greal, cup or dish; still others from
   the Latin graduale. See Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chronicon sive Historia
   Britonum (1130 and 1147, translated into English by Aaron Thomson,
   London, 1718); Sir T. Malory, History of Prince Arthur (1480-1485, new

   § 10. The Mission of Gregory and Augustin. Conversion of Kent, a.d.
   595-604.

   With the conquest of the Anglo-Saxons, who were heathen barbarians,
   Christianity was nearly extirpated in Britain. Priests were cruelly
   massacred, churches and monasteries were destroyed, together with the
   vestiges of a weak Roman civilization. The hatred and weakness of the
   Britons prevented them from offering the gospel to the conquerors, who
   in turn would have rejected it from contempt of the conquered. [22]

   But fortunately Christianity was re-introduced from a remote country,
   and by persons who had nothing to do with the quarrels of the two
   races. To Rome, aided by the influence of France, belongs the credit of
   reclaiming England to Christianity and civilization. In England the
   first, and, we may say, the only purely national church in the West was
   founded, but in close union with the papacy. "The English church," says
   Freeman, "reverencing Rome, but not slavishly bowing down to her, grew
   up with a distinctly national character, and gradually infused its
   influence into all the feelings and habits of the English people. By
   the end of the seventh century, the independent, insular, Teutonic
   church had become one of the brightest lights of the Christian
   firmament. In short, the introduction of Christianity completely
   changed the position of the English nation, both within its own island
   and towards the rest of the world." [23]

   The origin of the Anglo-Saxon mission reads like a beautiful romance.
   Pope Gregory I., when abbot of a Benedictine convent, saw in the
   slave-market of Rome three Anglo-Saxon boys offered for sale. He was
   impressed with their fine appearance, fair complexion, sweet faces and
   light flaxen hair; and learning, to his grief, that they were
   idolaters, he asked the name of their nation, their country, and their
   king. When he heard that they were Angles, he said: "Right, for they
   have angelic faces, and are worthy to be fellow-heirs with angels in
   heaven." They were from the province Deira. "Truly," he replied, "are
   they De-ira-ns, that is, plucked from the ire of God, and called to the
   mercy of Christ." He asked the name of their king, which was AElla or
   Ella (who reigned from 559 to 588). "Hallelujah," he exclaimed, "the
   praise of God the Creator must be sung in those parts." He proceeded at
   once from the slave market to the pope, and entreated him to send
   missionaries to England, offering himself for this noble work. He
   actually started for the spiritual conquest of the distant island. But
   the Romans would not part with him, called him back, and shortly
   afterwards elected him pope (590). What he could not do in person, he
   carried out through others. [24]

   In the year 596, Gregory, remembering his interview with the
   sweet-faced and fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slave-boys, and hearing of a
   favorable opportunity for a mission, sent the Benedictine abbot
   Augustin (Austin), thirty other monks, and a priest, Laurentius, with
   instructions, letters of recommendation to the Frank kings and several
   bishops of Gaul, and a few books, to England. [25] The missionaries,
   accompanied by some interpreters from France, landed on the isle of
   Thanet in Kent, near the mouth of the Thames. [26] King Ethelbert, by
   his marriage to Bertha, a Christian princess from Paris, who had
   brought a bishop with her, was already prepared for a change of
   religion. He went to meet the strangers and received them in the open
   air; being afraid of some magic if he were to see them under roof. They
   bore a silver cross for their banner, and the image of Christ painted
   on a board; and after singing the litany and offering prayers for
   themselves and the people whom they had come to convert, they preached
   the gospel through their Frank interpreters. The king was pleased with
   the ritualistic and oratorical display of the new religion from
   distant, mighty Rome, and said: "Your words and promises are very fair;
   but as they are new to us and of uncertain import, I cannot forsake the
   religion I have so long followed with the whole English nation. Yet as
   you are come from far, and are desirous to benefit us, I will supply
   you with the necessary sustenance, and not forbid you to preach and to
   convert as many as you can to your religion." [27] Accordingly, he
   allowed them to reside in the City of Canterbury (Dorovern,
   Durovernum), which was the metropolis of his kingdom, and was soon to
   become the metropolis of the Church of England. They preached and led a
   severe monastic life. Several believed and were baptized, "admiring,"
   as Bede says, "the simplicity of their innocent life, and the sweetness
   of their heavenly doctrine." He also mentions miracles. Gregory warned
   Augustin not to be puffed up by miracles, but to rejoice with fear, and
   to tremble in rejoicing, remembering what the Lord said to his
   disciples when they boasted that even the devils were subject to them.
   For not all the elect work miracles, and yet the names of all are
   written in heaven. [28]

   King Ethelbert was converted and baptized (probably June 2, 597), and
   drew gradually his whole nation after him, though he was taught by the
   missionaries not to use compulsion, since the service of Christ ought
   to be voluntary.

   Augustin, by order of pope Gregory, was ordained archbishop of the
   English nation by Vergilius, [29] archbishop of Arles, Nov. 16, 597,
   and became the first primate of England, with a long line of successors
   even to this day. On his return, at Christmas, he baptized more than
   ten thousand English. His talents and character did not rise above
   mediocrity, and he bears no comparison whatever with his great
   namesake, the theologian and bishop of Hippo; but he was, upon the
   whole, well fitted for his missionary work, and his permanent success
   lends to his name the halo of a borrowed greatness. He built a church
   and monastery at Canterbury, the mother-church of Anglo-Saxon
   Christendom. He sent the priest Laurentius to Rome to inform the pope
   of his progress and to ask an answer to a number of questions
   concerning the conduct of bishops towards their clergy, the ritualistic
   differences between the Roman and the Gallican churches, the marriage
   of two brothers to two sisters, the marriage of relations, whether a
   bishop may be ordained without other bishops being present, whether a
   woman with child ought to be baptized, how long after the birth of an
   infant carnal intercourse of married people should be delayed, etc.
   Gregory answered these questions very fully in the legalistic and
   ascetic spirit of the age, yet, upon the whole, with much good sense
   and pastoral wisdom. [30]

   It is remarkable that this pope, unlike his successors, did not insist
   on absolute conformity to the Roman church, but advises Augustin, who
   thought that the different customs of the Gallican church were
   inconsistent with the unity of faith, "to choose from every church
   those things that are pious, religious and upright;" for "things are
   not to be loved for the sake of places, but places for the sake of good
   things." [31] In other respects, the advice falls in with the papal
   system and practice. He directs the missionaries not to destroy the
   heathen temples, but to convert them into Christian churches, to
   substitute the worship of relics for the worship of idols, and to allow
   the new converts, on the day of dedication and other festivities, to
   kill cattle according to their ancient custom, yet no more to the
   devils, but to the praise of God; for it is impossible, he thought, to
   efface everything at once from their obdurate minds; and he who
   endeavors to ascend to the highest place, must rise by degrees or
   steps, and not by leaps. [32] This method was faithfully followed by
   his missionaries. It no doubt facilitated the nominal conversion of
   England, but swept a vast amount of heathenism into the Christian
   church, which it took centuries to eradicate.

   Gregory sent to Augustin, June 22, 601, the metropolitan pall
   (pallium), several priests (Mellitus, Justus, Paulinus, and others),
   many books, sacred vessels and vestments, and relics of apostles and
   martyrs. He directed him to ordain twelve bishops in the archiepiscopal
   diocese of Canterbury, and to appoint an archbishop for York, who was
   also to ordain twelve bishops, if the country adjoining should receive
   the word of God. Mellitus was consecrated the first bishop of London;
   Justus, bishop of Rochester, both in 604 by Augustin (without
   assistants); Paulinus, the first archbishop of York, 625, after the
   death of Gregory and Augustin. [33] The pope sent also letters and
   presents to king Ethelbert, "his most excellent son," exhorting him to
   persevere in the faith, to commend it by good works among his subjects,
   to suppress the worship of idols, and to follow the instructions of
   Augustin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22] Bede (I. 22) counts it among the most wicked acts or neglects
   rather, of the Britons mentioned even by their own historian Gildas,
   that they, never preached the faith to the Saxons who dwelt among them.

   [23] History of the Norman conquest of England, Vol. I., p. 22 (Oxford
   ed. of 1873).

   [24] Beda (B. II., ch.1 at the close) received this account "from the
   ancients" (ab antiquis, or traditione majorum), but gives it as an
   episode, not as a part of the English mission (which is related I. 53).
   The elaborate play on words excites critical suspicion of the truth of
   the story, which, though well told, is probably invented or
   embellished, like so many legends about Gregory, ."Se non vero, e ben
   trovato."

   [25] Among these books were a Bible in 2 vols., a Psalter, a book of
   the Gospels, a Martyrology, Apocryphal Lives of the Apostles, and some
   Commentaries. "These are the foundation or beginning of the library of
   the whole English church."

   [26] The first journey of Augustin, in 595, was a failure. He started
   finally for England July 23d, 596, wintered in Gaul, and landed in
   England the following year with about forty persons, including Gallic
   priests and interpreters. Haddan and Stubbs, III. 4.

   [27] Bede I. 25.

   [28] "Non enim omnes electi miracula faciunt, sed tamen eorum omnium
   nomina in caelo sunt ascripta."Greg., Ad Augustinum Anglorum Episcopum,
   Epp. Lib. XI. 28, and Bede I. 31.

   [29] Not AEtherius, as Bede has it, I. 27, and in other places.
   AEtherius was the contemporary archbishop of Lyons.

   [30] Bede I. 27 sqq. gives extracts from Gregory's answers. It is
   curious how the pope handles such delicate subjects as the monthly
   courses and the carnal intercourse between married people. A husband,
   he says, should not approach his wife after the birth of an infant,
   till the infant be weaned. Mothers should not give their children to
   other women to suckle. A man who has approached his wife is not to
   enter the church unless washed with water and till after sunset. We see
   here the genius of Romanism which aims to control by its legislation
   all the ramifications of human life, and to shackle the conscience by a
   subtle and minute casuistry. Barbarians, however, must be treated like
   children.

   [31] "Non enim pro locis res, sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt. Ex
   singulis ergo quibusdam ecclesiis, quae pia, quae religiosa, quae recta
   sunt, elige, et haec quasi in fasciculum collecta apud Anglorum mentes
   in consuetudinem depone." Gr. Respons. ad interrogat. Aug., Ep. XI. 64,
   and Bede I. 27.

   [32] "Is qui locum summum ascendere nititur, gradibus wel passibus,
   saltibus elevatur." Ep. lib. XI. 76 (and Bede I. 30). This epistle of
   the year 601 is addressed to Mellitus on his way to England, but is
   intended for Augustin ad faciliorem Anglorum conversionem. In Sardinia,
   where Christianity already prevailed, Gregory advised Bishop Januarius
   to suppress the remaining heathenism by imprisonment and corporal
   punishment.

   [33] York and London had been the first metropolitan sees among the
   Britons. London was even then, as Bede (II. 3) remarks, a mart of many
   nations resorting to it by sea and land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 11. Antagonism of the Saxon and British Clergy.

   Bede, II. 2; Haddan and Stubbs, III. 38-41.

   Augustin, with the aid of king Ethelbert, arranged (in 602 or 603) a
   conference with the British bishops, at a place in Sussex near the
   banks of the Severn under an oak, called "Augustin's Oak." [34] He
   admonished them to conform to the Roman ceremonial in the observance of
   Easter Sunday, and the mode of administering baptism, and to unite with
   their Saxon brethren in converting the Gentiles. Augustin had neither
   wisdom nor charity enough to sacrifice even the most trifling
   ceremonies on the altar of peace. He was a pedantic and contracted
   churchman. He met the Britons, who represented at all events an older
   and native Christianity, with the haughty spirit of Rome, which is
   willing to compromise with heathen customs, but demands absolute
   submission from all other forms of Christianity, and hates independence
   as the worst of heresies.

   The Britons preferred their own traditions. After much useless
   contention, Augustin proposed, and the Britons reluctantly accepted, an
   appeal to the miraculous interposition of God. A blind man of the Saxon
   race was brought forward and restored to sight by his prayer. The
   Britons still refused to give up their ancient customs without the
   consent of their people, and demanded a second and larger synod.

   At the second Conference, seven bishops of the Britons, with a number
   of learned men from the Convent of Bangor, appeared, and were advised
   by a venerated hermit to submit the Saxon archbishop to the moral test
   of meekness and humility as required by Christ from his followers. If
   Augustin, at the meeting, shall rise before them, they should hear him
   submissively; but if he shall not rise, they should despise him as a
   proud man. As they drew near, the Roman dignitary remained seated in
   his chair. He demanded of them three things, viz. compliance with the
   Roman observance of the time of Easter, the Roman form of baptism, and
   aid in efforts to convert the English nation; and then he would readily
   tolerate their other peculiarities. They refused, reasoning among
   themselves, if he will not rise up before us now, how much more will he
   despise us when we shall be subject to his authority? Augustin
   indignantly rebuked them and threatened the divine vengeance by the
   arms of the Saxons. "All which," adds Bede, "through the dispensation
   of the divine judgment, fell out exactly as he had predicted." For, a
   few years afterwards (613), Ethelfrith the Wild, the pagan King of
   Northumbria, attacked the Britons at Chester, and destroyed not only
   their army, but slaughtered several hundred [35] priests and monks, who
   accompanied the soldiers to aid them with their prayers. The massacre
   was followed by the destruction of the flourishing monastery of Bangor,
   where more than two thousand monks lived by the labor of their hands.

   This is a sad picture of the fierce animosity of the two races and
   rival forms of Christianity. Unhappily, it continues to the present
   day, but with a remarkable difference: the Keltic Irish who, like the
   Britons, once represented a more independent type of Catholicism, have,
   since the Norman conquest, and still more since the Reformation, become
   intense Romanists; while the English, once the dutiful subjects of
   Rome, have broken with that foreign power altogether, and have vainly
   endeavored to force Protestantism upon the conquered race. The Irish
   problem will not be solved until the double curse of national and
   religious antagonism is removed.

   Haddan and Stubbs, III. 40 and 41.

   [35] Bede mentions twelve hundred, but the Saxon chronicle (a. d.607)
   only two hundred.

   § 12. Conversion of the Other Kingdoms of the Heptarchy.

   Augustin, the apostle of the Anglo-Saxons, died a.d. 604, and lies
   buried, with many of his successors, in the venerable cathedral of
   Canterbury. On his tomb was written this epitaph: "Here rests the Lord
   Augustin, first archbishop of Canterbury, who being formerly sent
   hither by the blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome, and by God's
   assistance supported with miracles, reduced king Ethelbert and his
   nation from the worship of idols to the faith of Christ, and having
   ended the days of his office in peace, died on the 26th day of May, in
   the reign of the same king." [36]

   He was not a great man; but he did a great work in laying the
   foundations of English Christianity and civilization.

   Laurentius (604-619), and afterwards Mellitus (619-624) succeeded him
   in his office.

   Other priests and monks were sent from Italy, and brought with them
   books and such culture as remained after the irruption of the
   barbarians. The first archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the
   bishops of most of the Southern sees were foreigners, if not
   consecrated, at least commissioned by the pope, and kept up a constant
   correspondence with Rome. Gradually a native clergy arose in England.

   The work of Christianization went on among the other kingdom of the
   heptarchy, and was aided by the marriage of kings with Christian wives,
   but was more than once interrupted by relapse into heathenism.
   Northumbria was converted chiefly through the labors of the sainted
   Aidan (d. Aug. 31, 651), a monk from the island Iona or Hii, and the
   first bishop of Lindisfarne, who is even lauded by Bede for his zeal,
   piety and good works, although he differed from him on the Easter
   question. [37] Sussex was the last part of the Heptarchy which
   renounced paganism. It took nearly a hundred years before England was
   nominally converted to the Christian religion. [38]

   To this conversion England owes her national unity and the best
   elements of her civilization. [39]

   The Anglo-Saxon Christianity was and continued to be till the
   Reformation, the Christianity of Rome, with its excellences and faults.
   It included the Latin mass, the worship of saints, images and relics,
   monastic virtues and vices, pilgrimages to the holy city, and much
   credulity and superstition. Even kings abdicated their crown to show
   their profound reverence for the supreme pontiff and to secure from him
   a passport to heaven. Chapels, churches and cathedrals were erected in
   the towns; convents founded in the country by the bank of the river or
   under the shelter of a hill, and became rich by pious donations of
   land. The lofty cathedrals and ivy-clad ruins of old abbeys and
   cloisters in England and Scotland still remain to testify in solemn
   silence to the power of mediaeval Catholicism.

   [39] "The conversion of the heptarchic kingdom," says Professor Stubbs
   (Constitutional History of England, Vol. I., p. 217), "during the
   seventh century not only revealed to Europe and Christendom the
   existence of a new nation, but may be said to have rendered the new
   nation conscious of its unity in a way in which, under the influence of
   heathenism, community of language and custom had failed to do."

   § 13. Conformity to Row Established. Wilfrid, Theodore, Bede.

   The dispute between the Anglo-Saxon or Roman, and the British ritual
   was renewed in the middle of the seventh century, but ended with the
   triumph of the former in England proper. The spirit of independence had
   to take refuge in Ireland and Scotland till the time of the Norman
   conquest, which crushed it out also in Ireland.

   Wilfrid, afterwards bishop of York, the first distinguished native
   prelate who combined clerical habits with haughty magnificence,
   acquired celebrity by expelling "the quartodeciman heresy and schism,"
   as it was improperly called, from Northumbria, where the Scots had
   introduced it through St. Aidan. The controversy was decided in a Synod
   held at Whitby in 664 in the presence of King Oswy or Oswio and his son
   Alfrid. Colman, the second success or of Aidan, defended the Scottish
   observance of Easter by the authority of St. Columba and the apostle
   John. Wilfrid rested the Roman observance on the authority of Peter,
   who had introduced it in Rome, and on the universal custom of
   Christendom. When he mentioned, that to Peter were intrusted the keys
   of the kingdom of heaven, the king said: "I will not contradict the
   door-keeper, lest when I come to the gates of the kingdom of heaven,
   there should be none to open them." By this irresistible argument the
   opposition was broken, and conformity to the Roman observance
   established. The Scottish semi-circular tonsure also, which was
   ascribed to Simon Magus, gave way to the circular, which was derived
   from St. Peter. Colman, being worsted, returned with his sympathizers
   to Scotland, where he built two monasteries. Tuda was made bishop in
   his place. [40]

   Soon afterwards, a dreadful pestilence raged through England and
   Ireland, while Caledonia was saved, as the pious inhabitants believed,
   by the intercession of St. Columba.

   The fusion of English Christians was completed in the age of Theodorus,
   archbishop of Canterbury (669 to 690), and Beda Venerabilis ( b. 673,
   d. 735), presbyter and monk of Wearmouth. About the same time
   Anglo-Saxon literature was born, and laid the foundation for the
   development of the national genius which ultimately broke loose from
   Rome.

   Theodore was a native of Tarsus, where Paul was born, educated in
   Athens, and, of course, acquainted with Greek and Latin learning. He
   received his appointment and consecration to the primacy of England
   from Pope Vitalian. He arrived at Canterbury May 27, 669, visited the
   whole of England, established the Roman rule of Easter, and settled
   bishops in all the sees except London. He unjustly deposed bishop
   Wilfrid of York, who was equally devoted to Rome, but in his later
   years became involved in sacerdotal jealousies and strifes. He
   introduced order into the distracted church and some degree of
   education among the clergy. He was a man of autocratic temper, great
   executive ability, and, having been directly sent from Rome, he carried
   with him double authority. "He was the first archbishop," says Bede,
   "to whom the whole church of England submitted." During his
   administration the first Anglo-Saxon mission to the mother-country of
   the Saxons and Friesians was attempted by Egbert, Victberet, and
   Willibrord (689 to 692). His chief work is a "Penitential" with minute
   directions for a moral and religious life, and punishments for
   drunkenness, licentiousness, and other prevalent vices. [41]

   The Venerable Bede was the first native English scholar, the father of
   English theology and church history. He spent his humble and peaceful
   life in the acquisition and cultivation of ecclesiastical and secular
   learning, wrote Latin in prose and verse, and translated portions of
   the Bible into Anglo-Saxon. His chief work is his--the only
   reliable--Church History of old England. He guides us with a gentle
   hand and in truly Christian spirit, though colored by Roman views, from
   court to court, from monastery to monastery, and bishopric to
   bishopric, through the missionary labyrinth of the miniature kingdoms
   of his native island. He takes the Roman side in the controversies with
   the British churches. [42]

   Before Bede cultivated Saxon prose, Caedmon (about 680), first a
   swine-herd, then a monk at Whitby, sung, as by inspiration, the wonders
   of creation and redemption, and became the father of Saxon (and
   Christian German) poetry. His poetry brought the Bible history home to
   the imagination of the Saxon people, and was a faint prophecy of the
   "Divina Comedia" and the "Paradise Lost." [43] We have a remarkable
   parallel to this association of Bede and Caedmon in the association of
   Wiclif, the first translator of the whole Bible into English (1380),
   and the contemporary of Chaucer, the father of English poetry, both
   forerunners of the British Reformation, and sustaining a relation to
   Protestant England somewhat similar to the relation which Bede and
   Caedmon sustain to mediaeval Catholic England.

   The conversion of England was nominal and ritual, rather than
   intellectual and moral. Education was confined to the clergy and monks,
   and consisted in the knowledge of the Decalogue, the Creed and the
   Pater Noster, a little Latin without any Greek or Hebrew. The
   Anglo-Saxon clergy were only less ignorant than the British. The
   ultimate triumph of the Roman church was due chiefly to her superior
   organization, her direct apostolic descent, and the prestige of the
   Roman empire. It made the Christianity of England independent of
   politics and court-intrigues, and kept it in close contact with the
   Christianity of the Continent. The advantages of this connection were
   greater than the dangers and evils of insular isolation. Among all the
   subjects of Teutonic tribes, the English became the most devoted to the
   Pope. They sent more pilgrims to Rome and more money into the papal
   treasury than any other nation. They invented the Peter's Pence. At
   least thirty of their kings and queens, and an innumerable army of
   nobles ended their days in cloistral retreats. Nearly all of the public
   lands were deeded to churches and monasteries. But the exuberance of
   monasticism weakened the military and physical forces of the nation

   Danish and the Norman conquests. The power and riches of the church
   secularized the clergy, and necessitated in due time a reformation.
   Wealth always tends to vice, and vice to decay. The Norman conquest did
   not change the ecclesiastical relations of England, but infused new
   blood and vigor into the Saxon race, which is all the better for its
   mixed character.

   The church-history of Ireland is peculiar. It began with an independent
   catholicity (or a sort of semi-Protestantism), and ended with Romanism,
   while other Western countries passed through the reverse order. Lying
   outside of the bounds of the Roman empire, and never invaded by Roman
   legions, [45] that virgin island was Christianized without bloodshed
   and independently of Rome and of the canons of the oecumenical synods.
   The early Irish church differed from the Continental churches in minor
   points of polity and worship, and yet excelled them all during the
   sixth and seventh centuries in spiritual purity and missionary zeal.
   After the Norman conquest, it became closely allied to Rome. In the
   sixteenth century the light of the Reformation did not penetrate into
   the native population; but Queen Elizabeth and the Stuarts set up by
   force a Protestant state-religion in antagonism to the prevailing faith
   of the people. Hence, by the law of re-action, the Keltic portion of
   Ireland became more intensely Roman Catholic being filled with double
   hatred of England on the ground of difference of race and religion.
   This glaring anomaly of a Protestant state church in a Roman Catholic
   country has been removed at last after three centuries of oppression
   and misrule, by the Irish Church Disestablishment Act in 1869 under the
   ministry of Gladstone.

   The early history of Ireland (Hibernia) is buried in obscurity. The
   ancient Hibernians were a mixed race, but prevailingly Keltic. They
   were ruled by petty tyrants, proud, rapacious and warlike, who kept the
   country in perpetual strife. They were devoted to their religion of
   Druidism. Their island, even before the introduction of Christianity,
   was called the Sacred Island. It was also called Scotia or Scotland
   down to the eleventh century. [46] The Romans made no attempt at
   subjugation, as they did not succeed in establishing their authority in
   Caledonia.

   The first traces of Irish Christianity are found at the end of the
   fourth or the beginning of the fifth century.

   As Pelagius, the father of the famous heresy, which bears his name, was
   a Briton, so Coelestius, his chief ally and champion, was a Hibernian;
   but we do not know whether he was a Christian before be left Ireland.
   Mansuetus, first bishop of Toul, was an Irish Scot (a.d. 350). Pope
   Caelestine, in 431, ordained and sent Palladius, a Roman deacon, and
   probably a native Briton, "to the Scots believing in Christ," as their
   first bishop. [47] This notice by Prosper of France implies the
   previous existence of Christianity in Ireland. But Palladius was so
   discouraged that he soon abandoned the field, with his assistants for
   North Britain, where he died among the Picts. [48] For nearly two
   centuries after this date, we have no authentic record of papal
   intercourse with Ireland; and yet during that period it took its place
   among the Christian countries. It was converted by two humble
   individuals, who probably never saw Rome, St. Patrick, once a slave,
   and St. Bridget, the daughter of a slave-mother. [49] The Roman
   tradition that St. Patrick was sent by Pope Caelestine is too late to
   have any claim upon our acceptance, and is set aside by the entire
   silence of St. Patrick himself in his genuine works. It arose from
   confounding Patrick with Palladius. The Roman mission of Palladius
   failed; the independent mission of Patrick succeeded. He is the true
   Apostle of Ireland, and has impressed his memory in indelible
   characters upon the Irish race at home and abroad.

   St. Patrick or Patricius (died March 17, 465 or 493) was the son of a
   deacon, and grandson of a priest, as he confesses himself without an
   intimation of the unlawfulness of clerical marriages. [50] He was in
   his youth carried captive into Ireland, with many others, and served
   his master six years as a shepherd. While tending his flock in the
   lonesome fields, the teachings of his childhood awakened to new life in
   his heart without any particular external agency. He escaped to France
   or Britain, was again enslaved for a short period, and had a remarkable
   dream, which decided his calling. He saw a man, Victoricius, who handed
   him innumerable letters from Ireland, begging him to come over and help
   them. He obeyed the divine monition, and devoted the remainder of his
   life to the conversion of Ireland (from a.d. 440 to 493). [51]

   "I am," he says, "greatly a debtor to God, who has bestowed his grace
   so largely upon me, that multitudes were born again to God through me.
   The Irish, who never had the knowledge of God and worshipped only idols
   and unclean things, have lately become the people of the Lord, and are
   called sons of God." He speaks of having baptized many thousands of
   men. Armagh seems to have been for some time the centre of his
   missionary operations, and is to this day the seat of the primacy of
   Ireland, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. He died in peace, and was
   buried in Downpatrick (or Gabhul), where he began his mission, gained
   his first converts and spent his declining years. [52]

   His Roman Catholic biographers have surrounded his life with marvelous
   achievements, while some modern Protestant hypercritics have questioned
   even his existence, as there is no certain mention of his name before
   634; unless it be "the Hymn of St. Sechnall (Secundinus) in praise of
   St. Patrick, which is assigned to 448. But if we accept his own
   writings, "there can be no reasonable doubt" (we say with a
   Presbyterian historian of Ireland) "that he preached the gospel in
   Hibernia in the fifth century; that he was a most zealous and efficient
   evangelist, and that he is eminently entitled to the honorable
   designation of the Apostle of Ireland." [53]

   The Christianity of Patrick was substantially that of Gaul and old
   Britain, i.e. Catholic, orthodox, monastic, ascetic, but independent of
   the Pope, and differing from Rome in the age of Gregory I. in minor
   matters of polity and ritual. In his Confession he never mentions Rome
   or the Pope; he never appeals to tradition, and seems to recognize the
   Scriptures (including the Apocrypha) as the only authority in matters
   of faith. He quotes from the canonical Scriptures twenty-five times;
   three times from the Apocrypha. It has been conjectured that the
   failure and withdrawal of Palladius was due to Patrick, who had already
   monopolized this mission-field; but, according to the more probable
   chronology, the mission of Patrick began about nine years after that of
   Palladius. From the end of the seventh century, the two persons were
   confounded, and a part of the history of Palladius, especially his
   connection with Pope Caelestine, was transferred to Patrick. [54]

   With St. Patrick there is inseparably connected the most renowned
   female saint of Ireland, St. Bridget (or Brigid, Brigida, Bride), who
   prepared his winding sheet and survived him many years. She died Feb.
   1, 523 (or 525). She is "the Mary of Ireland," and gave her name to
   innumerable Irish daughters, churches, and convents. She is not to be
   confounded with her name-sake, the widow-saint of Sweden. Her life is
   surrounded even by a still thicker cloud of legendary fiction than that
   of St. Patrick, so that it is impossible to separate the facts from the
   accretions of a credulous posterity. She was an illegitimate child of a
   chieftain or bard, and a slave-mother, received holy orders, became
   deformed in answer to her own prayer, founded the famous nunnery of
   Kildare (i.e. the Church of the Oak), [55] foretold the birth of
   Columba, and performed all sorts of signs and wonders.

   Upon her tomb in Kildare arose the inextinguishable flame called "the
   Light of St. Bridget," which her nuns (like the Vestal Virgins of Rome)
   kept


   "Through long ages of darkness and storm" (Moore).

   Six lives of her were published by Colgan in his Trias Thaumaturgus,
   and five by the Bollandists in the Acta Sanctorum.

   Critical Note on St. Patrick.

   We have only one or two genuine documents from Patrick, both written in
   semi-barbarous (early Irish) Latin, but breathing an humble, devout and
   fervent missionary spirit without anything specifically Roman, viz. his
   autobiographical Confession (in 25 chapters), written shortly before
   his death (493?), and his Letter of remonstrance to Coroticus (or
   Ceredig), a British chieftain (nominally Christian), probably of
   Ceredigion or Cardigan, who had made a raid into Ireland, and sold
   several of Patrick's converts into slavery (10 chapters). The
   Confession, as contained in the "Book of Armagh," is alleged to have
   been transcribed before a.d. 807 from Patrick's original autograph,
   which was then partly illegible. There are four other MSS. of the
   eleventh century, with sundry additions towards the close, which seem
   to be independent copies of the same original. See Haddan & Stubbs,
   note on p. 296. The Epistle to Coroticus is much shorter, and not so
   generally accepted. Both documents were first printed in 1656, then in
   1668 in the Acta Sanctorum, also in Migne's Patrologia (Vol. 53), in
   Miss Cusack's Life of St. Patrick, in the work of Ebrard (l.c. 482
   sqq.), and in Haddan & Stubbs, Councils (Vol. II., P. II., 296 sqq.).

   There is a difference of opinion about Patrick's nationality, whether
   he was of Scotch, or British, or French extraction. He begins his
   Confession: "I, Patrick, a sinner, the rudest and the least of all the
   faithful, and the most contemptible with the multitude (Ego Patricius,
   peccator, rusticissimus et minimus omnium fidelium et
   contemptibilissimus apud plurimos, or, according to another reading,
   contemptibilis sum apud plurimos), had for my father Calpornus (or
   Calphurnius), a deacon (diaconum, or diaconem), the son of Potitus (al.
   Photius), a presbyter (filium quondam Potiti presbyteri), who lived in
   the village of Bannavem (or Banaven) of Tabernia; for he had a cottage
   in the neighborhood where I was captured. I was then about sixteen
   years old; but I was ignorant of the true God, and was led away into
   captivity to Hibernia." Bannavem of Tabernia is, perhaps Banavie in
   Lochaber in Scotland (McLauchlan); others fix the place of his birth in
   Kilpatrick (i.e. the cell or church of Patrick), near Dunbarton on the
   Clyde (Ussher, Butler, Maclear); others, somewhere in Britain, and thus
   explain his epithet "Brito" or "Briton" (Joceline and Skene); still
   others seek it in Armoric Gaul, in Boulogne (from Bononia), and derive
   Brito from Brittany (Lanigan, Moore, Killen, De Vinné).

   He does not state the instrumentality of his conversion. Being the son
   of a clergyman, he must have received some Christian instruction; but
   he neglected it till he was made to feel the power of religion in
   communion with God while in slavery. "After I arrived in Ireland," he
   says (ch. 6), "every day I fed cattle, and frequently during the day I
   prayed; more and more the love and fear of God burned, and my faith and
   my spirit were strengthened, so that in one day I said as many as a
   hundred prayers, and nearly as many in the night." He represents his
   call and commission as coming directly from God through a vision, and
   alludes to no intervening ecclesiastical authority or episcopal
   consecration. In one of the oldest Irish MSS., the Book of Durrow, he
   is styled a presbyter. In the Epistle to Coroticus, he appears more
   churchly and invested with episcopal power and jurisdiction. It begins:
   "Patricius, peccator indoctus, Hiberione (or Hyberione) constitutus
   episcopus, certissime reor, a Deo accepi id quod sum: inter barbaras
   utique gentes proselytus et profuga, ob amorem Dei." (So according to
   the text of Haddan & Stubbs, p. 314; somewhat different in Migne,
   Patrol. LIII. 814; and in Ebrard, p. 505.) But the letter does not
   state where or by whom he was consecrated.

   The "Book of Armagh "contains also an Irish hymn (the oldest monument
   of the Irish Keltic language), called S. Patricii Canticum Scotticum,
   which Patrick is said to have written when he was about to convert the
   chief monarch of the island (Laoghaire or Loegaire). [56] The hymn is a
   prayer for the special aid of Almighty God for so important a work; it
   contains the principal doctrines of orthodox Christianity, with a dread
   of magical influences of aged women and blacksmiths, such as still
   prevails in some parts of Ireland, but without an invocation of Mary
   and the saints, such as we might expect from the Patrick of tradition
   and in a composition intended as a breast-plate or corselet against
   spiritual foes. The following is the principal portion:


   "5. I bind to myself to-day,--

   The Power of God to guide me,

   The Might of God to uphold me,

   The Wisdom of God to teach me,

   The Eye of God to watch over me,

   The Ear of God to hear me,

   The Word of God to give me speech.

   The Hand of God to protect me,

   The Way of God to go before me,

   The Shield of God to shelter me,

   The Host of God to defend me,
   Against the snares of demons,
   Against the temptations of vices,
   Against the lusts of nature,
   Against every man who meditates injury to me.
      Whether far or near,
      With few or with many.


   6. I have set around me all these powers,

   Against every hostile savage power,

   Directed against my body and my soul,

   Against the incantations of false prophets,

   Against the black laws of heathenism,

   Against the false laws of heresy,

   Against the deceits of idolatry,

   Against the spells of women, and smiths, and druids,

   Against all knowledge which blinds the soul of man.


   7. Christ protect me to-day

   Against poison, against burning,

   Against drowning, against wound,

   That I may receive abundant reward.


   8. Christ with me, Christ before me,

   Christ behind me, Christ within me,

   Christ beneath me, Christ above me,

   Christ at my right, Christ at my left,

   Christ in the fort [i.e. at home],

   Christ in the chariot-seat [travelling by land],

   Christ in the poop [travelling by water].


   9. Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,

   Christ in the mouth of every man who speaks to me,

   Christ in every eye that sees me,

   Christ in every ear that hears me.

   10. I bind to myself to-day

   The strong power of an invocation of the Trinity,

   The faith of the Trinity in Unity,

   The Creator of [the elements].


   11. Salvation is of the Lord,

   Salvation is of the Lord,

   Salvation is of Christ;

   May thy salvation, O Lord, be ever with us."

   contemporary, is a Latin "Hymn in praise of St. Patrick" (Hymnus Sancti
   Patricii, Episcopi Scotorum) by St. Sechnall (Secundinus) which begins
   thus:


   "Audite, omnes amantes Deum, sancta merita

   Viri in Christo beati Patrici Episcopi:

   Quomodo bonum ob actum simulatur angelis,

   Perfectamque propter uitam aequatur Apostolis."

   The poem is given in full by Haddan & Stubbs, 324-327, and assigned to
   "before a.d. 448 (?)," in which year Sechnall died. But how could he
   anticipate the work of Patrick, when his mission, according to the same
   writers, began only eight years earlier (440), and lasted till 493? The
   hymn is first mentioned by Tyrechanus in the "Book of Armagh."

   The next oldest document is the Irish hymn of St. Fiacc on St. Patrick,
   which is assigned to the latter part of the sixth century, (l.c.
   356-361). The Senchus Mor is attributed to the age of St. Patrick; but
   it is a code of Irish laws, derived from Pagan times, and gradually
   modified by Christian ecclesiastics in favor of the church. The Canons
   attributed to St. Patrick are of later date (Haddan & Stubbs, 328
   sqq.).

   It is strange that St. Patrick is not mentioned by Bede in his Church
   History, although he often refers to Hibernia and its church, and is
   barely named as a presbyter in his Martyrology. He is also ignored by
   Columba and by the Roman Catholic writers, until his mediaeval
   biographers from the eighth to the twelfth century Romanized him,
   appealing not to his genuine Confession, but to spurious documents and
   vague traditions. He is said to have converted all the Irish chieftains
   and bards, even Ossian, the blind Homer of Scotland, who sang to him
   his long epic of Keltic heroes and battles. He founded 365 or,
   according to others, 700 churches, and consecrated as many bishops, and
   3,000 priests (when the whole island had probably not more than two or
   three hundred thousand inhabitants; for even in the reign of Elizabeth
   it did not exceed 600,000). [57] He changed the laws of the kingdom,
   healed the blind, raised nine persons from death to life, and expelled
   all the snakes and frogs from Ireland. [58] His memory is celebrated
   March 17, and is a day of great public processions with the Irish
   Catholics in all parts of the world. His death is variously put in the
   year 455 (Tillemont), 464 or 465 (Butler, Killen), 493 (Ussher, Skene,
   Forbes, Haddan & Stubbs). Forbes (Kalendars, p. 433) and Skene (Keltic
   Scotland, II. 427 sqq.) come to the conclusion that the legend of St.
   Patrick in its present shape is not older than the ninth century, and
   dissolves into three personages: Sen-Patrick, whose day in the Kalendar
   is the 24th of August; Palladius, "qui est Patricius," to whom the
   mission in 431 properly belongs, and Patricius, whose day is the 17th
   of March, and who died in 493. "From the acts of these three saints,
   the subsequent legend of the great Apostle of Ireland was compiled, and
   an arbitrary chronology applied to it."

   the Pope had given him, together with the tablets on which he himself
   used to write. Haddan & Stubbs, p. 291.

   [49] Hence Montalembert says (II. 393): "The Christian faith dawned
   upon Ireland by means of two slaves." The slave-trade between Ireland
   and England flourished for many centuries.

   [50] This fact is usually, omitted by Roman Catholic writers. Butler
   says simply: "His father was of a good family." Even Montalembert
   conceals it by calling "the Gallo-Roman (?) Patrick, son of a relative
   of the great St. Martin of Tours" (II. 390). He also repeats, without a
   shadow of proof, the legend that St. Patrick was consecrated and
   commissioned by Pope St. Celestine (p. 391), though he admits that
   "legend and history have vied in taking possession of the life of St.
   Patrick."

   [51] The dates are merely conjectural. Haddan & Stubbs (p. 295) select
   a. d.440 for St. Patrick's mission (as did Tillemont & Todd), and 493
   as the year of his death. According to other accounts, his mission
   began much earlier, and lasted sixty years. The alleged date of the
   foundation of Armagh is a. d.445.

   "Archbishop, First Primate, and Chief Apostle of Ireland.' See Haddan &

   purely historical grounds, the supposed mission from Rome of S. Patrick

   Irish peasantry, and repeated at bed-time as a protection from evil, or
   "as a religious armor to protect body and soul against demons and men
   and vices."

   [58] A witty Irishman, who rowed me (in 1875) over Lake Killarney, told
   me that St. Patrick put the last snake into an iron box, and sunk it to
   the bottom of the lake, although he had solemnly promised to let the
   creature out. I asked him whether it was not a sin to cheat a snake?
   "Not at all," was his quick reply, "he only paid him in the same coin;
   for the first snake cheated the whole world." The same guide told me
   that Cromwell killed all the good people in Ireland, and let the bad
   ones live; and when I objected that he must have made an exception with
   his ancestors, he politely replied: "No, my parents came from America."

   § 15. The Irish Church after St. Patrick.

   The Missionary Period.

   The labors of St. Patrick were carried on by his pupils and by many
   British priests and monks who were driven from England by the
   Anglo-Saxon invasion in the 5th and 6th centuries. [59] There was an
   intimate intercourse between Ireland and Wales, where British
   Christianity sought refuge, and between Ireland and Scotland, where the
   seed of Christianity, had been planted by Ninian and Kentigern. In less
   than a century, after St. Patrick's death Ireland was covered with
   churches and convents for men and women. The monastic institutions were
   training schools of clergymen and missionaries, and workshops for
   transscribing sacred books. Prominent among these are the monasteries
   of Armagh, Banchor or Bangor (558), Clonard (500), Clonmacnois (528),
   Derry (555), Glendolough (618).

   During the sixth and seventh centuries Ireland excelled all other
   countries in Christian piety, and acquired the name of "the Island of
   Saints." We must understand this in a comparative sense, and remember
   that at that time England was just beginning to emerge from Anglo-Saxon
   heathenism, Germany was nearly all heathen, and the French kings--the
   eldest sons of the Church--were "monsters of iniquity." Ireland itself
   was distracted by civil wars between the petty kings and chieftains;
   and the monks and clergy, even the women, marched to the conflict.
   Adamnan with difficulty secured a law exempting women from warfare, and
   it was not till the ninth century that the clergy in Ireland were
   exempted from "expeditions and hostings" (battles). The slave-trade was
   in full vigor between Ireland and England in the tenth century, with
   the port of Bristol for its centre. The Irish piety was largely based
   on childish superstition. But the missionary zeal of that country is
   nevertheless most praiseworthy. Ireland dreamed the dream of converting
   heathen Europe. Its apostles went forth to Scotland, North Britain,
   France, Germany, Switzerland, and North Italy. "They covered the land
   and seas of the West. Unwearied navigators, they landed on the most
   desert islands; they overflowed the Continent with their successive
   immigrations. They saw in incessant visions a world known and unknown
   to be conquered for Christ. The poem of the Pilgrimage of St. Brandan,
   that monkish Odyssey so celebrated in the middle ages, that popular
   prelude of the Divina Commedia, shows us the Irish monks in close
   contact with all the dreams and wonders of the Keltic ideal." [60]

   The missionaries left Ireland usually in companies of twelve, with a
   thirteenth as their leader. This duodecimal economy was to represent
   Christ and the twelve apostles. The following are the most prominent of
   these missionary bands: [61]

   St. Columba, with twelve brethren, to Hy in Scotland, a.d. 563.

   St. Mohonna (or Macarius, Mauricius), sent by Columba, with twelve
   companions, to the Picts.

   St. Columbanus, with twelve brethren, whose names are on record, to
   France and Germany, a.d. 612.

   St. Kilian, with twelve, to Franconia and Würzburg, a.d. 680.

   St. Eloquius, with twelve, to Belgium, a.d. 680.

   St. Rudbert or Rupert, with twelve, to Bavaria, a.d. 700.

   St. Willibrord (who studied twelve years in Ireland), with twelve, to
   Friesland, a.d. 692.

   St. Forannan, with twelve, to the Belgian frontier, a.d. 970.

   It is remarkable that this missionary activity of the Irish Church is
   confined to the period of her independence of the Church of Rome. We
   hear no more of it after the Norman conquest.

   The Irish Church during this missionary period of the sixth and seventh
   centuries had a peculiar character, which we learn chiefly from two
   documents of the eighth century, namely, the Catalogue of the Saints of
   Ireland, [62] and the Litany of Angus the Culdee. [63]

   The Catalogue distinguishes three periods and three orders of saints:
   secular, monastic, and eremitical.

   The saints of the time of St. Patrick were all bishops full of the Holy
   Ghost, three hundred and fifty in number, founders of churches; they
   had one head, Christ, and one leader, Patrick, observed one mass and
   one tonsure from ear to ear, and kept Easter on the fourteenth moon
   after the vernal equinox; they excluded neither laymen nor women;
   because, founded on the Rock of Christ, they feared not the blast of
   temptation. They sprung from the Romans, Franks, Britons and Scots.
   This order of saints continued for four reigns, from about a.d. 440
   till 543.

   The second order, likewise of four reigns, till a.d. 599, was of
   Catholic Presbyters, three hundred in number, with few bishops; they
   had one head, Christ, one Easter, one tonsure, as before; but different
   and different rules, and they refused the services of women, separating
   them from the monasteries.

   The third order of saints consisted of one hundred holy presbyters and
   a few bishops, living in desert places on herbs and water and the alms
   of the faithful; they had different tonsures and Easters, some
   celebrating the resurrection on the 14th, some on the 16th moon; they
   continued through four reigns till 665.

   The first period may be called episcopal, though in a rather
   non-episcopal or undiocesan sense. Angus, in his Litany, invokes "seven
   times fifty [350] holy cleric bishops," whom "the saint [Patrick]
   ordained," and "three hundred pure presbyters, upon whom he conferred
   orders." In Nennius the number of presbyters is increased to three
   thousand, and in the tripartite Life of Patrick to five thousand. These
   bishops, even if we greatly reduce the number as we must, had no higher
   rank than the ancient chorepiscopi or country-bishops in the Eastern
   Church, of whom there were once in Asia Minor alone upwards of four
   hundred. Angus the Culdee gives us even one hundred and fifty-three
   groups of seven bishops, each group serving in the same church.
   Patrick, regarding himself as the chief bishop of the whole Irish
   people, planted a church wherever he made a few converts and could
   obtain a grant from the chief of a clan, and placed a bishop ordained
   by himself over it. "It was a congregational and tribal episcopacy,
   united by a federal rather than a territorial tie under regular
   jurisdiction. During Patrick's life, he no doubt exercised a
   superintendence over the whole; but we do not see any trace of the
   metropolitan jurisdiction of the church of Armagh over the rest." [64]

   The second period was monastic and missionary. All the presbyters and
   deacons were monks. Monastic life was congenial to the soil, and had
   its antecedents in the brotherhoods and sisterhoods of the Druids. [65]
   It was imported into Ireland probably from France, either directly
   through Patrick, or from the monastery of St. Ninian at Galloway, who
   himself derives it from St. Martin of Tours. [66] Prominent among these
   presbyter-monks are the twelve apostles of Ireland headed by St.
   Columba, who carried Christianity to Scotland in 563, and the twelve
   companions of Columbanus, who departed from Ireland to the Continent
   about 612. The most famous monastery was that of Bennchar, or Bangor,
   founded a.d. 558 by Comgall in the county of Down, on the south side of
   Belfast Lough. Comgall had four thousand monks under his care. [67]
   From Bangor proceeded Columbanus and other evangelists.

   By a primitive Keltic monastery we must not understand an elaborate
   stone structure, but a rude village of wooden huts or bothies (botha)
   on a river, with a church (ecclais), a common eating-hall, a mill, a
   hospice, the whole surrounded by a wall of earth or stone. The senior
   monks gave themselves entirely to devotion and the transcribing of the
   Scriptures. The younger were occupied in the field and in mechanical
   labor, or the training of the rising generation. These monastic
   communities formed a federal union, with Christ as their invisible
   head. They were training schools of the clergy. They attracted converts
   from the surrounding heathen population, and offered them a refuge from
   danger and violence. They were resorted to by English noblemen, who,
   according to Bede, were hospitably received, furnished with books, and
   instructed. Some Irish clergymen could read the Greek Testament at a
   time when Pope Gregory J. was ignorant of Greek. There are traces of an
   original Latin version of the Scriptures differing from the Itala and
   Vulgate, especially in Patrick's writings. [68] But "there is no trace
   anywhere of any Keltic version of the Bible or any part of it. St.
   Chrysostom's words have been misunderstood to support such a
   supposition, but without ground." [69] If there had been such a
   translation, it would have been of little use, as the people could not
   read it, and depended for their scanty knowledge of the word of God on
   the public lessons in the church.

   The "Book of Armagh," compiled by Ferdomnach, a scribe or learned monk
   of Armagh, in 807, gives us some idea of the literary state of the
   Irish Church at that time. [70] It contains the oldest extant memoirs
   of St. Patrick, the Confession of St. Patrick, the Preface of Jerome to
   the New Testament, the Gospels, Epistles, Apocalypse and Acts, with
   some prefaces chiefly taken from the works of Pelagius, and the Life of
   St. Martin of Tours by Sulpicius Severus, with a short litany on behalf
   of the writer.

   In the ninth century John Scotus Erigena, who died in France, 874,
   startled the Church with his rare, but eccentric, genius and
   pantheistic speculations. He had that power of quick repartee for which
   Irishmen are distinguished to this day. When asked by Charles the Bald
   at the dinner-table, what was the difference between a Scot and a Sot
   (quid distat inter Scottum et Sottum?), John replied: "Nothing at all
   but the table, please your Majesty."

   Nennius, Asser, etc.), and come to the conclusion that the Vulgate,
   though known to Fastidius in Britain about a. d.420, was probably
   unknown to St. Patrick, writing half a century later in Ireland, but
   that from the seventh century on, the Vulgate gradually superseded the

   § 16. Subjection of Ireland to English and Roman Rule.

   The success of the Roman mission of Augustin among the Anglo-Saxons
   encouraged attempts to bring the Irish Church under the papal
   jurisdiction and to force upon it the ritual observances of Rome.
   England owes a good deal of her Christianity to independent Irish and
   Scotch missionaries from Bangor and Iona; but Ireland (as well as
   Germany) owes her Romanism, in great measure, to England. Pope Honorius
   (who was afterwards condemned by the sixth oecumenical council for
   holding the Monothelite heresy) addressed to the Irish clergy in 629 an
   exhortation--not, however, in the tone of authoritative dictation, but
   of superior wisdom and experience--to conform to the Roman mode of
   keeping Easter. This is the first known papal encyclical addressed to
   that country. A Synod was held at Magh-Lene, and a deputation sent to
   the Pope (and the three Eastern patriarchs) to ascertain the foreign
   usages on Easter. The deputation was treated with distinguished
   consideration in Rome, and, after three years' absence, reported in
   favor of the Roman cycle, which indeed rested on a better system of
   calculation. It was accordingly adopted in the South of Ireland, under
   the influence of the learned Irish ecclesiastic Cummian, who devoted a
   whole year to the study of the controversy. A few years afterwards
   Thomian, archbishop and abbot of Armagh (from 623 to 661), and the best
   Irish scholar of his age, introduced, after correspondence with the
   Pope, the Roman custom in the North, and thereby promoted his authority
   in opposition to the power of the abbot of Iona, which extended over a
   portion of Ireland, and strongly favored the old custom. But at last
   Abbot Adamnan likewise yielded to the Roman practice before his death
   (704).

   The Norman conquest under William I., with the sanction of the Pope,
   united the Irish Church still more closely to Rome (1066). Gregory
   VII., in an encyclical letter to the king, clergy and laity of Ireland
   (1084)., boldly, challenged their obedience to the Vicar of the blessed
   Peter, and invited them to appeal to him in all matters requiring
   arbitration.

   The archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm, claimed and
   exercised a sort of supervision over the three most important
   sea-ports, Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, on the ground that the
   Norman settlers applied to them for bishops and priests. Their
   influence was exerted in favor of conformity to Rome. Clerical celibacy
   was more generally introduced, uniformity in ritual established, and
   the large number of bishoprics reduced to twenty-three under two
   archbishops, Armagh for the North and Cashel for the South; while the
   bishop of Dublin was permitted to remain under the care of the
   archbishop of Canterbury. This reorganization of the polity in the
   interest of the aggrandizement of the hierarchy was effected about 1112
   at the synod of Rathbreasail, which was attended by 58 bishops, 317
   priests, a large number of monks, and King Murtogh O'Brien with his
   nobles. [71]

   At last Ireland was invaded and conquered by England under Henry II.,
   with the effectual aid of Pope Adrian IV.--the only Englishman that sat
   on the papal throne. In a curious bull of 1155, he justified and
   encouraged the intended invasion in the interest of the papacy, and
   sent the king the ring of investiture as Lord of Ireland calling upon
   that licentious monarch to "extirpate the nurseries of vice" in
   Ireland, to "enlarge the borders of the (Roman) Church," and to secure
   to St. Peter from each house "the annual pension of one penny" (equal
   in value in the twelfth century to at least two or three shillings of
   our present currency). [72] Henry carried out his design in 1171, and
   with a strong military force easily subdued the whole Irish nation,
   weakened and distracted by civil wars, to British rule, which has been
   maintained ever since. A Synod at Armagh regarded the subjugation as a
   righteous judgment for the sins of the people, and especially for the
   slave trade. The bishops were the first to acknowledge Henry, hoping to
   derive benefit from a foreign régime, which freed them from petty
   tyrants at home. A Synod of Cashel in 1172, among other regulations,
   ordered that all offices of the church should hereafter in all parts of
   Ireland be conformed to the observances of the Church of England. A
   papal legate henceforward was constantly residing in Ireland. Pope
   Alexander III. was extremely gratified with this extension of his
   dominion, and in September, 1172, in the same tone of sanctimonious
   arrogance) issued a brief confirming the bull of Adrian, and expressing
   a hope that "the barbarous nation" would attain under the government of
   Henry "to some decency of manners;" he also wrote three epistles--one
   to Henry II., one to the kings and nobles of Ireland, and one to its
   hierarchy--enjoining obedience of Ireland to England, and of both to
   the see of St. Peter. [73]

   [71] See details in Lanigan and Killen (ch. vii.).

   [72] This papal-Irish bull is not found in the Bullarium Romanum, the
   editors of which were ashamed of it, and is denounced by some Irish
   Romanists as a monstrous and outrageous forgery, but it is given by,
   Matthew Paris (1155), was confirmed by Pope Alexander III. in a letter
   to Henry II. (a. d.1172), published in Ireland in 1175, printed in
   Baronius, Annales, ad a. d.1159, who took his copy from a Codex
   Vaticanus and is acknowledged as undoubtedly genuine by Dr. Lanigan,
   the Roman Catholic historian of Ireland (IV. 64), and other
   authorities; comp. Killen I. 211 sqq. It is as follows: "Adrian,
   Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, to his dearest son in Christ,
   the illustrious King of England, greeting and apostolic benediction. "
   Full laudably, and profitably has your magnificence conceived the
   design of propagating your glorious renown on earth, and of completing
   your reward of eternal happiness in heaven, whilst as a Catholic prince
   you are intent on enlarging the borders of the Church, teaching the
   truth of the Christian faith to the ignorant and rude, extirpating the
   nurseries of iniquity from the field of the Lord, and for the more
   convenient execution of this purpose, requiring the counsel and favor
   of the Apostolic See. In which the maturer your deliberation and the
   greater the discretion of your procedure, by, so much the happier, we
   trust, will be your progress, with the assistance of the Lord; because
   whatever has its origin in ardent faith and in love of religion always
   has a prosperous end and issue. "There is indeed no doubt but that
   Ireland and all the islands on which Christ the Sun of Righteousness
   has shone, and which have received the doctrines of the Christian
   faith, belong to the jurisdiction of St. Peter and of the holy Roman
   Church, as your Excellency also acknowledges. And therefore we are the
   more solicitous to propagate a faithful plantation among them, and a
   seed pleasing to the Lord, as we have the secret conviction of
   conscience that a very, rigorous account must be rendered of them. "
   You then, most dear son in Christ, have signified to us your desire to
   enter into the island of Ireland that you may reduce the people to
   obedience to laws, and extirpate the nurseries of vice, and that you
   are willing to pay from each house a yearly pension of one penny to St.
   Peter, and that you will preserve the rights of the churches of this
   land whole and inviolate. We, therefore, with that grace and acceptance
   suited to your pious and laudable design, and favorably assenting to
   your petition, hold it good and acceptable that, for extending the
   borders of the church, restraining the progress of vice, for the
   correction of manners, the planting of virtue, and the increase of the
   Christian religion, you enter that island, and execute therein whatever
   shall pertain to the honor of God and welfare of the land; and that the
   people of that land receive you honorably, and reverence you as their
   lord--the rights of their churches still remaining sacred and
   inviolate, and saving to St. Peter the annual pension of one penny from
   every house. "If then you are resolved to carry the design you have
   conceived into effectual execution, study to train that nation to
   virtuous manners, and labor by yourself and others whom you shall judge
   meet for this work, in faith, word, and life, that the church may be
   there adorned; that the religion of the Christian faith may be planted
   and grow up, and that all things pertaining to the honor of God and the
   salvation of souls be so ordered that you may be entitled to the
   fulness of eternal reward in God, and obtain a glorious renown on
   throughout all ages."

   Scotland (Scotia) before the tenth century was comprised in the general
   appellation of Britain (Britannia), as distinct from Ireland
   (Hibernia). It was known to the Romans as Caledonia, [74] to the Kelts
   as Alban; but the name of Scotia was exclusively appropriated to
   Ireland till the tenth century. The independent history of Scotland
   begins with the establishment of the Scottish monarchy in the ninth
   century. At first it was a purely Keltic kingdom; but in the course of
   time the Saxon race and feudal institutions spread over the country,
   and the Keltic tribes retreated to the mountains and western islands.
   The names of Scot and Scotch passed over to the English-speaking people
   and their language; while the Keltic language, formerly known as
   Scotch, became known as Irish.

   The Keltic history of Scotland is full of fable, and a battlefield of
   Romanists and Protestants, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, who have
   claimed it for their respective systems of doctrine and church-polity.
   It must be disentangled from the sectarian issues of the Culdean
   controversy. The historian is neither a polemic nor an apologist, and
   should aim at nothing but the truth.

   Tertullian says, that certain places in Britain which the Romans could
   not conquer were made subject to Christ. It is quite likely that the
   first knowledge of Christianity reached the Scots and Picts from
   England; but the constant wars between them and the Britons and the
   decline of the Roman power were unfavorable to any mission work.

   The mission of Palladius to Scotland by Pope Caelestius is as vague and
   uncertain as his mission to Ireland by the same Pope, and is strongly
   mixed up with the mission of Patrick. An Irish colony from the
   North-Eastern part of Ulster, which had been Christianized by Patrick,
   settled in Scotland towards the close of the fifth century, and
   continued to spread along the coasts of Argyle and as far as the
   islands of Mull and Iona, until its progress was checked by the
   Northern Picts.

   The first distinct fact in the church history of Scotland is the
   apostolate of St. Ninian at the close of the fourth century, during the
   reign of Theodosius in the East. We have little reliable information of
   him. The son of a British king, he devoted himself early to the
   ministry of Christ. He spent some time in Rome, where the Pope
   commissioned him to the apostolate among the heathen in Caledonia, and
   in Gaul with Bishop Martin of Tours, who deserves special praise for
   his protest against the capital punishment of heretics in the case of
   the Priscillianists. He began the evangelization of the Southern Picts
   in the Eastern districts of modern Scotland. He built a white stone
   church called "Candida Casa," at Whittern (Quhithern, Witerna) in
   Galloway, on the South-Westem border of Scotland by the sea side, and
   dedicated it to the memory of St. Martin, who had died in that year
   (397). [75] This was the beginning of "the Great Monastery" ("Magnum
   Monasterium") or monastery of Rosnat, which exerted a civilizing and
   humanizing influence on the surrounding country, and annually attracted
   pilgrims from England and Scotland to the shrine of St. Ninian. His
   life has been romanized and embellished with legends. He made a newborn
   infant indicate its true father, and vindicate the innocence of a
   presbyter who had been charged by the mother with the crime of
   violation; he caused leeks and herbs to grow in the garden before their
   season; he subdued with his staff the winds and the waves of the sea;
   and even his relics cured the sick, cleansed the lepers, and terrified
   the wicked, "by all which things," says Ailred, his biographer, "the
   faith of believers is confirmed to the praise and glory of Christ."

   St. Kentigern (d. Nov. 13, 603), also called St. Mungo (the gracious
   one), [76] the first bishop of Glasgow, labored in the sixth century
   for the conversion of the people in Cumberland, Wales, and on the
   Clyde, and re-converted the Picts, who had apostatized from the faith.
   He was the grandson of a heathen king in Cumbria or Strathclyde, the
   son of a Christian, though unbaptized mother. He founded a college of
   Culdees or secular monks, and several churches. He wore a hair shirt
   and garment of goat-skin, lived on bread and vegetables, slept on a
   rocky couch and a stony pillow, like Jacob, rose in the night to sing
   psalms, recited in the morning the whole psalter in a cold stream,
   retired to desert places during Lent, living on roots, was
   con-crucified with Christ on Good Friday, watched before the tomb, and
   spent Easter in hilarity and joy. He converted more by his silence than
   his speech, caused a wolf and a stag to drag the plough, raised grain
   from a field sown with sand, kept the rain from wetting his garments,
   and performed other marvels which prove the faith or superstition of
   his biographers in the twelfth century. Jocelyn relates also, that
   Kentigern went seven times to Rome, and received sundry privileges and
   copies of the Bible from the Pope. There is, however, no trace of such
   visits in the works of Gregory I., who was more interested in the Saxon
   mission than the Scotch. Kentigern first established his episcopal
   chair in Holdelm (now Hoddam), afterwards in Glasghu (Glasgow). He met
   St. Columba, and exchanged with him his pastoral stave. [77] He
   attained to the age of one hundred and eighty-five years, and died
   between a.d. 601 and 612 (probably 603). [78] He is buried in the crypt
   of the cathedral of St. Mungo in Glasgow, the best preserved of
   mediaeval cathedrals in Scotland.

   St. Cuthbert (d. March 20, 687), whose life has been written by Bede,
   prior of the famous monastery of Mailros (Melrose), afterwards bishop
   of Lindisfarne, and last a hermit, is another legendary saint of
   Scotland, and a number of churches are traced to him or bear his name.

   Saint Columba or Columbcille, (died June 9, 597) is the real apostle of
   Scotland. He is better known to us than Ninian and Kentigern. The
   account of Adamnan (624-704), the ninth abbot of Hy, was written a
   century after Columba's death from authentic records and oral
   traditions, although it is a panegyric rather than a history. Later
   biographers have romanized him like St. Patrick. He was descended from
   one of the reigning families of Ireland and British Dalriada, and was
   born at, Gartan in the county of Donegal about a.d. 521. He received in
   baptism the symbolical name Colum, or in Latin Columba (Dove, as the
   symbol of the Holy Ghost), to which was afterwards added cille (or
   kill, i.e. "of the church," or "the dove of the cells," on account of
   his frequent attendance at public worship, or, more probably, for his
   being the founder of many churches. [80] He entered the monastic
   seminary of Clonard, founded by St. Finnian, and afterwards another
   monastery near Dublin, and was ordained a priest. He planted the church
   at Derry in 545, the monastery of Darrow in 553, and other churches. He
   seems to have fondly clung all his life to his native Ireland, and to
   the convent of Derry. In one of his elegies, which were probably
   retouched by the patriotism of some later Irish bard, he sings:


   "Were all the tributes of Scotia [i.e. Ireland] mine,

   From its midland to its borders,

   I would give all for one little cell

   In my beautiful Derry.

   For its peace and for its purity,

   For the white angels that go

   In crowds from one end to the other,

   I love my beautiful Derry.

   For its quietness and purity,

   For heaven's angels that come and go

   Under every leaf of the oaks,

   I love my beautiful Derry.


   My Derry, my fair oak grove,

   My dear little cell and dwelling,

   O God, in the heavens above I

   Let him who profanes it be cursed.

   Beloved are Durrow and Derry,

   Beloved is Raphoe the pure,

   Beloved the fertile Drumhome,

   Beloved are Sords and Kells!

   But sweeter and fairer to me

   The salt sea where the sea-gulls cry

   When I come to Derry from far,

   It is sweeter and dearer to me --
   Sweeter to me." [81]

   In 563, the forty-second year of his age, Columba prompted by a passion
   for travelling and a zeal for the spread of Christianity, [82] sailed
   with twelve fellow-apostles to the West of Scotland, possibly on
   invitation of the provincial king, to whom he was related by blood. He
   was presented with the island of Hy, commonly called Iona, [83] near
   the Western coast of Scotland about fifty miles West from Oban. It is
   an inhospitable island, three miles and a half long and a mile and a
   half broad, partly cultivated, partly covered with hill pasture,
   retired dells, morass and rocks, now in possession of the Duke of
   Argyll, numbering about three hundred Protestant inhabitants, an
   Established Presbyterian Church, and a Free Church. The neighboring
   island of Staffa, though smaller and uninhabited, is more interesting
   to the ordinary tourist, and its Fingal's Cave is one of the most
   wonderful specimens of the architectural skill of nature; it looks like
   a Gothic cathedral, 66 feet high, 42 feet broad, and 227 feet long,
   consisting of majestic basalt columns, an arched roof, and an open
   portal towards the ocean, which dashes in and out in a constant
   succession of waves, sounding solemn anthems in this unique temple of
   nature. Columba and his fellow-monks must have passed it on their
   missionary wanderings; but they were too much taken up with heaven to
   look upon the wonders of the earth, and the cave remained comparatively
   unknown to the world till 1772. Those islands wore the same aspect in
   the sixth century as now, with the exception of the woods, which have
   disappeared. Walter Scott (in the "Lord of the Isles") has thrown the
   charm of his poetry over the Hebridean archipelago, from which
   proceeded the Christianization of Scotland. [84]

   By the labors of Columba and his successors, Iona has become one of the
   most venerable and interesting spots in the history of Christian
   missions. It was a light-house in the darkness of heathenism. We can
   form no adequate conception of the self-denying zeal of those heroic
   missionaries of the extreme North, who, in a forbidding climate and
   exposed to robbers and wild beasts, devoted their lives to the
   conversion of savages. Columba and his friends left no monuments of
   stone and wood; nothing is shown but the spot on the South of the
   island where he landed, and the empty stone coffin where his body was
   laid together with that of his servant; his bones were removed
   afterwards to Dunkeld. The old convent was destroyed and the monks were
   killed by the wild Danes and Norsemen in the tenth century. The
   remaining ruins of Iona--a cathedral, a chapel, a nunnery, a graveyard
   with the tombstones of a number of Scottish and Norwegian and Irish
   kings, and three remarkable carved crosses, which were left of three
   hundred and sixty that (according to a vague tradition) were thrown
   into the sea by the iconoclastic zeal of the Reformation--are all of
   the Roman Catholic period which succeeded the original Keltic
   Christianity, and which lived on its fame. During the middle ages Iona
   was a sort of Jerusalem of the North, where pilgrims loved to worship,
   and kings and noblemen desired to be buried. When the celebrated Dr.
   Johnson, in his Tour to the Hebrides, approached Iona, he felt his
   piety grow warmer. No friend of missions can visit that lonely spot,
   shrouded in almost perpetual fog, without catching new inspiration and
   hope for the ultimate triumph of the gospel over all obstacles. [85]

   The arrival of Columba at Iona was the beginning of the Keltic church
   in Scotland. The island was at that time on the confines of the Pictic
   and Scotic jurisdiction, and formed a convenient base for missionary
   labors among the Scots, who were already Christian in name, but needed
   confirmation, and among the Picts, who were still pagan, and had their
   name from painting their bodies and fighting naked. Columba directed
   his zeal first to the Picts; he visited King Brude in his fortress, and
   won his esteem and co-operation in planting Christianity among his
   people. "He converted them by example as well as by word" (Bede). He
   founded a large number of churches and monasteries in Ireland and
   Scotland directly or through his disciples. [86] He was involved in the
   wars so frequent in those days, when even women were required to aid in
   battle, and he availed himself of military force for the overthrow of
   paganism. He used excommunication very freely, and once pursued a
   plunderer with maledictions into the sea until the water reached to his
   knees. But these rough usages did not interfere with the veneration for
   his name. He was only a fair type of his countrymen. "He had," says
   Montalembert, "the vagabond inclination, the ardent, agitated, even
   quarrelsome character of the race." He had the "perfervidum ingenium
   Scotorum." He was manly, tall and handsome, incessantly active, and had
   a sonorous and far-reaching voice, rolling forth the Psalms of David,
   every syllable distinctly uttered. He could discern the signs of the
   weather. Adamnan ascribes to him an angelic countenance, a prophetic
   fore-knowledge and miracles as great as those performed by Christ, such
   as changing water into wine for the celebration of the eucharist, when
   no wine could be obtained, changing bitter fruit into sweet, drawing
   water from a rock, calming the storm at sea, and curing many diseases.
   His biography instead of giving solid facts, teems with fabulous
   legends, which are told with childlike credulity. O'Donnell's biography
   goes still further. Even the pastoral staff of Columba, left
   accidentally upon the shore of Iona, was transported across the sea by
   his prayers to meet its disconsolate owner when he landed somewhere in
   Ireland. [87]

   Columba died beside the altar in the church while engaged in his
   midnight devotions. Several poems are ascribed to him--one in praise of
   the natural beauties of his chosen island, and a monastic rule similar
   to that of St. Benedict; but the "regula ac praecepta" of Columba, of
   which Wilfrid spoke at the synod of Whitby, probably mean discipline or
   observance rather than a written rule. [88]

   The church establishment of Columba at Iona belongs to the second or
   monastic period of the Irish church, of which it formed an integral
   part. It consisted of one hundred and fifty persons under the monastic
   rule. At the head of it stood a presbyter-abbot, who ruled over the
   whole province, and even the bishops, although the episcopal function
   of ordination was recognized. [89] The monks were a family of brethren
   living in common. They were divided into three classes: the seniors,
   who attended to the religious services, instruction, and the
   transcribing of the Scriptures; the middle-aged, who were the working
   brethren, devoted to agriculture, the tending of the cattle, and
   domestic labor; and the youth, who were alumni under instruction. The
   dress consisted of a white tunica or under garment, and a camilla or
   outer garment and hood made of wool. Their food was bread, milk, eggs,
   fish, and on Sundays and festivals mutton or beef. The doctrinal views
   and ecclesiastical customs as to the observance of Easter and the
   tonsure were the same as among the Britons and the Irish in distinction
   from the Roman system introduced by Augustin among the Saxons. [90]

   The monastery of Iona, says Bede, held for a long time the pre-eminence
   over the monasteries and churches of the Picts and Northern Scots.
   Columba's successors, he adds, were distinguished for their continency,
   their love of God, and strict attention to their rules of discipline,
   although they followed "uncertain cycles in their computation of the
   great festival (Easter), because they were so far away from the rest of
   the world, and had none to supply them with the synodical decrees on
   the paschal observance; wherefore they only practised such works of
   piety and chastity as they could learn from the prophetical,
   evangelical, and apostolical writings. This manner of keeping Easter
   continued among them for a hundred and fifty years, till the year of
   our Lord's incarnation 715." [91]

   Adamnan (d. 704), the ninth successor of Columba, in consequence of a
   visit to the Saxons, conformed his observance of Easter to the Roman
   Church; but his brethren refused to follow him in this change. After
   his death, the community of Iona became divided on the Easter question,
   until the Columban monks, who adhered to the old custom, were by royal
   command expelled (715). With this expulsion terminates the primacy of
   Iona in the kingdom of the Picts.

   The monastic church was broken up or subordinated to the hierarchy of
   the secular clergy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] In the Irish calendar there are twenty saints of the name Columba,
   or Columbanus, Columbus, Columb. The most distinguished next to
   Columbcille is Columbanus, the Continental missionary, who has often
   been confounded with Columba. In the Continental hagiology, the name is
   used for female saints. See Reeves, p. 248.

   [81] Montalembert, III. 112. This poem strikes the key-note of father
   Prout's more musical "Bells of Shandon which sound so grand on the
   river Lee."

   [82] "Pro Christo peregrinare volens," says Adamnan (p. 108), who knows
   nothing of his excommunication and exile from Ireland in consequence of
   a great battle. And yet it is difficult to account for this tradition.
   In one of the Irish Keltic poems ascribed to Columba, he laments to
   have been driven from Erin by his own fault and in consequence of the
   blood shed in his battles. Montalembert, III. 145.

   [83] This is not an adaptation to Columba's Hebrew name (Neander), but
   a corruption of Ii-shona, i.e. the Holy Island (from Ii, the Keltic
   name for island, and hona or shona, sacred). So Dr. Lindsay Alexander
   and Cunningham. But Reeves (l.c. Introd., p. cxxx.) regards Ioua as the
   genuine form, which is the feminine adjective of Iou (to be pronounced
   like the English Yeo). The island has borne no fewer than thirty names.

   [84] "No two objects of interest," says the Duke of Argyll (Iona, p. 1)
   "could be more absolutely dissimilar in kind than the two neighboring
   islands, Staffa and Iona:--Iona dear to Christendom for more than a
   thousand years;--Staffa known to the scientific and the curious only
   since the close of the last century. Nothing but an accident of
   geography could unite their names. The number of those who can
   thoroughly understand and enjoy them both is probably very small."

   [85] "Hither came holy men from Erin to take counsel with the Saint on
   the troubles of clans and monasteries which were still dear to him.
   Hither came also bad men red-handed from blood and sacrilege to make
   confession and do penance at Columba's feet. Hither, too, came
   chieftains to be blessed, and even kings to be ordained--for it is
   curious that on this lonely spot, so far distant from the ancient
   centres of Christendom, took place the first recorded case of a
   temporal sovereign seeking from a minister of the Church what appears
   to have been very like formal consecration. Adamnan, as usual, connects
   his narrative of this event, which took place in 547, with miraculous
   circumstances, and with Divine direction to Columba, in his selection
   of Aidan, one of the early kings of the Irish Dalriadic colony in
   Scotland. " The fame of Columba's supernatural powers attracted many
   and strange visitors to the shores on which we are now looking. Nor can
   we fail to remember, with the Reilig Odhrain at our feet, how often the
   beautiful galleys of that olden time came up the sound laden with the
   dead,--'their dark freight a vanished life.' A grassy mound not far
   from the present landing place is known as the spot on which bodies
   were laid when they were first carried to the shore. We know from the
   account of Columba's own burial that the custom is to wake the body
   with the singing of psalms during three days and nights before laying
   it to its final rest. It was then home in solemn procession to the
   grave. How many of such processions must have wound along the path that
   leads to the Reilig Odhrain! How many fleets of galley must have ridden
   at anchor on that bay below us, with all those expressive signs of
   mourning which belong to ships, when kings and chiefs who had died in
   distant lands were carried hither to be buried in this holy Isle! From
   Ireland, from Scotland, and from distant Norway there came, during many
   centuries, many royal funerals to its shores. And at this day by far
   the most interesting remains upon the Island are the curious and
   beautiful tombstones and crosses which lie in the Reilig Odhrain. They
   belong indeed, even the most ancient of them, to, in age removed by
   many hundred years from Columba's time. But they represent the lasting
   reverence which his name has inspired during so many generations and
   the desire of a long succession of chiefs and warriors through the
   Middle Ages and down almost to our own time, to be buried in the soil
   he trod." The Duke of Argyll, l.c., pp. 95-98.

   § 19. The Culdees.

   After the expulsion of the Columban monks from the kingdom of the Picts
   in the eighth century, the term Culdee or Ceile De, or Kaledei, first
   appears in history, and has given rise to much controversy and
   untenable theories. [92] It is of doubtful origin, but probably means
   servants or worshippers of God. [93] it was applied to anchorites, who,
   in entire seclusion from society, sought the perfection of sanctity.
   They succeeded the Columban monks. They afterwards associated
   themselves into communities of hermits, and were finally brought under
   canonical rule along with the secular clergy, until at length the name
   of Culdee became almost synonymous with that of secular canon.

   The term Culdee has been improperly applied to the whole Keltic church,
   and a superior purity has been claimed for it.

   There is no doubt that the Columban or the Keltic church of Scotland,
   as well as the early Irish and the early British churches, differed in
   many points from the mediaeval and modern church of Rome, and represent
   a simpler and yet a very active missionary type of Christianity.

   The leading peculiarities of the ancient Keltic church, as distinct
   from the Roman, are:

   1. Independence of the Pope. Iona was its Rome, and the Abbot of Iona,
   and afterwards of Dunkeld, though a mere Presbyter, ruled all Scotland.

   2. Monasticism ruling supreme, but mixed with secular life, and not
   bound by vows of celibacy; while in the Roman church the monastic
   system was subordinated to the hierarchy of the secular clergy.

   3. Bishops without dioceses and jurisdiction and succession.

   4. Celebration of the time of Easter.

   5. Form of the tonsure.

   It has also been asserted, that the Kelts or Culdees were opposed to
   auricular confession, the worship of saints, and images, purgatory,
   transubstantiation, the seven sacraments, and that for this reason they
   were the forerunners of Protestantism.

   But this inference is not warranted. Ignorance is one thing, and
   rejection of an error from superior knowledge is quite another thing.
   The difference is one of form rather than of spirit. Owing to its
   distance and isolation from the Continent, the Keltic church, while
   superior to the churches in Gaul and Italy--at least during the sixth
   and seventh centuries--in missionary zeal and success, was left behind
   them in other things, and adhered to a previous stage of development in
   truth and error. But the general character and tendency of both during
   that period were essentially different from the genius of Protestant
   Christianity. We find among the Kelts the same or even greater love for
   monasticism and asceticism the same superstitious belief in incredible
   miracles, the same veneration for relics (as the bones of Columba and
   Aidan, which for centuries were carried from place to place), the same
   scrupulous and narrow zeal for outward forms and ceremonies (as the
   observance of the mere time of Easter, and the mode of monastic
   tonsure), with the only difference that the Keltic church adhered to an
   older and more defective calendar, and to the semi-circular instead of
   the circular tonsure. There is not the least evidence that the Keltic
   church had a higher conception of Christian freedom, or of any positive
   distinctive principle of Protestantism, such as the absolute supremacy
   of the Bible in opposition to tradition, or justification by faith
   without works, or the universal priesthood of all believers. [94]

   Considering, then, that the peculiarities of the Keltic church arose
   simply from its isolation of the main current of Christian history, the
   ultimate triumph of Rome, with all its incidental evils, was upon the
   whole a progress in the onward direction. Moreover, the Culdees
   degenerated into a state of indolence and stagnation during the
   darkness of the ninth and tenth centuries, and the Danish invasion,
   with its devastating and disorganizing influences. We still find them
   in the eleventh century, and frequently at war with the Roman clergy
   about landed property, tithes and other matters of self-interest, but
   not on matters of doctrine, or Christian life. The old Culdee convents
   of St. Andrews Dunkeld, Dunblane and Brechin were turned into the
   bishop's chapter with the right of electing the bishop. Married Culdees
   were gradually supplanted by Canons-Regular. They lingered longest in
   Brechin, but disappeared in the thirteenth century. The decline of the
   Culdees was the opportunity of Rome. The Saxon priests and monks,
   connected with the more civilized countries, were very active and
   aggressive, building cathedrals, monasteries, hospitals, and getting
   possession of the land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [92] To Adamnan and to Bede, the name was entirely unknown. Skene (II.
   226) says: "In the whole range of ecclesiastical history there is
   nothing more entirely destitute of authority than the application of
   this name to the Columban monks of the sixth and seventh centuries, or
   more utterly baseless than the fabric which has been raised upon that
   assumption." The most learned and ingenious construction of an
   imaginary Protestant Culdee Church was furnished by Ebrard and
   McLauchlan.

   [93] The word Culdee is variously derived from the Gaelic Gille De,
   servant of God; from the Keltic Cuil or Ceal, retreat, recess, and
   Cuildich, men of the recess (Jamieson, McLauchlan, Cunningham); from
   the Irish Ceile De, the spouse of God (Ebrard), or the servant of God
   (Reeves); from the Irish Culla, cowl, i.e. the black monk; from the
   Latin Deicola, cultores Dei (Colidei), worshippers of God the Father,
   in distinction from Christicolae (Calechrist in Irish), or ordinary
   Christians (Skene); from the Greek kelleotai, men of the cells
   (Goodall). The earliest Latin form is Kaledei. in Irish Keile as a
   substantive means socius maritus, also servus. On the name, see Braun,
   De Culdeis, Bonn, 1840, McLauchlan pp. 175 sq.; Ebrard pp. 2 sq., and
   Skene, II. 238.

   [94] The Duke of Argyll who is a Scotch Presbyterian, remarks (l.c. p.
   41): "It is vain to look, in the peculiarities of the Scoto-Irish
   Church, for the model either of primitive practice, or of any
   particular system. As regards the theology of Columba's time, although
   it was not what we now understand as Roman, neither assuredly was it
   what we understand as Protestant. Montalembert boasts, and I think with
   truth, that in Columba's life we have proof of the practice of the
   auricular confession, of the invocation of saints, of confidence in
   their protection, of belief in transubstantiation [?], of the practices
   of fasting and of penance, of prayers for the dead, of the sign of the
   crow in familiar--and it must be added--in most superstitious use. On
   the other hand there is no symptom of the worship or 'cultus' of the
   Virgin, and not even an allusion to such an idea as the universal
   bishopric of Rome, or to any special authority as seated there."

   § 20. Extinction of the Keltic Church, and Triumph of Rome under King
   David I.

   The turning-point in the history of the Scotch church is the reign of
   the devout Saxon queen St. Margaret, one of the best queens of Scotland
   (1070-1093). She exerted unbounded influence over her illiterate
   husband, Malcolm III., and her sons. She was very benevolent,
   self-denying, well versed in the Scriptures, zealous in reforming
   abuses, and given to excessive fasting, which undermined her
   constitution and hastened her death. "ln St. Margaret we have an
   embodiment of the spirit of her age. What ostentatious humility, what
   almsgiving, what prayers! What piety, had it only been freed from the
   taint of superstition! The Culdees were listless and lazy, while she
   was unwearied in doing good. The Culdees met her in disputation, but,
   being ignorant, they were foiled. Death could not contend with life.
   The Indian disappears before the advance of the white man. The Keltic
   Culdee disappeared before the footsteps of the Saxon priest." [95]

   The change was effected by the same policy as that of the Norman kings
   towards Ireland. The church was placed upon a territorial in the place
   of a tribal basis, and a parochial system and a diocesan episcopacy was
   substituted for the old tribal churches with their monastic
   jurisdiction and functional episcopacy. Moreover the great religious
   orders of the Roman Church were introduced and founded great
   monasteries as centres of counter-influence. And lastly, the Culdees
   were converted from secular into regular Canons and thus absorbed into
   the Roman system. When Turgot was appointed bishop of St. Andrews, a.d.
   1107 "the whole rights of the Keledei over the whole kingdom of
   Scotland passed to the bishopric of St. Andrews."

   From the time of Queen Margaret a stream of Saxons and Normans poured
   into Scotland, not as conquerors but as settlers, and acquired rapidly,
   sometimes by royal grant, sometimes by marriage, the most fertile
   districts from the Tweed to the Pentland Firth. From these settlers
   almost every noble family of Scotland traces its descent. They brought
   with them English civilization and religion.

   The sons and successors of Margaret enriched the church by magnificent
   endowments. Alexander I. founded the bishoprics of Moray and Dunkeld.
   His younger brother, David I., the sixth son of Malcolm III., who
   married Maud, a grand-niece of William the Conqueror (1110) and ruled
   Scotland from 1124 to 1153, founded the bishoprics of Ross, Aberdeen,
   Caithness, and Brechin, and several monasteries and religious houses.
   The nobility followed his example of liberality to the church and the
   hierarchy so that in the course of a few centuries one half of the
   national wealth passed into the hands of the clergy, who were at the
   same time in possession of all the learning.

   In the latter part of David's reign an active crusade commenced against
   the Culdee establishments from St. Andrews to Iona, until the very name
   gradually disappeared; the last mention being of the year 1332, when
   the usual formula of their exclusion in the election of a bishop was
   repeated.

   Thus the old Keltic Church came to an end, leaving no vestiges behind
   it, save here and there the roofless walls of what had been a church,
   and the numerous old burying-grounds to the use of which the people
   still cling with tenacity, and where occasionally an ancient Keltic
   cross tells of its former state. All else has disappeared; and the only
   records we have of their history are the names of the saints by whom
   they were founded preserved in old calendars, the fountains near the
   old churches bearing their name, the village fairs of immemorial
   antiquity held on their day, and here and there a few lay families
   holding a small portion of land, as hereditary custodiers of the
   pastoral staff, or other relic of the reputed founder of the church,
   with some small remains of its jurisdiction." [96]

   Ketzergeschichte. Berlin 1860.

   We now proceed to the conversion of the Continental Teutons, especially
   those of France and Germany.

   The first wholesale conversions of the Germanic or Teutonic race to the
   Christian religion took place among the Goths in the time when Arianism
   was at the height of power in the East Roman empire. The chief agents
   were clerical and other captives of war whom the Goths in their raids
   carried with them from the provinces of the Roman empire and whom they
   learned to admire and love for their virtue and supposed miraculous
   power. Constantine the Great entered into friendly relations with them,
   and is reported by Eusebius and Socrates to have subjected them to the
   cross of Christ. It is certain that some ecclesiastical organization
   was effected at that time. Theophilus, a bishop of the Goths, is
   mentioned among the fathers of the Council of Nicaea, 325.

   The real apostle of the Goths is Ulifilas, [97] who was consecrated
   bishop in 348 at Constantinople, and died there in 381, aged seventy
   years. He invented the Gothic alphabet, and translated the Bible into
   Gothic, but was an Arian, or rather a semi-Arian, who regarded Christ
   as a secondary God and the Holy Spirit merely as a sanctifying power.
   [98]

   Arianism spread with great rapidity among the Visigoths, Ostrogoths,
   Burgundians, and Vandals. This heretical form of Christianity, however,
   was more a matter of accident than preference and conviction among the
   Germans, and soon gave way to orthodoxy when they became acquainted
   with it. When Alaric, the famous king of the Visigoths, captured Rome
   (410), he treated the city with marked leniency, which Augustin justly
   traced to the influence of the Christian faith even in heretical form.
   The Vandals, the rudest among the Teutonic tribes, made an exception;
   they fiercely persecuted the orthodox Christians in North Africa (since
   430) and desolated this once flourishing field of the Catholic Church,
   the scene of the immortal labors of St. Augustin. Their kingdom was
   destroyed under Justinian (534), but the Catholic Church never rose
   from its ruins, and the weak remnant was conquered by the sword of
   Islâm (670).

   Chrysostom made a noble effort to convert the Eastern Goths from
   Arianism to Catholicity, but his mission ceased after his death (407).

   The conversion of the Franks to Catholic christianity and various
   political circumstances led to the abandonment of Arianism among the
   other Germanic tribes. The Burgundians who spread from the Rhine to the
   Rhone and Saone, embraced Catholic Christianity in 517, and were
   incorporated into the French kingdom in 534. The Suevi who spread from
   Eastern Germany into France and Spain, embraced the Catholic faith in
   550. The Visigoths in Spain, through their king, Reccared the Catholic,
   subscribed an orthodox creed at the third Council of Toledo, a.d. 589,
   but the last of the Gothic kings, Roderic, was conquered by the
   Saracens, breaking into Spain from Africa, in the bloody battle of
   Xeres de la Frontera, a.d. 711.

   The last stronghold of Arianism were the Longobards or Lombards, who
   conquered Northern Italy (still called Lombardy) and at first
   persecuted the Catholics. They were converted to the orthodox faith by
   the wise influence of Pope Gregory I. (590616), and the Catholic queen
   Theodelinde (d. 625) whose husband Agilulf (590-616) remained Arian,
   but allowed his son Adelwald to be baptized and brought up in the
   Catholic Church. An Arian reaction followed, but Catholicism triumphed
   under Grimoald (662-671), and Liutprand (773-774). Towards the close of
   the eighth century, Pepin and Charlemagne, in the interest of France
   and the papacy, destroyed the independence of the Lombards after a
   duration of about two hundred years, and transferred the greater part
   of Italy to the Eastern empire and to the Pope. In these struggles the
   Popes, being then (as they have been ever since) opposed from
   hierarchical interest to the political unity of Italy, aided the Franks
   and reaped the benefit.

   The Salian Franks were the first among the Teutonic tribes which were
   converted to catholic or orthodox Christianity. Hence the sovereign of
   France is styled by the Popes "the oldest son of the church," and
   Rheims, where Clovis was baptized, is the holy city where most of the
   French kings down to Charles X. (1824) were consecrated. [99] The
   conversion of the Franks prepared the way for the downfall of the Arian
   heresy among the other Germanic nations, and for the triumph of the
   papacy in the German empire under Charlemagne.

   The old Roman civilization of Gaul, though nominally Christian, was in
   the last stage of consumption when the German barbarians invaded the
   soil and introduced fresh blood. Several savage tribes, even the Huns,
   passed through Gaul like a tempest, leaving desolation behind them, but
   the Franks settled there and changed Gaul into France, as the
   Anglo-Saxons changed Britain into England. They conquered the
   Gallo-Romans, cruelly spoiled and almost exterminated them in the
   North-Eastern districts. Before they accepted the Christianity of the
   conquered race, they learned their vices. "The greatest evil of
   barbarian government," says Henri Martin, [100] "was perhaps the
   influence of the greedy and corrupt Romans who insinuated themselves
   into the confidence of their new masters." To these degenerate
   Christians Montalembert traces the arts of oppression and the
   refinements of debauchery and perfidy which the heathen Germans added
   to their native brutality. "The barbarians derived no advantage from
   their contact with the Roman world, depraved as it was under the
   empire. They brought with them manly virtues of which the conquered
   race had lost even the recollection; but they borrowed, at the same
   time, abject and contagious vices, of which the Germanic world had no
   conception. They found Christianity there; but before they yielded to
   its beneficent influence, they had time to plunge into all the baseness
   and debauchery, of a civilization corrupted long before it was
   vanquished. The patriarchal system of government which characterized
   the ancient Germans, in their relations with their children and slaves
   as well as with their chiefs, fell into ruin in contact with that
   contagious depravity." [101]

   The conversion of the Salian Franks took place under the lead of their
   victorious king Chlodwig or Clovis (Ludovicus, Louis), the son of
   Childeric and grandson of Merovig (hence the name of Merovingians). He
   ruled from the year 481 to his death in 511. With him begins the
   history not only of the French empire, its government and laws, but
   also of the French nation, its religion and moral habits. He married a
   Christian princess, Chlotilda, a daughter of the king of the
   Burgundians (493), and allowed his child to be baptized. Before the
   critical battle at Tolbiac [102] near Cologne against the invasion of
   the Allemanni, he prayed to Jesus Christ for aid after having first
   called upon his own gods, and promised, in case of victory, to submit
   to baptism together with his warriors. After the victory he was
   instructed by Bishop Remigius of Rheims. When he heard the story of the
   crucifixion of Christ, he exclaimed: "Would I had been there with my
   valiant Franks to avenge him!" On Christmas, in the year 496, he
   descended before the cathedral of Rheims into the baptismal basin, and
   three thousand of his warriors followed him as into the joys of
   paradise. "When they arose from the waters, as Christian disciples, one
   might have seen fourteen centuries of empire rising with them; the
   whole array of chivalry, the long series of the crusades, the deep
   philosophy of the schools, in one word all the heroism, all the
   liberty, all the learning of the later ages. A great nation was
   commencing its career in the world--that nation was the Franks." [103]

   But the change of religion had little or no effect on the character of
   Clovis and his descendants, whose history is tarnished with atrocious
   crimes. The Merovingians, half tigers, half lambs, passed with
   astonishing rapidity from horrible massacres to passionate
   demonstrations of contrition, and from the confessional back again to
   the excesses of their native cruelty. The crimes of Clovis are honestly
   told by such saintly biographers as Gregory of Tours and Hincmar, who
   feel no need of any excuse for him in view of his services to religion.
   St. Remigius even advised the war of conquest against the Visigoths,
   because they were Arians.

   "The Franks," says a distinguished Catholic Frenchman, [104] "were sad
   Christians. While they respected the freedom of the Catholic faith, and
   made external profession of it, they violated without scruple all its
   precepts, and at the same time the simplest laws of humanity. After
   having prostrated themselves before the tomb of some holy martyr or
   confessor; after having distinguished themselves by the choice of an
   irreproachable bishop; after having listened respectfully to the voice
   of a pontiff or monk, we see them, sometimes in outbreaks of fury,
   sometimes by cold-blooded cruelties, give full course to the evil
   instincts of their savage nature. Their incredible perversity was most
   apparent in the domestic tragedies, the fratricidal executions and
   assassinations, of which Clovis gave the first example, and which
   marked the history of his son and grandson with an ineffaceable stain.
   Polygamy and perjury mingled in their daily life with a semi-pagan
   superstition, and in reading these bloody biographies, scarcely
   lightened by some transient gleams of faith or humility, it is
   difficult to believe that, in embracing Christianity, they gave up a
   single pagan vice or adopted a single Christian virtue.

   "It was against this barbarity of the soul, far more alarming than
   grossness and violence of manners, that the Church triumphantly
   struggled. From the midst of these frightful disorders, of this double
   current of corruption and ferocity, the pure and resplendent light of
   Christian sanctity was about to rise. But the secular clergy, itself
   tainted by the general demoralization of the two races, was not
   sufficient for this task. They needed the powerful and soon
   preponderating assistance of the monastic Army. It did not fail: the
   church and France owe to it the decisive victory of Christian
   civilization over a race much more difficult to subdue than the
   degenerate subjects of Rome or Byzantium. While the Franks, coming from
   the North, completed the subjugation of Gaul, the Benedictines were
   about to approach from the South, and super-impose a pacific and
   beneficent dominion upon the Germanic barbarian conquest. The junction
   and union of these forces, so unequal in their civilizing power, were
   destined to exercise a sovereign influence over the future of our
   country."

   Among these Benedictine monks, St. Maurus occupies the most prominent
   place. He left Monte Casino before the death of St. Benedict (about
   540), with four companions, crossed the Alps, founded Glanfeuil on the
   Loire, the first Benedictine monastery in France, and gave his name to
   that noble band of scholars who, more than a thousand years after,
   enriched the church with the best editions of the fathers and other
   works of sacred learning. [105] He had an interview with King
   Theodebert (the grandson of Clovis), was treated with great reverence
   and received from him a large donation of crown lands. Monastic
   establishments soon multiplied and contributed greatly to the
   civilization of France. [106]

   145.

   While the Latin Benedictine monks worked their way up from the South
   towards the heart of France, Keltic missionaries carried their
   independent Christianity from the West to the North of France, the
   banks of the Rhine, Switzerland and Lombardy; but they were
   counteracted by Roman missionaries, who at last secured the control
   over France and Germany as well as over the British Isles.

   St. Columbanus [107] is the pioneer of the Irish missionaries to the
   Continent. His life has been written with great minuteness by Jonas, a
   monk of his monastery at Bobbio. He was born in Leinster, a.d. 543, in
   which year St. Benedict, his celebrated monastic predecessor, died at
   Monte Casino, and was trained in the monastery of Bangor, on the coast
   of Down, under the direction of St. Comgall. Filled with missionary
   zeal, he left his native land with twelve companions, and crossed over
   the sea to Gaul in 590, [108] or in 585, [109] several years before
   Augustin landed in England. He found the country desolated by war;
   Christian virtue and discipline were almost extinct. He travelled for
   several years, preaching and giving an example of humility and charity.
   He lived for whole weeks without other food than herbs and wild
   berries. He liked best the solitude of the woods and eaves, where even
   the animals obeyed his voice and received his caresses. In Burgundy he
   was kindly received by King Gontran, one of the grandsons of Clovis;
   refused the offer of wealth, and chose a quiet retreat in the Vosges
   mountains, first in a ruined Roman fort at Annegray, and afterwards at
   Luxeuil (Luxovium). Here he established a celebrated monastery on the
   confines of Burgundy and Austrasia. A similar institution he founded at
   Fontaines. Several hundred disciples gathered around him. Luxeuil
   became the monastic capital of Gaul, a nursery of bishops and saints,
   and the mother of similar institutions.

   Columbanus drew up a monastic rule, which in all essential points
   resembles the more famous rule of St. Benedict, but is shorter and more
   severe. It divides the time of the monks between ascetic exercises and
   useful agricultural labor, and enjoins absolute obedience on severe
   penalties. It was afterwards superseded by the Benedictine rule, which
   had the advantage of the papal sanction and patronage. [110]

   The life of Columbanus in France was embittered and his authority
   weakened by his controversy with the French clergy and the court of
   Burgundy. He adhered tenaciously to the Irish usage of computing
   Easter, the Irish tonsure and costume. Besides, his extreme severity of
   life was a standing rebuke of the worldly priesthood and dissolute
   court. He was summoned before a synod in 602 or 603, and defended
   himself in a letter with great freedom and eloquence, and with a
   singular mixture of humility and pride. He calls himself (like St.
   Patrick) "Columbanus, a sinner," but speaks with an air of authority.
   He pleads that he is not the originator of those ritual differences,
   that he came to France, a poor stranger, for the cause of Christ, and
   asks nothing but to be permitted to live in silence in the depth of the
   forests near the bones of his seventeen brethren, whom he had already
   seen die. "Ah! let us live with you in this Gaul, where we now are,
   since we are destined to live with each other in heaven, if we are
   found worthy to enter there." The letter is mixed with rebukes of the
   bishops, calculations of Easter and an array of Scripture quotations.
   At the same time he wrote several letters to Pope Gregory I., one of
   which only is preserved in the writings of Columbanus. There is no
   record of the action of the Synod on this controversy, nor of any
   answer of the Pope.

   The conflict with the court of Burgundy is highly honorable to
   Columbanus, and resulted in his banishment. He reproved by word and
   writing the tyranny of queen Brunehild (or Brunehauld) and the
   profligacy of her grandson Theodoric (or Thierry II.); he refused to
   bless his illegitimate children and even threatened to excommunicate
   the young king. He could not be silenced by flattery and gifts, and was
   first sent as a prisoner to Besançon, and then expelled from the
   kingdom in 610. [111]

   But this persecution extended his usefulness. We find him next, with
   his Irish friends who accompanied him, on the lake of Zurich, then in
   Bregenz (Bregentium) on the lake of Constance, planting the seeds of
   Christianity in those charming regions of German Switzerland. His
   preaching was accompanied by burning the heathen idols. Leaving his
   disciple St. Gall at Bregenz, he crossed the Alps to Lombardy, and
   founded a famous monastery at Bobbio. He manfully fought there the
   Arian heresy, but in a letter to Boniface IV. he defended the cause of
   Nestorius, as condemned by the Fifth General Council of 553, and called
   upon the Pope to vindicate the church of Rome against the charge of
   heresy. He speaks very boldly to the Pope, but acknowledges Rome to be
   "the head of the churches of the whole world, excepting only the
   singular prerogative of the place of the Lord's resurrection"
   (Jerusalem). [112] He died in Bobbio, Nov. 21, 615. The poetry of
   grateful love and superstitious faith has adorned his simple life with
   various miracles.

   Columbanus was a man of considerable learning for his age. He seems to
   have had even some knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. His chief works are
   his Regula Monastica, in ten short chapters; seventeen Discourses; his
   Epistles to the Gallic Synod on the paschal controversy, to Gregory I.,
   and to Boniface IV.; and a few poems. The following characteristic
   specimen of his ascetic view of life is from one of the discourses: "O
   mortal life! how many hast thou deceived, seduced, and blinded! Thou
   fliest and art nothing; thou appearest and art but a shade; thou risest
   and art but a vapor; thou fliest every day, and every day thou comest;
   thou fliest in coming, and comest in flying, the same at the point of
   departure, different at the end; sweet to the foolish, bitter to the
   wise. Those who love thee know thee not, and those only know thee who
   despise thee. What art thou, then, O human life? Thou art the way of
   mortals, and not their life. Thou beginnest in sin and endest in death.
   Thou art then the way of life and not life itself. Thou art only a
   road, and an unequal road, long for some, short for others; wide for
   these, narrow for those; joyous for some, sad for others, but for all
   equally rapid and without return. It is necessary, then, O miserable
   human life! to fathom thee, to question thee, but not to trust in thee.
   We must traverse thee without dwelling in thee--no one dwells upon a
   great road; we but march over it, to reach the country beyond." [113]

   Several of the disciples of Columbanus labored in eastern Helvetia and
   Rhaetia.

   Sigisbert separated from him at the foot of the St. Gothard, crossed
   eastward over the Oberalp to the source of the Rhine, and laid the
   foundation of the monastery of Dissentis in the Grisons, which lasts to
   this day.

   St. Gall (Gallus), the most celebrated of the pupils of Columbanus,
   remained in Switzerland, and became the father of the monastery and
   city called after him, on the banks of the river Steinach. He declined
   the bishopric of Constanz. His double struggle against the forces of
   nature and the gods of heathenism has been embellished with marvelous
   traits by the legendary poetry of the middle ages. [114] When he died,
   ninety-five years old, a.d. 640, the whole surrounding country of the
   Allemanni was nominally Christianized. The monastery of St. Gall became
   one of the most celebrated schools of learning in Switzerland and
   Germany, where Irish and other missionaries learned German and prepared
   themselves for evangelistic work in Switzerland and Southern Germany.
   There Notker Balbulus, the abbot (died 912), gave a lasting impulse to
   sacred poetry and music, as the inventor or chief promoter of the
   mediaeval Laudes or Prosae, among which the famous "Media vita in morte
   sumus" still repeats in various tongues its solemn funeral warning
   throughout Christendom.

   Fridold or Fridolin, who probably came from Scotland, preached the
   gospel to the Allemanni in South Germany. But his life is involved in
   great obscurity, and assigned by some to the time of Clovis I.
   (481-511), by others more probably to that of Clovis II. (638-656).

   Kilian or Kyllina, of a noble Irish family, is said to have been the
   apostle of Franconia and the first bishop of Würzburg in the seventh
   century.

   § 24. German Missionaries before Boniface.

   England derived its Anglo-Saxon population from Germany in the fifth
   century, and in return gave to Germany in the eighth century the
   Christian religion with a strong infusion of popery. Germany afterwards
   shook off the yoke of popery, and gave to England the Protestant
   Reformation. In the seventeenth century, England produced Deism, which
   was the first act of modern unbelief, and the forerunner of German
   Rationalism. The revival of evangelical theology and religion which
   followed in both countries, established new points of contact between
   these cognate races, which meet again on common ground in the Western
   hemisphere to commingle in the American nationality.

   The conversion of Germany to Christianity and to Romanism was, like
   that of England, the slow work of several centuries. It was
   accomplished by missionaries of different nationalities, French,
   Scotch-Irish, English, and Greek. It began at the close of the second
   century, when Irenaeus spoke of Christian congregations in the two
   Germanies, [115] i.e. Germania prima and secunda, on the upper and
   lower Rhine; and it was substantially completed in the age of
   Charlemagne in the eighth century. But nearly the entire North-Eastern
   part of Germany, which was inhabited mostly by Slavonic tribes,
   remained heathen till the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.

   We must distinguish especially three stages: 1) the preparatory labors
   of Italian, French, and Scotch-Irish missionaries; 2) the consolidating
   romanizing work of Boniface of England and his successors; 3) the
   forcible military conversion of the Saxons under Charlemagne. The
   fourth and last missionary stage, the conversion of the Prussians and
   Slavonic races in North-Eastern Germany, belongs to the next period.

   The light of Christianity came to Germany first from the Roman empire
   in the Roman colonies on the Rhine. At the council of Arles in 314,
   there was a bishop Maternus of Cologne with his deacon, Macrinus, and a
   bishop of Treves by the name of Agröcius.

   In the fifth century the mysterious Severinus from the East appeared
   among the savages on the banks of the Danube in Bavaria as an angel of
   mercy, walking bare-footed in mid-winter, redeeming prisoners of war,
   bringing food and clothing with the comfort of the Gospel to the poor
   and unfortunate, and won by his self-denying labors universal esteem.
   French monks and hermits left traces of their work at St. Goar, St.
   Elig, Wulfach, and other places on the charming banks of the Rhine. The
   efficient labors of Columbanus and his Irish companions and pupils
   extended from the Vosges to South Germany and Eastern Switzerland.
   Willebrord, an Anglo-Saxon, brought up in an Irish convent, left with
   twelve brethren for Holland (690) became the Apostle of the Friesians,
   and was consecrated by the Pope the first bishop of Utrecht
   (Trajectum), under the name of Clemens. He developed an extensive
   activity of nearly fifty years till his death (739).

   When Boniface arrived in Germany he found nearly in all parts which he
   visited, especially in Bavaria and Thuringia, missionaries and bishops
   independent of Rome, and his object was fully as much to romanize this
   earlier Christianity, as to convert the heathen. He transferred the
   conflict between the Anglo-Saxon mission of Rome and the older Keltic
   Christianity of Patrick and Columba and their successors from England
   to German soil, and repeated the role of Augustin of Canterbury. The
   old Easter controversy disappears after Columbanus, and the chief
   objects of dispute were freedom from popery and clerical marriage. In
   both respects, Boniface succeeded, after a hard struggle, in romanizing
   Germany.

   The leaders of the opposition to Rome and to Bonifacius among his
   predecessors and contemporaries were Adelbert and Clemens. We know them
   only from the letters of Boniface, which represent them in a very,
   unfavorable light. Adelbert, or Aldebert (Eldebert), was a Gaul by
   nation, and perhaps bishop of Soissons; at all events he labored on the
   French side of the Rhine, had received episcopal ordination, and
   enjoyed great popularity from his preaching, being regarded as an
   apostle, a patron, and a worker of miracles. According to Boniface, he
   was a second Simon Magus, or immoral impostor, who deceived the people
   by false miracles and relics, claimed equal rank with the apostles, set
   up crosses and oratories in the fields, consecrated buildings in his
   own name, led women astray, and boasted to have relics better than
   those of Rome, and brought to him by an angel from the ends of the
   earth. Clemens was a Scotchman (Irishman), and labored in East
   Franconia. He opposed ecclesiastical traditions and clerical celibacy,
   and had two sons. He held marriage with a brother's widow to be valid,
   and had peculiar views of divine predestination and Christ's descent
   into Hades. Aldebert and Clemens were condemned without a hearing, and
   excommunicated as heretics and seducers of the people, by a provincial
   Synod of Soissons, a.d. 744, and again in a Synod of Rome, 745, by Pope
   Zacharias, who confirmed the decision of Boniface. Aldebert was at last
   imprisoned in the monastery of Fulda, and killed by shepherds after
   escaping from prison. Clemens disappeared. [116]

   On the Councils of Bonif see Hefele: Conciliengeschichte, III. 458.

   Boniface or Winfried [117] surpassed all his predecessors on the German
   mission-field by the extent and result of his labors, and acquired the
   name of the Apostle of Germany. He was born about 680 from a noble
   family, at Kirton in Wessex the last stronghold of paganism among the
   Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. He was brought up in the convent of Nutsal near
   Winchester, and ordained priest at the age of thirty. He felt it his
   duty, to christianize those countries from which his Anglo-Saxon
   forefathers had emigrated. It was a formidable task, requiring a heroic
   courage and indomitable perseverance.

   He sacrificed his splendid prospects at home, crossed the channel, and
   began his missionary career with two or three companions among the
   Friesians in the neighborhood of Utrecht in Holland (715). His first
   attempt was a failure. Ratbod, the king of Friesland, was at war with
   Charles Martel, and devastated the churches and monasteries which had
   been founded by the Franks, and by Willibrord.

   But far from being discouraged, he was only stimulated to greater
   exertion. After a brief sojourn in England, where he was offered the
   dignity of abbot of his convent, he left again his native land, and
   this time forever. He made a pilgrimage to Rome, was cordially welcomed
   by Pope Gregory II. and received a general commission to Christianize
   and romanize central Europe (718). Recrossing the Alps, he visited
   Bavaria and Thuringia, which had been evangelized in part by the
   disciples of Columban, but he was coldly received because he
   represented their Christianity as insufficient, and required submission
   to Rome. He turned his steps again to Friesland where order had been
   restored, and assisted Willibrord, archbishop of Utrecht, for three
   years. In 722 he returned to Thuringia in the wake of Charles Martel's
   victorious army and preached to the heathen in Hesse who lived between
   the Franks and the Saxons, between the middle Rhine and the Elbe. He
   founded a convent at Amanaburg (Amöneburg) on the river Ohm.

   In 723 he paid, on invitation, a second visit to Rome, and was
   consecrated by Gregory II. as a missionary bishop without a diocese
   (episcopus regionarius). He bound himself on the grave of St. Peter
   with the most stringent oath of fealty to the Pope similar to that
   which was imposed on the Italian or suburban bishops. [118]

   From this time his work assumed a more systematic character in the
   closest contact with Rome as the centre of Christendom. Fortified with
   letters of commendation, he attached himself for a short time to the
   court of Charles Martel, who pushed his schemes of conquest towards the
   Hessians. Aided by this secular help and the Pope's spiritual
   authority, he made rapid progress. By a master stroke of missionary
   policy he laid the axe to the root of Teutonic heathenism; with his own
   hand, in the presence of a vast assembly, he cut down the sacred and
   inviolable oak of the Thunder-God at Geismar (not far from Fritzlar),
   and built with the planks an oratory or church of St. Peter. His
   biographer, Willibald, adds that a sudden storm from heaven came to his
   aid and split the oak in four pieces of equal length. This practical
   sermon was the death and burial of German mythology. He received from
   time to time supplies of books, monks and nuns from England. The whole
   church of England took a deep interest in his work, as we learn from
   his correspondence. He founded monastic colonies near Erfurt, Fritzlar,
   Ohrdruf, Bischofsheim, and Homburg. The victory of Charles Martel over
   the Saracens at Tours (732) checked the westward progress of Islâm and
   insured the triumph of Christianity in central Europe.

   Boniface was raised to the dignity of archbishop (without a see) and
   papal legate by the new Pope Gregory III. (732), and thus enabled to
   coerce the refractory bishops.

   In 738 he made his third and last pilgrimage to Rome with a great
   retinue of monks and converts, and received authority to call a synod
   of bishops in Bavaria and Allemannia. On his return he founded, in
   concert with Duke Odilo, four Bavarian bishoprics at Salzburg,
   Freising, Passau, and Ratisbon or Regensburg (739). To these he added
   in central Germany the sees of Würzburg, Buraburg (near Fritzlar),
   Erfurt, Eichstädt (742). He held several synods in Mainz and elsewhere
   for the organization of the churches and the exercise of discipline.
   The number of his baptized converts till 739 is said to have amounted
   to many thousands.

   In 743 he was installed Archbishop of Mainz or Mayence (Moguntum) in
   the place of bishop Gervillius (Gewielieb) who was deposed for
   indulging in sporting propensities and for homicide in battle. His
   diocese extended from Cologne to Strasburg and even to Coire. He would
   have preferred Cologne, but the clergy there feared his disciplinary
   severity. He aided the sons of Charles Martel in reducing the Gallic
   clergy to obedience, exterminating the Keltic element, and
   consolidating the union with Rome.

   In 744, in a council at Soissons, where twenty-three bishops were
   present, his most energetic opponents were condemned. In the same year,
   in the very heart of Germany, he laid the foundation of Fulda, the
   greatest of his monasteries, which became the Monte Casino of Germany.

   In 753 he named Lull or Lullus his successor at Mainz. Laying aside his
   dignities, he became once more an humble missionary, and returned with
   about fifty devoted followers to the field of the baffled labors of his
   youth among the Friesians, where a reaction in favor of heathenism had
   taken place since the death of Willibrord. He planted his tents on the
   banks of the river Borne near Dockum (between Franecker and Groningen),
   waiting for a large number of converts to be confirmed. But, instead of
   that, he was assailed and slain, with his companions, by armed pagans.
   He met the martyr's death with calmness and resignation, June 5, 754 or
   755. His bones were deposited first at Utrecht, then at Mainz, and at
   last in Fulda. Soon after his death, an English Synod chose him,
   together with Pope Gregory and Augustin, patron of the English church.
   In 1875 Pope Pius IX. directed the Catholics of Germany and England to
   invoke especially the aid of St. Boniface in the distress of modern
   times.

   The works of Boniface are epistles and sermons. The former refer to his
   missionary labors and policy, the latter exhibit his theological views
   and practical piety. Fifteen short sermons are preserved, addressed not
   to heathen, but to Christian converts; they reveal therefore not so
   much his missionary as his edifying activity. They are without
   Scripture text, and are either festal discourses explaining the history
   of salvation, especially the fall and redemption of man, or
   catechetical expositions of Christian doctrine and duty. We give as a
   characteristic specimen of the latter, the fifteenth sermon, on the
   renunciation of the devil in baptism:

   Sermon XV.

   "I. Listen, my brethren, and consider well what you have solemnly
   renounced in your baptism. You have renounced the devil and all his
   works, and all his pomp. But what are the works of the devil? They are
   pride, idolatry, envy, murder, calumny, lying, perjury, hatred,
   fornication, adultery, every kind of lewdness, theft, false witness,
   robbery, gluttony, drunkenness, Slander, fight, malice, philters,
   incantations, lots, belief in witches and were-wolves, abortion,
   disobedience to the Master, amulets. These and other such evil things
   are the works of the devil, all of which you have forsworn by your
   baptism, as the apostle says: Whosoever doeth such things deserves
   death, and shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven. But as we believe
   that, by the mercy of God, you will renounce all these things, with
   heart and hand, in order to become fit for grace, I admonish you, my
   dearest brethren, to remember what you have promised Almighty God.

   II. For, first, you have promised to believe in Almighty God, and in
   his Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Spirit, one almighty God in
   perfect trinity.

   III. And these are the commandments which you shall keep and fulfil: to
   love God, whom you profess, with all your heart, all your soul, and all
   your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourselves; for on these
   commandments hang the whole law and the prophets. Be patient, have
   mercy, be benevolent, chaste, pure. Teach your sons to fear God; teach
   your whole family to do so. Make peace where you go, and let him who
   sits in court; give a just verdict and take no presents, for presents
   make even a wise man blind.

   IV. Keep the Sabbath and go to church-to pray, but not to prattle. Give
   alms according to your power, for alms extinguish sins as water does
   fire. Show hospitality to travelers, visit the sick, take care of
   widows and orphans, pay your tithes to the church, and do to nobody
   what you would not have done to yourself. Fear God above all. Let the
   servants be obedient to their masters, and the masters just to their
   servants. Cling to the Lord's Prayer and the Creed, and communicate
   them to your own children and to those whose baptismal sponsors you
   are. Keep the fast, love what is right, stand up against the devil, and
   partake from time to time of the Lord's Supper. Such are the works
   which God commands you to do and fulfil.

   V. Believe in the advent of Christ, the resurrection of the body, and
   the judgment of all men. For then the impious shall be separated from
   the just, the one for the everlasting fire, the others for the eternal
   life. Then begins a life with God without death, a light without
   shadows, a health without sickness, a plenty without hunger, a
   happiness without fear, a joy with no misgivings. Then comes the
   eternal glory, in which the just shall shine like suns, for no eye has
   ever seen, no ear has ever heard, no heart has ever dreamed, of all
   that which God has prepared for those whom he loves.

   VI. I also remind you, my beloved brethren, that the birth-day of our
   Lord is approaching, in order that you may abstain from all that is
   worldly or lewd or impure or bad. Spit out all malice and hatred and
   envy; it is poison to your heart. Keep chaste even with respect to your
   own wives. Clothe yourselves with good works. Give alms to the poor who
   belong to Christ; invite them often to your feasts. Keep peace with
   all, and make peace between those who are at discord. If, with the aid
   of Christ, you will truly fulfil these commands, then in this life you
   can with confidence approach the altar of God, and in the next you
   shall partake of the everlasting bliss." [119]

   Bonifacius combined the zeal and devotion of a missionary with worldly
   prudence and a rare genius for organization and administration. He was
   no profound scholar, but a practical statesman and a strict
   disciplinarian. He was not a theologian, but an ecclesiastic, and would
   have made a good Pope. He selected the best situations for his
   bishoprics and monasteries, and his far-sighted policy has been
   confirmed by history. He was a man of unblemished character and
   untiring energy. He was incessantly active, preaching, traveling,
   presiding over Synods, deciding perplexing questions about heathen
   customs and trivial ceremonies. He wrought no miracles, such as were
   usually expected from a missionary in those days. His disciple and
   biographer apologizes for this defect, and appeals as an offset to the
   invisible cures of souls which he performed. [120]

   The weak spot in his character is the bigotry and intolerance which he
   displayed in his controversy with the independent missionaries of the
   French and Scotch-Irish schools who had done the pioneer work before
   him. He reaped the fruits of their labors, and destroyed their further
   usefulness, which he might have secured by a liberal Christian policy.
   He hated every feature of individuality and national independence in
   matters of the church. To him true Christianity was identical with
   Romanism, and he made Germany as loyal to the Pope as was his native
   England. He served under four Popes, Gregory II., Gregory III.,
   Zacharias, and Stephen, and they could not have had a more devoted and
   faithful agent. Those who labored without papal authority were to him
   dangerous hirelings, thieves and robbers who climbed up some other way.
   He denounced them as false prophets, seducers of the people, idolaters
   and adulterers (because they were married and defended clerical
   marriage). [121] He encountered from them a most determined opposition,
   especially in Bavaria. In connection with his servile Romanism is his
   pedantic legalism and ceremonialism. His epistles and sermons show a
   considerable knowledge of the Bible, but also a contracted legalistic
   spirit. He has much to say about matters of outward conformity to Roman
   authority and usages and about small questions of casuistry, such as
   whether it was right to eat horse flesh, rabbits, storks, meat offered
   to idols, to marry a widow after standing god-father to her son, how
   often the sign of the cross should be made in preaching. In his
   strength and his weakness, his loyalty, to Rome, and in the importance
   of the work he accomplished, he resembled Augustin, the Roman apostle
   of his Anglo-Saxon ancestors.

   Boniface succeeded by indomitable perseverance, and his work survived
   him. This must be his vindication. In judging of him we should remember
   that the controversy between him and his French and Scotch-Irish
   opponents was not a controversy between Catholicism and evangelical
   Protestantism (which was not yet born), but between organized
   Catholicism or Romanism and independent Catholicism. Mediaeval
   Christianity was very weak, and required for its self-preservation a
   strong central power and legal discipline. It is doubtful whether in
   the barbarous condition of those times, and amid the commotions of
   almost constant civil wars, the independent and scattered labors of the
   anti-Roman missionaries could have survived as well and made as strong
   an impression upon the German nation as a consolidated Christianity
   with a common centre of unity, and authority.

   Roman unity was better than undisciplined independency, but it was
   itself only a preparatory school for the self-governing freedom of
   manhood.

   After Boniface had nearly completed his work, a political revolution
   took place in France which gave it outward support. Pepin, the major
   domus of the corrupt Merovingian dynasty, overthrew it with the aid of
   Pope Zacharias, who for his conquest of the troublesome Lombards
   rewarded him with the royal crown of France (753). Fifty years
   afterwards this political alliance of France and Germany with the
   Italian papacy was completed by Charlemagne and Leo III., and lasted
   for many centuries. Rome had the enchantment of distance, the prestige
   of power and culture, and promised to furnish the strongest support to
   new and weak churches. Rome was also the connecting link between
   mediaeval and ancient civilization, and transmitted to the barbarian
   races the treasures of classical literature which in due time led to
   the revival of letters and to the Protestant Reformation.

   [117] One that wins peace. His Latin name Bonifacius, Benefactor, was
   probably his monastic name, or given to him by the pope on his second
   visit to Rome. 723.

   [118] The juramentum of Boniface, which he ever afterwards remembered
   and observed with painful conscientiousness deserves to be quoted in
   full, as it contains his whole missionary policy (see Migne, l.c., p.
   803): "In nomine Domini Dei Salvatoris nostri Jesus Christi, imperante
   domino Leone Magno imperatore, anno 7 post consulatum ejus, sed et
   Constantini Magni imperatoris ejus filii anno 4, indictione 6. Promitto

   princeps vicarioque tuo beato Gregorio papae et successoribus ejus, per
   Patrem et Filium, et Spiritum Sanctum, Trinitatem inseparabilem, et hoc
   sacratissimum corpus tuum, me omnem fidem et puritatem sanctae fidei
   catholicae exhibere, et in unitate ejusdem fidei, Deo operante,
   persistere in quo omnis Christianorum salus esse sine dubio
   comprobatur, nullo modo me contra unitatem communis et universalis
   Ecclesiae, quopiam consentire, sed, ut dixi, fidem et puritatem meam
   atque concursum, tibi et utilitatibus tiae Ecclesiae, cui a Domino Deo

   episcopus manu propria, ita ut praescriptum, Deo teste et judice, feci
   sacramentum, quod et conservare promitto." With all his devotion to the
   Roman See, Boniface was manly and independent enough to complain in a
   letter to Pope Zacharias of the scandalous heathen practices in Rome
   which were reported by travellers and filled the German Christians with
   prejudice and disobedience to Rome. See the letter in Migne, l.c. p.
   746 sqq.

   [121] The description he gives of their immorality, must be taken with
   considerable deduction. In Ep. 49 to Pope Zacharias (a. d.742) in
   Migne, l.c., p. 745, he speaks of deacons, priests and bishops hostile
   to Rome, as being guilty of habitual drunkenness, concubinage, and even
   polygamy. I will only quote what he says of the bishops: "Et
   inveniuntur quidem inter eos episcopi, qui, licet dicant se fornicarios
   vel adulteros non esse, sed sunt ebriosi, et injuriosi, vel venatores,
   et qui pugnant in exercitu armati, et effundunt propria manu sanguinem
   hominum, sive paganorum, sive Christianorum."

   § 26. The Pupils of Boniface. Willibald, Gregory of Utrecht, Sturm of
   Fulda.

   Boniface left behind him a number of devoted disciples who carried on
   his work.

   Among these we mention St. Willibald, the first bishop of Eichstädt. He
   was born about a.d. 700 from a noble Anglo-Saxon family and a near
   relative of Boniface. In his early manhood he made a pilgrimage to Rome
   and to the Holy Land as far as Damascus, spent several years among the
   Benedictines in Monte Casino, met Boniface in Rome, joined him in
   Germany (a.d. 740) and became bishop of Eichstädt in Bavaria in 742. He
   directed his attention chiefly to the founding of monasteries after the
   Benedictine rule. He called to his side his brother Wunnebald, his
   sister Walpurgis, and other helpers from England. He died July 7, 781
   or 787. He is considered by some as the author of the biography of
   Boniface; but it was probably the work of another Willibald, a
   presbyter of Mainz.

   Gregory, Abbot of Utrecht, was related to the royal house of the
   Merovingians, educated at the court, converted in his fifteenth year by
   a sermon of Boniface, and accompanied him on his journeys. After the
   death of Boniface he superintended the mission among the Friesians, but
   declined the episcopal dignity. In his old age he became lame, and was
   carried by his pupils to wherever his presence was desired. He died in
   781, seventy-three years old.

   Sturm, the first Abbot of Fulda (710 to Dec. 17, 779), was of a noble
   Bavarian family and educated by Boniface. With his approval he passed
   with two companions through the dense beech forests of Hesse in pursuit
   of a proper place for a monastery. Singing psalms, he rode on an ass,
   cutting a way through the thicket inhabited by wild beasts; at night
   after saying his prayers and making the sign of the cross he slept on
   the bare ground under the canopy of heaven till sunrise. He met no
   human being except a troupe of heathen slaves who bathed in the river
   Fulda, and afterwards a man with a horse who was well acquainted with
   the country. He found at last a suitable place, and took solemn
   possession of it in 744, after it was presented to him for a monastery
   by Karloman at the request of Boniface, who joined him there with a
   large number of monks, and often resorted to this his favorite
   monastery. "In a vast solitude," he wrote to Pope Zacharias in 751,
   "among the tribes entrusted to my preaching, there is a place where I
   erected a convent and peopled it with monks who live according to the
   rule of St. Benedict in strict abstinence, without flesh and wine,
   without intoxicating drink and slaves, earning their living with their
   own hands. This spot I have rightfully secured from pious men,
   especially from Karloman, the late prince of the Franks, and dedicated
   to the Saviour. There I will occasionally rest my weary limbs, and
   repose in death, continuing faithful to the Roman Church and to the
   people to which I was sent?" [122]

   Fulda received special privileges from Pope Zacharias and his
   successors, [123] and became a centre of German Christianity and
   civilization from which proceeded the clearing of the forests, the
   cultivation of the soil, and the education of youths. The number of
   Benedictine monks was increased by large re-enforcements from Monte
   Casino, after an Italian journey of Sturm in 747. The later years of
   his life were disturbed by a controversy with Lullus of Mainz about the
   bones of Boniface after his martyrdom (755) and by calumniations of
   three monks who brought upon him the displeasure of King Pepin. He was,
   however, reinstated in his dignity and received the remains of his
   beloved teacher which repose in Fulda. Charlemagne employed him as
   missionary among the Saxons. His bones were deposited in the convent
   church. Pope Innocent II. canonized him, A. D, 1139. [124]

   Of all the German tribes the fierce and warlike Saxons were the last to
   accept the Christian religion. They differed in this respect very much
   from their kinsmen who had invaded and conquered England. But the means
   employed were also as different: rude force in one case, moral suasion
   in the other. The Saxons inhabited the districts of modern Hanover,
   Oldenburg, Brunswick, and Westphalia, which were covered with dense
   forests. They had driven the Franks beyond the Weser and the Rhine, and
   they were now driven back in turn by Charles Martel, Pepin, and
   Charlemagne. They hated the foreign yoke of the Franks, and far-off
   Rome; they hated the tithe which was imposed upon them for the support
   of the church. They looked upon Christianity as the enemy of their wild
   liberty and independence. The first efforts of Ewald, Suidbert, and
   other missionaries were fruitless. Their conversion was at last brought
   about by the sword from political as well as religious motives, and was
   at first merely nominal, but resulted finally in a real change under
   the silent influence of the moral forces of the Christian religion.

   Charlemagne, who became master of the French kingdom in 768, had the
   noble ambition to unite the German tribes in one great empire and one
   religion in filial communion with Rome, but he mistook the means. He
   employed material force, believing that people become Christians by
   water-baptism, though baptized against their will. He thought that the
   Saxons, who were the most dangerous enemies of his kingdom, must be
   either subdued and Christianized, or killed. He pursued the same policy
   towards them as the squatter sovereigns would have the United States
   government pursue towards the wild Indians in the Western territories.
   Treaties were broken, and shocking cruelties were committed on both
   sides, by the Saxons from revenge and for independence, by Christians
   for punishment in the name of religion and civilization. Prominent
   among these atrocities is the massacre of four thousand five hundred
   captives at Verden in one day. As soon as the French army was gone, the
   Saxons destroyed the churches and murdered the priests, for which they
   were in turn put to death.

   Their subjugation was a work of thirty-three years, from 772 to 805.
   Widukind (Wittekind) and Albio (Abbio), the two most powerful Saxon
   chiefs, seeing the fruitlessness of the resistance, submitted to
   baptism in 785, with Charlemagne as sponsor. [125]

   But the Saxons were not entirely defeated till 804, when 10,000
   families were driven from house and home and scattered in other
   provinces. Bloody laws prohibited the relapse into heathenism. The
   spirit of national independence was defeated, but not entirely crushed,
   and broke out seven centuries afterwards in another form against the
   Babylonian tyranny of Rome under the lead of the Saxon monk, Martin
   Luther.

   The war of Charlemagne against the Saxons was the first ominous example
   of a bloody crusade for the overthrow of heathenism and the extension
   of the church. It was a radical departure from the apostolic method,
   and diametrically opposed to the spirit of the gospel. This was felt
   even in that age by the more enlightened divines. Alcuin, who
   represents the English school of missionaries, and who expresses in his
   letters great respect and admiration for Charlemagne, modestly
   protested, though without effect, against this wholesale conversion by
   force, and asked him rather to make peace with the "abominable" people
   of the Saxons. He properly held that the heathen should first be
   instructed before they are required to be baptized and to pay tithes;
   that water-baptism without faith was of no use; that baptism implies
   three visible things, namely, the priest, the body, and the water, and
   three invisible things, namely, the Spirit, the soul, and faith; that
   the Holy Spirit regenerates the soul by faith; that faith is a free act
   which cannot be enforced; that instruction, persuasion, love and
   self-denial are the only proper means for converting the heathen. [126]

   Charlemagne relaxed somewhat the severity of his laws or capitularies
   after the year 797. He founded eight bishoprics among the Saxons:
   Osnabrück, Münster, Minden, Paderborn, Verden, Bremen, Hildesheim, and
   Halberstadt. From these bishoprics and the parochial churches grouped
   around them, and from monasteries such as Fulda, proceeded those higher
   and nobler influences which acted on the mind and heart.

   The first monument of real Christianity among the Saxons is the
   "Heliand" (Heiland, i.e., Healer, Saviour) or a harmony of the Gospels.
   It is a religious epos strongly resembling the older work of the
   Anglo-Saxon Caedmon on the Passion and Resurrection. From this it no
   doubt derived its inspiration. For since Bonifacius there was a lively
   intercourse between the church of England and the church in Germany,
   and the language of the two countries was at that time essentially the
   same. In both works Christ appears as the youthful hero of the human
   race, the divine conqueror of the world and the devil, and the
   Christians as his faithful knights and warriors. The Heliand was
   composed in the ninth century by one or more poets whose language
   points to Westphalia as their home. The doctrine is free from the
   worship of saints, the glorification of Peter, and from ascetic
   excesses, but mixed somewhat with mythological reminiscences. Vilmar
   calls it the only real Christian epos, and a wonderful creation of the
   German genius. [127]

   A little later (about 870) Otfried, a Franconian, educated at Fulda and
   St. Gall, produced another poetic harmony of the Gospels, which is one
   of the chief monuments of old high German literature. It is a life of
   Christ from his birth to the ascension, and ends with a description of
   the judgment. It consists of fifteen thousand rhymed lines in strophes
   of four lines.

   Thus the victory of Christianity in Germany as well as it, England, was
   the beginning of poetry and literature, and of true civilization,

   The Christianization of North-Eastern Germany, among the Slavonic
   races, along the Baltic shores in Prussia, Livonia, and Courland, went
   on in the next period, chiefly through Bishop Otto of Bamberg, the
   apostle of Pomerania, and the Knights of the Teutonic order, and was
   completed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

   [125] "Jetzt war Sachsen besiegt," says Giesebrecht (l.c., p. 117),
   "und mit Blutgesetzen worden das Christenthum und das Königthum
   zugliech den Sachsen aufgedrungen. Mit Todesstrafen wurde die Taufe
   erzwungen, die heidnischen Gebräuche bedroht; jede Verletzung eines
   chistlichen Priesters wurde, wie der Aufruhr gegen den König und der
   Ungehorsam gegen seine Befehle, zu einem todeswuerdigen Verbrechen
   gestempelt."

   [126] Neander III. 152 sqq. (Germ, ed.; Torrey's trnsl. III. 76). It
   seems to me, from looking over Alcuin's numerous epistles to the
   emperor, he might have used his influence much more freely with his
   pupil. Merivale says (p. 131): "Alcuin of York, exerted his influence
   upon those Northern missions from the centre of France, in which he had
   planted himself. The purity and simplicity of the English school of
   teachers contrasted favoably with the worldly, character of the
   Frankish priesthood, and Charlemagne himelf was impressed with the
   importance of intrusting the establishment of the Church throughout his
   Northern conquests to these foreigners rather than to his own subjects.
   He appointed the Anglo-Saxon Willibrord to preside over the district of
   Estphalia, and Liudger, a Friesian by birth, but an Englishman by his
   training at York, to organize the church in Westphalia; while he left
   to the earlier foundation of Fulda, which had also received its first
   Christian traditions from the English Boniface and his pupil Sturm, the
   charge of Engern or Angaria. From the teaching of these strangers there
   sprang up a crop of Saxon priests and missionaries; from among the
   youths of noble family whom the conqueror had carried off from their
   homes as hostages, many were selected to be trained in the monasteries
   for the life of monks and preachers. Eventually the Abbey of Corbie,
   near Amiens, was founded by one of the Saxon converts, and became an
   important centre of Christian teaching. From hence sprang the
   daughter-foundation of the New Corbie, or Corby, on the banks of the
   Weser, in the diocese of Paderborn. This abbey received its charter
   from Louis le Debonnaire in 823, and became no less important an
   institution for the propagation of the faith in the north of Germany,
   than Fulda still continued to be in the centre, and St. Gall in the
   South."

   Scandinavia was inhabited by one of the wildest and fiercest, but also
   one of the strongest and most valiant branches of the Teutonic race, a
   people of robbers which grew into a people of conquerors. Speaking the
   same language--that which is still spoken in Iceland--and worshipping
   the same gods, they were split into a number of small kingdoms covering
   the present Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Every spring, when the ice
   broke in the fjords, they launched their boats or skiffs, and swept,
   each swarm under the leadership of its own king, down upon the coasts
   of the neighboring countries. By the rivers they penetrated far into
   the countries, burning and destroying what they could not carry away
   with them. When autumn came, they returned home, loaded with spoil, and
   they spent the winter round the open hearth, devouring their prey. But
   in course of time, the swarms congregated and formed large armies, and
   the robber-campaigns became organized expeditions for conquest;
   kingdoms were founded in Russia, England, France, and Sicily. In their
   new homes, however, the Northern vikings soon forgot both their native
   language and their old gods, and became the strong bearers of new
   departures of civilization and the valiant knights of Christianity.

   In the Scandinavian mythology, there were not a few ideas which the
   Christian missionary could use as connecting links. It was not
   absolutely necessary for him to begin with a mere negation; here, too,
   there was an "unknown God" and many traits indicate that, during the
   eighth and ninth centuries, people throughout Scandinavia became more
   and more anxious to hear something about him. When a man died, he went
   to Walhall, if he had been brave, and to Niflheim, if he had been a
   coward. In Walhall he lived together with the gods, in great brightness
   and joy, fighting all the day, feasting all the night. In Niflheim he
   sat alone, a shadow, surrounded with everything disgusting and
   degrading. But Walhall and Niflheim were not to last forever. A deep
   darkness, Ragnarokr, shall fall over the universe; Walhall and Niflheim
   shall be destroyed by fire; the gods, the heroes, the shadows, shall
   perish. Then a new heaven and a new earth shall be created by the
   All-Father, and he shall judge men not according as they have been
   brave or cowardly, but according as they have been good or bad. From
   the Eddas themseIves, it appears that, throughout Scandinavian
   heathendom, there now and then arose characters who, though they would
   not cease to be brave, longed to be good. The representative of this
   goodness, this dim fore-shadowing of the Christian idea of holiness,
   was Baldur, the young god standing on the rainbow and watching the
   worlds, and he was also the link which held together the whole chain of
   the Walhall gods; when he died, Ragnarokr came.

   A transition from the myth of Baldur to the gospel of Christ cannot
   have been very difficult to the Scandinavian imagination; and, indeed,
   it is apparent that the first ideas which the Scandinavian heathens
   formed of the "White Christ" were influenced by their ideas of Baldur.
   It is a question, however, not yet settled, whether certain parts of
   the Scandinavian mythology, as, for instance, the above myths of
   Ragnarokr and Baldur, are not a reflex of Christian ideas; and it is
   quite probable that when the Scandinavians in the ninth century began
   to look at Christ under the image of Baldur, they had long before
   unconsciously remodeled their idea of Baldur after the image of Christ.

   Another point, of considerable importance to the Christian missionary,
   was that, in Scandinavian heathendom, he had no priesthood to
   encounter. Scandinavian paganism never became an institution. There
   were temples, or at least altars, at Leire, near Roeskilde, in Denmark;
   at Sigtuna, near Upsall, in Sweden, and at Moere, near Drontheim, in
   Norway; and huge sacrifices of ninety-nine horses, ninety-nine cocks,
   and ninety-nine slaves were offered up there every Juul-time. But every
   man was his own priest. At the time when Christianity first appeared in
   Scandinavia, the old religion was evidently losing its hold on the
   individuals and for the very reason, that it had never succeeded in
   laying hold on the nation. People continued to swear by the gods, and
   drink in their honor; but they ceased to pray to them. They continued
   to sacrifice before taking the field or after the victory, and to make
   the sign of the cross, meaning Thor's hammer, over a child when it was
   named; but there was really nothing in their life, national or
   individual, public or private, which demanded religious consecration.
   As, on the one side, characters developed which actually went beyond
   the established religion, longing for something higher and deeper, it
   was, on the other side, still more frequent to meet with characters
   which passed by the established religion with utter indifference,
   believing in nothing but their own strength.

   The principal obstacle which Christianity had to encounter in
   Scandinavia was moral rather than religious. In his passions, the old
   Scandinavian was sometimes worse than a beast. Gluttony and drunkenness
   he considered as accomplishments. But he was chaste. A dishonored woman
   was very seldom heard of, adultery never. In his energy, he was
   sometimes fiercer than a demon. He destroyed for the sake of
   destruction, and there were no indignities or cruelties which he would
   not inflict upon a vanquished enemy. But for his friend, his king, his
   wife, his child, he would sacrifice everything, even life itself; and
   he would do it without a doubt, without a pang, in pure and noble
   enthusiasm. Such, however, as his morals were, they, had absolute sway
   over him. The gods he could forget, but not his duties. The evil one,
   among gods and men, was he who saw the duty, but stole away from it.
   The highest spiritual power among the old Scandinavians, their only
   enthusiasm, was their feeling of duty; but the direction which had been
   given to this feeling was so absolutely opposed to that pointed out by
   the Christian morality, that no reconciliation was possible. Revenge
   was the noblest sentiment and passion of man; forgiveness was a sin.
   The battle-field reeking with blood and fire was the highest beauty the
   earth could show; patient and peaceful labor was an abomination. It was
   quite natural, therefore, that the actual conflict between Christianity
   and Scandinavian paganism should take place in the field of morals. The
   pagans slew the missionaries, and burnt their schools and churches, not
   because they preached new gods, but because they "corrupted the morals
   of the people" (by averting them from their warlike pursuits), and
   when, after a contest of more than a century, it became apparent that
   Christianity would be victorious, the pagan heroes left the country in
   great swarms, as if they were flying from some awful plague. The first
   and hardest work which Christianity had to do in Scandinavia was
   generally humanitarian rather than specifically religious.

   During the sixth and seventh centuries the Danes first came in contact
   with Christianity, partly through their commercial intercourse with
   Duerstede in Holland, partly through their perpetual raids on Ireland;
   and tales of the "White Christ" were frequently told among them, though
   probably with no other effect than that of wonder. The first Christian
   missionary who visited them and worked among them was Willebrord. Born
   in Northumbria and educated within the pale of the Keltic Kirk he went
   out, in 690, as a missionary to the Frises. Expelled by them he came,
   about 700, to Denmark, was well received by king Yngrin (Ogendus),
   formed a congregation and bought thirty Danish boys, whom he educated
   in the Christian religion, and of whom one, Sigwald, is still
   remembered as the patron saint of Nuremberg, St. Sebaldus. But his work
   seems to have been of merely temporary effect.

   Soon, however, the tremendous activity which Charlemagne developed as a
   political organizer, was felt even on the Danish frontier. His realm
   touched the Eyder. Political relations sprang up between the Roman
   empire and Denmark, and they opened a freer and broader entrance to the
   Christian missionaries. In Essehoe, in Holstein, Charlemagne built a
   chapel for the use of the garrison; in Hamburg he settled Heridock as
   the head of a Christian congregation; and from a passage in one of
   Alcuin's letters [128] it appears that a conversion of the Danes did
   not lie altogether outside of his plans. Under his successor, Lewis the
   Pious, Harald Klak, one of the many petty kings among whom Denmark was
   then divided, sought the emperor's support and decision in a family
   feud, and Lewis sent archbishop Ebo of Rheims, celebrated both as a
   political negotiator and as a zealous missionary, to Denmark. In 822
   Ebo crossed the Eyder, accompanied by bishop Halitgar of Cambray. In
   the following years he made several journeys to Denmark, preached,
   baptized, and established a station of the Danish mission at Cella
   Wellana, the present Welnau, near Essehoe. But he was too much occupied
   with the internal affairs of the empire and the opportunity which now
   opened for the Danish mission, demanded the whole and undivided energy
   of a great man. In 826 Harald Klak was expelled and sought refuge with
   the emperor, Ebo acting as a mediator. At Ingelheim, near Mentz, the
   king, the queen, their son and their whole retinue, were solemnly
   baptized, and when Harald shortly after returned to Denmark with
   support from the emperor, he was accompanied by that man who was
   destined to become the Apostle of the North, Ansgar.

   Ansgar was born about 800 (according to general acceptation Sept. 9,
   801) in the diocese of Amiens, of Frankish parents, and educated in the
   abbey of Corbie, under the guidance of Adalhard. Paschasius Radbertus
   was among his teachers. In 822 a missionary colony was planted by
   Corbie in Westphalia, and the German monastery of Corwey or New Corwey
   was founded. Hither Ansgar was removed, as teacher in the new school,
   and he soon acquired great fame both on account of his powers as a
   preacher and on account of his ardent piety. When still a boy he had
   holy visions, and was deeply impressed with the vanity of all earthly
   greatness. The crown of the martyr seemed to him the highest grace
   which human life could attain, and he ardently prayed that it might be
   given to him. The proposition to follow king Harald as a missionary,
   among the heathen Danes he immediately accepted, in spite of the
   remonstrances of his friends, and accompanied by Autbert he repaired,
   in 827, to Denmark, where he immediately established a missionary
   station at Hedeby, in the province of Schleswig. The task was
   difficult, but the beginning was not without success. Twelve young boys
   were bought to be educated as teachers, and not a few people were
   converted and baptized. His kindness to the poor, the sick, to all who
   were in distress, attracted attention; his fervor as a preacher and
   teacher produced sympathy without, as yet, provoking resistance. But in
   829 king Harald was again expelled and retired to Riustri, a possession
   on the mouth of the Weser, which the emperor had given to him as a
   fief. Ansgar was compelled to follow him and the prospects of the
   Danish mission became very dark, the more so as Autbert had to give up
   any further participation in the work on account of ill health, and
   return to New Corwey. At this time an invitation from the Swedish king,
   Björn, gave Ansgar an opportunity to visit Sweden, and he stayed there
   till 831, when the establishment of an episcopal see at Hamburg,
   determined upon by the diet of Aix-le-chapelle in 831, promised to give
   the Danish mission a new impulse. All Scandinavia was laid under the
   new see, and Ansgar was consecrated its first bishop by bishop Drago of
   Metz, a brother of the emperor, with the solemn assistance of three
   archbishops, Ebo of Rheims, Hetti of Treves and Obgar of Mentz. A bull
   of Gregory IV. [129] confirmed the whole arrangement, and Ansgar
   received personally the pallium from the hands of the Pope. In 834 the
   emperor endowed the see with the rich monastery of Thorout, in West
   Flanders, south of Bruges, and the work of the Danish mission could now
   be pushed with vigor. Enabled to treat with the petty kings of Denmark
   on terms of equality, and possessed of means to impress them with the
   importance of the cause, Ansgar made rapid progress, but, as was to be
   expected, the progress soon awakened opposition. In 834 a swarm of
   heathen Danes penetrated with a fleet of six hundred small vessels into
   the Elb under the command of king Horich I., and laid siege to Hamburg.
   The city was taken, sacked and burnt; the church which Ansgar had
   built, the monastery in which he lived, his library containing a copy
   of the Bible which the emperor had presented to him, etc., were
   destroyed and the Christians were driven away from the place. For many
   days Ansgar fled from hiding-place to hiding-place in imminent danger
   of his life. He sought refuge with the bishop of Bremen, but the bishop
   of Bremen was jealous, because Scandinavia had not been laid under his
   see, and refused to give any assistance. The revenues of Thorout he
   lost, as the emperor, Charles the Bald, gave the fief to one of his
   favorites. Even his own pupils deserted him.

   In this great emergency his character shone forth in all its strength
   and splendor; he bore what God laid upon him in silence and made no
   complaint. Meanwhile Lewis the German came to his support. In 846 the
   see of Bremen became vacant. The see of Hamburg was then united to that
   of Bremen, and to this new see, which Ansgar was called to fill, a
   papal bull of May 31, 864, gave archiepiscopal rank. Installed in
   Bremen, Ansgar immediately took up again the Danish mission and again
   with success. He won even king Horich himself for the Christian cause,
   and obtained permission from him to build a church in Hedeby, the first
   Christian church in Denmark, dedicated to Our Lady. Under king Horich's
   son this church was allowed to have bells, a particular horror to the
   heathens, and a new and larger church was commenced in Ribe. By
   Ansgar's activity Christianity became an established and acknowledged
   institution in Denmark, and not only in Denmark but also in Sweden,
   which he visited once more, 848-850.

   The principal feature of his spiritual character was ascetic severity;
   he wore a coarse hair-shirt close to the skin, fasted much and spent
   most of his time in prayer. But with this asceticism he connected a
   great deal of practical energy; he rebuked the idleness of the monks,
   demanded of his pupils that they should have some actual work at hand,
   and was often occupied in knitting, while praying. His enthusiasm and
   holy raptures were also singularly well-tempered by good common sense.
   To those who wished to extol his greatness and goodness by ascribing
   miracles to him, he said that the greatest miracle in his life would
   be, if God ever made a thoroughly pious man out of him. [130] Most
   prominent, however, among the spiritual features of his character
   shines forth his unwavering faith in the final success of his cause and
   the never-failing patience with which this faith fortified his soul. In
   spite of apparent failure he never gave up his work; overwhelmed with
   disaster, he still continued it. From his death-bed he wrote a letter
   to king Lewis to recommend to him the Scandinavian mission. Other
   missionaries may have excelled him in sagacity and organizing talent,
   but none in heroic patience and humility. He died at Bremen, Feb. 3,
   865, and lies buried there in the church dedicated to him. He was
   canonized by Nicholas I.

   Ansgar's successor in the archiepiscopal see of Hamburg-Bremen was his
   friend and biographer, Rimbert, 865-888. In his time all the petty
   kingdoms into which Denmark was divided, were gathered together under
   one sceptre by King Gorm the Old; but this event, in one respect very
   favorable to the rapid spread of Christianity, was in other respects a
   real obstacle to the Christian cause as it placed Denmark, politically,
   in opposition to Germany, which was the basis and only support of the
   Christian mission to Denmark. King Gorm himself was a grim heathen; but
   his queen, Thyra Danabod, had embraced Christianity, and both under
   Rimbert and his successor, Adalgar, 888-909, the Christian missionaries
   were allowed to work undisturbed. A new church, the third in Denmark,
   was built at Aarhus. But under Adalgar's successor, Unni, 909-936, King
   Gorm's fury, half political and half religious, suddenly burst forth.
   The churches were burnt, the missionaries were killed or expelled, and
   nothing but the decisive victory of Henry the Fowler, king of Germany,
   over the Danish king saved the Christians in Denmark from complete
   extermination. By the peace it was agreed that King Gorm should allow
   the preaching of Christianity in his realm, and Unni took up the cause
   again with great energy. Between Unni's successor, Adaldag, 936-988,
   and King Harald Blue Tooth, a son of Gorm the Old, there grew up a
   relation which almost might be called a co-operation. Around the three
   churches in Jutland: Schleswig, Ribe and Aarhus, and a fourth in Fünen:
   Odense, bishoprics were formed, and Adaldag consecrated four native
   bishops. The church obtained right to accept and hold donations, and
   instances of very large endowments occurred.

   The war between King Harald and the German king, Otto II., arose from
   merely political causes, but led to the baptism of the former, and soon
   after the royal residence was moved from Leire, one of the chief
   centres of Scandinavian heathendom, to Roeskilde, where a Christian
   church was built. Among the Danes, however, there was a large party
   which was very ill-pleased at this turn of affairs. They were heathens
   because heathenism was the only religion which suited their passions.
   They clung to Thor, not from conviction, but from pride. They looked
   down with indignation and dismay upon the transformation which
   Christianity everywhere effected both of the character and the life of
   the people. Finally they left the country and settled under the
   leadership of Palnatoke, at the mouth of the Oder, where they founded a
   kind of republic, Jomsborg.

   From this place they waged a continuous war upon Christianity in
   Denmark for more than a decade, and with dreadful effect. The names of
   the martyrs would fill a whole volume, says Adam of Bremen. The church
   in Roeskilde was burnt. The bishopric of Fünen was abolished. The
   king's own son, Swen, was one of the leaders, and the king himself was
   finally shot by Palnatoke, 991. Swen, however, soon fell out with the
   Joms vikings, and his invasion of England gave the warlike passions of
   the nation another direction.

   From the conquest of that country and its union with Denmark, the
   Danish mission received a vigorous impulse. King Swen himself was
   converted, and showed great zeal for Christianity. He rebuilt the
   church in Roeskilde, erected a new church at Lund, in Skaane, placed
   the sign of the cross on his coins, and exhorted, on his death-bed, his
   son Canute to work for the Christianization of Denmark. The ardor of
   the Hamburg-Bremen archbishops for the Danish mission seemed at this
   time to have cooled, or perhaps the growing difference between the
   language spoken to the north of the Eyder and that spoken to the south
   of that river made missionary work in Denmark very difficult for a
   German preacher. Ansgar had not felt this difference; but two centuries
   later it had probably become necessary for the German missionary to
   learn a foreign language before entering on his work in Denmark.

   Between England and Denmark there existed no such difference of
   language. King Canute the Great, during whose reign (1019-1035) the
   conversion of Denmark was completed, could employ English priests and
   monks in Denmark without the least embarrassment. He re-established the
   bishopric of Fünen, and founded two new bishoprics in Sealand and
   Skaane; and these three sees were filled with Englishmen consecrated by
   the archbishop of Canterbury. He invited a number of English monks to
   Denmark, and settled them partly as ecclesiastics at the churches,
   partly in small missionary stations, scattered all around in the
   country; and everywhere, in the style of the church-building and in the
   character of the service the English influence was predominating. This
   circumstance, however, did in no way affect the ecclesiastical relation
   between Denmark and the archiepiscopal see of Hamburg-Bremen. The
   authority of the archbishop, though not altogether unassailed, was
   nevertheless generally submitted to with good grace, and until in the
   twelfth century an independent Scandinavian archbishopric was
   established at Lund, with the exception of the above cases, he always
   appointed and consecrated the Danish bishops. Also the relation to the
   Pope was very cordial. Canute made a pilgrimage to Rome, and founded
   several Hospitia Danorum there. He refused, however, to permit the
   introduction of the Peter's pence in Denmark, and the tribute which, up
   to the fourteenth century, was annually sent from that country to Rome,
   was considered a voluntary gift.

   The last part of Denmark which was converted was the island of
   Bornholm. It was christianized in 1060 by Bishop Egius of Lund. It is
   noticeable, however, that in Denmark Christianity was not made a part
   of the law of the land, such as was the case in England and in Norway.

   Just when the expulsion of Harald Klak compelled Ansgar to give up the
   Danish mission, at least for the time being, an embassy was sent by the
   Swedish king, Björn, to the emperor, Lewis the Pious, asking him to
   send Christian missionaries to Sweden. Like the Danes, the Swedes had
   become acquainted with Christianity through their wars and commercial
   connections with foreign countries, and with many this acquaintance
   appears to have awakened an actual desire to become Christians.
   Accordingly Ansgar went to Sweden in 829, accompanied by Witmar. While
   crossing the Baltic, the vessel was overtaken and plundered by pirates,
   and he arrived empty handed, not to say destitute, at Björkö or Birka,
   the residence of King Björn, situated on an island in the Maelarn.
   Although poverty, and misery were very poor introduction to a heathen
   king in ancient Scandinavia, he was well received by the king; and in
   Hergeir, one of the most prominent men at the court of Birka, he found
   a warm and reliable friend. Hergeir built the first Christian chapel in
   Sweden, and during his whole life he proved an unfailing and powerful
   support of the Christian cause. After two years' successful labor,
   Ansgar returned to Germany; but he did not forget the work begun. As
   soon as he was well established as bishop in Hamburg, he sent, in 834,
   Gautbert, a nephew of Ebo, to Sweden, accompanied by Nithard and a
   number of other Christian priests, and well provided with everything
   necessary for the work. Gautbert labored with great success. In Birka
   he built a church, and thus it became possible for the Christians,
   scattered all over Sweden, to celebrate service and partake of the
   Lord's Supper in their own country without going to Duerstede or some
   other foreign place. But here, as in Denmark, the success of the
   Christian mission aroused the jealousy and hatred of the heathen, and,
   at last, even Hergeir was not able to keep them within bounds. An
   infuriated swarm broke into the house of Gautbert. The house was
   plundered; Nithard was murdered; the church was burnt, and Gautbert
   himself was sent in chains beyond the frontier. He never returned to
   Sweden, but died as bishop of Osnabrück, shortly before Ansgar. When
   Ansgar first heard of the outbreak in Sweden, he was himself flying
   before the fury of the Danish heathen, and for several years he was
   unable to do anything for the Swedish mission. Ardgar, a former hermit,
   now a priest, went to Sweden, and in Birka he found that Hergeir had
   succeeded in keeping together and defending the Christian congregation;
   but Hergeir died shortly after, and with him fell the last defence
   against the attacks of the heathen and barbarians.

   Meanwhile Ansgar had been established in the archiepiscopal see of
   Hamburg-Bremen. In 848, he determined to go himself to Sweden. The
   costly presents he gave to king Olaf, the urgent letters he brought
   from the emperor, and the king of Denmark, the magnificence and
   solemnity of the appearance of the mission made a deep impression. The
   king promised that the question should be laid before the assembled
   people, whether or not they would allow Christianity to be preached
   again in the country. In the assembly it was the address of an old
   Swede, proving that the god of the Christians was stronger even than
   Thor, and that it was poor policy for a nation not to have the
   strongest god, which finally turned the scales, and once more the
   Christian missionaries were allowed to preach undisturbed in the
   country, . Before Ansgar left, in 850, the church was rebuilt in Birka,
   and, for a number of years, the missionary labor was continued with
   great zeal by Erimbert, a nephew of Gautbert, by Ansfrid, born a Dane,
   and by Rimbert, also a Dane.

   Nevertheless, although the persecutions ceased, Christianity made
   little progress, and when, in 935, Archbishop Unni himself visited
   Birka, his principal labor consisted in bringing back to the Christian
   fold such members as had strayed away among the heathen, and forgotten
   their faith. Half a century later, however, during the reign of Olaf
   Skotkonge, the mission received a vigorous impulse. The king himself
   and his sons were won for the Christian cause, and from Denmark a
   number of English missionaries entered the country. The most prominent
   among these was Sigfrid, who has been mentioned beside Ansgar as the
   apostle of the North. By his exertions many were converted, and
   Christianity became a legally recognized religion in the country beside
   the old heathenism. In the Southern part of Sweden, heathen sacrifices
   ceased, and heathen altars disappeared. In the Northern part, however,
   the old faith still continued to live on, partly because it was
   difficult for the missionaries to penetrate into those wild and
   forbidding regions, partly because there existed a difference of tribe
   between the Northern and Southern Swedes, which again gave rise to
   political differences.

   The Christianization of Sweden was not completed until the middle of
   the twelfth century.

   Christianity was introduced in Norway almost exclusively by the
   exertions of the kings, and the means employed were chiefly violence
   and tricks. The people accepted Christianity not because they had
   become acquainted with it and felt a craving for it, but because they
   were compelled to accept it, and the result was that heathen customs
   and heathen ideas lived on in Christian Norway for centuries after they
   had disappeared from the rest of Scandinavia.

   The first attempt to introduce Christianity in the country was made in
   the middle of the tenth century by Hakon the Good. Norway was gathered
   into one state in the latter part of the ninth century by Harald
   Haarfagr, but internal wars broke out again under Harald's son and
   successor, Eric. These troubles induced Hakon, an illegitimate son of
   Harald Haarfagr and educated in England at the court of king Athelstan,
   to return to Norway and lay claim to the crown. He succeeded in gaining
   a party in his favor, expelled Eric and conquered all Norway, where he
   soon became exceedingly popular, partly on account of his valor and
   military ability, partly also on account of the refinement and suavity
   of his manners. Hakon was a Christian, and the Christianization of
   Norway seems to have been his highest goal from the very first days of
   his reign. But he was prudent. Without attracting any great attention
   to the matter, he won over to Christianity a number of those who stood
   nearest to him, called Christian priests from England, and built a
   church at Drontheim. Meanwhile he began to think that the time had come
   for a more public and more decisive step, and at the great Frostething,
   where all the most prominent men of the country were assembled, he
   addressed the people on the matter and exhorted them to become
   Christians. The answer he received was very characteristic. They had no
   objection to Christianity itself, for they did not know what it meant,
   but they suspected the king's proposition, as if it were a political
   stratagem by means of which he intended to defraud them of their
   political rights and liberties. Thus they not only refused to become
   Christians themselves, but even compelled the king to partake in their
   heathen festivals and offer sacrifices to their heathen gods. The king
   was very indignant and determined to take revenge, but just as he had
   got an army together, the sons of the expelled Eric landed in Norway
   and in the battle against them, 961, he received a deadly wound.

   The sons of Eric, who had lived in England during their exile, were
   likewise Christians, and they took up the cause of Christianity in a
   very high-handed manner, overthrowing the heathen altars and forbidding
   sacrifices. But the impression they made was merely odious, and their
   successor, Hakon Jarl, was a rank heathen. The first time Christianity
   really gained a footing in Norway, was under Olaf Trygveson. Descended
   from Harald Haarfagr, but sold, while a child, as a slave in Esthonia,
   he was ransomed by a relative who incidentally met him and recognized
   his own kin in the beauty of the boy, and was educated at Moscow.
   Afterwards he roved about much in Denmark, Wendland, England and
   Ireland, living as a sea-king. In England he became acquainted with
   Christianity and immediately embraced it, but he carried his
   viking-nature almost unchanged over into Christianity, and a fiercer
   knight of the cross was probably never seen. Invited to Norway by a
   party which had grown impatient of the tyranny of Hakon Jarl, he easily
   made himself master of the country, in 995, and immediately set about
   making Christianity its religion, "punishing severely," as Snorre says,
   "all who opposed him, killing some, mutilating others, and driving the
   rest into banishment." In the Southern part there still lingered a
   remembrance of Christianity from the days of Hakon the Good, and things
   went on here somewhat more smoothly, though Olaf more than once gave
   the people assembled in council with him the choice between fighting
   him or accepting baptism forthwith. But in the Northern part all the
   craft and all the energy of the king were needed in order to overcome
   the opposition. Once, at a great heathen festival at Moere, he told the
   assembled people that, if he should return to the heathen gods it would
   be necessary for him to make some great and awful sacrifice, and
   accordingly he seized twelve of the most prominent men present and
   prepared to sacrifice them to Thor. They were rescued, however, when
   the whole assembly accepted Christianity and were baptized. In the year
   1000, he fell in a battle against the united Danish and Swedish kings,
   but though he reigned only five years, he nevertheless succeeded in
   establishing Christianity as the religion of Norway and, what is still
   more remarkable, no general relapse into heathenism seems to have taken
   place after his death.

   During the reign of Olaf the Saint, who ruled from a.d. 1014-'30, the
   Christianization of the country was completed. His task it was to
   uproot heathenism wherever it was still found lurking, and to give the
   Christian religion an ecclesiastical organization. Like his
   predecessors, he used craft and violence to reach his goal. Heathen
   idols and altars disappeared, heathen customs and festivals were
   suppressed, the civil laws were brought into conformity with the rules
   of Christian morals. The country was divided into dioceses and
   parishes, churches were built, and regular revenues were raised for the
   sustenance of the clergy. For the most part he employed English monks
   and priests, but with the consent of the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen,
   under whose authority he placed the Norwegian church. After his death,
   in the battle of Stiklestad, July 29, 1030, he was canonized and became
   the patron saint of Norway.

   To Norway belonged, at that time, Iceland. From Icelandic tradition as
   well as from the "De Mensura Orbis" by Dicuilus, an Irish monk in the
   beginning of the ninth century, it appears that Culdee anchorites used
   to retire to Iceland as early as the beginning of the eighth century,
   while the island was still uninhabited. These anchorites, however, seem
   to have had no influence whatever on the Norwegian settlers who, flying
   from the tyranny of Harald Haarfagr, came to Iceland in the latter part
   of the ninth century and began to people the country. The new-comers
   were heathen, and they looked with amazement at Auda the Rich, the
   widow of Olaf the White, king of Dublin, who in 892 took up her abode
   in Iceland and reared a lofty cross in front of her house. But the
   Icelanders were great travellers, and one of them, Thorvald Kodranson,
   who in Saxony had embraced Christianity, brought bishop Frederic home
   to Iceland. Frederic stayed there for four years, and his preaching
   found easy access among the people. The mission of Thangbrand in the
   latter part of the tenth century failed, but when Norway, or at least
   the Norwegian coast, became Christian, the intimate relation between
   Iceland and Norway soon brought the germs which Frederic had planted,
   into rapid growth, and in the year 1000 the Icelandic Althing declared
   Christianity to be the established religion of the country. The first
   church was built shortly after from timber sent by Olaf the Saint from
   Norway to the treeless island.

   IV. THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF THE SLAVS.

   At what time the Slavs first made their appearance in Europe is not
   known. Latin and Greek writers of the second half of the sixth century,
   such as Procopius, Jornandes, Agathias, the emperor Mauritius and
   others, knew only those Slavs who lived along the frontiers of the
   Roman empire. In the era of Charlemagne the Slavs occupied the whole of
   Eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Balkan; the Obotrites and Wends
   between the Elbe and the Vistula; the Poles around the Vistula, and
   behind them the Russians; the Czechs in Bohemia. Further to the South
   the compact mass of Slavs was split by the invasion of various Finnish
   or Turanian tribes; the Huns in the fifth century, the Avars in the
   sixth, the Bulgarians in the seventh, the Magyars in the ninth. The
   Avars penetrated to the Adriatic, but were thrown back in 640 by the
   Bulgarians; they then settled in Panonia, were subdued and converted by
   Charlemagne, 791-796, and disappeared altogether from history in the
   ninth century. The Bulgarians adopted the Slavic language and became
   Slavs, not only in language, but also in customs and habits. Only the
   Magyars, who settled around the Theiss and the Danube, and are the
   ruling race in Hungary, vindicated themselves as a distinct
   nationality.

   The great mass of Slavs had no common political organization, but
   formed a number of kingdoms, which flourished, some for a shorter, and
   others for a longer period, such as Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland,
   and Russia. In a religious respect also great differences existed among
   them. They were agriculturists, and their gods were representatives of
   natural forces; but while Radigost and Sviatovit, worshipped by the
   Obotrites and Wends, were cruel gods, in whose temples, especially at
   Arcona in the island of Rügen, human beings were sacrificed, Svarog
   worshipped by the Poles, and Dazhbog, worshipped by the Bohemians, were
   mild gods, who demanded love and prayer. Common to all Slavs, however,
   was a very elaborate belief in fairies and trolls; and polygamy,
   sometimes connected with sutteeism, widely prevailed among them. Their
   conversion was attempted both by Constantinople and by Rome; but the
   chaotic and ever-shifting political conditions under which they lived,
   the rising difference and jealousy between the Eastern and Western
   churches, and the great difficulty which the missionaries experienced
   in learning their language, presented formidable obstacles, and at the
   close of the period the work was not yet completed.

   Charlemagne was the first who attempted to introduce Christianity among
   the Slavic tribes which, under the collective name of Wends, occupied
   the Northern part of Germany, along the coast of the Baltic, from the
   mouth of the Elbe to the Vistula: Wagrians in Holstein, Obotrites in
   Mecklenburg, Sorbians on the Saxon boundary, Wilzians in Brandenburg,
   etc. But in the hands of Charlemagne, the Christian mission was a
   political weapon; and to the Slavs, acceptation of Christianity became
   synonymous with political and national subjugation. Hence their fury
   against Christianity which, time after time, broke forth, volcano-like,
   and completely destroyed the work of the missionaries. The decisive
   victories which Otto I. gained over the Wends, gave him an opportunity
   to attempt, on a large scale, the establishment of the Christian church
   among them. Episcopal sees were founded at Havelberg in 946, at
   Altenburg or Oldenburg in 948, at Meissen, Merseburg, and Zeitz in 968,
   and in the last year an archiepiscopal see was founded at Magdeburg.
   Boso, a monk from St. Emmeran, at Regensburg, who first had translated
   the formulas of the liturgy into the language of the natives, became
   bishop of Merseburg, and Adalbert, who first had preached Christianity
   in the island of Rügen, became archbishop.

   But again the Christian church was used as a means for political
   purposes, and, in the reign of Otto II., a fearful rising took place
   among the Wends under the leadership of Prince Mistiwoi. He had become
   a Christian himself; but, indignant at the suppression which was
   practiced in the name of the Christian religion, he returned to
   heathenism, assembled the tribes at Rethre, one of the chief centres of
   Wendish heathendom, and began, in 983, a war which spread devastation
   all over Northern Germany. The churches and monasteries were burnt, and
   the Christian priests were expelled. Afterwards Mistiwoi was seized
   with remorse, and tried to cure the evil he had done in an outburst of
   passion. But then his subjects abandoned him; he left the country, and
   spent the last days of his life in a Christian monastery at Bardewick.
   His grandson, Gottschalk, whose Slavic name is unknown, was educated in
   the Christian faith in the monastery of St. Michael., near Lüneburg;
   but when he heard that his father, Uto, had been murdered, 1032, the
   old heathen instincts of revenge at once awakened within him. He left
   the monastery, abandoned Christianity, and raised a storm of
   persecution against the Christians, which swept over all Brandenburg,
   Mecklenburg, and Holstein. Defeated and taken prisoner by Bernard of
   Lower Saxony, he returned to Christianity; lived afterwards at the
   court of Canute the Great in Denmark and England; married a Danish
   princess, and was made ruler of the Obotrites. A great warrior, he
   conquered Holstein and Pommerania, and formed a powerful Wendish
   empire; and on this solid political foundation, he attempted, with
   considerable success, to build up the Christian church. The old
   bishoprics were re-established, and new ones were founded at Razzeburg
   and Mecklenburg; monasteries were built at Leuzen, Oldenburg,
   Razzeburg, Lübeck, and Mecklenburg; missionaries were provided by
   Adalbert, archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen; the liturgy was translated into
   the native tongue, and revenues were raised for the support of the
   clergy, the churches, and the service.

   But, as might have been expected, the deeper Christianity penetrated
   into the mass of the people, the fiercer became the resistance of the
   heathen. Gottschalk was murdered at Lentz, June 7, 1066, together with
   his old teacher, Abbot Uppo, and a general rising now took place. The
   churches and schools were destroyed; the priests and monks were stoned
   or killed as sacrifices on the heathen altars; and Christianity, was
   literally swept out of the country. It took several decades before a
   new beginning could be made, and the final Christianization of the
   Wends was not achieved until the middle of the twelfth century.

   German translation, Mitau, 1847); J. E. Biley (Prague, 1863); Dümmler
   and F. Milkosisch (Wien, 1870).

   The Moravian Slavs were subjugated by Charlemagne, and the bishop of
   Passau was charged with the establishment of a Christian mission among
   them. Moymir, their chief, was converted and bishoprics were founded at
   Olmütz and Nitra. But Lewis the German suspected Moymir of striving
   after independence and supplanted him by Rastislaw or Radislaw.
   Rastislaw, however, accomplished what Moymir had only been suspected
   of. He formed an independent Moravian kingdom and defeated Lewis the
   German, and with the political he also broke the ecclesiastical
   connections with Germany, requesting the Byzantine emperor, Michael
   III., to send him some Greek missionaries.

   Cyrillus and Methodius became the apostles of the Slavs. Cyrillus,
   whose original name was Constantinus, was born at Thessalonica, in the
   first half of the ninth century, and studied philosophy in
   Constantinople, whence his by-name: the philosopher. Afterwards he
   devoted himself to the study of theology, and went to live, together
   with his brother Methodius, in a monastery. A strong ascetic, he became
   a zealous missionary. In 860 he visited the Chazares, a Tartar tribe
   settled on the North-Eastern shore of the Black Sea, and planted a
   Christian church there. He afterward labored among the Bulgarians and
   finally went, in company with his brother, to Moravia, on the
   invitation of Rastislaw, in 863.

   Cyrillus understood the Slavic language, and succeeded in making it
   available for literary purposes by inventing a suitable alphabet. He
   used Greek letters, with some Armenian and Hebrew, and some original
   letters. His Slavonic alphabet is still used with alterations in
   Russia, Wallachia, Moldavia, Bulgaria, and Servia. He translated the
   liturgy and the pericopes into Slavic, and his ability to preach and
   celebrate service in the native language soon brought hundreds of
   converts into his fold. A national Slavic church rapidly arose; the
   German priests with the Latin liturgy left the country. It corresponded
   well with the political plans of Rastislaw, to have a church
   establishment entirely independent of the German prelates, but in the
   difference which now developed between the Eastern and Western
   churches, it was quite natural for the young Slavic church to connect
   itself with Rome and not with Constantinople, partly because Cyrillus
   always had shown a kind of partiality to Rome, partly because the
   prudence and discrimination with which Pope Nicholas I. recently had
   interfered in the Bulgarian church, must have made a good impression.

   In 868 Cyrillus and Methodius went to Rome, and a perfect agreement was
   arrived at between them and Pope Adrian II., both with respect to the
   use of the Slavic language in religious service and with respect to the
   independent position of the Slavic church, subject only to the
   authority of the Pope. Cyrillus died in Rome, Feb. 14, 869, but
   Methodius returned to Moravia, having been consecrated archbishop of
   the Pannonian diocese.

   The organization of this new diocese of Pannonia was, to some extent,
   an encroachment on the dioceses of Passau and Salzburg, and such an
   encroachment must have been so much the more irritating to the German
   prelates, as they really had been the first to sow the seed of
   Christianity among the Slavs. The growing difference between the
   Eastern and Western churches also had its effect. The German clergy
   considered the use of the Slavic language in the mass an unwarranted
   innovation, and the Greek doctrine of the single procession of the Holy
   Spirit, still adhered to by Methodius and the Slavic church, they
   considered as a heresy. Their attacks, however, had at first no
   practical consequences, but when Rastislaw was succeeded in 870 by
   Swatopluk, and Adrian II. in 872 by John VIII., the position of
   Methodius became difficult. Once more, in 879, he was summoned to Rome,
   and although, this time too, a perfect agreement was arrived at, by
   which the independence of the Slavic church was confirmed, and all her
   natural peculiarities were acknowledged, neither the energy of
   Methodius, nor the support of the Pope was able to defend her against
   the attacks which now were made upon her both from without and from
   within. Swatopluk inclined towards the German-Roman views, and Wichin
   one of Methodius's bishops, became their powerful champion.

   After the death of Swatopluk, the Moravian kingdom fell to pieces and
   was divided between the Germans, the Czechs of Bohemia, and the Magyars
   of Hungary; and thereby the Slavic church lost, so to speak, its very
   foundation. Methodius died between 881 and 910. At the opening of the
   tenth century the Slavic church had entirely lost its national
   character. The Slavic priests were expelled and the Slavic liturgy
   abolished, German priests and the Latin liturgy taking their place. The
   expelled priests fled to Bulgaria, whither they brought the Slavic
   translations of the Bible and the liturgy.

   Neither Charlemagne nor Lewis the Pious succeeded in subjugating
   Bohemia, and although the country was added to the diocese of
   Regensburg, the inhabitants remained pagans. But when Bohemia became a
   dependency of the Moravian empire and Swatopluk married a daughter of
   the Bohemian duke, Borziwai, a door was opened to Christianity.
   Borziwai and his wife, Ludmilla, were baptized, and their children were
   educated in the Christian faith. Nevertheless, when Wratislav,
   Borziwai's son and successor, died in 925, a violent reaction took
   place. He left two sons, Wenzeslav and Boleslav, who were placed under
   the tutelage of their grandmother, Ludmilla. But their mother,
   Drahomira, was an inveterate heathen, and she caused the murder first
   of Ludmilla, and then of Wenzeslav, 938. Boleslav, surnamed the Cruel,
   had his mother's nature and also her faith, and he almost succeeded in
   sweeping Christianity out of Bohemia. But in 950 he was utterly
   defeated by the emperor, Otto I., and compelled not only to admit the
   Christian priests into the country, but also to rebuild the churches
   which had been destroyed, and this misfortune seems actually to have
   changed his mind. He now became, if not friendly, at least forbearing
   to his Christian subjects, and, during the reign of his son and
   successor, Boleslav the Mild, the Christian Church progressed so far in
   Bohemia that an independent archbishopric was founded in Prague. The
   mass of the people, however, still remained barbarous, and heathenish
   customs and ideas lingered among them for more than a century.
   Adalbert, archbishop of Prague, from 983 to 997, [131] preached against
   polygamy, the trade in Christian slaves, chiefly carried on by the
   Jews, but in vain. Twice he left his see, disgusted and discouraged;
   finally he was martyred by the Prussian Wends. Not until 1038
   archbishop Severus succeeded in enforcing laws concerning marriage, the
   celebration of the Lord's Day, and other points of Christian morals.
   About the contest between the Romano-Slavic and the Romano-Germanic
   churches in Bohemia, nothing is known. Legend tells that Methodius
   himself baptized Borziwai and Ludmilla, and the first missionary, work
   was, no doubt, done by Slavic priests, but at the time of Adalbert the
   Germanic tendency was prevailing.

   Also among the Poles the Gospel was first preached by Slavic
   missionaries, and Cyrillus and Methodius are celebrated in the Polish
   liturgy [132] as the apostles of the country. As the Moravian empire
   under Rastislaw comprised vast regions which afterward belonged to the
   kingdom of Poland, it is only natural that the movement started by
   Cyrillus and Methodius should have reached also these regions, and the
   name of at least one Slavic missionary among the Poles, Wiznach, is
   known to history.

   After the breaking up of the Moravian kingdom, Moravian nobles and
   priests sought refuge in Poland, and during the reign of duke Semovit
   Christianity had become so powerful among the Poles, that it began to
   excite the jealousy of the pagans, and a violent contest took place. By
   the marriage between Duke Mieczyslav and the Bohemian princess
   Dombrowka, a sister of Boleslav the Mild, the influence of Christianity
   became still stronger. Dombrowka brought a number of Bohemian priests
   with her to Poland, 965, and in the following year Mieczyslav himself
   was converted and baptized. With characteristic arrogance he simply
   demanded that all his subjects should follow his example, and the pagan
   idols were now burnt or thrown into the river, pagan sacrifices were
   forbidden and severely punished, and Christian churches were built. So
   far the introduction of Christianity among the Poles was entirely due
   to Slavic influences, but at this time the close political connection
   between Duke Mieczyslav and Otto I. opened the way for a powerful
   German influence. Mieczyslav borrowed the whole organization of the
   Polish church from Germany. It was on the advice of Otto I. that he
   founded the first Polish bishopric at Posen and placed it under the
   authority of the archbishop of Magdeburg. German priests, representing
   Roman doctrines and rites, and using the Latin language, began to work
   beside the Slavic priests who represented Greek doctrines and rites and
   used the native language, and when finally the Polish church was placed
   wholly under the authority of Rome, this was not due to any spontaneous
   movement within the church itself, such as Polish chroniclers like to
   represent it, but to the influence of the German emperor and the German
   church. Under Mieczyslav's son, Boleslav Chrobry, the first king of
   Poland and one of the most brilliant heroes of Polish history, Poland,
   although christianized only on the surface, became itself the basis for
   missionary labor among other Slavic tribes.

   It was Boleslav who sent Adalbert of Prague among the Wends, and when
   Adalbert here was pitifully martyred, Boleslav ransomed his remains,
   had them buried at Gnesen (whence they afterwards were carried to
   Prague), and founded here an archiepiscopal see, around which the
   Polish church was finally consolidated. The Christian mission, however,
   was in the hands of Boleslav, just as it often had been in the hands of
   the German emperors, and sometimes even in the hands of the Pope
   himself, nothing but a political weapon. The mass of the population of
   his own realm was still pagan in their very hearts. Annually the Poles
   assembled on the day on which their idols had been thrown into the
   rivers or burnt, and celebrated the memory of their gods by dismal
   dirges, [133] and the simplest rules of Christian morals could be
   enforced only by the application of the most barbarous punishments.
   Yea, under the political disturbances which occurred after the death of
   Mieczyslav II., 1034, a general outburst of heathenism took place
   throughout the Polish kingdom, and it took a long time before it was
   fully put down.

   The Bulgarians were of Turanian descent, but, having lived for
   centuries among Slavic nations, they had adopted Slavic language,
   religion, customs and habits. Occupying the plains between the Danube
   and the Balkan range, they made frequent inroads into the territory of
   the Byzantine empire. In 813 they conquered Adrianople and carried a
   number of Christians, among whom was the bishop himself, as prisoners
   to Bulgaria. Here these Christian prisoners formed a congregation and
   began to labor for the conversion of their captors, though not with any
   great success, as it would seem, since the bishop was martyred. But in
   861 a sister of the Bulgarian prince, Bogoris, who had been carried as
   a prisoner to Constantinople, and educated there in the Christian
   faith, returned to her native country, and her exertions for the
   conversion of her brother at last succeeded.

   Methodius was sent to her aid, and a picture he painted of the last
   judgment is said to have made an overwhelming impression on Bogoris,
   and determined him to embrace Christianity. He was baptized in 863, and
   entered immediately in correspondence with Photius, the patriarch of
   Constantinople. His baptism, however, occasioned a revolt among his
   subjects, and the horrible punishment, which he inflicted upon the
   rebels, shows how little as yet he had understood the teachings of
   Christianity.

   Meanwhile Greek missionaries, mostly monks, had entered the country,
   but they were intriguing, arrogant, and produced nothing but confusion
   among the people. In 865 Bogoris addressed himself to Pope Nicolas I.,
   asking for Roman missionaries, and laying before the Pope one hundred
   and six questions concerning Christian doctrines, morals and ritual,
   which he wished to have answered. The Pope sent two bishops to
   Bulgaria, and gave Bogoris very elaborate and sensible answers to his
   questions.

   Nevertheless, the Roman mission did not succeed either. The Bulgarians
   disliked to submit to any foreign authority. They desired the
   establishment of an independent national church, but this was not to be
   gained either from Rome or from Constantinople. Finally the Byzantine
   emperor, Basilius Macedo, succeeded in establishing Greek bishops and a
   Greek archbishop in the country, and thus the Bulgarian church came
   under the authority of the patriarch of Constantinople, but its history
   up to this very day has been a continuous struggle against this
   authority. The church is now ruled by a Holy Synod, with an independent
   exarch.

   Fearful atrocities of the Turks against the Christians gave rise to the
   Russo-Turkish war in 1877, and resulted in the independence of
   Bulgaria, which by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 was constituted into
   "an autonomous and tributary principality, under the suzerainty of the
   Sultan," but with a Christian government and a national militia.
   Religious proselytism is prohibited, and religious school-books must be
   previously examined by the Holy Synod. But Protestant missionaries are
   at work among the people, and practically enjoy full liberty.

   The Magyars, belonging to the Turanian family of nations, and allied to
   the Finns and the Turks, penetrated into Europe in the ninth century,
   and settled, in 884, in the plains between the Bug and the Sereth, near
   the mouth of the Danube. On the instigation of the Byzantine emperor,
   Leo the Wise, they attacked the Bulgarians, and completely defeated
   them. The military renown they thus acquired gave them a new
   opportunity. The Frankish king Arnulf invoked their aid against
   Swatopluk, the ruler of the Moravian empire. Swatopluk, too, was
   defeated, and his realm was divided between the victors. The Magyars,
   retracing their steps across the Carpathian range, settled in the
   plains around the Theiss and the Danube, the country which their
   forefathers, the Huns, once had ruled over, the, present Hungary. They
   were a wild and fierce race, worshipping one supreme god under the
   guise of various natural phenomena: the sky, the river, etc. They had
   no temples and no priesthood, and their sacrifices consisted of animals
   only, mostly horses. But the oath was kept sacred among them, and their
   marriages were monogamous, and inaugurated with religious rites.

   The first acquaintance with Christianity the Magyars made through their
   connections with the Byzantine court, without any further consequences.
   But after settling in Hungary, where they were surrounded on all sides
   by Christian nations, they were compelled, in 950, by the emperor, Otto
   I., to allow the bishop of Passau to send missionaries into their
   country; and various circumstances contributed to make this mission a
   rapid and complete success. Their prince, Geyza, had married a daughter
   of the Transylvanian prince, Gyula, and this princess, Savolta, had
   been educated in the Christian faith. Thus Geyza felt friendly towards
   the Christians; and as soon as this became known, Christianity broke
   forth from the mass of the population like flowers from the earth when
   spring has come. The people which the Magyars had subdued when settling
   in Hungary, and the captives whom they had carried along with them from
   Bulgaria and Moravia, were Christians. Hitherto these Christians had
   concealed their religion from fear of their rulers, and their children
   had been baptized clandestinely; but now they assembled in great
   multitudes around the missionaries, and the entrance of Christianity
   into Hungary looked like a triumphal march. [134]

   Political disturbances afterwards interrupted this progress, but only
   for a short time. Adalbert of Prague visited the country, and made a
   great impression. He baptized Geyza's son, Voik, born in 961, and gave
   him the name of Stephanus, 994. Adalbert's pupil, Rodla, remained for a
   longer period in the country, and was held in so high esteem by the
   people, that they afterwards would not let him go. When Stephanus
   ascended the throne in 997, he determined at once to establish
   Christianity as the sole religion of his realm, and ordered that all
   Magyars should be baptized, and that all Christian slaves should be set
   free. This, however, caused a rising of the pagan party under the head
   of Kuppa, a relative of Stephanus; but Kuppa was defeated at Veszprim,
   and the order had to be obeyed.

   Stephanus' marriage with Gisela, a relative of the emperor, Otto III.,
   brought him in still closer contact with the German empire, and he,
   like Mieczyslav of Poland, borrowed the whole ecclesiastical
   organization from the German church. Ten bishoprics were formed, and
   placed under the authority of the archbishop of Gran on the Danube
   (which is still the seat of the primate of Hungary); churches were
   built, schools and monasteries were founded, and rich revenues were
   procured for their support; the clergy was declared the first order in
   rank, and the Latin language was made the official language not only in
   ecclesiastical, but also in secular matters. As a reward for his zeal,
   Stephanus was presented by Pope Silvester II. with a golden crown, and,
   in the year 1000, he was solemnly crowned king by the archbishop of
   Gran, while a papal bull conferred on him the title of "His Apostolic
   Majesty." And, indeed, Stephanus was the apostle of the Magyars. As
   most of the priests and monks, called from Germany, did not understand
   the language of the people, the king himself travelled about from town
   to town, preached, prayed, and exhorted all to keep the Lord's Day, the
   fast, and other Christian duties. Nevertheless, it took a long time
   before Christianity really took hold of the Magyars, chiefly on account
   of the deep gulf created between the priests and their flocks, partly
   by the difference of language, partly by the exceptional position which
   Stephanus had given the clergy in the community, and which the clergy
   soon learned to utilize for selfish purposes. Twice during the eleventh
   century there occurred heavy relapses into paganism; in 1045, under
   King Andreas, and in 1060, under King Bela.

   The legend traces Christianity in Russia back to the Apostle St.
   Andrew, who is especially revered by the Russians. Mouravieff commences
   his history of the Russian church with these words: "The Russian
   church, like the other Orthodox churches of the East, had an apostle
   for its founder. St. Andrew, the first called of the Twelve, hailed
   with his blessing long beforehand the destined introduction of
   Christianity into our country. Ascending up and penetrating by the
   Dniepr into the deserts of Scythia, he planted the first cross on the
   hills of Kieff, and 'See you,' said he to his disciples, 'those hills?
   On those hills shall shine the light of divine grace. There shall be
   here a great city, and God shall have in it many churches to His name.'
   Such are the words of the holy Nestor that point from whence Christian
   Russia has sprung."

   This tradition is an expansion of the report that Andrew labored and
   died a martyr in Scythia, [135] and nothing more.

   In the ninth century the Russian tribes, inhabiting the Eastern part of
   Europe, were gathered together under the rule of Ruric, a Varangian
   prince, [136] who from the coasts of the Baltic penetrated into the
   centre of the present Russia, and was voluntarily accepted, if not
   actually chosen by the tribes as their chief. He is regarded as the
   founder of the Russian empire, a.d. 862, which in 1862 celebrated its
   millennial anniversary. About the same time or a little later the
   Russians became somewhat acquainted with Christianity through their
   connections with the Byzantine empire. The Eastern church, however,
   never developed any great missionary activity, and when Photius, the
   patriarch of Constantinople, in his circular letter against the Roman
   see, speaks of the Russians as already converted at his time (867), a
   few years after the founding of the empire, he certainly exaggerates.
   When, in 945, peace was concluded between the Russian grand-duke, Igor,
   and the Byzantine emperor, some of the Russian soldiers took the oath
   in the name of Christ, but by far the greatest number swore by Perun,
   the old Russian god. In Kieff, on the Dniepr, the capital of the
   Russian realm, there was at that time a Christian church, dedicated to
   Elijah, and in 955 the grand-duchess, Olga, went to Constantinople and
   was baptized. She did not succeed, however, in persuading her son,
   Svatoslav, to embrace the Christian faith.

   The progress of Christianity among the Russians was slow until the
   grand-duke Vladimir (980-1015), a grandson of Olga, and revered as
   Isapostolos ("Equal to an Apostle") with one sweep established it as
   the religion of the country. The narrative of this event by Nestor is
   very dramatic. Envoys from the Greek and the Roman churches, from the
   Mohammedans and the Jews (settled among the Chazares) came to Vladimir
   to persuade him to leave his old gods. He hesitated and did not know
   which of the new religions he should choose. Finally he determined to
   send wise men from among his own people to the various places to
   investigate the matter. The envoys were so powerfully impressed by a
   picture of the last judgment and by the service in the church of St.
   Sophia in Constantinople, that the question at once was settled in
   favor of the religion of the Byzantine court.

   Vladimir, however, would not introduce it without compensation. He was
   staying at Cherson in the Crimea, which he had just taken and sacked,
   and thence he sent word to the emperor Basil, that he had determined
   either to adopt Christianity and receive the emperor's sister, Anne, in
   marriage, or to go to Constantinople and do to that city as he had done
   to Cherson. He married Anne, and was baptized on the day of his
   wedding, a.d. 988.

   As soon as he was baptized preparations were made for the baptism of
   his people. The wooden image of Perun was dragged at a horse's tail
   through the country, soundly flogged by all passers-by, and finally
   thrown into the Dniepr. Next, at a given hour, all the people of Kieff,
   men, women and children, descended into the river, while the grand Duke
   kneeled, and the Christian priests read the prayers from the top of the
   cliffs on the shore. Nestor, the Russian monk and annalist, thus
   describes the scene: "Some stood in the water up to their necks, others
   up to their breasts, holding their young children in their arms; the
   priests read the prayers from the shore, naming at once whole companies
   by the same name. It was a sight wonderfully curious and beautiful to
   behold; and when the people were baptized each returned to his own
   home."

   Thus the Russian nation was converted in wholesale style to
   Christianity by despotic power. It is characteristic of the supreme
   influence of the ruler and the slavish submission of the subjects in
   that country. Nevertheless, at its first entrance in Russia,
   Christianity penetrated deeper into the life of the people than it did
   in any other country, without, however, bringing about a corresponding
   thorough moral transformation. Only a comparatively short period
   elapsed, before a complete union of the forms of religion and the
   nationality took place. Every event in the history of the nation, yea,
   every event in the life of the individual was looked upon from a
   religious point of view, and referred to some distinctly religious
   idea. The explanation of this striking phenomenon is due in part to
   Cyrill's translation of the Bible into the Slavic language, which had
   been driven out from Moravia and Bohemia by the Roman priests, and was
   now brought from Bulgaria into Russia, where it took root. While the
   Roman church always insisted upon the exclusive use of the Latin
   translation of the Bible and the Latin language in divine service, the
   Greek church always allowed the use of the vernacular. Under its
   auspices there were produced translations into the Coptic, Syriac,
   Armenian, and Slavic languages, and the effects of this principle were,
   at least in Russia, most beneficial. During the reign of Vladimir's
   successor, Jaroslaff, 1019-1054, not only were churches and monasteries
   and schools built all over the country, but Greek theological books
   were translated, and the Russian church had, at an early date, a
   religious literature in the native tongue of the people. Jaroslaff, by
   his celebrated code of laws, became the Justinian of Russia.

   The Czars and people of Russia have ever since faithfully adhered to
   the Oriental church which grew with the growth of the empire all along
   the Northern line of two Continents. As in the West, so in Russia,
   monasticism was the chief institution for the spread of Christianity
   among heathen savages. Hilarion (afterwards Metropolitan), Anthony,
   Theodosius, Sergius, Lazarus, are prominent names in the early history
   of Russian monasticism.

   The subsequent history of the Russian church is isolated from the main
   current of histoy, and almost barren of events till the age of Nikon
   and Peter the Great. At first she was dependent on the patriarch of
   Constantinople. In 1325 Moscow was founded, and became, in the place of
   Kieff, the Russian Rome, with a metropolitan, who after the fall of
   Constantinople became independent (1461), and a century later was
   raised to the dignity of one of the five patriarchs of the Eastern
   Church (1587). But Peter the Great made the Northern city of his own
   founding the ecclesiastical as well as the political metropolis, and
   transferred the authority of the patriarchate of Moscow to the "Holy
   Synod" (1721), which permanently resides in St. Petersburg and
   constitutes the highest ecclesiastical judicatory of Russia under the
   caesaropapal rule of the Czar, the most powerful rival of the Roman
   Pope.

   § 38. Literature.

   See A. Sprenger's Bibliotheca Orientalis Sprengeriana. Giessen, 1857.

   W. Muir.: Life of Mahomet, Vol. I., ch. 1. Muir discusses especially
   the value of Mohammedan traditions.

   Ch. Friedrici: Bibliotheca Orientalis. London (Trübner & Co.) 1875 sqq.

   I. Sources.

   1. The Koran or AL-Koran. The chief source. The Mohammedan Bible,
   claiming to be given by inspiration to Mohammed during the course of
   twenty years. About twice as large as the New Testament. The best
   Arabic MSS., often most beautifully written, are in the Mosques of
   Cairo, Damascus, Constantinople, and Paris; the largest, collection in
   the library of the Khedive in Cairo. Printed editions in Arabic by
   Hinkelmann (Hamburg, 1694); Molla Osman Ismael (St. Petersburg, 1787
   and 1803); G. Flügel (Leipz., 1834); revised by Redslob (1837, 1842,
   1858). Arabice et Latine, ed. L. Maraccius, Patav., 1698, 2 vols., fol.
   (Alcorani textus universus, with notes and refutation). A lithographed
   edition of the Arabic text appeared at Lucknow in India, 1878 (A. H.
   1296).

   The standard English translations: in prose by Geo. Sale (first publ.,
   Lond., 1734, also 1801, 1825, Philad., 1833, etc.), with a learned and
   valuable preliminary discourse and notes; in the metre, but without the
   rhyme, of the original by J. M. Rodwell (Lond., 1861, 2d ed. 1876, the
   Suras arranged in chronological order). A new transl. in prose by E. H.
   Palmer. (Oxford, 1880, 2 vols.) in M. Müller's "Sacred Books of the
   East." Parts are admirably translated by Edward W. Lane.

   French translation by Savary, Paris, 1783, 2 vols.; enlarged edition by
   Garcin de Tassy, 1829, in 3 vols.; another by M. Kasimirski, Paris,
   1847, and 1873.

   German translations by Wahl (Halle, 1828), L. Ullmann (Bielefeld, 1840,
   4th ed. 1857), and parts by Hammer von Purgstall (in the Fundgruben des
   Orients), and Sprenger (in Das Leben und die Lehre des Mohammad).

   2. Secondary sources on the Life of Moh. and the origin of Islâm are
   the numerous poems of contemporaries, especially in Ibn Ishâc, and the
   collections of the sayings of Moh., especially the Sahih (i.e. The
   True, the Genuine) of Albuchârî (d. 871). Also the early Commentaries
   on the Koran, which explain difficult passages, reconcile the
   contradictions, and insert traditional sayings and legends. See
   Sprenger, III. CIV. sqq.

   III. Biographies of Mohammed.

   1. Mohammedan biographers.

   Zohri (the oldest, died after the Hegira 124).

   Ibn Ishâc (or Ibni Ishak, d. A. H. 151, or a.d. 773), ed. in Arabic
   from MSS. by Wüstenfeld, Gött., 1858-60, translated by Weil, Stuttg.,
   1864.

   Ibn (Ibni) Hishâm (d. A. H. 213, a.d. 835), also ed. by Wüstenfeld, and
   translated by Weil, 1864.

   Katib Al Waquidi (or Wackedee, Wackidi, d. at Bagdad A. H. 207, a.d.
   829), a man of prodigious learning, who collected the traditions, and
   left six hundred chests of books (Sprenger, III., LXXI.), and his
   secretary, Muhammad Ibn Sâad (d. A. H. 230, a.d. 852), who arranged,
   abridged, and completed the biographical works of his master in twelve
   or fifteen for. vols.; the first vol. contains the biography of Moh.,
   and is preferred by Muir and Sprenger to all others. German transl. by
   Wellhausen: Muhammed in Medina. From the Arabic of Vakidi. Berlin,
   1882.

   Tabari (or Tibree, d. A. H. 310, a.d. 932), called by Gibbon "the Livy
   of the Arabians."

   Muir says (I., CIII.): "To the three biographies by Ibn Hishâm, by
   Wackidi, and his secretary, and by Tabari, the judicious historian of
   Mahomet will, as his original authorities, confine himself. He will
   also receive, with a similar respect, such traditions in the general
   collections of the earliest traditionists--Bokhâri, Muslim, Tirmidzi,
   etc.,--as may bear upon his subject. But he will reject as evidence all
   later authors." Abulfeda (or Abulfida, d. 1331), once considered the
   chief authority, now set aside by much older sources.

   *Syed Ahmed Khan Bahador (member of the Royal Asiatic Society): A
   Series of Essays on the Life of Mohammed. London (Trübner & Co.), 1870.
   He wrote also a "Mohammedan Commentary on the Holy Bible." He begins
   with the sentence: "In nomine Dei Misericordis Miseratoris. Of all the
   innumerable wonders of the universe, the most marvellous is religion."

   Syed Ameer Ali, Moulvé (a Mohammedan lawyer, and brother of the
   former): A Critical Examination of the Life and Teachings of Mohammed.
   London 1873. A defense of Moh. chiefly drawn from Ibn-Hishâm (and
   Ibn-al Athîr (1160-1223).

   2. Christian Biographies.

   Jean Gagnier (d. 1740): La vie de Mahomet, 1732, 2 vols., etc. Amsterd.
   1748, 3 vols. Chiefly from Abulfeda and the Sonna. He also translated
   Abulfeda.

   *Gibbon: Decline and Fall, etc. (1788), chs. 50-52. Although not an
   Arabic scholar, Gibbon made the best use of the sources then accessible
   in Latin, French, and English, and gives a brilliant and, upon the
   whole, impartial picture.

   *Gustav Weil: Mohammed der Prophet, sein Leben und seine Lehre.
   Stuttgart, 1843. Comp. also his translation of Ibn Ishâc, and Ibn
   Hishâm, Stuttgart, 1864, 2 vols.; and his Biblische Legenden der
   Muselmänner aus arabischen Quellen und mit jüd. Sagen verglichen.
   Frcf., 1845. The last is also transl. into English.

   Th. Carlyle: The Hero as Prophet, in his Heroes Hero- Worship and the
   Heroic in History. London, 1840. A mere sketch, but full of genius and
   stimulating hints. He says: "We have chosen Mahomet not as the most
   eminent prophet, but as the one we are freest to speak of. He is by no
   means the truest of prophets, but I esteem him a true one. Farther, as
   there is no danger of our becoming, any of us, Mahometans, I mean to
   say all the good of him I justly can. It is the way to get at his
   secret."

   § 40. Position of Mohammedanism in Church History.

   While new races and countries in Northern and Western Europe, unknown
   to the apostles, were added to the Christian Church, we behold in Asia
   and Africa the opposite spectacle of the rise and progress of a rival
   religion which is now acknowledged by more than one-tenth of the
   inhabitants of the globe. It is called "Mohammedanism" from its
   founder, or "Islâm," from its chief virtue, which is absolute surrender
   to the one true God. Like Christianity, it had its birth in the
   Shemitic race, the parent of the three monotheistic religions, but in
   an obscure and even desert district, and had a more rapid, though less
   enduring success.

   But what a difference in the means employed and the results reached!
   Christianity made its conquest by peaceful missionaries and the power
   of persuasion, and carried with it the blessings of home, freedom and
   civilization. Mohammedanism conquered the fairest portions of the earth
   by the sword and cursed them by polygamy, slavery, despotism and
   desolation. The moving power of Christian missions was love to God and
   man; the moving power of Islâm was fanaticism and brute force.
   Christianity has found a home among all nations and climes;
   Mohammedanism, although it made a most vigorous effort to conquer the
   world, is after all a religion of the desert, of the tent and the
   caravan, and confined to nomad and savage or half-civilized nations,
   chiefly Arabs, Persians, and Turks. It never made an impression on
   Europe except by brute force; it is only encamped, not really
   domesticated, in Constantinople, and when it must withdraw from Europe
   it will leave no trace behind.

   Islâm in its conquering march took forcible possession of the lands of
   the Bible, and the Greek church, seized the throne of Constantine,
   overran Spain, crossed the Pyrenees, and for a long time threatened
   even the church of Rome and the German empire, until it was finally
   repulsed beneath the walls of Vienna. The Crusades which figure so
   prominently in the history of mediaeval Christianity, originated in the
   desire to wrest the holy land from the followers of "the false
   prophet," and brought the East in contact with the West. The monarchy
   and the church of Spain, with their architecture, chivalry, bigotry,
   and inquisition, emerged from a fierce conflict with the Moors. Even
   the Reformation in the sixteenth century was complicated with the
   Turkish question, which occupied the attention of the diet of Augsburg
   as much as the Confession of the Evangelical princes and divines.
   Luther, in one of his most popular hymns, prays for deliverance from
   "the murdering Pope and Turk," as the two chief enemies of the gospel
   [137] ; and the Anglican Prayer Book, in the collect for Good Friday,
   invokes God "to have mercy upon all Turks," as well as upon "Jews,
   Infidels, and Heretics." [138]

   The danger for Western Christendom from that quarter has long since
   passed away; the "unspeakable" Turk has ceased to be unconquerable, but
   the Asiatic and a part of the East European portion of the Greek church
   are still subject to the despotic rule of the Sultan, whose throne in
   Constantinople has been for more than four hundred years a standing
   insult to Christendom.

   Mohammedanism then figures as a hostile force, as a real Ishmaelite in
   church history; it is the only formidable rival which Christianity ever
   had, the only religion which for a while at least aspired to universal
   empire.

   And yet it is not hostile only. It has not been without beneficial
   effect upon Western civilization. It aided in the development of
   chivalry; it influenced Christian architecture; it stimulated the study
   of mathematics, chemistry, medicine (as is indicated by the technical
   terms: algebra, chemistry, alchemy); and the Arabic translations and
   commentaries on Aristotle by the Spanish Moors laid the philosophical
   foundation of scholasticism. Even the conquest of Constantinople by the
   Turks brought an inestimable blessing to the West by driving Greek
   scholars with the Greek Testament to Italy to inaugurate there the
   revival of letters which prepared the way for the Protestant
   Reformation.

   Viewed in its relation to the Eastern Church which it robbed of the
   fairest dominions, Mohammedanism was a well-deserved divine punishment
   for the unfruitful speculations, bitter contentions, empty
   ceremonialism and virtual idolatry which degraded and disgraced the
   Christianity of the East after the fifth century. The essence of true
   religion, love to God and to man, was eaten out by rancor and strife,
   and there was left no power of ultimate resistance to the foreign
   conqueror. The hatred between the orthodox Eastern church and the
   Eastern schismatics driven from her communion, and the jealousy between
   the Greek and Latin churches prevented them from aiding each other in
   efforts to arrest the progress of the common foe. The Greeks detested
   the Latin Filioque as a heresy more deadly than Islâm; while the Latins
   cared more for the supremacy of the Pope than the triumph of
   Christianity, and set up during the Crusades a rival hierarchy in the
   East. Even now Greek and Latin monks in Bethlehem and Jerusalem are apt
   to fight at Christmas and Easter over the cradle and the grave of their
   common Lord and Redeemer, unless Turkish soldiers keep them in order!
   [139]

   But viewed in relation to the heathenism from which it arose or which
   it converted, Mahommedanism is a vast progress, and may ultimately be a
   stepping-stone to Christianity, like the law of Moses which served as a
   schoolmaster to lead men to the gospel. It has destroyed the power of
   idolatry in Arabia and a large part of Asia and Africa, and raised
   Tartars and Negroes from the rudest forms of superstition to the belief
   and worship of the one true God, and to a certain degree of
   civilization.

   It should be mentioned, however, that, according to the testimony of
   missionaries and African travelers, Mohammedanism has inflamed the
   simple minded African tribes with the impure fire of fanaticism and
   given them greater power of resistance to Christianity. Sir William
   Muir, a very competent judge, thinks that Mohammedanism by the
   poisoning influence of polygamy and slavery, and by crushing all
   freedom of judgment in religion has interposed the most effectual
   barrier against the reception of Christianity. "No system," he says,
   "could have been devised with more consummate skill for shutting out
   the nations over which it has sway, from the light of truth. Idolatrous
   Arabs might have been aroused to spiritual life and to the adoption of
   the faith of Jesus; Mahometan Arabia is, to the human eye, sealed
   against the benign influences of the gospel .... The sword of Mahomet
   and the Coran are the most fatal enemies of civilization, liberty, and
   truth." [140]

   This is no doubt true of the past. But we have not yet seen the end of
   this historical problem. It is not impossible that Islâm may yet prove
   to be a necessary condition for the revival of a pure Scriptural
   religion in the East. Protestant missionaries from England and America
   enjoy greater liberty under the Mohammedan rule than they would under a
   Greek or Russian government. The Mohammedan abhorrence of idolatry and
   image worship, Mohammedan simplicity and temperance are points of
   contact with the evangelical type of Christianity, which from the
   extreme West has established flourishing missions in the most important
   parts of Turkey. The Greek Church can do little or nothing with the
   Mohammedans; if they are to be converted it must be done by a
   Christianity which is free from all appearance of idolatry, more simple
   in worship, and more vigorous in life than that which they have so
   easily conquered and learned to despise. It is an encouraging fact that
   Mohammedans have, great respect for the Anglo-Saxon race. They now
   swear by the word of an Englishman as much as by the beard of Mohammed.

   Islâm is still a great religious power in the East. It rules supreme in
   Syria, Palestine, Asia Minor, Egypt, North Africa, and makes progress
   among the savage tribes in the interior of the Dark Continent. It is by
   no means simply, as Schlegel characterized the system, "a prophet
   without miracles, a faith without mysteries, and a morality without
   love." It has tenacity, aggressive vitality and intense enthusiasm.
   Every traveller in the Orient must be struck with the power of its
   simple monotheism upon its followers. A visit to the Moslem University
   in the Mosque El Azhar at Cairo is very instructive. It dates from the
   tenth century (975), and numbers (or numbered in 1877, when I visited
   it) no less than ten thousand students who come from all parts of the
   Mohammedan world and present the appearance of a huge Sunday School,
   seated in small groups on the floor, studying the Koran as the
   beginning and end of all wisdom, and then at the stated hours for
   prayer rising to perform their devotions under the lead of their
   teachers. They live in primitive simplicity, studying, eating and
   sleeping on a blanket or straw mat in the same mosque, but the
   expression of their faces betrays the fanatical devotion to their
   creed. They support themselves, or are aided by the alms of the
   faithful. The teachers (over three hundred) receive no salary and live
   by private instruction or presents from rich scholars.

   Nevertheless the power of Islâm, like its symbol, the moon, is
   disappearing before the sun of Christianity which is rising once more
   over the Eastern horizon. Nearly one-third of its followers are under
   Christian (mostly English) rule. It is essentially a politico-religious
   system, and Turkey is its stronghold. The Sultan has long been a "sick
   man," and owes his life to the forbearance and jealousy of the
   Christian powers. Sooner or later he will be driven out of Europe, to
   Brusa or Mecca. The colossal empire of Russia is the hereditary enemy
   of Turkey, and would have destroyed her in the wars of 1854 and 1877,
   if Catholic France and Protestant England had not come to her aid. In
   the meantime the silent influences of European civilization and
   Christian missions are undermining the foundations of Turkey, and
   preparing the way for a religious, moral and social regeneration and
   transformation of the East. "God's mills grind slowly, but surely and
   wonderfully fine." A thousand years before Him are as one day, and one
   day may do the work of a thousand years.

   [138] The words "all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics," were
   inserted by the framers of the Prayer Book in the first edition (1547);
   the rest of the collect is translated from the old Latin service. In
   the middle ages the word "infidel" denoted a Mohammedan. The
   Mohammedans in turn call Christians, Jews, and all other religionists,
   "infidels" and "dogs."

   [139] Archbishop Trench, l.c. p. 54: "We can regard Mohammedanism in no
   other light than as a scourge of God upon a guilty church. He will not
   give his glory to another. He will not suffer the Creator and the
   creature to be confounded; and if those who should have been witnesses
   for the truth, who had been appointed thereunto, forsake, forget, or
   deny it, He will raise up witnesses from quarters the most unlooked
   for, and will strengthen their hands and give victory to their arms
   even against those who bear his name, but have forgotten his truth."
   Similarly Dr. Jessup, l.c. p. 14: "The Mohammedan religion arose, in
   the providence of God, as a scourge to the idolatrous Christianity, and
   the pagan systems of Asia and Africa--a protest against polytheism, and
   a preparation for the future conversion to a pure Christianity of the
   multitude who have fallen under its extraordinary power." Carlyle calls
   the creed of Mohammed "a kind of Christianity better than that of those
   miserable Syrian Sects with the head full of worthless noise, the heart
   empty and dead. The truth of it is imbedded in portentous error and
   falsehood; but the truth makes it to be believed, not the falsehood: it
   succeeded by its truth. A bastard kind of Christianity, but a living
   kind; with a heart-life in it; not dead, chopping, barren logic
   merely."

   § 41. The Home, and the Antecedents of Islâm.

   On the Aborigines of Arabia and its religious condition before Islam,
   compare the preliminary discourse of Sale, Sect.1 and 2; Muir, Vol. I.
   ch. 2d; Sprenger, I. 13-92, and Stobart, ch. 1.

   The fatherland of Islâm is Arabia, a peninsula between the Red Sea, the
   Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. It is covered with sandy deserts,
   barren hills, rock-bound coasts, fertile wadies, and rich pastures. It
   is inhabited by nomadic tribes and traders who claim descent from five
   patriarchal stocks, Cush, Shem, Ishmael, Keturah, and Esau. It was
   divided by the ancients into Arabia Deserta, Arabia Petraea (the Sinai
   district with Petra as the capital), and Arabia Felix (El-Yemen, i.e.
   the land on the right hand, or of the South). Most of its rivers are
   swelled by periodical rains and then lose themselves in the sandy
   plains; few reach the ocean; none of them is navigable. It is a land of
   grim deserts and strips of green verdure, of drought and barrenness,
   violent rains, clear skies, tropical heat, date palms, aromatic herbs,
   coffee, balsam, myrrh, frankincense, and dhurra (which takes the place
   of grain). Its chief animals are the camel, "the ship of the desert,"
   an excellent breed of horses, sheep, and goats. The desert, like the
   ocean, is not without its grandeur. It creates the impression of
   infinitude, it fosters silence and meditation on God and eternity. Man
   is there alone with God. The Arabian desert gave birth to some of the
   sublimest compositions, the ode of liberty by Miriam, the ninetieth
   Psalm by Moses, the book of Job, which Carlyle calls "the grandest poem
   written by the pen of man."

   The Arabs love a roaming life, are simple and temperate, courteous,
   respectful, hospitable, imaginative, fond of poetry and eloquence,
   careless of human life, revengeful, sensual, and fanatical. Arabia,
   protected by its deserts, was never properly conquered by a foreign
   nation.

   The religious capital of Islâm, and the birthplace of its founder--its
   Jerusalem and Rome--is Mecca (or Mekka), one of the oldest cities of
   Arabia. It is situated sixty-five miles East of Jiddah on the Red Sea,
   two hundred and forty-five miles South of Medina, in a narrow and
   sterile valley and shut in by bare hills. It numbered in its days of
   prosperity over one hundred thousand inhabitants, now only about
   forty-five thousand. It stands under the immediate control of the
   Sultan. The streets are broad, but unpaved, dusty in summer, muddy in
   winter. The houses are built of brick or stone, three or four stories
   high; the rooms better furnished than is usual in the East. They are a
   chief source of revenue by being let to the pilgrims. There is scarcely
   a garden or cultivated field in and around Mecca, and only here and
   there a thorny acacia and stunted brushwood relieves the eye. The city
   derives all its fruit--watermelons, dates, cucumbers, limes, grapes,
   apricots, figs, almonds--from Tâif and Wady Fatima, which during the
   pilgrimage season send more than one hundred camels daily to the
   capital. The inhabitants are indolent, though avaricious, and make
   their living chiefly of the pilgrims who annually flock thither by
   thousands and tens of thousands from all parts of the Mohammedan world.
   None but Moslems are allowed to enter Mecca, but a few Christian
   travellers--Ali Bey (the assumed name of the Spaniard, Domingo Badia y
   Leblich, d. 1818), Burckhardt in 1814, Burton in 1852, Maltzan in 1862,
   Keane in 1880--have visited it in Mussulman disguise, and at the risk
   of their lives. To them we owe our knowledge of the place. [141]

   The most holy place in Mecca is Al-Kaaba, a small oblong temple, so
   called from its cubic form. [142] To it the faces of millions of
   Moslems are devoutly turned in prayer five times a day. It is inclosed
   by the great mosque, which corresponds in importance to the temple of
   Solomon in Jerusalem and St. Peter's cathedral in Rome, and can hold
   about thirty-five thousand persons. It is surrounded by colonnades,
   chambers, domes and minarets. Near it is the bubbling well Zemzem, from
   which Hagar and Ishmael are said to have quenched their burning thirst.
   The Kaaba is much older than Mecca. Diodorus Siculus mentions it as the
   oldest and most honored temple in his time. It is supposed to have been
   first built by angels in the shape of a tent and to have been let down
   from heaven; there Adam worshipped after his expulsion from Paradise;
   Seth substituted a structure of clay and stone for a tent; after the
   destruction by the deluge Abraham and Ishmael reconstructed it, and
   their footsteps are shown. [143] It was entirely rebuilt in 1627. It
   contains the famous Black Stone, [144] in the North-Eastern corner near
   the door. This is probably a meteoric stone, or of volcanic origin, and
   served originally as an altar. The Arabs believe that it fell from
   Paradise with Adam, and was as white as milk, but turned black on
   account of man's sins. [145] It is semi-circular in shape, measures
   about six inches in height, and eight inches in breadth, is four or
   five feet from the ground, of reddish black color, polished by
   innumerable kisses (like the foot of the Peter-statue in St. Peter's at
   Rome), encased in silver, and covered with black silk and inscriptions
   from the Koran. It was an object of veneration from time immemorial,
   and is still devoutly kissed or touched by the Moslem pilgrims on each
   of their seven circuits around the temple. [146]

   Mohammed subsequently cleared the Kaaba of all relics of idolatry, and
   made it the place of pilgrimage for his followers. He invented or
   revived the legend that Abraham by divine command sent his son Ishmael
   with Hagar to Mecca to establish there the true worship and the pilgrim
   festival. He says in the Koran: "God hath appointed the Kaaba, the
   sacred house, to be a station for mankind," and, "Remember when we
   appointed the sanctuary as man's resort and safe retreat, and said,
   'Take ye the station of Abraham for a place of prayer.' And we
   commanded Abraham and Ishmael, 'Purify my house for those who shall go
   in procession round it, and those who shall bow down and prostrate
   themselves.' " [147]

   Arabia had at the time when Mohammed appeared, all the elements for a
   wild, warlike, eclectic religion like the one which he established. It
   was inhabited by heathen star-worshippers, Jews, and Christians.

   The heathen were the ruling race, descended from Ishmael, the bastard
   son of Abraham (Ibrahim), the real sons of the desert, full of animal
   life and energy. They had their sanctuary in the Kaaba at Mecca, which
   attracted annually large numbers of pilgrims long before Mohammed.

   The Jews, after the destruction of Jerusalem, were scattered in Arabia,
   especially in the district of Medina, and exerted considerable
   influence by their higher culture and rabbinical traditions.

   The Christians belonged mostly to the various heretical sects which
   were expelled from the Roman empire during the violent doctrinal
   controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries. We find there traces
   of Arians, Sabellians, Ebionites, Nestorians, Eutychians, Monophysites,
   Marianites, and Collyridians or worshippers of Mary. Anchorets and
   monks settled in large numbers in Wady Feiran around Mount Serbal, and
   Justinian laid the foundation of the Convent of St. Catharine at the
   foot of Mount Sinai, which till the year 1859 harbored the oldest and
   most complete uncial manuscript of the Greek Scriptures of both
   Testaments from the age of Constantine. But it was a very superficial
   and corrupt Christianity which had found a home in those desert
   regions, where even the apostle Paul spent three years after his
   conversion in silent preparation for his great mission.

   These three races and religions, though deadly hostile to each other,
   alike revered Abraham, the father of the faithful, as their common
   ancestor. This fact might suggest to a great mind the idea to unite
   them by a national religion monotheistic in principle and eclectic in
   its character. This seems to have been the original project of the
   founder of Islâm.

   It is made certain by recent research that there were at the time and
   before the call of Mohammed a considerable number of inquirers at Mecca
   and Medina, who had intercourse with Eastern Christians in Syria and
   Abyssinia, were dissatisfied with the idolatry around them, and
   inclined to monotheism, which they traced to Abraham. They called
   themselves Hanyfs, i.e. Converts, Puritans. One of them, Omayah of
   Tâif, we know to have been under Christian influence; others seem to
   have derived their monotheistic ideas from Judaism. Some of the early
   converts of Mohammed as, Zayd (his favorite slave), Omayab, or Umaijah
   (a popular poet), and Waraka (a cousin of Chadijah and a student of the
   Holy Scriptures of the Jews and Christians) belonged to this sect, and
   even Mohammed acknowledged himself at first a Hanyf. [148] Waraka, it
   is said, believed in him, as long as he was a Hanyf, but then forsook
   him, and died a Christian or a Jew. [149]

   Mohammed consolidated and energized this reform-movement, and gave it a
   world-wide significance, under the new name of Islâm, i.e. resignation
   to God; whence Moslem (or Muslim), one who resigns himself to God.

   [149] According to Sprenger, I. 91 sqq., he died a Christian; but
   Deutsch, l.c., p. 77, says: "Whatever Waraka was originally, he

   asked by Chadijah for his opinion concerning Mohammed's revelations, he
   cried out: "Koddus! Koddus! (i.e., Kadosh, Holy). Verily this is the
   Namus (i.e., nomos, Law) which came to Moses. He will be the prophet of
   his people."

   § 42. Life and Character of Mohammed.

   Mohammed, an unschooled, self-taught, semi-barbarous son of nature, of
   noble birth, handsome person, imaginative, energetic, brave, the ideal
   of a Bedouin chief, was destined to become the political and religious
   reformer, the poet, prophet, priest, and king of Arabia.

   He was born about a.d. 570 at Mecca, the only child of a young widow
   named Amina. [150] His father Abdallah had died a few months before in
   his twenty-fifth year on a mercantile journey in Medina, and left to
   his orphan five camels, some sheep and a slave girl. [151] He belonged
   to the heathen family of the Hàshim, which was not wealthy, but claimed
   lineal descent from Ishmael, and was connected with the Koreish or
   Korashites, the leading tribe of the Arabs and the hereditary guardians
   of the sacred Kaaba. [152] Tradition surrounds his advent in the world
   with a halo of marvellous legends: he was born circumcised and with his
   navel cut, with the seal of prophecy written on his back in letters of
   light; he prostrated himself at once on the ground, and, raising his
   hands, prayed for the pardon of his people; three persons, brilliant as
   the sun, one holding a silver goblet, the second an emerald tray, the
   third a silken towel, appeared from heaven, washed him seven times,
   then blessed and saluted him as the "Prince of Mankind." He was nursed
   by a healthy Bedouin woman of the desert. When a boy of four years he
   was seized with something like a fit of epilepsy, which Wâckidi and
   other historians transformed into a miraculous occurrence. He was often
   subject to severe headaches and feverish convulsions, in which he fell
   on the ground like a drunken man, and snored like a camel. [153] In his
   sixth year he lost his mother on the return from Medina, whither she
   had taken him on camel's back to 'visit the maternal relations of his
   father, and was carried back to Mecca by his nurse, a faithful slave
   girl. He was taken care of by his aged grandfather, Abd al Motkalib,
   and after his death in 578 by his uncle Abu Tâlib, who had two wives
   and ten children, and, though poor and no believer in his nephew's
   mission, generously protected him to the end.

   He accompanied his uncle on a commercial journey to Syria, passing
   through the desert, ruined cities of old, and Jewish and Christian
   settlements, which must have made a deep impression on his youthful
   imagination.

   Mohammed made a scanty living as an attendant on caravans and by
   watching sheep and goats. The latter is rather a disreputable
   occupation among the Arabs, and left to unmarried women and slaves; but
   he afterwards gloried in it by appealing to the example of Moses and
   David, and said that God never calls a prophet who has not been a
   shepherd before. According to tradition--for, owing to the strict
   prohibition of images, we have no likeness of the prophet--he was of
   medium size, rather slender, but broad-shouldered and of strong
   muscles, had black eyes and hair, an oval-shaped face, white teeth, a
   long nose, a patriarchal beard, and a commanding look. His step was
   quick and firm. He wore white cotton stuff, but on festive occasions
   fine linen striped or dyed in red. He did everything for himself; to
   the last he mended his own clothes, and cobbled his sandals, and aided
   his wives in sewing and cooking. He laughed and smiled often. He had a
   most fertile imagination and a genius for poetry and religion, but no
   learning. He was an "illiterate prophet," in this respect resembling
   some of the prophets of Israel and the fishermen of Galilee. It is a
   disputed question among Moslem and Christian scholars whether he could
   even read and write. [154] Probably he could not. He dictated the Koran
   from inspiration to his disciples and clerks. What knowledge he
   possessed, he picked up on the way from intercourse with men, from
   hearing books read, and especially from his travels.

   In his twenty-fifth year he married a rich widow, Chadijah (or
   Chadîdsha), who was fifteen years older than himself, and who had
   previously hired him to carry on the mercantile business of her former
   husband. Her father was opposed to the match; but she made and kept him
   drunk until the ceremony was completed. He took charge of her caravans
   with great success, and made several journeys. The marriage was happy
   and fruitful of six children, two sons and four daughters; but all died
   except little Fâtima, who became the mother of innumerable legitimate
   and illegitimate descendants of the prophet. He also adopted Alî, whose
   close connection with him became so important in the history of Islâm.
   He was faithful to Chadijah, and held her in grateful remembrance after
   her death. [155] He used to say, "Chadijah believed in me when nobody
   else did." He married afterwards a number of wives, who caused him much
   trouble and scandal. His favorite wife, Ayesha, was more jealous of the
   dead Chadijah than any of her twelve or more living rivals, for he
   constantly held up the toothless old woman as the model of a wife.

   On his commercial journeys to Syria, he became acquainted with Jews and
   Christians, and acquired an imperfect knowledge of their traditions. He
   spent much of his time in retirement, prayer, fasting, and meditation.
   He had violent convulsions and epileptic fits, which his enemies, and
   at first he himself, traced to demoniacal possessions, but afterwards
   to the overpowering presence of God. His soul was fired with the idea
   of the divine unity, which became his ruling passion; and then he awoke
   to the bold thought that he was a messenger of God, called to warn his
   countrymen to escape the judgment and the damnation of hell by
   forsaking idolatry and worshipping the only true God. His monotheistic
   enthusiasm was disturbed, though not weakened, by his ignorance and his
   imperfect sense of the difference between right and wrong.

   In his fortieth year (a.d. 610), he received the call of Gabriel, the
   archangel at the right hand of God, who announced the birth of the
   Saviour to the Virgin Mary. The first revelation was made to him in a
   trance in the wild solitude of Mount Hirâ, an hour's walk from Mecca.
   He was directed "to cry in the name of the Lord." He trembled, as if
   something dreadful had happened to him, and hastened home to his wife,
   who told him to rejoice, for he would be the prophet of his people. He
   waited for other visions; but none came. He went up to Mount Hirâ
   again--this time to commit suicide. But as often as he approached the
   precipice, he beheld Gabriel at the end of the horizon saying to him:
   "I am Gabriel, and thou art Mohammed, the prophet of God. Fear not!" He
   then commenced his career of a prophet and founder of a new religion,
   which combined various elements of the three religious represented in
   Arabia, but was animated and controlled by the faith in Allah, as an
   almighty, ever-present and working will. From this time on, his life
   was enacted before the eyes of the world, and is embodied in his deeds
   and in the Koran.

   The revelations continued from time to time for more than twenty years.
   When asked how they were delivered to him, he replied (as reported by
   Ayesha): "Sometimes like the sound of a bell--a kind of communication
   which was very severe for me; and when the sounds ceased, I found
   myself aware of the instructions. And sometimes the angel would come in
   the form of a man, and converse with me, and all his words I
   remembered."

   After his call, Mohammed labored first for three years among his family
   and friends, under great discouragements, making about forty converts,
   of whom his wife Chadijah was the first, his father-in-law, Abu Bakr,
   and the young, energetic Omar the most important. His daughter Fatima,
   his adopted son Alî, and his slave Zayd likewise believed in his divine
   mission. Then he publicly announced his determination to assume by
   command of God the office of prophet and lawgiver, preached to the
   pilgrims flocking to Mecca, attacked Meccan idolatry, reasoned with his
   opponents, answered their demand for miracles by producing the Koran
   "leaf by leaf," as occasion demanded, and provoked persecution and
   civil commotion. He was forced in the year 622 to flee for his life
   with his followers from Mecca to Medina (El-Medina an-Nabî, the City of
   the Prophet), a distance of two hundred and fifty miles North, or ten
   days' journey over the sands and rocks of the desert.

   This flight or emigration, called Hégira or Hidshra, marks the
   beginning of his wonderful success, and of the Mohammedan era (July 15,
   622). He was recognized in Medina as prophet and lawgiver. At first he
   proclaimed toleration: "Let there be no compulsion in religion;" but
   afterwards he revealed the opposite principle that all unbelievers must
   be summoned to Islâm, tribute, or the sword. With an increasing army of
   his enthusiastic followers, he took the field against his enemies,
   gained in 624 his first victory over the Koreish with an army of 305
   (mostly citizens of Medina) against a force twice as large, conquered
   several Jewish and Christian tribes, ordered and watched in person the
   massacre of six hundred Jews in one day, [156] while their wives and
   children were sold into slavery (627), triumphantly entered Mecca
   (630), demolished the three hundred and sixty idols of the Kaaba, and
   became master of Arabia. The Koreish were overawed by his success, and
   now shouted: "There is but one God, and Mohammed is his prophet." The
   various tribes were melted into a nation, and their old hereditary
   feuds changed into a common fanatical hatred of the infidels, as the
   followers of all other religions were called. The last chapter of the
   Koran commands the remorseless extermination of all idolaters in
   Arabia, unless they submit within four months.

   In the tenth year of the Hegira, the prophet made his last pilgrimage
   to Mecca at the head of forty thousand Moslems, instructed them in all
   important ordinances, and exhorted them to protect the weak, the poor,
   and the women, and to abstain from usury. He planned a large campaign
   against the Greeks.

   But soon after his return to Medina, he died of a violent fever in the
   house and the arms of Ayesha, June 8, 632, in the sixty-third year of
   his age, and was buried on the spot where he died, which is now
   enclosed by a mosque. He suffered great pain, cried and wailed, turned
   on his couch in despair, and said to his wives when they expressed
   their surprise at his conduct: "Do ye not know that prophets have to
   suffer more than all others? One was eaten up by vermin; another died
   so poor that he had nothing but rags to cover his shame; but their
   reward will be all the greater in the life beyond." Among his last
   utterances were: "The Lord destroy the Jews and Christians! Let his
   anger be kindled against those that turn the tombs of their prophets
   into places of worship! O Lord, let not my tomb be an object of
   worship! Let there not remain any faith but that of Islâm throughout
   the whole of Arabia .... Gabriel, come close to me! Lord, grant me
   pardon and join me to thy companionship on high! Eternity in paradise!
   Pardon! Yes, the blessed companionship on high!" [157]

   Omar would not believe that Mohammed was dead, and proclaimed in the
   mosque of Medina: "The prophet has only swooned away; he shall not die
   until he have rooted out every hypocrite and unbeliever." But Abu Bakr
   silenced him and said: "Whosoever worships Mohammed, let him know that
   Mohammed is dead; but whosoever worships God, let him know that the
   Lord liveth, and will never die." Abu Bakr, whom he had loved most, was
   chosen Calif, or Successor of Mohammed.

   Later tradition, and even the earliest biography, ascribe to the
   prophet of Mecca strange miracles, and surround his name with a
   mythical halo of glory. He was saluted by walking trees and stones; he
   often made by a simple touch the udders of dry goats distend with milk;
   be caused floods of water to well up from the parched ground, or gush
   forth from empty vessels, or issue from betwixt the fingers; he raised
   the dead; he made a night journey on his steed Borak through the air
   from Mecca to Jerusalem, from Jerusalem to paradise and the mansions of
   the prophets and angels, and back again to Mecca. [158] But he himself,
   in several passages of the Koran, expressly disclaims the power of
   miracles; he appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, and
   shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those signs
   which might diminish the merit of faith and aggravate the guilt of
   unbelief. [159]

   Character of Mohammed.

   The Koran, if chronologically arranged, must be regarded as the best
   commentary on his character. While his followers regard him to this day
   as the greatest prophet of God, he was long abhorred in Christendom as
   a wicked impostor, as the antichrist, or the false prophet, predicted
   in the Bible, and inspired by the father of lies.

   The calmer judgment of recent historians inclines to the belief that he
   combined the good and bad qualities of an Oriental chief, and that in
   the earlier part of his life he was a sincere reformer and enthusiast,
   but after the establishment of his kingdom a slave of ambition for
   conquest. He was a better man in the period of his adversity and
   persecution at Mecca, than during his prosperity and triumph at Medina.
   History records many examples of characters rising from poverty and
   obscurity to greatness, and then decaying under the sunshine of wealth
   and power. He degenerated, like Solomon, but did not repent, like the
   preacher of "vanity of vanities." He had a melancholic and nervous
   temperament, liable to fantastic hallucinations and alternations of
   high excitement and deep depression, bordering at times on despair and
   suicide. The story of his early and frequent epileptic fits throws some
   light on his revelations, during which he sometimes growled like a
   camel, foamed at his mouth, and streamed with perspiration. He believed
   in evil spirits, omens, charms, and dreams. His mind was neither clear
   nor sharp, but strong and fervent, and under the influence of an
   exuberant imagination. He was a poet of high order, and the Koran is
   the first classic in Arabic literature. He believed himself to be a
   prophet, irresistibly impelled by supernatural influence to teach and
   warn his fellow-men. He started with the over-powering conviction of
   the unity of God and a horror of idolatry, and wished to rescue his
   countrymen from this sin of sins and from the terrors of the judgment
   to come; but gradually he rose above the office of a national reformer
   to that of the founder of a universal religion, which was to absorb the
   other religions, and to be propagated by violence. It is difficult to
   draw the line in such a character between honest zeal and selfish
   ambition, the fear of God and the love of power and glory.

   He despised a throne and a diadem, lived with his wives in a row of low
   and homely cottages of unbaked bricks, and aided them in their
   household duties; he was strictly temperate in eating and drinking, his
   chief diet being dates and water; he was not ashamed to milk his goats,
   to mend his clothes and to cobble his shoes; his personal property at
   his death amounted to some confiscated lands, fourteen or fifteen
   slaves, a few camels and mules, a hundred sheep, and a rooster. This
   simplicity of a Bedouin Sheikh of the desert contrasts most favorably
   with the luxurious style and gorgeous display of Mohammed's successors,
   the Califs and Sultans, who have dozens of palaces and harems filled
   with eunuchs and women that know nothing beyond the vanities of dress
   and etiquette and a little music. He was easy of access to visitors who
   approached him with faith and reverence; patient, generous, and
   (according to Ayesha) as modest and bashful "as a veiled virgin." But
   towards his enemies he was cruel and revengeful. He did not shrink from
   perfidy. He believed in the use of the sword as the best missionary,
   and was utterly unscrupulous as to the means of success. He had great
   moral, but little physical courage; he braved for thirteen years the
   taunts and threats of the people, but never exposed himself to danger
   in battle, although he always accompanied his forces.

   Mohammed was a slave of sensual passion. Ayesha, who knew him best in
   his private character and habits, used to say: "The prophet loved three
   things, women, perfumes and food; he had his heart's desire of the two
   first, but not of the last." The motives of his excess in polygamy were
   his sensuality which grew with his years, and his desire for male
   offspring. His followers excused or justified him by the examples of
   Abraham, David and Solomon, and by the difficulties of his prophetic
   office, which were so great that God gave him a compensation in sexual
   enjoyment, and endowed him with greater capacity than thirty ordinary
   men. For twenty-four years he had but one wife, his beloved Chadijah,
   who died in 619, aged sixty-five, but only two months after her death
   he married a widow named Sawda (April 619), and gradually increased his
   harem, especially during the last two years of his life. When he heard
   of a pretty woman, says Sprenger, he asked her hand, but was
   occasionally refused. He had at least fourteen legal wives, and a
   number of slave concubines besides. At his death he left nine widows.
   He claimed special revelations which gave him greater liberty of sexual
   indulgence than ordinary Moslems (who are restricted to four wives),
   and exempted him from the prohibition of marrying near relatives. [160]
   He married by divine command, as he alleged, Zeynab, the wife of Zayd,
   his adopted son and bosom-friend. His wives were all widows except
   Ayesha. One of them was a beautiful and rich Jewess; she was despised
   by her sisters, who sneeringly said: "Pshaw, a Jewess!" He told her to
   reply: "Aaron is my father and Moses my uncle!" Ayesha, the daughter of
   Abû Bakr, was his especial favorite. He married her when she was a girl
   of nine years, and he fifty-three years old. She brought her
   doll-babies with her, and amused and charmed the prophet by her
   playfulness, vivacity and wit. She could read, had a copy of the Koran,
   and knew more about theology, genealogy and poetry than all the other
   widows of Mohammed. He announced that she would be his wife also in
   Paradise. Yet she was not free from suspicion of unfaithfulness until
   he received a revelation of her innocence. After his death she was the
   most sacred person among the Moslems and the highest authority on
   religious and legal questions. She survived her husband forty-seven
   years and died at Medina, July 13, 678, aged sixty-seven years. [161]

   In his ambition for a hereditary dynasty, Mohammed was sadly
   disappointed: he lost his two sons by Chadijah, and a third one by Mary
   the Egyptian, his favorite concubine.

   To compare such a man with Jesus, is preposterous and even blasphemous.
   Jesus was the sinless Saviour of sinners; Mohammed was a sinner, and he
   knew and confessed it. He falls far below Moses, or Elijah, or any of
   the prophets and apostles in moral purity. But outside of the sphere of
   revelation, he ranks with Confucius, and Cakya Muni the Buddha, among
   the greatest founders of religions and lawgivers of nations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [150] We know accurately the date of Mohammed's death (June 8, 632),
   but the year of his birth only by reckoning backwards; and as his age
   is variously stated from sixty-one to sixty-five, there is a
   corresponding difference in the statements of the year of his birth. De
   Sacy fixes it April 20, 571, von Hammer 569, Muir Aug. 20, 570,
   Sprenger between May 13, 567, and April 13, 571, but afterwards (I.
   138), April 20, 571, as most in accordance with early tradition.

   [151] According to Ihn Ishâk and Wâckidi. Bahador adopts this
   tradition, in the last of his essays which treats of "the Birth and
   Childhood of Mohammed." But according to other accounts, Abdallah died
   several months (seven or eighteen) after Mohammed's birth. Muir. I. 11;
   Sprenger, I. 138.

   [152] On the pedigree of Mohammed, see an essay in the work of Syed
   Ahmed Khan Bahador, and MuirI1. 242-271. The Koreish were not exactly
   priests, but watched the temple, kept the keys, led the processions,
   and provided for the pilgrims. Hâshim, Mohammed's great-grandfather (b.
   a. d.442), thus addressed the Koreish: "Ye are the neighbors of God and
   the keepers of his house. The pilgrims who come honoring the sanctity
   of his temple, are his guests; and it is meet that ye should entertain
   them above all other guests. Ye are especially chosen of God and
   exalted unto this high dignity; wherefore honor big guests and refresh
   them." He himself set an example of munificent hospitality, and each of
   the Koreish contributed according to his ability. Muir I. CCXLVII.

   [153] Sprenger has a long chapter on this disease of Mohammed, which he
   calls with Schönlein, hysteria muscularis I. 207-268.

   [154] Sprenger discusses the question, and answers it in the
   affirmative, Vol. II. 398 sqq. The Koran (29) says: "Formerly [before I
   sent down the book, i.e. the Koran] thou didst not read any book nor
   write one with thy right hand!" From this, some Moslems infer that
   after the reception of the Koran, he was supernaturally taught to read
   and write; but others hold that he was ignorant of both. Syed Ahmed
   Khan Bahador says: "Not the least doubt now exists that the Prophet was
   wholly unacquainted with the art of writing, being also, as a matter of
   course (?), unable to read the hand-writing of others; for which
   reason, and for this only, be was called Ummee" (illiterate).

   [155] Sprenger attributes his faithfulness to Chadyga (as he spells the
   name) not to his merit, but to his dependence. She kept her fortune
   under her own control, and gave him only as much as he needed.

   [156] So Sprenger,III. 221. Others give seven hundred and ninety as the
   number of Jews who were beheaded in a ditch.

   [157] See Sprenger, III. 552 sqq., Muir, IV. 270 sqq.

   [158] This absurd story, circumstantially described by Abulfeda, is
   probably based on a dream which Mohammed himself relates in the Koran,
   Sura 17, entitled The Night Journey: "Glory be to Him who carried his
   servant by night from the sacred temple of Mecca to the temple that is
   remote" [i.e. in Jerusalem]. In the Dome of the Rock on Mount Moriah,
   the hand-prints of the angel Gabriel are shown in the mysterious rock
   which attempted to follow Mohammed to its native quarry in Paradise,
   but was kept back by the angel!

   [159] See an interesting essay on the "Miracles of Mohammed" in
   Tholuck's Miscellaneous Essays (1839), Vol. I., pp. 1-27. Also Muir,
   I., pp. 65 sqq.; Sprenger, II. 413 sqq.

   [160] He speaks freely of this subject in the Koran, Sur. 4, and 33. In
   the latter (Rodman's transl., p. 508) this scandalous passage occurs:
   "O Prophet! we allow thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered, and the
   slaves whom thy right hand possesseth out of the booty which God hath
   granted thee, and the daughters of thy uncle, and of thy paternal and
   maternal aunts who fled with thee to Medina, and any believing woman
   who hath given herself up to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to wed
   her, a privilege for thee above the rest of the faithful." Afterwards
   in the same Sura (p. 569) he says: "Ye must not trouble the Apostle of
   God, nor marry his wives after him forever. This would be a grave
   offence with God."

   [161] Sprenger, III. 61-87, gives a full account of fourteen wives of
   Mohammed, and especially of Ayesha, according to the list of Zohry and
   Ibn Saad. Sprenger says, p. 37: "Der Prophet hatte keine Wohnung für
   sich selbst. Sein Hauptquartier war in der Hütte der Ayischa und die
   öffentlichen Geschäfte verrichtete er in der Moschee, aber er brachte
   jede Nacht bei einer seiner Frauen zu und war, wie es scheint, auch ihr
   Gast beim Essen. Er ging aber täglich, wenn er bei guter Laune war, bei
   allen seinen Frauen umher, gab jeder einen Kuss, sprach einige Worte
   und spielte mit ihr. Wir haben gesehen, dass seine Familie neun Hütten
   besass, dies war auch die, Anzahl der Frauen, welche er bei seinem Tode
   hinterliess. Doch gab es Zeiten, zu denen sein Harem stärker war. Er
   brachte dann einige seiner Schönen in den Häusern von Nachbarn unter.
   Es kam auch vor, dass zwei Frauen eine Hütte bewohnten.
   Stiefkinderwohnten, so lange sie jung waren, bei ihren Müttern."

   § 43. The Conquests of Islâm.

   "The sword," says Mohammed, "is the key of heaven and hell; a drop of
   blood shed in the cause of Allah, a night spent in arms, is of more
   avail than two months of fasting or prayer: whosoever falls in battle,
   his sins are forgiven, and at the day of judgment his limbs shall be
   supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim." This is the secret of
   his success. Idolaters had to choose between Islâm, slavery, and death;
   Jews and Christians were allowed to purchase a limited toleration by
   the payment of tribute, but were otherwise kept in degrading bondage.
   History records no soldiers of greater bravery inspired by religion
   than the Moslem conquerors, except Cromwell's Ironsides, and the Scotch
   Covenanters, who fought with purer motives for a nobler cause.

   The Califs, Mohammed's successors, who like him united the priestly and
   kingly dignity, carried on his conquests with the battle-cry: "Before
   you is paradise, behind you are death and hell." Inspired by an intense
   fanaticism, and aided by the weakness of the Byzantine empire and the
   internal distractions of the Greek Church, the wild sons of the desert,
   who were content with the plainest food, and disciplined in the school
   of war, hardship and recklessness of life, subdued Palestine, Syria,
   and Egypt, embracing the classical soil of primitive Christianity.
   Thousands of Christian churches in the patriarchal dioceses of
   Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria, were ruthlessly destroyed, or
   converted into mosques. Twenty-one years after the death of Mohammed
   the Crescent ruled over a realm as large as the Roman Empire. Even
   Constantinople was besieged twice (668 and 717), although in vain. The
   terrible efficacy of the newly invented "Greek fire," and the unusual
   severity of a long winter defeated the enemy, and saved Eastern and
   Northern Europe from the blight of the Koran. A large number of nominal
   Christians who had so fiercely quarreled with each other about
   unfruitful subtleties of their creeds, surrendered their faith to the
   conqueror. In 707 the North African provinces, where once St. Augustin
   had directed the attention of the church to the highest problems of
   theology and religion, fell into the hands of the Arabs.

   In 711 they crossed from Africa to Spain and established an independent
   Califate at Cordova. The moral degeneracy and dissensions of the
   Western Goths facilitated their subjugation. Encouraged by such
   success, the Arabs crossed the Pyrenees and boasted that they would
   soon stable their horses in St. Peter's cathedral in Rome, but the
   defeat of Abd-er Rahman by Charles Martel between Poitiers and Tours in
   732--one hundred and ten years after the Hegira--checked their progress
   in the West, and in 1492--the same year in which Columbus discovered a
   new Continent--Ferdinand defeated the last Moslem army in Spain at the
   gates of Granada and drove them back to Africa. The palace and citadel
   of the Alhambra, with its court of lions, its delicate arabesques and
   fretwork, and its aromatic gardens and groves, still remains, a
   gorgeous ruin of the power of the Moorish kings.

   In the East the Moslems made new conquests. In the ninth century they
   subdued Persia, Afghanistan, and a large part of India. They reduced
   the followers of Zoroaster to a few scattered communities, and
   conquered a vast territory of Brahminism and Buddhism even beyond the
   Ganges. The Seliuk Turks in the eleventh century, and the Mongols in
   the thirteenth, adopted the religion of the Califs whom they conquered.
   Constantinople fell at last into the hands of the Turks in 1453, and
   the magnificent church of St. Sophia, the glory of Justinian's reign,
   was turned into a mosque where the Koran is read instead of the Gospel,
   the reader holding the drawn scimetar in his hand. From Constantinople
   the Turks threatened the German empire, and it was not till 1683 that
   they were finally defeated by Sobieski at the gates of Vienna and
   driven back across the Danube.

   With the senseless fury of fanaticism and pillage the Tartar Turks have
   reduced the fairest portions of Eastern Europe to desolation and ruin.
   With sovereign contempt for all other religions, they subjected the
   Christians to a condition of virtual servitude, treating them like
   "dogs," as they call them. They did not intermeddle with their internal
   affairs, but made merchandise of ecclesiastical offices. The death
   penalty was suspended over every attempt to convert a Mussulman.
   Apostasy from the faith is also treason to the state, and merits the
   severest punishment in this world, as well as everlasting damnation in
   the world to come.

   After the Crimean war in 1856, the death penalty for apostasy was
   nominally abolished in the dominions of the Sultan, and in the Berlin
   Treaty of 1878 liberty of religion (more than mere toleration) was
   guaranteed to all existing sects in the Turkish empire, but the old
   fanaticism will yield only to superior force, and the guarantee of
   liberty is not understood to imply the liberty of propaganda among
   Moslems. Christian sects have liberty to prey on each other, but woe to
   them if they invade the sacred province of Islâm. [162]

   A Mohammedan tradition contains a curious prophecy that Christ, the son
   of Mary, will return as the last Calif to judge the world. [163] The
   impression is gaining ground among the Moslems that they will be unable
   ultimately to withstand the steady progress of Christianity and Western
   civilization. The Sultan, the successor of the Califs, is a mere shadow
   on the throne trembling for his life. The dissolution of the Turkish
   empire, which may be looked for at no distant future, will break the
   backbone of lslâm, and open the way for the true solution of the
   Eastern question--the moral regeneration of the Lands of the Bible by
   the Christianity of the Bible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [162] If Protestant missionaries enjoy more toleration and liberty in
   Turkey than in Roman Catholic Austria and in Greek Catholic Russia, it
   must be understood with the above limitation. Turkish toleration
   springs from proud contempt of Christianity in all its forms; Russian
   and Austrian intolerance, from despotism and bigoted devotion to a
   particular form of Christianity.

   [163] Among the traditional sayings of Mohammed is this (Gerock, l.c.,
   p. 132): "I am nearest to Jesus, both as to the beginning and the end;
   for there is no prophet between me and Jesus; and at the end of time he
   will be my representative and my successor. The prophets are all
   brethren, as they have one father, though their mothers are different.
   The origin of all their religions is the same, and between me and Jesus
   there is no other prophet!'
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 44. The Koran, and the Bible.

   "Mohammed's truth lay in a sacred Book,

   Christ's in a holy Life."--Milnes (Palm-Leaves).

   The Koran [164] is the sacred book, the Bible of the Mohammedans. It is
   their creed, their code of laws, their liturgy. It claims to be the
   product of divine inspiration by the arch-angel Gabriel, who performed
   the function assigned to the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures. [165] The
   Mohammedans distinguish two kinds of revelations: those which were
   literally delivered as spoken by the angel (called Wahee Matloo, or the
   word of God), and those which give the sense of the inspired
   instruction in the prophet's own words (called Wahee Ghair Matloo, or
   Hadees). The prophet is named only five times, but is addressed by
   Gabriel all through the book with the word Say, as the recipient and
   sacred penman of the revelations. It consists of 114 Suras [166] and
   6,225 verses. Each Sura (except the ninth) begins with the formula (of
   Jewish origin): "In the name of Allah, the God of Mercy, the Merciful."
   [167]

   The Koran is composed in imperfect metre and rhyme (which is as natural
   and easy in the Arabic as in the Italian language). Its language is
   considered the purest Arabic. Its poetry somewhat resembles Hebrew
   poetry in Oriental imagery and a sort of parallelism or correspondence
   of clauses, but it loses its charm in a translation; while the Psalms
   and Prophets can be reproduced in any language without losing their
   original force and beauty. The Koran is held in superstitious
   veneration, and was regarded till recently as too sacred to be
   translated and to be sold like a common book. [168]

   Mohammed prepared and dictated the Koran from time to time as he
   received the revelations and progressed in his career, not for readers,
   but for hearers, leaving much to the suggestive action of the public
   recital, either from memory or from copies taken down by his friends.
   Hence its occasional, fragmentary character. About a year after his
   death, at the direction of Abu-Bakr, his father-in-law and immediate
   successor, Zayd, the chief ansar or amanuensis of the Prophet,
   collected the scattered fragments of the Koran "from palm-leaves, and
   tablets of white stone, and from the breasts of men," but without any
   regard to chronological order or continuity of subjects. Abu-Bakr
   committed this copy to the custody of Haphsa, one of Mohammed's widows.
   It remained the standard during the ten years of Omar's califate. As
   the different readings of copies occasioned serious disputes, Zayd,
   with several Koreish, was commissioned to secure the purity of the text
   in the Meccan dialect, and all previous copies were called in and
   burned. The recension of Zayd has been handed down with scrupulous care
   unaltered to this day, and various readings are almost unknown; the
   differences being confined to the vowel-points, which were invented at
   a later period. The Koran contains many inconsistencies and
   contradictions; but the expositors hold that the later command
   supersedes the earlier.

   The restoration of the chronological order of the Suras is necessary
   for a proper understanding of the gradual development of Islâm in the
   mind and character of its author. [169] There is a considerable
   difference between the Suras of the earlier, middle, and later periods.
   In the earlier, the poetic, wild, and rhapsodical element predominates;
   in the middle, the prosaic, narrative, and missionary; in the later,
   the official and legislative. Mohammed began with descriptions of
   natural objects, of judgment, of heaven and hell, impassioned,
   fragmentary utterances, mostly in brief sentences; he went on to
   dogmatic assertions, historical statements from Jewish and Christian
   sources, missionary appeals and persuasions; and he ended with the
   dictatorial commands of a legislator and warrior. "He who at Mecca is
   the admonisher and persuader, at Medina is the legislator and the
   warrior, who dictates obedience and uses other weapons than the pen of
   the poet and the scribe. When business pressed, as at Medina, poetry
   makes way for prose, [170] and although touches of the poetical element
   occasionally break forth, and he has to defend himself up to a very
   late period against the charge of being merely a poet, yet this is
   rarely the case in the Medina Suras; and we are startled by finding
   obedience to God and the Apostle, God's gifts and the Apostle's, God's
   pleasure and the Apostle's, spoken of in the same breath, and epithets,
   and attributes, applied to Allah, openly applied to Mohammed, as in
   Sura IX." [171]

   The materials of the Koran, as far as they are not productions of the
   author's own imagination, were derived from the floating traditions of
   Arabia and Syria, from rabbinical Judaism, and a corrupt Christianity,
   and adjusted to his purposes.

   Mohammed had, in his travels, come in contact with professors of
   different religions, and on his first journey with camel-drivers he
   fell in with a Nestorian monk of Bostra, who goes by different names
   (Bohari, Bahyra, Sergius, George), and welcomed the youthful prophet
   with a presage of his future greatness. [172] His wife Chadijah and her
   cousin Waraka (a reputed convert to Christianity, or more probably a
   Jew) are said to have been well acquainted with the sacred books of the
   Jews and the Christians.

   The Koran, especially in the earlier Suras, speaks often and highly of
   the Scriptures; calls them "the Book of God," "the Word of God," "the
   Tourât" (Thora, the Pentateuch), "the Gospel" (Ynyil), and describes
   the Jews and Christians as "the people of the Book," or "of the
   Scripture," or "of the Gospel." It finds in the Scriptures prophecies
   of Mohammed and his success, and contains narratives of the fall of
   Adam and Eve, Noah and the Deluge, Abraham and Lot, the destruction of
   Sodom and Gomorrah, Moses and Joseph, John the Baptist, the Virgin Mary
   and Jesus, sometimes in the words of the Bible, but mostly distorted
   and interspersed with rabbinical and apocryphal fables. [173]

   It is quite probable that portions of the Bible were read to Mohammed;
   but it is very improbable that he read it himself; for according to the
   prevailing Moslem tradition he could not read at all, and there were no
   Arabic translations before the Mohammedan conquests, which spread the
   Arabic language in the conquered countries. Besides, if he had read the
   Bible with any degree of care, he could not have made such egregious
   blunders. The few allusions to Scripture phraseology--as "giving alms
   to be seen of men," "none forgiveth sins but God only"--may be derived
   from personal intercourse and popular traditions. Jesus (Isa) is spoken
   of as "the Son of Mary, strengthened by the Holy Spirit." Noah (Nûh),
   Abraham (Ibrahym), Moses (Mûsa), Aaron (Harun), are often honorably
   mentioned, but apparently always from imperfect traditional or
   apocryphal sources of information. [174]

   The Koran is unquestionably one of the great books of the world. It is
   not only a book, but an institution, a code of civil and religious
   laws, claiming divine origin and authority. It has left its impress
   upon ages. It feeds to this day the devotions, and regulates the
   private and public life, of more than a hundred millions of human
   beings. It has many passages of poetic beauty, religious fervor, and
   wise counsel, but mixed with absurdities, bombast, unmeaning images,
   low sensuality. It abounds in repetitions and contradictions, which are
   not removed by the convenient theory of abrogation. It alternately
   attracts and repels, and is a most wearisome book to read. Gibbon calls
   the Koran "a glorious testimony to the unity of God," but also, very
   properly, an "endless, incoherent rhapsody of fable and precept and
   declamation, which seldom excites a sentiment or idea, which sometimes
   crawls in the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds." [175] Reiske
   [176] denounces it as the most absurd book and a scourge to a reader of
   sound common sense. Goethe, one of the best judges of literary and
   poetic merit, characterizes the style as severe, great, terrible, and
   at times truly sublime. "Detailed injunctions," he says, "of things
   allowed and forbidden, legendary stories of Jewish and Christian
   religion, amplifications of all kinds, boundless tautologies and
   repetitions, form the body of this sacred volume, which to us, as often
   as we approach it, is repellent anew, next attracts us ever anew, and
   fills us with admiration, and finally forces us into veneration." He
   finds the kernel of Islâm in the second Sura, where belief and unbelief
   with heaven and hell, as their sure reward, are contrasted. Carlyle
   calls the Koran "the confused ferment of a great rude human soul; rude,
   untutored, that cannot even read, but fervent, earnest, struggling
   vehemently to utter itself In words;" and says of Mohammedanism: "Call
   it not false, look not at the falsehood of it; look at the truth of it.
   For these twelve centuries it has been the religion and life-guidance
   of the fifth part of the whole kindred of mankind. Above all, it has
   been a religion heartily believed." But with all his admiration,
   Carlyle confesses that the reading of the Koran in English is "as
   toilsome a task" as he ever undertook. "A wearisome, confused jumble,
   crude, incondite; endless iterations, long-windedness, entanglement;
   insupportable stupidity, in short, nothing but a sense of duty could
   carry any European through the Koran. We read it, as we might in the
   State-Paper Office, unreadable masses of lumber, that we may get some
   glimpses of a remarkable man." And yet there are Mohammedan doctors who
   are reported to have read the Koran seventy thousand times! What a
   difference of national and religious taste! Emanuel Deutsch finds the
   grandeur of the Koran chiefly in its Arabic diction, "the peculiarly
   dignified, impressive, sonorous nature of Semitic sound and parlance;
   its sesquipedalia verba, with their crowd of prefixes and affixes, each
   of them affirming its own position, while consciously bearing upon and
   influencing the central root, which they envelop like a garment of many
   folds, or as chosen courtiers move round the anointed person of the
   king." E. H. Palmer says that the claim of the Koran to miraculous
   eloquence, however absurd it may sound to Western ears, was and is to
   the Arab incontrovertible, and he accounts for the immense influence
   which it has always exercised upon the Arab mind, by the fact, "that it
   consists not merely of the enthusiastic utterances of an individual,
   but of the popular sayings, choice pieces of eloquence, and favorite
   legends current among the desert tribes for ages before this time.
   Arabic authors speak frequently of the celebrity attained by the
   ancient Arabic orators, such as Shâibân Wâil; but unfortunately no
   specimens of their works have come down to us. The Qur'ân, however,
   enables us to judge of the speeches which took so strong a hold upon
   their countrymen." [177]

   Of all books, not excluding the Vedas, the Koran is the most powerful
   rival of the Bible, but falls infinitely below it in contents and form.

   Both contain the moral and religious code of the nations which own it;
   the Koran, like the Old Testament, is also a civil and political code.
   Both are oriental in style and imagery. Both have the fresh character
   of occasional composition growing out of a definite historical
   situation and specific wants. But the Bible is the genuine revelation
   of the only true God in Christ, reconciling the world to himself; the
   Koran is a mock-revelation without Christ and without atonement.
   Whatever is true in the Koran is borrowed from the Bible; what is
   original, is false or frivolous. The Bible is historical and embodies
   the noblest aspirations of the human race in all ages to the final
   consummation; the Koran begins and stops with Mohammed. The Bible
   combines endless variety with unity, universal applicability with local
   adaptation; the Koran is uniform and monotonous, confined to one
   country, one state of society, and one class of minds. The Bible is the
   book of the world, and is constantly travelling to the ends of the
   earth, carrying spiritual food to all races and to all classes of
   society; the Koran stays in the Orient, and is insipid to all who have
   once tasted the true word of the living God. [178] Even the poetry of
   the Koran never rises to the grandeur and sublimity of Job or Isaiah,
   the lyric beauty of the Psalms, the sweetness and loveliness of the
   Song of Solomon, the sententious wisdom of the Proverbs, and
   Ecclesiastes.

   A few instances must suffice for illustration.

   The first Sura, called "the Sura of Praise and Prayer," which is
   recited by the Mussulmans several times in each of the five daily
   devotions, fills for them the place of the Lord's Prayer, and contains
   the same number of petitions. We give it in a rhymed, and in a more
   literal translation:


   "In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!

   Praise be to Allah, who the three worlds made,

   The Merciful, the Compassionate,

   The King of the day of Fate,

   Thee alone do we worship, and of Thee alone do we ask aid.

   Guide us to the path that is straight --

   The path of those to whom Thy love is great,

   Not those on whom is hate,

   Nor they that deviate! Amen. [179]


   "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

   Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!

   The Compassionate, the Merciful!

   King on the day of judgment!

   Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.

   Guide Thou us on the right path,

   The path of those to whom Thou art gracious;

   Not of those with whom Thou art angered,

   Nor of those who go astray." [180]

   We add the most recent version in prose:

   "In the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

   Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds, the merciful, the
   compassionate, the ruler of the day of judgment! Thee we serve and Thee
   we ask for aid. Guide us in the right path, the path of those Thou art
   gracious to; not of those Thou art wroth with; nor of those who err."
   [181]

   As this Sura invites a comparison with the Lord's Prayer infinitely to
   the advantage of the latter, so do the Koran's descriptions of Paradise
   when contrasted with St. John's vision of the heavenly Jerusalem:


   "Joyous on that day shall be the inmates of Paradise in their employ;

   In shades, on bridal couches reclining, they and their spouses:

   Therein shall they have fruits, and whatever they require --

   'Peace!' shall be the word on the part of a merciful Lord.

   But be ye separated this day, O ye sinners!" [182]


   "The sincere servants of God

   A stated banquet shall they have

   Of fruits; and honored shall they be

   In the gardens of delight,

   Upon couches face to face.

   A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain,

   Limpid, delicious to those who drink;

   It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken,

   And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances,
   fair like the sheltered egg." [183]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [164] Arabic qurân, i.e. the reading or that which should be read, the
   book. It is read over and over again in all the mosques and schools.

   [165] Sura 53 (Rodwell, p. 64): "The Koran is no other than a
   revelation revealed to him: One terrible in power [Gabriel, i.e. the
   Strong one of God] taught it him.
   Endued with wisdom, with even balance stood he In the highest part of
   the horizon. He came nearer and approached, And was at the distance of
   two bows, or even closer,-- And he revealed to his servant what he
   revealed." I add the view of a learned modern Mohammedan, Syed Ahmed
   Khan Babador, who says (l.c., Essay on the Holy Koran): "The Holy Koran
   was delivered to Mohammed neither in the form of graven tablets of
   stone, nor in that of cloven tongues of fire; nor was it necessary that
   the followers of Mohammed, like those of Moses, should be furnished
   with a copy or counterpart, in case the original should be lost. No
   mystery attended the delivery of it, for it was on Mohammed's heart
   that it was engraven, and it was with his tongue that it was
   communicated to all Arabia. The heart of Mohammed was the Sinai where
   he received the revelation, and his tablets of stone were the hearts of
   true believers."

   [166] Sura means either revelation, or chapter, or part of a chapter.
   The Mohammedan commentators refer it primarily to the succession of
   subjects or parts, like the rows of bricks in a wall. The titles of the
   Suras are generally taken from some leading topic or word in each, as
   "The Sun," "The Star," "The Charges," "The Scattering," "The
   Adoration," "The Spider," "Women," "Hypocrites," "Light," "Jonas," "The
   Cave," "The Night Journey," "The Cow," "The Battle," "The Victory."

   [167] 7 "Bismillahi 'rrahonani 'rrahim." According to the Ulama (the
   professors of religion and law), "God of mercy" means merciful in great
   things; "the Merciful" means merciful in small things. But, according
   to E. W. Lane, "the first expresses an occasional sensation, the second
   a constant quality!" In other words, the one refers to acts, the other
   to a permanent attribute.

   [168] These scruples are gradually giving way, at least in India, where
   "printed copies, with inter-lineal versions in Persian and Urdoo--too
   literal to be intelligible--are commonly used." Muir, The Corân, p. 48.
   The manuscript copies in the mosques, in the library of the Khedive in
   Cairo, and in many European libraries, are equal in caligraphic beauty
   to the finest mediaeval manuscripts of the Bible.

   [169] The present order, Says Muir (Corân, p. 41), is almost a direct
   inversion of the natural chronological order; the longest which mostly
   belong to the later period of Mohammed, being placed first and the
   shortest last. Weil, Sprenger, and Muir have paid much attention to the
   chronological arrangement. Nöldeke also, in his Geschichte des Qôrans,
   has fixed the order of the Suras, with a reasonable degree of certainty
   on the basis of Mohammedan traditions and a searching analysis of the
   text; and he has been mainly followed by Rodwell in his English
   version.

   throughout.

   [173] See a collection of these correspondences in the original Arabic

   that Mohammed knew the Bible, and believed in its divine origin and
   authority.

   [174] Muir (Life, II. 313, 278) and Stanley (p. 366) adduce, as traces
   of a faint knowledge of the Canonical Gospels, the account of the birth
   of John the Baptist in the Koran, and the assumption by Mohammed of the
   name of Paracletus under the distorted form of Periclytus, the
   Illustrious. But the former does not strike me as being taken from St.
   Luke, else he could not have made such a glaring chronological mistake
   as to identify Mary with Miriam, the sister of Moses. And as to the
   promise of the Paraclete, which only occurs in St. John, it certainly
   must have passed into popular tradition, for the word occurs also in
   the Talmud. If Mohammed had read St. John, he must have seen that the
   Paraclete is the Holy Spirit, and would have identified him with
   Gabriel, rather than with himself. Palmer's opinion is that Mohammed
   could neither read nor write, but acquired his knowledge from the
   traditions which were then current in Arabia among Jewish and Christian

   § 45. The Mohammedan Religion.

   lslâm is not a new religion, nor can we expect a new one after the
   appearance of that religion which is perfect and intended for all
   nations and ages. It is a compound or mosaic of preëxisting elements, a
   rude attempt to combine heathenism, Judaism and Christianity, which
   Mohammed found in Arabia, but in a very imperfect form. [184] It is
   professedly, a restoration of the faith of Abraham, the common father
   of Isaac and of Ishmael. But it is not the genuine faith of Abraham
   with its Messianic hopes and aspirations looking directly to the gospel
   dispensation as its goal and fulfilment, but a bastard Judaism of
   Ishmael, and the post-Christian and anti-Christian Judaism of the
   Talmud. Still less did Mohammed know the pure religion of Jesus as laid
   down in the New Testament, but only a perversion and caricature of it
   such as we find in the wretched apocryphal and heretical Gospels. This
   ignorance of the Bible and the corruptions of Eastern Christianity with
   which the Mohammedans came in contact, furnish some excuse for their
   misbelief and stubborn prejudices. And yet even the poor pseudo-Jewish
   and pseudo-Christian elements of the Koran were strong enough to reform
   the old heathenism of Arabia and Africa and to lift it to a much higher
   level. The great and unquestionable merit of Islâm is the breaking up
   of idolatry and the diffusion of monotheism.

   The creed of Islâm is simple, and consists of six articles: God,
   predestination, the angels (good and bad), the books, the prophets, the
   resurrection and judgment with eternal reward and eternal punishment.

   God.

   Monotheism is the comer-stone of the system. It is expressed in the
   ever-repeated sentence: "There is no god but God (Allâh, i.e., the
   true, the only God), and Mohammed is his prophet (or apostle)." [185]
   Gibbon calls this a "compound of an eternal truth and a necessary
   fiction." The first clause certainly is a great and mighty truth
   borrowed from the Old Testament (Deut. 6:4); and is the religious
   strength of the system. But the Mohammedan (like the later Jewish, the
   Socinian, and the Unitarian) monotheism is abstract, monotonous,
   divested of inner life and fulness, anti-trinitarian, and so far
   anti-Christian. One of the last things which a Mohammedan will admit,
   is the divinity of Christ. Many of the divine attributes are vividly
   apprehended, emphasized and repeated in prayer. But Allah is a God of
   infinite power and wisdom, not a God of redeeming love to all mankind;
   a despotic sovereign of trembling subjects and slaves, not a loving
   Father of trustful children. He is an object of reverence and fear
   rather than of love and gratitude. He is the God of fate who has
   unalterably foreordained all things evil as well as good; hence
   unconditional resignation to him (this is the meaning of Islâm) is true
   wisdom and piety. He is not a hidden, unknowable being, but a God who
   has revealed himself through chosen messengers, angelic and human.
   Adam, Noah, Abraham Moses, and Jesus are his chief prophets. [186] But
   Mohammed is the last and the greatest.

   Christ.

   The Christology of the Koran is a curious mixture of facts and
   apocryphal fictions, of reverence for the man Jesus and denial of his
   divine character. He is called "the Messiah Jesus Son of Mary," or "the
   blessed Son of Mary." [187] He was a servant and apostle of the one
   true God, and strengthened by the Holy Spirit, i.e., the angel Gabriel
   (Dshebril), who afterwards conveyed the divine revelations to Mohammed.
   But he is not the Son of God; for as God has no wife, he can have no
   son. [188] He is ever alone, and it is monstrous and blasphemous to
   associate another being with Allah.

   Some of the Mohammedan divines exempt Jesus and even his mother from
   sin, and first proclaimed the dogma of the immaculate conception of
   Mary, for which the apocryphal Gospels prepared the way. [189] By a
   singular anachronism, the Koran confounds the Virgin Mary with Miriam,"
   the sister of Aaron" (Harun), and Moses (Ex. xv. 20; Num. xxi. 1).
   Possibly Mohammed may have meant another Aaron (since he calls Mary,
   "the sister of Aaron but not "of Moses"); some of his commentators,
   however, assume that the sister of Moses was miraculously preserved to
   give birth to Jesus. [190]

   According to the Koran Jesus was conceived by the Virgin Mary at the
   appearance of Gabriel and born under a palm tree beneath which a
   fountain opened. This story is of Ebionite origin. [191] Jesus preached
   in the cradle and performed miracles in His infancy (as in the
   apocryphal Gospels), and during His public ministry, or rather Allah
   wrought miracles through Him. Mohammed disclaims the miraculous power,
   and relied upon the stronger testimony of the truth of his doctrine.
   Jesus proclaimed the pure doctrine of the unity of God and disclaimed
   divine honors.

   The crucifixion of Jesus is denied. He was delivered by a miracle from
   the death intended for Him, and taken up by God into Paradise with His
   mother. The Jews slew one like Him, by mistake. This absurd docetic
   idea is supposed to be the common belief of Christians. [192]

   Jesus predicted the coming of Mohammed, when he said: "O children of
   Israel! of a truth I am God's apostle to you to confirm the law which
   was given before me, and to announce an apostle that shall come after
   me whose name shall be Ahmed!" [193] Thus the promise of the Holy
   Ghost, "the other Paraclete," (John xiv. 16) was applied by Mohammed to
   himself by a singular confusion of Paracletos (paravklhto") with
   Periclytos (perivkluto", heard all round, famous) or Ahmed (the
   glorified, the illustrious), one of the prophet's names. [194]

   Owing to this partial recognition of Christianity Mohammed was
   originally regarded not as the founder of a new religion, but as one of
   the chief heretics. [195] The same opinion is expressed by several
   modern writers, Catholic and Protestant. Döllinger says: "Islâm must be
   considered at bottom a Christian heresy, the bastard offspring of a
   Christian father and a Jewish mother, and is indeed more closely allied
   to Christianity than Manichaeism, which is reckoned a Christian sect."
   [196] Stanley calls Islâm an "eccentric heretical form of Eastern
   Christianity," and Ewald more correctly, "the last and most powerful
   offshoot of Gnosticism." [197]

   The Ethics of IslÂm.

   Resignation (Islâm) to the omnipotent will of Allah is the chief
   virtue. It is the most powerful motive both in action and suffering,
   and is carried to the excess of fatalism and apathy.

   The use of pork and wine is strictly forbidden; prayer, fasting
   (especially during the whole month of Ramadhân), and almsgiving are
   enjoined. Prayer carries man half-way to God, fasting brings him to the
   door of God's palace, alms secure admittance. The total abstinence from
   strong drink by the whole people, even in countries where the vine
   grows in abundance, reveals a remarkable power of self-control, which
   puts many Christian nations to shame. Mohammedanism is a great
   temperance society. Herein lies its greatest moral force.

   Polygamy.

   But on the other hand the heathen vice of polygamy and concubinage is
   perpetuated and encouraged by the example of the prophet. He restrained
   and regulated an existing practice, and gave it the sanction of
   religion. Ordinary believers are restricted to four wives (exclusive of
   slaves), and generally have only one or two. But Califs may fill their
   harems to the extent of their wealth and lust. Concubinage with female
   slaves is allowed to all without limitation. The violation of captive
   women of the enemy is the legitimate reward of the conqueror. The laws
   of divorce and prohibited degrees are mostly borrowed from the Jews,
   but divorce is facilitated and practiced to an extent that utterly
   demoralizes married life.

   Polygamy and servile concubinage destroy the dignity of woman, and the
   beauty and peace of home. In all Mohammedan countries woman is ignorant
   and degraded; she is concealed from public sight by a veil (a sign of
   degradation as well as protection); she is not commanded to pray, and
   is rarely seen in the mosques; it is even an open question whether she
   has a soul, but she is necessary even in paradise for the gratification
   of man's passion. A Moslem would feel insulted by an inquiry after the
   health of his wife or wives. Polygamy affords no protection against
   unnatural vices, which are said to prevail to a fearful extent among
   Mohammedans, as they did among the ancient heathen. [198]

   In nothing is the infinite superiority of Christianity over Islâm so
   manifest as in the condition of woman and family life. Woman owes
   everything to the religion of the gospel.

   The sensual element pollutes even the Mohammedan picture of heaven from
   which chastity is excluded. The believers are promised the joys of a
   luxuriant paradise amid blooming gardens, fresh fountains, and
   beautiful virgins. Seventy-two Houris, or black-eyed girls of blooming
   youth will be created for the enjoyment of the meanest believer; a
   moment of pleasure will be prolonged to a thousand years; and his
   faculties will be increased a hundred fold. Saints and martyrs will be
   admitted to the spiritual joys of the divine vision. But infidels and
   those who refuse to fight for their faith will be cast into hell.

   The Koran distinguishes seven heavens, and seven hells (for wicked or
   apostate Mohammedans, Christians, Jews, Sabians, Magians, idolaters,
   hypocrites). Hell (Jahennem=Gehenna) is beneath the lowest earth and
   seas of darkness; the bridge over it is finer than a hair and sharper
   than the edge of a sword; the pious pass over it in a moment, the
   wicked fall from it into the abyss.

   Slavery.

   Slavery is recognized and sanctioned as a normal condition of society,
   and no hint is given in the Koran, nor any effort made by Mohammedan
   rulers for its final extinction. It is the twin-sister of polygamy;
   every harem is a slave-pen or a slave-palace. "The Koran, as a
   universal revelation, would have been a perpetual edict of servitude."
   Mohammed, by ameliorating the condition of slaves, and enjoining kind
   treatment upon the masters, did not pave the way for its abolition, but
   rather riveted its fetters. The barbarous slave-trade is still carried
   on in all its horrors by Moslems among the negroes in Central Africa.

   War.

   War against unbelievers is legalized by the Koran. The fighting men are
   to be slain, the women and children reduced to slavery. Jews and
   Christians are dealt with more leniently than idolaters; but they too
   must be thoroughly humbled and forced to pay tribute.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] Luther said of the religion of the Turks: "Also ist's ein Glaub
   zusammengeflickt aus der Jüden, Christen und Heiden Glaube." Milman
   (II. 139) calls Mohammedanism "the republication of a more
   comprehensive Judaism with some depraved forms of Christianity." Renan
   describes it as "the least original" of the religious creations of
   humanity. Geiger and Deutsch (both Hebrews) give prominence to the
   Jewish element. "It is not merely parallelisms," says Deutsch,
   "reminiscences, allusions, technical terms, and the like, of Judaism,
   its lore and dogma and ceremony, its Halacha and Haggadah (which may
   most briefly be rendered by 'Law' and 'Legend'), which we find in the
   Koran; but we think Islâm neither more nor less than Judaism as adapted
   to Arabia--plus the apostleship of Jesus and Mohammed. Nay, we verily
   believe that a great deal of such Christianity as has found its way
   into the Koran, has found it through Jewish channels" (l.c. p. 64).

   [185] Lâ ilâha ill' Allâh, wa Muhammeda rrasúlà 'llâh. Allâh is
   composed of the article al, "the," and ilâh, "a god," and is equivalent
   to the Hebrew Eli and Elohim. He was known to the Arabs before
   Mohammed, and regarded as the chief god in their pantheon.

   [186] A similar idea is presented in the pseudo-Clementine Homilies.

   [187] Mesich Isa ben Mariam.

   [188] In rude misconception or wilful perversion, Mohammed seems to
   have understood the Christian doctrine of the trinity to be a trinity
   of Father, Mary, and Jesus. The Holy Spirit is identified with Gabriel.
   "God is only one God! Far be it from his glory that he should have a
   son!" Sura 4, ver. 169; comp. 5, ver. 77. The designation and worship
   of Mary as "the mother of God" may have occasioned this strange
   mistake. There was in Arabia in the fourth century a sect of fanatical
   women called Collyridians (Kollurides), who rendered divine worship to
   Mary. Epiphanius, Haer. 79.·

   [189] As the Protevangelium Jacobi, the Evang. de Nativitate Mariae,
   the Evang. Infantis Servatoris, etc. Gibbon (ch. 50) and Stanley (p.
   367) trace the doctrine of the immaculate conception directly to the
   Koran. It is said of Mary: "Remember when the angel said: 'O Mary!
   verily hath God chosen thee, and purified thee, and chosen thee above
   the women of the worlds.' " But this does not necessarily mean more
   than Luke i. 28. The Koran knows nothing of original sin in the
   Christian sense.

   [190] Gerok, l.c. pp. 22-28. This would be a modification of the
   rabbinical fable that ordinary death and corruption had as little power
   over Miriam as over Moses, and that both died by the breath of Jehovah.

   [191] Rösch (l.c., p. 439) Die Geburtsgeschichte Jesu im Koran ist
   nichts anderes als ein mythologischer Mythus aus Ezech. 47 mit
   eingewobenen jüdischen Zügen, der seine Heimath im Ebionismus hat."

   [192] Sura 4. This view of the crucifixion is no doubt derived from
   apocryphal sources. The Gnostic sect of Basilides supposed Simon of
   Cyrene, the Evangel. Barrabae, Judas, to have been that other person
   who was crucified instead of Jesus. Mani (Epist. Fund.) says that the
   prince of darkness was nailed to the cross, and wore the crown of
   thorns.

   [193] Sura 61.

   [194] The Moslems refer also some other passages of Scripture to
   Mohammed and his religion, e.g. Gen. xvi. 10; xvii. 20; xxi. 12, 13;
   xxvii. 20 (the promise of God to bless Hagar and Ishmael); Deut. xviii.
   15, 18 (the promise to raise up a prophet like Moses); Isa. xxi. 67
   (where Mohammed is supposed to be meant by the "rider on the camel," as
   distinct from Jesus, "the rider on the ass"); John iv. 21; 1 John iv.
   23 (where he is the spirit that is of God, because he proclaimed that
   Jesus was a true man, not God); Deut. xxxii.2 (where Sinai is said to
   mean the Jewish, Seir the Christian, and Paran the Mohammedan
   revelation).

   § 46. Mohammedan Worship.


   "A simple, unpartitioned room,

   Surmounted by an ample dome,

   Or, in some Iands that favored he,

   With centre open to the sky,

   But roofed with arched cloisters round,

   That mark the consecrated bound,

   And shade the niche to Mecca turned,

   By which two massive lights are burned;

   With pulpit whence the sacred word

   Expounded on great days is heard;

   With fountains fresh, where, ere they pray,

   Men wash the soil of earth away;

   With shining minaret, thin and high,

   From whose fine trellised balcony,

   Announcement of the hour of prayer

   Is uttered to the silent air:

   Such is the Mosque--the holy place,

   Where faithful men of every race

   Meet at their ease and face to face."

                                      (From Milnes, "Palm Leaves.")

   In worship the prominent feature of Islâm is its extreme iconoclasm and
   puritanism. In this respect, it resembles the service of the synagogue.
   The second commandment is literally understood as a prohibition of all
   representations of living creatures, whether in churches or elsewhere.
   The only ornament allowed is the "Arabesque," which is always taken
   from inanimate nature. [199]

   The ceremonial is very simple. The mosques, like Catholic churches, are
   always open and frequented by worshippers, who perform their devotions
   either alone or in groups with covered head and bare feet. In entering,
   one must take off the shoes according to the command: "Put off thy
   shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
   ground." Slippers or sandals of straw are usually provided for
   strangers, and must be paid for. There are always half a dozen
   claimants for "backsheesh"--the first and the last word which greets
   the traveller in Egypt and Syria. Much importance is attached to
   preaching. [200]

   Circumcision is retained from the Jews, although it is not mentioned in
   the Koran. Friday is substituted for the Jewish Sabbath as the sacred
   day (perhaps because it was previously a day for religious assemblage).
   It is called the prince of days, the most excellent day on which man
   was created, and on which the last judgment will take place; but the
   observance is less strict than that of the Jewish Sabbath. On solemn
   occasions sacrifice, mostly in the nature of a thank-offering, is
   offered and combined with an act of benevolence to the poor. But there
   is no room in Islâm for the idea of atonement; God forgives sins
   directly and arbitrarily, without a satisfaction of justice. Hence
   there is no priesthood in the sense of a hereditary or perpetual caste,
   offering sacrifices and mediating between God and the people. [201] Yet
   there are Mufties and Dervishes, who are as powerful as any class of
   priests and monks. The Mussulmans have their saints, and pray at their
   white tombs. In this respect, they approach the Greeks and Roman
   Catholics; yet they abhor the worship of saints as idolatry. They also
   make much account of religious processions and pilgrimages. Their chief
   place of pilgrimage is Mecca. Many thousands of Moslems from Egypt and
   all parts of Turkey pass annually through the Arabian desert to worship
   at the holy Kaaba, and are received in triumph on their return. The
   supposed tomb of Moses, also, which is transferred to the Western shore
   of the Dead Sea, is visited by the Moslems of Jerusalem and the
   neighboring country in the month of April.

   Prayer with prostrations is reduced to a mechanical act which is
   performed with the regularity of clock work. Washing of hands is
   enjoined before prayer, but in the desert, sand is permitted as a
   substitute for water. There are five stated seasons for prayer: at
   day-break, near noon, in the afternoon, a little after sunset (to avoid
   the appearance of sun-worship), and at night-fall, besides two night
   prayers for extra devotion. The muëddin or muëzzin (crier) announces
   the time of devotion from the minaret of the mosque by chanting the
   "Adan" or call to prayer, in these words:

   God is great!" (four times). "I bear witness that there is no god but
   God" (twice). "I bear witness that Mohammed is the Apostle of God"
   (twice). "Come hither to prayers!" (twice). "Come hither to salvation!"
   (twice). "God is great! There is no other God!" And in the early
   morning the crier adds: "Prayer is better than sleep!"

   A devout Mussulman is never ashamed to perform his devotion in public,
   whether in the mosque, or in the street, or on board the ship.
   Regardless of the surroundings, feeling alone with God in the midst of
   the crowd, his face turned to Mecca, his hands now raised to heaven,
   then laid on the lap, his forehead touching the ground, he goes through
   his genuflexions and prostrations, and repeats the first Sura of the
   Koran and the ninety-nine beautiful names of Allah, which form his
   rosary. [202] The mosques are as well filled with men, as many
   Christian churches are with women. Islâm is a religion for men; women
   are of no account; the education and elevation of the female sex would
   destroy the system.

   With all its simplicity and gravity, the Mohammedan worship has also
   its frantic excitement of the Dervishes. On the celebration of the
   birthday of their prophet and other festivals, they work themselves, by
   the constant repetition of "Allah, Allah," into a state of unconscious
   ecstacy, "in which they plant swords in their breasts, tear live
   serpents with their teeth, eat bottles of glass, and finally lie
   prostrate on the ground for the chief of their order to ride on
   horseback over their bodies." [203]

   I will add a brief description of the ascetic exercises of the
   "Dancing" and "Howling" Dervishes which I witnessed in their convents
   at Constantinople and Cairo in 1877.

   The Dancing or Turning Dervishes in Pera, thirteen in number, some
   looking ignorant and stupid, others devout and intensely fanatical,
   went first through prayers and prostrations, then threw off their outer
   garments, and in white flowing gowns, with high hats of stiff woolen
   stuff, they began to dance to the sound of strange music, whirling
   gracefully and skilfully on their toes, ring within ring, without
   touching each other or moving out of their circle, performing, in four
   different acts, from forty to fifty turnings in one minute, their arms
   stretched out or raised to heaven their eyes half shut, their mind
   apparently lost in a sort of Nirwana or pantheistic absorption in
   Allah. A few hours afterward I witnessed the rare spectacle of one of
   these very Dervishes reeling to and fro in a state of intoxication on
   the street and the lower bridge of the Golden Horn.

   The Howling Dervishes in Scutari present a still more extraordinary
   sight, and a higher degree of ascetic exertion, but destitute of all
   grace and beauty. The performance took place in a small, plain, square
   room, and lasted nearly two hours. As the monks came in, they kissed
   the hand of their leader and repeated with him long prayers from the
   Koran. One recited with melodious voice an Arabic song in praise of
   Mohammed. Then, standing in a row, bowing, and raising their heads,
   they continued to howl the fundamental dogma of Mohammedanism, Lâ ilâha
   ill' Allâh for nearly an hour. Some were utterly exhausted and wet with
   perspiration. The exercises I saw in Cairo were less protracted, but
   more dramatic, as the Dervishes had long hair and stood in a circle,
   swinging their bodies backward and forward in constant succession, and
   nearly touching the ground with their flowing hair. In astounding feats
   of asceticism the Moslems are fully equal to the ancient Christian
   anchorites and the fakirs of India.

   (Die Bestreitung des Islâm im Mittelalter.)

   The argument of Mohammedanism against other religions was the sword.
   Christian Europe replied with the sword in the crusades, but failed.
   Greek and Latin divines refuted the false prophet with superior
   learning, but without rising to a higher providential view, and without
   any perceptible effect. Christian polemics against Mohammed and the
   Koran began in the eighth century, and continued with interruptions to
   the sixteenth and seventeenth.

   John of Damascus, who lived among the Saracens (about a.d. 750), headed
   the line of champions of the cross against the crescent. He was
   followed, in the Greek Church, by Theodor of Abukara, who debated a
   good deal with Mohammedans in Mesopotamia, by Samonas, bishop of Gaza,
   Bartholomew of Edessa, John Kantakuzenus (or rather a monk Meletius,
   formerly a Mohammedan, who justified his conversion, with the aid of
   the emperor, in four apologies and four orations), Euthymius Zigabenus,
   Gennadius, patriarch of Constantinople. Prominent in the Latin church
   were Peter, Abbot of Clugny (twelfth century), Thomas Aquinas, Alanus
   ab Insulis, Raimundus LulIus, Nicolaus of Cusa, Ricold or Richard (a
   Dominican monk who lived long in the East), Savonarola, Joh. de
   Turrecremata.

   The mediaeval writers, both Greek and Latin, represent Mohammed as an
   impostor and arch-heretic, who wove his false religion chiefly from
   Jewish (Talmudic) fables and Christian heresies. They find him foretold
   in the Little Horn of Daniel, and the False Prophet of the Apocalypse.
   They bring him in connection with a Nestorian monk, Sergius, or
   according to others, with the Jacobite Bahira, who instructed Mohammed,
   and might have converted him to the Christian religion, if malignant
   Jews had not interposed with their slanders. Thus he became the shrewd
   and selfish prophet of a pseudo-gospel, which is a mixture of apostate
   Judaism and apostate Christianity with a considerable remnant of his
   native Arabian heathenism. Dante places him, disgustingly torn and
   mutilated, among the chief heretics and schismatics in the ninth gulf
   of Hell,


   "Where is paid the fee

   By those who sowing discord win their burden." [204]

   This mediaeval view was based in part upon an entire ignorance or
   perversion of facts. It was then believed that Mohammedans were pagans
   and idolaters, and cursed the name of Christ, while it is now known,
   that they abhor idolatry, and esteem Christ as the highest prophet next
   to Mohammed.

   The Reformers and older Protestant divines took substantially the same
   view, and condemn the Koran and its author without qualification. We
   must remember that down to the latter part of the seventeenth century
   the Turks were the most dangerous enemies of the peace of Europe.
   Luther published, at Wittenberg, 1540, a German translation of
   Richard's Confutatio Alcorani, with racy notes, to show "what a
   shameful, lying, abominable book the Alcoran is." He calls Mohammed "a
   devil and the first-born child of Satan." He goes into the question,
   whether the Pope or Mohammed be worse, and comes to the conclusion,
   that after all the pope is worse, and the real Anti-Christ
   (Endechrist). "Wohlan," he winds up his epilogue, "God grant us his
   grace and punish both the Pope and Mohammed, together with their
   devils. I have done my part as a true prophet and teacher. Those who
   won't listen may leave it alone." Even the mild and scholarly
   Melanchthon identifies Mohammed with the Little Horn of Daniel, or
   rather with the Gog and Magog of the Apocalypse, and charges his sect
   with being a compound of "blasphemy, robbery, and sensuality." It is
   not very strange. that in the heat of that polemical age the Romanists
   charged the Lutherans, and the Lutherans the Calvinists, and both in
   turn the Romanists, with holding Mohammedan heresies. [205]

   In the eighteenth century this view was gradually corrected. The
   learned Dean Prideaux still represented Mohammed as a vulgar impostor,
   but at the same time as a scourge of God in just punishment of the sins
   of the Oriental churches who turned our holy religion "into a firebrand
   of hell for contention, strife and violence." He undertook his "Life of
   Mahomet" as a part of a "History of the Eastern Church," though he did
   not carry out his design.

   Voltaire and other Deists likewise still viewed Mohammed as an
   impostor, but from a disposition to trace all religion to priestcraft
   and deception. Spanheim, Sale, and Gagnier began to take a broader and
   more favorable view. Gibbon gives a calm historical narrative; and in
   summing up his judgment, he hesitates whether "the title of enthusiast
   or impostor more properly belongs to that extraordinary man .... From
   enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery; the daemon
   of Socrates affords a memorable instance how a wise man may deceive
   himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience may
   slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary
   fraud."

   Dean Milman suspends his judgment, saying: "To the question whether
   Mohammed was hero, sage, impostor, or fanatic, or blended, and blended
   in what proportions, these conflicting elements in his character? the
   best reply is the reverential phrase of Islâm: God knows.' " [206]

   Goethe and Carlyle swung from the orthodox abuse to the opposite
   extreme of a pantheistic hero-worshiping over-estimate of Mohammed and
   the Koran by extending the sphere of revelation and inspiration, and
   obliterating the line which separates Christianity from all other
   religions. Stanley, R. Bosworth Smith, Emanuel Deutsch, and others
   follow more or less in the track of this broad and charitable
   liberalism. Many errors and prejudices have been dispelled, and the
   favorable traits of Islâm and its followers, their habits of devotion,
   temperance, and resignation, were held up to the shame and admiration
   of the Christian world. Mohammed himself, it is now generally conceded,
   began as an honest reformer, suffered much persecution for his faith,
   effectually destroyed idolatry, was free from sordid motives, lived in
   strict monogamy during twenty-four years of his youth and manhood, and
   in great simplicity to his death. The polygamy which disfigured the
   last twelve years of his life was more moderate than that of many other
   Oriental despots, Califs and Sultans, and prompted in part by motives
   of benevolence towards the widows of his followers, who had suffered in
   the service of his religion. [207]

   But the enthusiasm kindled by Carlyle for the prophet of Mecca has been
   considerably checked by fuller information from the original sources as
   brought out in the learned biographies of Weil, Nöldeke, Sprenger and
   Muir. They furnish the authentic material for a calm, discriminating
   and impartial judgment, which, however, is modified more or less by the
   religious standpoint and sympathies of the historian. Sprenger
   represents Mohammed as the child of his age, and mixes praise and
   censure, without aiming at a psychological analysis or philosophical
   view. Sir William Muir concedes his original honesty and zeal as a
   reformer and warner, but assumes a gradual deterioration to the
   judicial blindness of a self-deceived heart, and even a kind of Satanic
   inspiration in his later revelations. "We may readily admit," he says,
   "that at the first Mahomet did believe, or persuaded himself to
   believe, that his revelations were dictated by a divine agency. In the
   Meccan period of his life, there certainly can be traced no personal
   ends or unworthy motives to belie this conclusion. The Prophet was
   there, what he professed to be, 'a simple Preacher and a Warner;' he
   was the despised and rejected teacher of a gainsaying people; and he
   had apparently no ulterior object but their reformation .... But the
   scene altogether changes at Medina. There the acquisition of temporal
   power, aggrandizement, and self-glorification mingled with the grand
   object of the Prophet's previous life; and they were sought after and
   attained by precisely the same instrumentality. Messages from heaven
   were freely brought forward to justify his political conduct, equally
   with his religious precepts. Battles were fought, wholesale executions
   inflicted, and territories annexed, under pretext of the Almighty's
   sanction. Nay, even baser actions were not only excused but encouraged,
   by the pretended divine approval or command .... The student of history
   will trace for himself how the pure and lofty aspirations of Mahomet
   were first tinged, and then gradually debased by a half unconscious
   self-deception, and how in this process truth merged into falsehood,
   sincerity into guile,--these opposite principles often co-existing even
   as active agencies in his conduct. The reader will observe that
   simultaneously with the anxious desire to extinguish idolatry and to
   promote religion and virtue in the world, there was nurtured by the
   Prophet in his own heart a licentious self-indulgence; till in the end,
   assuming to be the favorite of Heaven, he justified himself by
   'revelations' from God in the most flagrant breaches of morality. He
   will remark that while Mahomet cherished a kind and tender disposition,
   'Weeping with them that wept,' and binding to his person the hearts of
   his followers by the ready and self-denying offices of love and
   friendship, he could yet take pleasure in cruel and perfidious
   assassination, could gloat over the massacre of entire tribes, and
   savagely consign the innocent babe to the fires of hell.
   Inconsistencies such as these continually present themselves from the
   period of Mahomet's arrival at Medina; and it is by, the study of these
   inconsistencies that his character must be rightly comprehended. The
   key, to many difficulties of this description may be found, I believe,
   in the chapter 'on the belief of Mahomet in his own inspiration.' When
   once he had dared to forge the name of the Most High God as the seal
   and authority of his own words and actions, the germ was laid from
   which the errors of his after life freely and fatally developed
   themselves." [208]

   The Book of Mormon. First printed at Palmyra, N. Y., 1830. Written by
   the Prophet Mormon, three hundred years after Christ, upon plates of
   gold in the "Reformed Egyptian" (?) language, and translated by the
   Prophet Joseph Smith, Jun., with the aid of Urim and Thummim, into
   English. As large as the Old Testament. A tedious historical romance on
   the ancient inhabitants of the American Continent, whose ancestors
   emigrated from Jerusalem b.c. 600, and whose degenerate descendants are
   the red Indians. Said to have been written as a book of fiction by a
   Presbyterian minister, Samuel Spalding.

   The Doctrines and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter
   Day Saints. Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. Contains the special
   revelations given to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young at different times.
   Written in similar style and equally insipid as the Book of Mormon.

   A Catechism for Children by Elder John Jaques. Salt Lake City. 25th
   thousand, 1877.

   We cannot close this chapter on Oriental Mohammedanism without some
   remarks on the abnormal American phenomenon of Mormonism, which arose
   in the nineteenth century, and presents an instructive analogy to the
   former. Joseph Smith (born at Sharon, Vt., 1805; shot dead at Nauvoo,
   in Illinois, 1844), the first founder, or rather Brigham Young (d.
   1877), the organizer of the sect, may be called the American Mohammed,
   although far beneath the prophet of Arabia in genius and power.

   The points of resemblance are numerous and striking: the claim to a
   supernatural revelation mediated by an angel; the abrogation of
   previous revelations by later and more convenient ones; the embodiment
   of the revelations in an inspired book; the eclectic character of the
   system, which is compounded of Jewish, heathenish, and all sorts of
   sectarian Christian elements; the intense fanaticism and heroic
   endurance of the early Mormons amidst violent abuse and persecution
   from state to state, till they found a refuge in the desert of Utah
   Territory, which they turned into a garden; the missionary zeal in
   sending apostles to distant lands and importing proselytes to their
   Eldorado of saints from the ignorant population of England, Wales,
   Norway, Germany, and Switzerland; the union of religion with civil
   government, in direct opposition to the American separation of church
   and state; the institution of polygamy in defiance of the social order
   of Christian civilization. In sensuality and avarice Brigham Young
   surpassed Mohammed; for he left at his death in Salt Lake City
   seventeen wives, sixteen sons, and twenty-eight daughters (having had
   in all fifty-six or more children), and property estimated at two
   millions of dollars. [209]

   The government of the United States cannot touch the Mormon religion;
   but it can regulate the social institutions connected therewith, as
   long as Utah is a Territory under the immediate jurisdiction of
   Congress. Polygamy has been prohibited by law in the Territories under
   its control, and President Hayes has given warning to foreign
   governments (in 1879) that Mormon converts emigrating to the United
   States run the risk of punishment for violating the laws of the land.
   President Garfield (in his inaugural address, March 4, 1881) took the
   same decided ground on the Mormon question, saying: "The Mormon church
   not only offends the moral sense of mankind by sanctioning polygamy,
   but prevents the administration of justice through the ordinary
   instrumentalities of law. In my judgment it is the duty of Congress,
   while respecting to the uttermost the conscientious convictions and
   religious scruples of every citizen, to prohibit within its
   jurisdiction all criminal practices, especially of that class which
   destroy the family relations and endanger social order. Nor can any
   ecclesiastical organization be safely permitted to usurp in the
   smallest degree the functions and powers of the National Government."

   His successor, President Arthur, in his last message to Congress, Dec.
   1884, again recommends that Congress "assume absolute political control
   of the Territory of Utah," and says: "I still believe that if that
   abominable practice [polygamy] can be suppressed by law it can only be
   by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the
   Constitution." The secular and religious press of America, with few
   exceptions, supports these sentiments of the chief magistrate.

   Since the annexation of Utah to the United States, after the Mexican
   war, "Gentiles" as the Christians are called, have entered the Mormon
   settlement, and half a dozen churches of different denominations have
   been organized in Salt Lake City. But the "Latter Day Saints" are
   vastly in the majority, and are spreading in the adjoining Territories.
   Time will show whether the Mormon problem can be solved without resort
   to arms, or a new emigration of the Mormons.

   [204] Inferno, Canto XXVIII. 22 sqq. (Longfellow's translation): "A
   cask by losing centre-piece or cant Was never shattered so, as I saw
   one Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind. Between his legs
   were hanging down his entrails; His heart was visible, and the dismal
   sack That maketh excrement of what is eaten. While I was all absorbed
   in seeing him, He looked at me, and opened with his hands His bosom,
   saying: 'See now how I rend me; How mutilated, am, is Mahomet; In front
   of me doth Ali weeping go, Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
   And all the others whom thou here beholdest Sowers of scandal and of
   schism have been While living, and therefore are thus cleft asunder.' "

   [205] Maracci, Vivaldus, and other Roman writers point out thirteen or
   more heresies in which Mohammedanism and Lutheranism agree, such as
   iconoclasm, the rejection of the worship of saints, polygamy (in the
   case of Philip of Hesse), etc. A fanatical Lutheran wrote a book to
   prove that "the damned Calvinists hold six hundred and sixty-six theses
   (the apocalyptic number) in common with the Turks!" The Calvinist
   Reland, on the other hand, finds analogies to Romish errors in the
   Mohammedan prayers for the dead, visiting the graves of prophets,
   pilgrimages to Mecca, intercession of angels, fixed fasts, meritorious
   almsgiving, etc.

   [206] Lat. Christianity, II. 120.

   [207] The Mohammedan apologist, Syed Ameer Ali (The Life and Teachings
   of Mohammed, London, 1873, pp. 228 sqq.), makes much account of this
   fact, and entirely justifies Mohammed's polygamy. But the motive of
   benevolence and generosity can certainly not be shown in the marriage
   of Ayesha (the virgin-daughter of Abu-Bakr), nor of Zeynab (the lawful
   wife of his freedman Zeyd), nor of Safiya (the Jewess). Ali himself
   must admit that "some of Mohammed's marriages may possibly have arisen
   from a desire for male offspring." The motive of sensuality he entirely
   ignores.

   Whatever may be thought of the popes of earlier times," says Ranke,
   [213] "they always had great interests in view: the care of oppressed
   religion, the conflict with heathenism, the spread of Christianity
   among the northern nations, the founding of an independent hierarchy.
   It belongs to the dignity of human existence to aim at and to execute
   something great; this tendency the popes kept in upward motion."

   This commendation of the earlier popes, though by no means applicable
   to all, is eminently true of the one who stands at the beginning of our
   period.

   Gregory the First, or the Great, the last of the Latin fathers and the
   first of the popes, connects the ancient with the mediaeval church, the
   Graeco-Roman with the Romano-Germanic type of Christianity. He is one
   of the best representatives of mediaeval Catholicism: monastic,
   ascetic, devout and superstitious; hierarchical, haughty, and
   ambitious, yet humble before God; indifferent, if not hostile, to
   classical and secular culture, but friendly to sacred and
   ecclesiastical learning; just, humane, and liberal to ostentation; full
   of missionary zeal in the interest of Christianity, and the Roman see,
   which to his mind were inseparably connected. He combined great
   executive ability with untiring industry, and amid all his official
   cares he never forgot the claims of personal piety. In genius he was
   surpassed by Leo I., Gregory VII., Innocent III.; but as a man and as a
   Christian, he ranks with the purest and most useful of the popes.
   Goodness is the highest kind of greatness, and the church has done
   right in according the title of the Great to him rather than to other
   popes of superior intellectual power.

   The times of his pontificate (a.d. Sept. 3, 590 to March 12, 604) were
   full of trouble, and required just a man of his training and character.
   Italy, from a Gothic kingdom, had become a province of the Byzantine
   empire, but was exhausted by war and overrun by the savage Lombards,
   who were still heathen or Arian heretics, and burned churches, slew
   ecclesiastics, robbed monasteries, violated nuns, reduced cultivated
   fields into a wilderness. Rome was constantly exposed to plunder, and
   wasted by pestilence and famine. All Europe was in a chaotic state, and
   bordering on anarchy. Serious men, and Gregory himself, thought that
   the end of the world was near at hand. "What is it," says he in one of
   his sermons, "that can at this time delight us in this world?
   Everywhere we see tribulation, everywhere we hear lamentation. The
   cities are destroyed, the castles torn down, the fields laid waste the
   land made desolate. Villages are empty, few inhabitants remain in the
   cities, and even these poor remnants of humanity are daily cut down.
   The scourge of celestial justice does not cease, because no repentance
   takes place under the scourge. We see how some are carried into
   captivity, others mutilated, others slain. What is it, brethren, that
   can make us contented with this life? If we love such a world, we love
   not our joys, but our wounds. We see what has become of her who was
   once the mistress of the world .... Let us then heartily despise the
   present world and imitate the works of the pious as well as we can."

   Gregory was born about a.d. 540, from an old and wealthy senatorial
   (the Anician) family of Rome, and educated for the service of the
   government. He became acquainted with Latin literature, and studied
   Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustin, but was ignorant of Greek. His mother
   Sylvia, after the death of Gordianus her husband, entered a convent and
   so excelled in sanctity that she was canonized. The Greek emperor
   Justin appointed him to the highest civil office in Rome, that of
   imperial prefect (574). But soon afterwards he broke with the world,
   changed the palace of his father near Rome into a convent in honor of
   St. Andrew, and became himself a monk in it, afterwards abbot. He
   founded besides six convents in Sicily, and bestowed his remaining
   wealth on the poor. He lived in the strictest abstinence, and
   undermined his health by ascetic excesses. Nevertheless he looked back
   upon this time as the happiest of his life.

   Pope Pelagius II. made him one of the seven deacons of the Roman
   Church, and sent him as ambassador or nuntius to the court of
   Constantinople (579). [214] His political training and executive
   ability fitted him eminently for this post. He returned in 585, and was
   appointed abbot of his convent, but employed also for important public
   business.

   It was during his monastic period (either before or, more probably,
   after his return from Constantinople) that his missionary zeal was
   kindled, by an incident on the slave market, in behalf of the
   Anglo-Saxons. The result (as recorded in a previous chapter) was the
   conversion of England and the extension of the jurisdiction of the
   Roman see, during his pontificate. This is the greatest event of that
   age, and the brightest jewel in his crown. Like a Christian Caesar, he
   re-conquered that fair island by an army of thirty monks, marching
   under the sign of the cross. [215]

   In 590 Gregory was elected pope by the unanimous voice of the clergy,
   the senate, and the people, notwithstanding his strong remonstrance,
   and confirmed by his temporal sovereign, the Byzantine emperor
   Mauricius. Monasticism, for the first time, ascended the papal throne.
   Hereafter till his death he devoted all his energies to the interests
   of the holy see and the eternal city, in the firm consciousness of
   being the successor of St. Peter and the vicar of Christ. He continued
   the austere simplicity of monastic life, surrounded himself with monks,
   made them bishops and legates, confirmed the rule of St. Benedict at a
   council of Rome, guaranteed the liberty and property of convents, and
   by his example and influence rendered signal services to the monastic
   order. He was unbounded in his charities to the poor. Three thousand
   virgins, impoverished nobles and matrons received without a blush alms
   from his hands. He sent food from his table to the hungry before he sat
   down for his frugal meal. He interposed continually in favor of injured
   widows and orphans. He redeemed slaves and captives, and sanctioned the
   sale of consecrated vessels for objects of charity.

   Gregory began his administration with a public act of humiliation on
   account of the plague which had cost the life of his predecessor. Seven
   processions traversed the streets for three days with prayers and
   hymns; but the plague continued to ravage, and demanded eighty victims
   during the procession. The later legend made it the means of staying
   the calamity, in consequence of the appearance of the archangel Michael
   putting back the drawn sword into its sheath over the Mausoleum of
   Hadrian, since called the Castle of St. Angelo, and adorned by the
   statue of an angel.

   His activity as pontiff was incessant, and is the more astonishing as
   he was in delicate health and often confined to bed. "For a long time,"
   he wrote to a friend in 601, "I have been unable to rise from my bed. I
   am tormented by the pains of gout; a kind of fire seems to pervade my
   whole body: to live is pain; and I look forward to death as the only
   remedy." In another letter he says: "I am daily dying, but never die."

   Nothing seemed too great, nothing too little for his personal care. He
   organized and completed the ritual of the church, gave it greater
   magnificence, improved the canon of the mass and the music by a new
   mode of chanting called after him. He preached often and effectively,
   deriving lessons of humility and piety, from the calamities of the
   times, which appeared to him harbingers of the judgment-day. He
   protected the city of Rome against the savage and heretical Lombards.
   He administered the papal patrimony, which embraced large estates in
   the neighborhood of Rome, in Calabria, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily,
   Dalmatia, and even in Gaul and Africa. He encouraged and advised
   missionaries. As patriarch of the West, he extended his paternal care
   over the churches in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and Britain, and sent the
   pallium to some metropolitans, yet without claiming any legal
   jurisdiction. He appointed, he also reproved and deposed bishops for
   neglect of duty, or crime. He resolutely opposed the prevalent practice
   of simony, and forbade the clergy to exact or accept fees for their
   services. He corresponded, in the interest of the church, with nobles,
   kings and queens in the West, with emperors and patriarchs in the East.
   He hailed the return of the Gothic kingdom of Spain under Reccared from
   the Arian heresy to the Catholic faith, which was publicly proclaimed
   by the Council of Toledo, May 8, 589. He wrote to the king a letter of
   congratulation, and exhorted him to humility, chastity, and mercy. The
   detested Lombards likewise cast off Arianism towards the close of his
   life, in consequence partly of his influence over Queen Theodelinda, a
   Bavarian princess, who had been reared in the trinitarian faith. He
   endeavored to suppress the remnants of the Donatist schism in Africa.
   Uncompromising against Christian heretics and schismatics be was a step
   in advance of his age in liberality towards the Jews. He censured the
   bishop of Terracina and the bishop of Cagliari for unjustly depriving
   them of their synagogues; he condemned the forcible baptism of Jews in
   Gaul, and declared conviction by preaching the only legitimate means of
   conversion; he did not scruple, however, to try the dishonest method of
   bribery, and he inconsistently denied the Jews the right of building
   new synagogues and possessing Christian slaves. He made efforts, though
   in vain, to check the slave-trade, which was chiefly in the hands of
   Jews.

   After his death, the public distress, which he had labored to
   alleviate, culminated in a general famine, and the ungrateful populace
   of Rome was on the point of destroying his library, when the archdeacon
   Peter stayed their fury by asserting that he had seen the Holy Spirit
   in the form of a dove hovering above Gregory's head as he wrote his
   books. Hence he is represented with a dove. He was buried in St.
   Peter's under the altar of St. Andrew.

   Note. Estimates of Gregory I.

   Bishop Bossuet (as quoted by Montalembert, II. 173) thus tersely sums
   up the public life of Gregory: "This great pope ... subdued the
   Lombards; saved Rome and Italy, though the emperors could give him no
   assistance; repressed the new-born pride of the patriarchs of
   Constantinople; enlightened the whole church by his doctrine; governed
   the East and the West with as much vigor as humility; and gave to the
   world a perfect model of ecclesiastical government."

   To this Count Montalembert (likewise a Roman Catholic) adds: "It was
   the Benedictine order which gave to the church him whom no one would
   have hesitated to call the greatest of the popes, had not the same
   order, five centuries later, produced St. Gregory VII .... He is truly
   Gregory the Great, because he issued irreproachable from numberless and
   boundless difficulties; because he gave as a foundation to the
   increasing grandeur of the Holy See, the renown of his virtue, the
   candor of his innocence, the humble and inexhaustible tenderness of his
   heart."

   "The pontificate of Gregory the Great," says Gibbon (ch. 45), "which
   lasted thirteen years, six months, and ten days, is one of the most
   edifying periods of the history of the church. His virtues, and even
   his faults, a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning, of pride and
   humility, of sense and superstition, were happily suited to his station
   and to the temper of the times."

   Lau says (in his excellent monograph, pp. 302, 306): "The spiritual
   qualities of Gregory's character are strikingly apparent in his
   actions. With a clear, practical understanding, he combined a kind and
   mild heart; but he was never weak. Fearful to the obstinate
   transgressor of the laws, on account of his inflexible justice, he was
   lenient to the repentant and a warm friend to his friends, though,
   holding, as he did, righteousness and the weal of the church higher
   than friendship, he was severe upon any neglect of theirs. With a great
   prudence in managing the most different circumstances, and a great
   sagacity in treating the most different characters, he combined a moral
   firmness which never yielded an inch of what he had recognized as
   right; but he never became stubborn. The rights of the church and the
   privileges of the apostolical see he fought for with the greatest
   pertinacity; but for himself personally, he wanted no honors. As much
   as he thought of the church and the Roman chair, so modestly he
   esteemed himself. More than once his acts gave witness to the humility
   of his heart: humility was, indeed, to him the most important and the
   most sublime virtue. His activity was prodigious, encompassing great
   objects and small ones with equal zeal. Nothing ever became too great
   for his energy or too small for his attention. He was a warm patriot,
   and cared incessantly for the material as well as for the spiritual
   welfare of his countrymen. More than once he saved Rome from the
   Lombards, and relieved her from famine .... He was a great character
   with grand plans, in the realization of which he showed as much insight
   as firmness, as much prudent calculation of circumstances as sagacious
   judgment of men. The influence he has exercised is immense, and when
   this influence is not in every respect for the good, his time is to
   blame, not he. His goal was always that which he acknowledged as the
   best. Among all the popes of the sixth and following centuries, he
   shines as a star of the very first magnitude."

   Rud. Baxmann (l.c., I. 45 sq.): "Amidst the general commotion which the
   invasion of the Lombards caused in Italy, one man stood fast on his
   post in the eternal city, no matter how high the surges swept over it.
   As Luther, in his last will, calls himself an advocate of God, whose
   name was well known in heaven and on earth and in hell, the epitaph
   says of Gregory I. that he ruled as the consul Dei. He was the chief
   bishop of the republic of the church, the fourth doctor ecclesiae,
   beside the three other powerful theologians and columns of the Latin
   church: Ambrose, Augustine, and Jerome. He is justly called the pater
   ceremoniarum, the pater monachorum, and the Great. What the preceding
   centuries had produced in the Latin church for church government and
   dogmatics, for pastoral care and liturgy, he gathered together, and for
   the coming centuries he laid down the norms which were seldom deviated
   from."

   To this we add the judgment of James Barmby, the latest biographer of
   Gregory (Greg., p. 191): "Of the loftiness of his aims, the earnestness
   of his purpose, the fervor of his devotion, his unwearied activity, and
   his personal purity, there can be no doubt. These qualities are
   conspicuous through his whole career. If his religion was of the
   strongly ascetic type, and disfigured by superstitious credulity, it
   bore in these respects the complexion of his age, inseparable then from
   aspiration after the highest holiness. Nor did either superstition or
   asceticism supersede in him the principles of a true inward
   religion-justice, mercy, and truth. We find him, when occasion
   required, exalting mercy above sacrifice; he was singularly kindly and
   benevolent, as well as just, and even his zeal for the full rigor of
   monastic discipline was tempered with much gentleness and allowance for
   infirmity. If, again, with singleness of main purpose was combined at
   times the astuteness of the diplomatist, and a certain degree of
   politic insincerity in addressing potentates, his aims were never
   personal or selfish. And if he could stoop, for the attainment of his
   ends, to the then prevalent adulation of the great, he could also speak
   his mind fearlessly to the greatest, when he felt great principles to
   be at stake."

   § 51. Gregory and the Universal Episcopate.

   The activity, of Gregory tended powerfully to establish the authority
   of the papal chair. He combined a triple dignity, episcopal,
   metropolitan, and patriarchal. He was bishop of the city of Rome,
   metropolitan over the seven suffragan (afterwards called cardinal)
   bishops of the Roman territory, and patriarch of Italy, in fact of the
   whole West, or of all the Latin churches. This claim was scarcely
   disputed except as to the degree of his power in particular cases. A
   certain primacy of honor among all the patriarchs was also conceded,
   even by the East. But a universal episcopate, including an authority of
   jurisdiction over the Eastern or Greek church, was not acknowledged,
   and, what is more remarkable, was not even claimed by him, but
   emphatically declined and denounced. He stood between the patriarchal
   and the strictly papal system. He regarded the four patriarchs of
   Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, to whom he
   announced his election with a customary confession of his faith, as
   co-ordinate leaders of the church under Christ, the supreme head,
   corresponding as it were to the four oecumenical councils and the four
   gospels, as their common foundation, yet after all with a firm belief
   in a papal primacy. His correspondence with the East on this subject is
   exceedingly important. The controversy began in 595, and lasted several
   years, but was not settled.

   John IV., the Faster, patriarch of Constantinople, repeatedly used in
   his letters the title "oecumenical" or "universal bishop." This was an
   honorary, title, which had been given to patriarchs by the emperors Leo
   and Justinian, and confirmed to John and his successors by a
   Constantinopolitan synod in 588. It had also been used in the Council
   of Chalcedon of pope Leo I. [216] But Gregory I. was provoked and
   irritated beyond measure by the assumption of his Eastern rival, and
   strained every nerve to procure a revocation of that title. He
   characterized it as a foolish, proud, profane, wicked, pestiferous,
   blasphemous, and diabolical usurpation, and compared him who used it to
   Lucifer. He wrote first to Sabinianus, his apocrisiarius or ambassador
   in Constantinople, then repeatedly to the patriarch, to the emperor
   Mauricius, and even to the empress; for with all his monkish contempt
   for woman, he availed himself on every occasion of the female influence
   in high quarters. He threatened to break off communion with the
   patriarch. He called upon the emperor to punish such presumption, and
   reminded him of the contamination of the see of Constantinople by such
   arch-heretics as Nestorius. [217]

   Failing in his efforts to change the mind of his rival in New Rome, he
   addressed himself to the patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, and
   played upon their jealousy; but they regarded the title simply as a
   form of honor, and one of them addressed him as oecumenical pope, a
   compliment which Gregory could not consistently accept. [218]

   After the death of John the Faster in 596 Gregory instructed his
   ambassador at Constantinople to demand from the new patriarch,
   Cyriacus, as a condition of intercommunion, the renunciation of the
   wicked title, and in a letter to Maurice he went so far as to declare,
   that "whosoever calls himself universal priest, or desires to be called
   so, was the forerunner of Antichrist." [219]

   In opposition to these high-sounding epithets, Gregory called himself,
   in proud humility, "the servant of the servants of God." [220] This
   became one of the standing titles of the popes, although it sounds like
   irony in conjunction with their astounding claims.

   But his remonstrance was of no avail. Neither the patriarch nor the
   emperor obeyed his wishes. Hence he hailed a change of government which
   occurred in 602 by a violent revolution.

   When Phocas, an ignorant, red-haired, beardless, vulgar, cruel and
   deformed upstart, after the most atrocious murder of Maurice and his
   whole family (a wife, six sons and three daughters), ascended the
   throne, Gregory hastened to congratulate him and his wife Leontia (who
   was not much better) in most enthusiastic terms, calling on heaven and
   earth to rejoice at their accession, and vilifying the memory of the
   dead emperor as a tyrant, from whose yoke the church was now
   fortunately freed. [221] This is a dark spot, but the only really dark
   and inexcusable spot in the life of this pontiff. He seemed to have
   acted in this case on the infamous maxim that the end justifies the
   means. [222] His motive was no doubt to secure the protection and
   aggrandizement of the Roman see. He did not forget to remind the
   empress of the papal proof-text: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
   will build my church," and to add: "I do not doubt that you will take
   care to oblige and bind him to you, by whom you desire to be loosed
   from your sins."

   The murderer and usurper repaid the favor by taking side with the pope
   against his patriarch (Cyriacus), who had shown sympathy with the
   unfortunate emperor. He acknowledged the Roman church to be "the head
   of all churches." [223] But if he ever made such a decree at the
   instance of Boniface III., who at that time was papal nuntius at
   Constantinople, he must have meant merely such a primacy of honor as
   had been before conceded to Rome by the Council of Chalcedon and the
   emperor Justinian. At all events the disputed title continued to be
   used by the patriarchs and emperors of Constantinople. Phocas, after a
   disgraceful reign (602-610), was stripped of the diadem and purple,
   loaded with chains, insulted, tortured, beheaded and cast into the
   flames. He was succeeded by Heraclius.

   In this whole controversy the pope's jealousy of the patriarch is very
   manifest, and suggests the suspicion that it inspired the protest.

   Gregory displays in his correspondence with his rival a singular
   combination of pride and humility. He was too proud to concede to him
   the title of a universal bishop, and yet too humble or too inconsistent
   to claim it for himself. His arguments imply that he would have the
   best right to the title, if it were not wrong in itself. His real
   opinion is perhaps best expressed in a letter to Eulogius of
   Alexandria. He accepts all the compliments which Eulogius paid to him
   as the successor of Peter, whose very name signifies firmness and
   solidity; but he ranks Antioch and Alexandria likewise as sees of
   Peter, which are nearly, if not quite, on a par with that of Rome, so
   that the three, as it were, constitute but one see. He ignores
   Jerusalem. "The see of the Prince of the Apostles alone," he says, "has
   acquired a principality of authority, which is the see of one only,
   though in three places (quae in tribus locis unius est). For he himself
   has exalted the see in which he deigned to rest and to end his present
   life [Rome]. He himself adorned the see [Alexandria] to which he sent
   his disciple [Mark] as evangelist. He himself established the see in
   which he sat for seven years [Antioch]. Since, then, the see is one,
   and of one, over which by divine authority three bishops now preside,
   whatever good I hear of you I impute to myself. If you believe anything
   good of me, impute this to your own merits; because we are one in Him
   who said: 'That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I
   in Thee, that all may be one in us' (John xvii. 21)." [224]

   When Eulogius, in return for this exaltation of his own see, afterwards
   addressed Gregory as "universal pope," he strongly repudiated the
   title, saying: "I have said that neither to me nor to any one else (nec
   mihi, nec cuiquam alteri) ought you to write anything of the kind. And
   lo! in the preface of your letter you apply to me, who prohibited it,
   the proud title of universal pope; which thing I beg your most sweet
   Holiness to do no more, because what is given to others beyond what
   reason requires is subtracted from you. I do not esteem that an honor
   by which I know my brethren lose their honor. My honor is that of the
   universal Church. My honor is the solid strength of my brethren. I am
   then truly honored when all and each are allowed the honor that is due
   to them. For, if your Holiness calls me universal pope, you deny
   yourself to be that which you call me universally [that is, you own
   yourself to be no pope]. But no more of this: away with words which
   inflate pride and wound charity!" He even objects to the expression,
   "as thou hast commanded," which had occurred in hid correspondent's
   letter. "Which word, 'commanded,' I pray you let me hear no more; for I
   know what I am, and what you are: in position you are my brethren, in
   manners you are my, fathers. I did not, therefore, command, but desired
   only to indicate what seemed to me expedient." [225]

   On the other hand, it cannot be denied that Gregory, while he protested
   in the strongest terms against the assumption by the Eastern patriarchs
   of the antichristian and blasphemous title of universal bishop, claimed
   and exercised, as far as he had the opportunity and power, the
   authority and oversight over the whole church of Christ, even in the
   East. "With respect to the church of Constantinople," he asks in one of
   his letters, "who doubts that it is subject to the apostolic see?" And
   in another letter: "I know not what bishop is not subject to it, if
   fault is found in him." "To all who know the Gospels," he writes to
   emperor Maurice, "it is plain that to Peter, as the prince of all the
   apostles, was committed by our Lord the care of the whole church
   (totius ecclesiae cura) .... But although the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven and the power to bind and to loose, were intrusted to him, and
   the care and principality of the whole church (totius ecclesiae cura et
   principatus), he is not called universal bishop; while my most holy
   fellow-priest (vir sanctissimus consacerdos meus) John dares to call
   himself universal bishop. I am compelled to exclaim: O tempora, O
   mores!" [226]

   We have no right to impeach Gregory's sincerity. But he was clearly
   inconsistent in disclaiming the name, and yet claiming the thing
   itself. The real objection is to the pretension of a universal
   episcopate, not to the title. If we concede the former, the latter is
   perfectly legitimate. And such universal power had already been claimed
   by Roman pontiffs before Gregory, such as Leo I., Felix, Gelasius,
   Hormisdas, in language and acts more haughty and self-sufficient than
   his.

   No wonder, therefore that the successors of Gregory, less humble and
   more consistent than he, had no scruple to use equivalent and even more
   arrogant titles than the one against which he so solemnly protested
   with the warning: "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
   humble." [227] But it is a very remarkable fact, that at the beginning
   of the unfolding of the greatest power of the papacy one of the best of
   popes should have protested against the antichristian pride and
   usurpation of the system.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [216] Gregory alludes to this fact in a letter to John (Lib. V. 18, in
   Migne's ed. of Greg. Opera, vol. III. 740) and to the emperor Mauricius
   (Lib. V. 20, in Migne III. 747), but says in both that the popes never
   claimed nor used "hoc temerarium nomen." ... "Certe pro beati Petri
   apostolorum principis honore, per venerandam Chalcedonensem synodum
   Romano pontifici oblatum est [nomen istud blasphemiae]. Sed nullus
   eorum unquam hoc singularitatis nomine uti consensit, dum privatum
   aliquid daretur uni, honore debito sacerdotes privarentur universi.
   Quid est ergo quod nos huius vocabuli gloriam et oblatam non quaerimus,
   et alter sibi hanc arripere at non oblatam praesumit?" Strictly
   speaking, however, the fact assumed by Gregory is not quite correct.
   Leo was styled oikoumenikosarchiepiskoposonly in an accusation against
   Dioscurus, in the third session of Chalcedon. The papal delegates
   subscribed: Vicarii apostolici universalis ecclesiae Papae, which was
   translated by the Greeks: tesoikoumenikesekklesiasepiskopou. The popes
   claimed to be popes (but not bishops) of the universal church. See
   Hefele, Conciliengesch. II. 526. Boniface III is said to have openly
   assumed the title universalis episcopis in 606, when he obtained from
   the emperor Phocas a decree styling the see of Peter "caput omnium
   ecclesiarum." It appears as self-assumed in the Liber Diurnus,
   a.d.682-'5, and is frequent after the seventh century. The canonists,
   however, make a distinction between "universalis ecclesiae episcopus."
   and "episcopus universalis" or "oecumenicus," meaning by the latter an
   immediate jurisdiction in the diocese of other bishops, which was
   formerly denied to the pope. But according to the Vatican system of
   1870, he is the bishop of bishops, over every single bishop, and over
   all bishops put together, and all bishops are simply his vicars, as he
   himself is the vicar of Christ. See my Creeds of Christendom, I. 151.

   [217] See the letters in Lib. V. 18-21 (Migne III. 738-751). His
   predecessor, Pelagius II. (578-590), had already strongly denounced the
   assumption of the title by John, and at the same time disclaimed it for
   himself, while yet clearly asserting the universal primacy of the see
   of Peter. See Migne, Tom. LXXII. 739, and Baronius, ad ann. 587.

   [218] Ep. V. 43: ad Eulogium et Anastasium episcopos; VI. 60; VII. 34,
   40.

   [219] Ep. VII. 13: "Ego autem confidenter dico quia quisquis se
   universalem sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua
   Antichristum praecurrit, quia superbiendo se caeteris praeponit."

   [220] "Servus servorum Dei." See Joa. Diaconus, Vit. Greg. II. 1, and
   Lib. Diurnus, in Migne, Tom. CV. 23. Augustin (Epist. 217, ad Vitalem)
   had before subscribed himself: "Servus Christi, et per ipsum servus
   servorum ejus." Comp. Matt. xx. 26; xxiii. II. Fulgentius styled
   himself "Servorum Christi famulus." The popes ostentatiously wash the
   beggars' feet at St. Peter's in holy week, in imitation of Christ's
   example, but expect kings and queens to kiss their toe.

   [221] His letter "ad Phocam imperatorem," Ep. XIII. 31 (III. 1281 in
   Migne) begins with "Gloria in excelsis Deo, qui juxta quod scriptum
   est, immutat tempora et transfert regna." Comp. his letter "ad Leontiam
   imperatricen" (Ep. XIII. 39).

   [222] Gibbon (ch. 46): "As a subject and a Christian, it was the duty
   of Gregory to acquiesce in the established government; but the joyful
   applause with which he salutes the fortune of the assassin, has
   sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of the saint." Milman
   (II. 83): "The darkest stain on the name of Gregory is his cruel and
   unchristian triumph in the fall of the Emperor Maurice-his base and
   adulatory praise of Phocas, the most odious and Sanguinary tyrant who
   had ever seized the throne of Constantinople." Montalembert says (II.
   116): "This is the only stain in the life of Gregory. We do not attempt
   either to conceal or excuse it .... Among the greatest and holiest of
   mortals, virtue, like wisdom, always falls short in some respect." It
   is charitable to assume, with Baronius and other Roman Catholic
   historians, that Gregory, although usually very well informed, at the
   time he expressed his extravagant joy at the elevation of Phocas, knew
   only the fact, and not the bloody means of the elevation. The same
   ignorance must be assumed in the case of his flattering letters to
   Brunhilde, the profligate and vicious fury of France. Otherwise we
   would have here on a small scale an anticipation of the malignant joy
   with which Gregory XIII. hailed the fearful slaughter of the Huguenots.

   [223] The words run thus: "Hic [Phocas] rogante papa Bonifacio statuit
   Romanae et apostolicae ecclesia caput esse omniuim ecclesiarum,quia
   ecclesia Constantinopolitana primam se omnium rum scribebat." Paulus
   Diaconus, De Gest. Lomb. IV., cap. 7, in Muratori, Rer. Ital., I. 465.
   But the authenticity of this report which was afterwards frequently
   copied, is doubtful. It has been abused by controversialists on both
   sides. It is not the first declaration of the Roman primacy, nor is it
   a declaration of an exclusive primacy, nor an abrogation of the title
   of "oecumenical patriarch" on the part of the bishop of Constantinople.
   Comp. Greenwood, vol. II. 239 sqq.

   [224] Ep. VII. 40 (Migne III. 899). This parallel between the three
   great sees of Peter--a hierarchical tri-personality in unity of
   essence--seems to be entirely original with Gregory, and was never used
   afterwards by a Roman pontiff. It is fatal to the sole primacy of the
   Roman chair of Peter, and this is the very essence of popery.

   [225] Ep. VIII. 30 (III. 933).

   [226] Epist. V. 20 (III. 745). He quotes in proof the pet-texts of
   popery, John xxi. 17; Luke xxii. 31; Matt. xvi. 18.

   [227] Such titles as Universalis Episcopus (used by Boniface III., a
   year after Gregory's death), Pontifex Maximus, Summus Pontifex,
   Virarius Christi, and even "ipsius Dei in terris Virarius" (Conc. Trid.
   VI. De reform., c. 1). First Vicar of Peter, then Vicar of Christ, at
   last Vicar of God Almighty!

   § 52. The Writings of Gregory.

   Comp. the second part of Lau's biography, pp. 311 sqq., and Adolf
   Ebert: Geschichte der Christlich-Lateinischen Literatur, bis zum
   Zeitalter Karls der Grossen. Leipzig, 1874 sqq., vol. I. 516 sqq.

   With all the multiplicity of his cares, Gregory found time for literary
   labor. His books are not of great literary merit, but were eminently
   popular and useful for the clergy of the middle ages.

   His theology was based upon the four oecumenical councils and the four
   Gospels, which he regarded as the immovable pillars of orthodoxy; he
   also accepted the condemnation of the three chapters by the fifth
   oecumenical council. He was a moderate Augustinian, but with an
   entirely practical, unspeculative, uncritical, traditional and
   superstitious bent of mind. His destruction of the Palatine Library, if
   it ever existed, is now rejected as a fable; but it reflects his
   contempt for secular and classical studies as beneath the dignity of a
   Christian bishop. Yet in ecclesiastical learning and pulpit eloquence
   he had no superior in his age.

   Gregory is one of the great doctors or authoritative fathers of the
   church. His views on sin and grace are almost semi-Pelagian. He makes
   predestination depend on fore-knowledge; represents the fallen nature
   as sick only, not as dead; lays great stress on the meritoriousness of
   good works, and is chiefly responsible for the doctrine of a
   purgatorial fire, and masses for the benefit of the souls in purgatory.

   His Latin style is not classical, but ecclesiastical and monkish; it
   abounds in barbarisms; it is prolix and chatty, but occasionally
   sententious and rising to a rhetorical pathos, which he borrowed from
   the prophets of the Old Testament.

   The following are his works:

   1. Magna Moralia, in thirty-five books. This large work was begun in
   Constantinople at the instigation of Leander, bishop of Seville, and
   finished in Rome. It is a three-fold exposition of the book of Job
   according to its historic or literal, its allegorical, and its moral
   meaning. [228]

   Being ignorant of the Hebrew and Greek languages, and of Oriental
   history and customs (although for some time a resident of
   Constantinople), Gregory lacked the first qualifications for a
   grammatical and historical interpretation.

   The allegorical part is an exegetical curiosity he reads between or
   beneath the lines of that wonderful poem the history of Christ and a
   whole system of theology natural and revealed. The names of persons and
   things, the numbers, and even the syllables, are filled with mystic
   meaning. Job represents Christ; his wife the carnal nature; his seven
   sons (seven being the number of perfection) represent the apostles, and
   hence the clergy; his three daughters the three classes of the faithful
   laity who are to worship the Trinity; his friends the heretics; the
   seven thousand sheep the perfect Christians; the three thousand camels
   the heathen and Samaritans; the five hundred yoke of oxen and five
   hundred she-asses again the heathen, because the prophet Isaiah says:
   "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel
   doth not know, my people doth not consider."

   The moral sense, which Gregory explains last, is an edifying
   homiletical expansion and application, and a sort of compend of
   Christian ethics.

   2. Twenty-two Homilies on Ezekiel, delivered in Rome during the siege
   by Agilulph, and afterwards revised.

   3. Forty Homilies on the Gospels for the day, preached by Gregory at
   various times, and afterwards edited.

   4. Liber Regulae Pastoralis, in four parts. It is a pastoral theology,
   treating of the duties and responsibilities of the ministerial office,
   in justification of his reluctance to undertake the burden of the papal
   dignity. It is more practical than Chrysostom's "Priesthood." It was
   held in the highest esteem in the Middle Ages, translated into Greek by
   order of the emperor Maurice, and into Anglo-Saxon by King Alfred, and
   given to the bishops in France at their ordination, together with the
   book of canons, as a guide in the discharge of their duties. Gregory,
   according to the spirit of his age, enjoins strict celibacy even upon
   sub-deacons. But otherwise he gives most excellent advice suitable to
   all times. He makes preaching one of the chief duties of pastors, in
   the discharge of which he himself set a good example. He warns them to
   guard against the besetting sin of pride at the very outset; for they
   will not easily learn humility in a high position. They should preach
   by their lives as well as their words. "He who, by the necessity of his
   position, is required to speak the highest things, is compelled by the
   same necessity to exemplify the highest. For that voice best penetrates
   the hearts of hearers which the life of the speaker commends, because
   what he commends in his speech he helps to practice by his example." He
   advises to combine meditation and action. "Our Lord," he says,
   "continued in prayer on the mountain, but wrought miracles in the
   cities; showing to pastors that while aspiring to the highest, they
   should mingle in sympathy with the necessities of the infirm. The more
   kindly charity descends to the lowest, the more vigorously it recurs to
   the highest." The spiritual ruler should never be so absorbed in
   external cares as to forget the inner life of the soul, nor neglect
   external things in the care for his inner life. "The word of doctrine
   fails to penetrate the mind of the needy, unless commended by the hand
   of compassion."

   5. Four books of Dialogues on the lives and miracles of St. Benedict of
   Nursia and other Italian saints, and on the immortality of the soul
   (593). These dialogues between Gregory and the Roman archdeacon Peter
   abound in incredible marvels and visions of the state of departed
   souls. He acknowledges, however, that he knew these stories only from
   hearsay, and defends his recording them by the example of Mark and
   Luke, who reported the gospel from what they heard of the
   eye-witnesses. His veracity, therefore, is not at stake; but it is
   strange that a man of his intelligence and good sense should believe
   such grotesque and childish marvels. The Dialogues are the chief source
   of the mediaeval superstitions about purgatory. King Alfred ordered
   them to be translated into the Anglo-Saxon.

   6. His Epistles (838 in all) to bishops, princes, missionaries, and
   other persons in all parts of Christendom, give us the best idea of his
   character and administration, and of the conversion of the
   Anglo-Saxons. They treat of topics of theology, morals, politics,
   diplomacy, monasticism, episcopal and papal administration, and give us
   the best insight into his manifold duties, cares, and sentiments.

   7. The Gregorian Sacramentary is based upon the older Sacramentaries of
   Gelasius and Leo I., with some changes in the Canon of the Mass. His
   assertion that in the celebration of the eucharist, the apostles used
   the Lord's Prayer only (solummodo), has caused considerable discussion.
   Probably he meant no other prayer, in addition to the words of
   institution, which he took for granted.

   8. A collection of antiphons for mass (Liber Antiphonarius). It
   contains probably later additions. Several other works of doubtful
   authenticity, and nine Latin hymns are also attributed to Gregory. They
   are in the metre of St. Ambrose, without the rhyme, except the "Rex
   Christe, factor omnium" (which is very highly spoken of by Luther).
   They are simple, devout, churchly, elevated in thought and sentiment,
   yet without poetic fire and vigor. Some of them as "Blest Creator of
   the Light" (Lucis Creator optime), "O merciful Creator, hear" (Audi,
   beate Conditor), "Good it is to keep the fast" (Clarum decus jejunii),
   have recently been made familiar to English readers in free
   translations from the Anglo-Catholic school. [229] He was a great
   ritualist (hence called "Master of Ceremonies"), but with considerable
   talent for sacred poetry and music. The "Cantus Gregorianus" so called
   was probably a return from the artistic and melodious antiphonal
   "Cantus Ambrosianus" to the more ancient and simple mode of chanting.
   He founded a school of singers, which became a nursery of similar
   schools in other churches. [230]

   Some other writings attributed to him, as an Exposition of the First
   Book of Kings, and an allegorical Exposition of the Canticles, are of
   doubtful genuineness.

   § 53. The Papacy from Gregory I to Gregory II a.d. 604-715.

   The successors of Gregory I. to Gregory II. were, with few exceptions,
   obscure men, and ruled but a short time. They were mostly Italians,
   many of them Romans; a few were Syrians, chosen by the Eastern emperors
   in the interest of their policy and theology.

   Sabinianus (604) was as hard and avaricious as Gregory was benevolent
   and liberal, and charged the famine of his reign upon the prodigality
   of his sainted predecessor. Boniface III. (606607) did not scruple to
   assume the title of It universal bishop, "against which Gregory, in
   proud humility, had so indignantly protested as a blasphemous
   antichristian assumption. Boniface IV. converted the Roman Pantheon
   into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and all the
   Martyrs (608). Honorius l. (625-638) was condemned by an oecumenical
   council and by his own successors as a Monothelite heretic; while
   Martin I. (649-655) is honored for the persecution he endured in behalf
   of the orthodox doctrine of two wills in Christ. Under Gregory II. and
   III., Germany was converted to Roman Christianity.

   The popes followed the missionary policy of Gregory and the instinct of
   Roman ambition and power. Every progress of Christianity in the West
   and the North was a progress of the Roman Church. Augustin, Boniface,
   Ansgar were Roman missionaries and pioneers of the papacy. As England
   had been annexed to the triple crown under Gregory I., so France, the
   Netherlands, Germany and Scandinavia were annexed under his successors.
   The British and Scotch-Irish independence gave way gradually to the
   irresistible progress of Roman authority and uniformity. Priests,
   noblemen and kings from all parts of the West were visiting Rome as the
   capital of Christendom, and paid homage to the shrine of the apostles
   and to the living successor of the Galilaean fisherman.

   But while the popes thus extended their spiritual dominion over the new
   barbarous races, they were the political subjects of the Eastern
   emperor as the master of Italy, and could not be consecrated without
   his consent. They were expected to obey the imperial edicts even in
   spiritual matters, and were subject to arrest and exile. To rid
   themselves of this inconvenient dependence was a necessary step in the
   development of the absolute papacy. It was effected in the eighth
   century by the aid of a rising Western power. The progress of
   Mohammedanism and its encroachment on the Greek empire likewise
   contributed to their independence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 54. From Gregory II to Zacharias. a.d. 715-741.

   Gregory II. (715-731) marks the transition to this new state of things.
   He quarreled with the iconoclastic emperor, Leo the Isaurian, about the
   worship of images. Under his pontificate, Liutprand, [231] the ablest
   and mightiest king of the Lombards, conquered the Exarchate of Ravenna,
   and became master of Italy.

   But the sovereignty of a barbarian and once Arian power was more odious
   and dangerous to the popes than that of distant Constantinople. Placed
   between the heretical emperor and the barbarian robber, they looked
   henceforth to a young and rising power beyond the Alps for deliverance
   and protection. The Franks were Catholics from the time of their
   conversion under Clovis, and achieved under Charles Martel (the Hammer)
   a mighty victory over the Saracens (732), which saved Christian Europe
   against the invasion and tyranny of Islâm. They had thus become the
   protectors of Latin Christianity. They also lent their aid to Boniface
   in the conversion of Germany.

   Gregory, III. (731-741) renewed the negotiations with the Franks, begun
   by his predecessor. When the Lombards again invaded the territory, of
   Rome, and were ravaging by fire and sword the last remains of the
   property of the church, he appealed in piteous and threatening tone to
   Charles Martel, who had inherited from his father, Pepin of Herstal,
   the mayoralty of France, and was the virtual ruler of the realm. "Close
   not your ears," he says, "against our supplications, lest St. Peter
   close against you the gates of heaven." He sent him the keys of the
   tomb of St. Peter as a symbol of allegiance, and offered him the titles
   of Patrician and Consul of Rome. [232] This was virtually a declaration
   of independence from Constantinople. Charles Martel returned a
   courteous answer, and sent presents to Rome, but did not cross the
   Alps. He was abhorred by the clergy of his own country as a
   sacrilegious spoiler of the property of the church and disposer of
   bishoprics to his counts and dukes in the place of rightful incumbents.
   [233]

   The negotiations were interrupted by the death of Charles Martel Oct.
   21, 741, followed by that of Gregory III., Nov. 27 of the same year.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [231] Or Luitprand, born about 690, died 744. There is also a Lombard
   historian of that name, a deacon of the cathedral of Pavia, afterwards
   bishop of Cremona, died 972.

   [232] Gibbon actually attributes these titles to Charles Martel; while
   Bryce (p. 40) thinks that they were first given to Pepin. Gregory II.
   had already (724) addressed Charles Martel as "Patricius" (see Migne,
   Opera Caroli M. II. 69). Gregory III. sent him in 739 ipsas
   sacratissimas claves confessionis beati Petri quas vobus ad regnum
   dimisimus (ib. p. 66), which implies the transfer of civil authority
   over Rome.

   [233] Milman (Book IV., ch. 9) says that Dante, the faithful recorder
   of popular Catholic tradition, adopts the condemnatory legend which
   puts Charles "in the lowest pit of hell." But I can find no mention of
   him in Dante. The Charles Martel of Parad. VIII. and IX. is a very,
   different person, a king of Hungary, who died 1301. See Witte's Dante,
   p. 667, and Carey's note on Par. VIII. 53. On the relations of Charles
   Martel to Boniface see Rettberg, Kirchengesch. Deutschlands, I. 306
   sqq.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 55. Alliance of the Papacy with the New Monarchy of the Franks. Pepin
   and the Patrimony of St. Peter. a.d. 741-755.

   Pope Zacharias (741-752), a Greek, by the weight of his priestly
   authority, brought Liutprand to terms of temporary submission. The
   Lombard king suddenly paused in the career of conquest, and died after
   a reign of thirty years (743).

   But his successor, Astolph, again threatened to incorporate Rome with
   his kingdom. Zacharias sought the protection of Pepin the Short, [234]
   the Mayor of the Palace, son of Charles Martel, and father of
   Charlemagne, and in return for this aid helped him to the crown of
   France. This was the first step towards the creation of a Western
   empire and a new political system of Europe with the pope and the
   German emperor at the head.

   Hereditary succession was not yet invested with that religious sanctity
   among the Teutonic races as in later ages. In the Jewish theocracy
   unworthy kings were deposed, and new dynasties elevated by the
   interposition of God's messengers. The pope claimed and exercised now
   for the first time the same power. The Mayor, or high steward, of the
   royal household in France was the prime minister of the sovereign and
   the chief of the official and territorial nobility. This dignity became
   hereditary in the family of Pepin of Laudon, who died in 639, and was
   transmitted from him through six descents to Pepin the Short, a gallant
   warrior and an experienced statesman. He was on good terms with
   Boniface, the apostle of Germany and archbishop of Mayence, who,
   according to the traditional view, acted as negotiator between him and
   the pope in this political coup d'etat. [235]

   Childeric III., the last of the hopelessly degenerate Merovingian line,
   was the mere shadow of a monarch, and forced to retire into a
   monastery. Pepin, the ruler in fact now assumed the name, was elected
   at Soissons (March, 752) by the acclamation and clash of arms of the
   people, and anointed, like the kings of Israel, with holy oil, by
   Boniface or some other bishop, and two years after by the pope himself,
   who had decided that the lawful possessor of the royal power may also
   lawfully assume the royal title. Since that time he called himself "by
   the grace of God king of the Franks." The pope conferred on him the
   title of "Patrician of the Romans" (Patricius Romanorum), which implies
   a sort of protectorate over the Roman church, and civil sovereignty,
   over her territory. For the title "Patrician," which was introduced by
   Constantine the Great signified the highest rank next to that of the
   emperor, and since the sixth century was attached to the Byzantine
   Viceroy, of Italy. On the other hand, this elevation and coronation was
   made the basis of papal superiority over the crowns of France and
   Germany.

   The pope soon reaped the benefit of his favor. When hard pressed again
   by the Lombards, he called the new king to his aid.

   Stephen III., who succeeded Zacharias in March, 752, and ruled till
   757, visited Pepin in person, and implored him to enforce the
   restoration of the domain of St. Peter. He anointed him again at St.
   Denys, together with his two sons, and promised to secure the
   perpetuity of his dynasty by the fearful power of the interdict and
   excommunication. Pepin accompanied him back to Italy and defeated the
   Lombards (754). When the Lombards renewed the war, the pope wrote
   letter upon letter to Pepin, admonishing and commanding him in the name
   of Peter and the holy Mother of God to save the city of Rome from the
   detested enemies, and promising him long life and the most glorious
   mansions in heaven, if he speedily obeyed. To such a height of
   blasphemous assumption had the papacy risen already as to identify
   itself with the kingdom of Christ and to claim to be the dispenser of
   temporal prosperity and eternal salvation.

   Pepin crossed the Alps again with his army, defeated the Lombards, and
   bestowed the conquered territory upon the pope (755). He declared to
   the ambassadors of the East who demanded the restitution of Ravenna and
   its territory to the Byzantine empire, that his sole object in the war
   was to show his veneration for St. Peter. The new papal district
   embraced the Exarchate and the Pentapolis, East of the Apennines, with
   the cities of Ravenna, Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Cesena, Sinigaglia, lesi,
   Forlimpopoli, Forli, Montefeltro, Acerra, Monte di Lucano, Serra, San
   Marino, Bobbio, Urbino, Cagli, Luciolo, Gubbio, Comachio, and Narni.
   [236]

   This donation of Pepin is the foundation of "the Patrimony of St.
   Peter." The pope was already in possession of tracts of land in Italy
   and elsewhere granted to the church. But by this gift of a foreign
   conqueror he became a temporal sovereign over a large part of Italy,
   while claiming to be the successor of Peter who had neither silver nor
   gold, and the vicar of Christ who said: "My kingdom is not of this
   world." The temporal power made the papacy independent in the exercise
   of its jurisdiction, but at the expense of its spiritual character. It
   provoked a long conflict with the secular power; it involved it in the
   political interests, intrigues and wars of Europe, and secularized the
   church and the hierarchy. Dante, who shared the mediaeval error of
   dating the donation of Pepin back to Constantine the Great, [237] gave
   expression to this view in the famous lines:


   "Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,

   Not thy conversion, but that marriage-dower

   Which the first wealthy Father took from thee." [238]

   Yet Dante places Constantine, who "from good intent produced evil
   fruit," in heaven; where


   "Now he knows how all the ill deduced

   From his good action is not harmful to him,

   Although the world thereby may be destroyed."

   And he speaks favorably of Charlemagne's intervention in behalf of the
   pope:


   "And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten

   The Holy Church, then underneath its wings

   Did Charlemagne victorious succor her." [239]

   The policy of Pepin was followed by Charlemagne, the German, and
   Austrian emperors, and modern French rulers who interfered in Italian
   affairs, now as allies, now as enemies, until the temporal power of the
   papacy was lost under its last protector, Napoleon III., who withdrew
   his troops from Rome to fight against Germany, and by his defeat
   prepared the way for Victor Emanuel to take possession of Rome, as the
   capital of free and united Italy (1870). Since that time the pope who a
   few weeks before had proclaimed to the world his own infallibility in
   all matters of faith and morals, is confined to the Vatican, but with
   no diminution of his spiritual power as the bishop of bishops over two
   hundred millions of souls.

   [235] Rettberg, however (I. 385 sqq.), disconnects Boniface from all
   participation in the elevation and coronation of Pepin, and represents
   him as being rather opposed to it. He argues from the silence of some
   annalists, and from the improbability that the pope should have
   repeated the consecration if it had been previously performed by his
   legate.

   palace for his residence, and upon the church the right to hold real
   estate and to receive bequests of landed property from individuals.
   This is the slender foundation for the fable of the Donatio
   Constantini.

   With the death of Pepin the Short (Sept. 24, 768), the kingdom of
   France was divided between his two sons, Charles and Carloman, the
   former to rule in the Northern, the latter in the Southern provinces.
   After the death of his weaker brother (771) Charles, ignoring the
   claims of his infant nephews, seized the sole reign and more than
   doubled its extent by his conquests.

   Character and Aim of Charlemagne.

   This extraordinary man represents the early history of both France and
   Germany which afterwards divided into separate streams, and commands
   the admiration of both countries and nations. His grand ambition was to
   unite all the Teutonic and Latin races on the Continent under his
   temporal sceptre in close union with the spiritual dominion of the
   pope; in other words, to establish a Christian theocracy, coëxtensive
   with the Latin church (exclusive of the British Isles and Scandinavia).
   He has been called the "Moses of the middle age," who conducted the
   Germanic race through the desert of barbarism and gave it a now code of
   political, civil and ecclesiastical laws. He stands at the head of the
   new Western empire, as Constantine the Great had introduced the Eastern
   empire, and he is often called the new Constantine, but is as far
   superior to him as the Latin empire was to the Greek. He was
   emphatically a man of Providence.

   Charlemagne, or Karl der Grosse, towers high above the crowned princes
   of his age, and is the greatest as well as the first of the long line
   of German emperors from the eighth to the nineteenth century. He is the
   only prince whose greatness has been inseparably blended with his
   French name. [240] Since Julius Caesar history had seen no conqueror
   and statesman of such commanding genius and success; history after him
   produced only two military heroes that may be compared with him)
   Frederick II. of Prussia, and Napoleon Bonaparte (who took him and
   Caesar for his models), but they were far beneath him in religious
   character, and as hostile to the church as he was friendly to it. His
   lofty intellect shines all the more brightly from the general ignorance
   and barbarism of his age. He rose suddenly like a meteor in dark
   midnight. We do not know even the place and date of his birth, nor the
   history of his youth and education. [241]

   His Reign.

   His life is filled with no less than fifty-three military campaigns
   conducted by himself or his lieutenants, against the Saxons (18
   campaigns), Lombards (5), Aquitanians, Thuringians, Bavarians) Avars or
   Huns, Danes, Slaves, Saracens, and Greeks. His incessant activity
   astonished his subjects and enemies. He seemed to be omnipresent in his
   dominions, which extended from the Baltic and the Elbe in the North to
   the Ebro in the South, from the British Channel to Rome and even to the
   Straits of Messina, embracing France, Germany, Hungary, the greater
   part of Italy and Spain. His ecclesiastical domain extended over
   twenty-two archbishoprics or metropolitan sees, Rome, Ravenna, Milan,
   Friuli (Aquileia), Grado, Cologne, Mayence, Salzburg, Treves, Sens,
   Besançon, Lyons, Rouen, Rheims, Arles, Vienna, Moutiers-en-Tarantaise,
   Ivredun, Bordeaux, Tours, Bourges, Narbonne. [242] He had no settled
   residence, but spent much time on the Rhine, at Ingelheim, Mayence,
   Nymwegen, and especially at Aix-la-Chapelle on account of its baths. He
   encouraged trade, opened roads, and undertook to connect the Main and
   the Danube by canal. He gave his personal attention to things great and
   small. He introduced a settled order and unity of organization in his
   empire, at the expense of the ancient freedom and wild independence of
   the German tribes, although he continued to hold every year, in May,
   the general assembly of the freemen (Maifeld). He secured Europe
   against future heathen and Mohammedan invasion and devastation. He was
   universally admired or feared in his age. The Greek emperors sought his
   alliance; hence the Greek proverb, "Have the Franks for your friends,
   but not for your neighbors." The Caliph Harounal-Raschid, the mightiest
   ruler in the East, sent from Bagdad an embassy to him with precious
   gifts. But he esteemed a good sword more than gold. He impressed the
   stamp of his genius and achievements upon the subsequent history of
   Germany and France.

   Appearance and Habits of Charlemagne.

   Charles had a commanding, and yet winning presence. His physique
   betrayed the greatness of his mind. He was tall, strongly built and
   well proportioned. His height was seven times the length of his foot.
   He had large and animated eyes, a long nose, a cheerful countenance and
   an abundance of fine hair. "His appearance," says Eginhard, "was always
   stately and dignified, whether he was standing or sitting; although his
   neck was thick and somewhat short, and his belly rather prominent; but
   the symmetry of the rest of his body concealed these defects. His gait
   was firm, his whole carriage manly, and his voice clear, but not so
   strong as his size led one to expect." [243]

   He was naturally eloquent, and spoke with great clearness and force. He
   was simple in his attire, and temperate in eating and drinking; for,
   says Eginhard, "he abominated drunkenness in anybody, much more in
   himself and those of his household. He rarely gave entertainments, only
   on great feast days, and these to large numbers of people." He was fond
   of muscular exercise, especially of hunting and swimming, and enjoyed
   robust health till the last four years of his life, when he was subject
   to frequent fevers. During his meals he had extracts from Augustine's
   "City of God" (his favorite book), and stories of olden times, read to
   him. He frequently gave audience while dressing, without sacrifice of
   royal dignity. He was kind to the poor, and a liberal almsgiver.

   His Zeal for Education.

   His greatest merit is his zeal for education and religion. He was
   familiar with Latin from conversation rather than books, be understood
   a little Greek, and in his old age he began to learn the art of writing
   which his hand accustomed to the sword had neglected. He highly
   esteemed his native language, caused a German grammar to be compiled,
   and gave German names to the winds and to the months. [244] He
   collected the ancient heroic songs of the German minstrels. He took
   measures to correct the Latin Version of the Scriptures, and was
   interested in theological questions. He delighted in cultivated
   society. He gathered around him divines, scholars, poets, historians,
   mostly Anglo-Saxons, among whom Alcuin was the chief. He founded the
   palace school and other schools in the convents, and visited them in
   person. The legend makes him the founder of the University of Paris,
   which is of a much later date. One of his laws enjoins general
   education upon all male children.

   His Piety.

   Charles was a firm believer in Christianity and a devout and regular
   worshipper in the church, "going morning and evening, even after
   nightfall, besides attending mass." He was very liberal to the clergy.
   He gave them tithes throughout the empire appointed worthy bishops and
   abbots, endowed churches and built a splendid cathedral at
   Aix-la-Chapelle, in which he was buried.

   His respect for the clergy culminated in his veneration for the bishop
   of Rome as the successor of St. Peter. "He cherished the church of St.
   Peter the apostle at Rome above all other holy and sacred places, and
   filled its treasury with a vast wealth of gold, silver, and precious
   stones. He sent great and countless gifts to the popes; and throughout
   his whole reign the wish he had nearest at heart was to re-establish
   the ancient authority of the city of Rome under his care and by his
   influence, and to defend and protect the church of St. Peter, and to
   beautify and enrich it out of his own store above all other churches."
   [245]

   His Vices.

   Notwithstanding his many and great virtues, Charles was by, no means so
   pure as the poetry and piety of the church represented him, and far
   from deserving canonization. He sacrificed thousands of human beings to
   his towering ambition and passion for conquest. He converted the Saxons
   by force of arms; he waged for thirty years a war of extermination
   against them; he wasted their territory with fire and sword; he crushed
   out their independence; he beheaded in cold blood four thousand five
   hundred prisoners in one day at Verden on the Aller (782), and when
   these proud and faithless savages finally surrendered, he removed 10000
   of their families from their homes on the banks of the Elbe to
   different parts of Germany and Gaul to prevent a future revolt. It was
   indeed a war of religion for the annihilation of heathenism, but
   conducted on the Mohammedan principle: submission to the faith, or
   death. This is contrary to the spirit of Christianity which recognizes
   only the moral means of persuasion and conviction. [246]

   The most serious defect in his private character was his incontinence
   and disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie. In this respect he
   was little better than an Oriental despot or a Mohammedan Caliph. He
   married several wives and divorced them at his pleasure. He dismissed
   his first wife (unknown by name) to marry a Lombard princess, and he
   repudiated her within a year. After the death of his fifth wife he
   contented himself with three or four concubines. He is said even to
   have encouraged his own daughters in dissolute habits rather than give
   them in marriage to princes who might become competitors for a share in
   the kingdom, but he had them carefully educated. It is not to the
   credit of the popes that they never rebuked him for this vice, while
   with weaker and less devoted monarchs they displayed such
   uncompromising zeal for the sanctity of marriage. [247]

   His Death and Burial.

   The emperor died after a short illness, and after receiving the holy
   communion, Jan. 28, 814, in the 71st year of his age, and the 47th of
   his reign, and was buried on the same day in the cathedral of
   Aix-la-Chapelle "amid the greatest lamentations of the people." [248]
   Very many omens, adds Eginhard (ch. 32), had portended his approaching
   end, as he had recognized himself. Eclipses both of the sun and the
   moon were very frequent during the last three years of his life, and a
   black spot was visible on the sun for seven days. The bridge over the
   Rhine at Mayence, which he had constructed in ten years, was consumed
   by fire; the palace at Aix-la-Chapelle frequently trembled; the
   basilica was struck by lightning, the gilded ball on the roof shattered
   by a thunderbolt and hurled upon the bishop's house adjoining; and the
   word Princeps after Karolus inscribed on an arch was effaced a few
   months before his decease. "But Charles despised, or affected to
   despise, all these things as having no reference whatever to him."

   The Charlemagne of Poetry.

   The heroic and legendary poetry of the middle ages represents Charles
   as a giant of superhuman strength and beauty, of enormous appetite,
   with eyes shining like the morning star, terrible in war, merciful in
   peace, as a victorious hero, a wise lawgiver, an unerring judge, and a
   Christian saint. He suffered only one defeat, at Roncesvalles in the
   narrow passes of the Pyrenees, when, on his return from a successful
   invasion of Spain, his rearguard with the flower of the French
   chivalry, under the command of Roland, one of his paladins and nephews,
   was surprised and routed by the Basque Mountaineers (778). [249]

   The name of "the Blessed Charles" is enrolled in the Roman Calendar for
   his services to the church and gifts to the pope. Heathen Rome deified
   Julius Caesar, Christian Rome canonized, or at least beatified
   Charlemagne. Suffrages for the repose of his soul were continued in the
   church of Aix-la-Chapelle until Paschal, a schismatical pope, at the
   desire of Frederic Barbarossa, enshrined his remains in that city and
   published a decree for his canonization (1166). The act was neither
   approved nor revoked by a regular pope, but acquiesced in, and such
   tacit canonization is considered equivalent to beatification.

   Notes.

   I. Judgments on the Personal Character of Charlemagne.

   Eginhard (whose wife Emma figures in the legend as a daughter of
   Charlemagne) gives the following frank account of the private and
   domestic relations of his master and friend (chs. 18 and 19, in Migne,
   Tom. XCVII. 42 sqq.):

   "Thus did Charles defend and increase as well as beautify his kingdom;
   and here let me express my admiration of his great qualities and his
   extraordinary constancy alike in good and evil fortune. I will now
   proceed to give the details of his private life. After his father's
   death, while sharing the kingdom with his brother, he bore his
   unfriendliness and jealousy most patiently, and, to the wonder of all,
   could not be provoked to be angry with him. Later" [after repudiating
   his first wife, an obscure person] "he married a daughter of
   Desiderius, King of the Lombards, at the instance of his mother"
   [notwithstanding the protest of the pope]; "but he repudiated her at
   the end of a year for some reason unknown, and married Hildegard, a
   woman of high birth, of Swabian origin [d. 783]. He had three sons by
   her,--Charles, Pepin, and Lewis--and as many daughters,--Hruodrud,
   Bertha, and Gisela." [Eginhard omits Adelaide and Hildegard.] "He had
   three other daughters besides these--Theoderada, Hiltrud, and
   Ruodhaid--two by his third wife, Fastrada, a woman of East Frankish
   (that is to say of German) origin, and the third by a concubine, whose
   name for the moment escapes me. At the death of Fastrada, he married
   Liutgard, an Alemannic woman, who bore him no children. After her death
   he had three [according to another reading four] concubines--Gerswinda,
   a Saxon, by whom he had Adaltrud; Regina, who was the mother of Drogo
   and Hugh; and Ethelind, by whom he had Theodoric. Charles's mother,
   Berthrada, passed her old age with him in great honor; he entertained
   the greatest veneration for her; and there was never any disagreement
   between them except when he divorced the daughter of King Desiderius,
   whom he had married to please her. She died soon after Hildegard, after
   living to see three grandsons and as many grand-daughters in her son's
   house, and he buried her with great pomp in the Basilica of St. Denis,
   where his father lay. He had an only [surviving] sister, Gisela, who
   had consecrated herself to a religious life from girlhood, and he
   cherished as much affection for her as for his mother. She also died a
   few years before him in the nunnery where she had passed her life. The
   plan which he adopted for his children's education was, first of all,
   to have both boys and girls instructed in the liberal arts, to which he
   also turned his own attention. As soon as their years admitted, in
   accordance with the custom of the Franks, the boys had to learn
   horsemanship, and to practise war and the chase, and the girls to
   familiarize themselves with cloth-making, and to handle distaff and
   spindle, that they might not grow indolent through idleness, and he
   fostered in them every virtuous sentiment. He only lost three of all
   his children before his death, two sons and one daughter .... When his
   sons and his daughters died, he was not so calm as might have been
   expected from his remarkably strong mind, for his affections were no
   less strong, and moved him to tears. Again when he was told of the
   death of Hadrian, the Roman Pontiff, whom he had loved most of all his
   friends, he wept as much as if he had lost a brother, or a very dear
   son. He was by nature most ready to contract friendships, and not only
   made friends easily, but clung to them persistently, and cherished most
   fondly those with whom he had formed such ties. He was so careful of
   the training of his sons and daughters that he never took his meals
   without them when he was at home, and never made a journey without
   them; his sons would ride at his side, and his daughters follow him,
   while a number of his body-guard, detailed for their protection,
   brought up the rear. Strange to say, although they were very handsome
   women, and he loved them very dearly, he was never willing to marry
   either of them to a man, of their own nation or to a foreigner, but
   kept them all at home until his, death, saying that he could not
   dispense with their society. Hence though otherwise happy, he
   experienced the malignity of fortune as far as they were concerned; yet
   he concealed his knowledge of the rumors current in regard to them, and
   of the suspicions entertained of their honor."

   Gibbon is no admirer of Charlemagne, and gives an exaggerated view of
   his worst vice: "Of his moral virtues chastity is not the most
   conspicuous; but the public happiness could not be materially injured
   by his nine wives or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or
   more transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed
   on the church, and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his
   daughters, whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a
   passion." But this charge of incest, as Hallam and Milman observe,
   seems to have originated in a misinterpreted passage of Eginhard quoted
   above, and is utterly unfounded.

   Henry Hallam (Middle Ages I. 26) judges a little more favorably: The
   great qualities of Charlemagne were, indeed, alloyed by the vices of a
   barbarian and a conqueror. Nine wives, whom he divorced with very
   little ceremony, attest the license of his private life, which his
   temperance and frugality can hardly be said to redeem. Unsparing of
   blood, though not constitutionally cruel, and wholly indifferent to the
   means which his ambition prescribed, he beheaded in one day four
   thousand Saxons--an act of atrocious butchery, after which his
   persecuting edicts, pronouncing the pain of death against those who
   refused baptism, or even who ate flesh during Lent, seem scarcely
   worthy of notice. This union of barbarous ferocity with elevated views
   of national improvement might suggest the parallel of Peter the Great.
   But the degrading habits and brute violence of the Muscovite place him
   at an immense distance from the restorer of the empire.

   "A strong sympathy for intellectual excellence was the leading
   characteristic of Charlemagne, and this undoubtedly biassed him in the
   chief political error of his conduct--that of encouraging the power and
   pretensions of the hierarchy. But, perhaps, his greatest eulogy is
   written in the disgraces of succeeding times and the miseries of
   Europe. He stands alone, like a beacon upon a waste, or a rock in the
   broad ocean. His sceptre was the bow of Ulysses, which could not be
   drawn by any weaker hand. In the dark ages of European history the
   reign of Charlemagne affords a solitary resting-place between two long
   periods of turbulence and ignominy, deriving the advantages of contrast
   both from that of the preceding dynasty and of a posterity for whom he
   had formed an empire which they were unworthy and unequal to maintain."

   G. P. R. James (History of Charlemagne, Lond., 1847, p. 499): "No man,
   perhaps, that ever lived, combined in so high a degree those qualities
   which rule men and direct events, with those which endear the possessor
   and attach his contemporaries. No man was ever more trusted and loved
   by his people, more respected and feared by other kings, more esteemed
   in his lifetime, or more regretted at his death.

   Milman (Book V. ch. 1): "Karl, according to his German appellation, was
   the model of a Teutonic chieftain, in his gigantic stature, enormous
   strength, and indefatigable activity; temperate in diet, and superior
   to the barbarous vice of drunkenness. Hunting and war were his chief
   occupations; and his wars were carried on with all the ferocity of
   encountering savage tribes. But he was likewise a Roman Emperor, not
   only in his vast and organizing policy, he had that one vice of the old
   Roman civilization which the Merovingian kings had indulged, though not
   perhaps with more unbounded lawlessness. The religious emperor, in one
   respect, troubled not himself with the restraints of religion. The
   humble or grateful church beheld meekly, and almost without
   remonstrance, the irregularity of domestic life, which not merely
   indulged in free license, but treated the sacred rite of marriage as a
   covenant dissoluble at his pleasure. Once we have heard, and but once,
   the church raise its authoritative, its comminatory voice, and that not
   to forbid the King of the Franks from wedding a second wife while his
   first was alive, but from marrying a Lombard princess. One pious
   ecclesiastic alone in his dominion, he a relative, ventured to protest
   aloud.')

   Guizot (Histoire de la civilisation en France, leçon XX.): "Charlemagne
   marque la limite à laquelle est enfin consommée la dissolution de
   l'ancien monde romain et barbare, et où commence la formation du monde
   nouveau."

   Vétault (Charlemagne, 455, 458): "Charlemagne fut, en effet, le père du
   monde moderne et de la societé européenne .... Si Ch. ne peut être
   légitemement honoré comme un saint, il a droit du moins à la première
   place, parmis tous les héros, dans l'admiration des hommes; car on ne
   trouverait pas un autre souverain qui ait autant aimé l'humanité et lui
   ait fait plus de bien. Il est le plus glorieux, parce que ... il a
   mérite d' être proclamé le plus honnête des grands hommes."

   Giesebrecht, the historian of the German emperors, gives a glowing
   description of Charlemagne (I. 140): "Many high-minded rulers arose in
   the ten centuries after Charles, but none had a higher aim. To be
   ranked with him, satisfied the boldest conquerors, the wisest princes
   of peace. French chivalry of later times glorified Charlemagne as the
   first cavalier; the German burgeoisie as the fatherly friend of the
   people and the most righteous judge; the Catholic Church raised him to
   the number of her saints; the poetry of all nations derived ever new
   inspiration and strength from his mighty person. Never perhaps has
   richer life proceeded from the activity of a mortal man (Nie vielleicht
   ist reicheres Leben von der Wirksamkeit eines sterblichen Menschen
   ausgegangen)."

   We add the eloquent testimony of an American author, Parke Godwin
   (History of France, N. Y., 1860, vol. i. p. 410): "There is to me
   something indescribably grand in the figure of many of the barbaric
   chiefs--Alariks, Ataulfs, Theodoriks, and Euriks--who succeeded to the
   power of the Romans, and in their wild, heroic way, endeavored to raise
   a fabric of state on the ruins of the ancient empire. But none of those
   figures is so imposing and majestic as that of Karl, the son of Pippin,
   whose name, for the first and only time in history, the admiration of
   mankind has indissolubly blended with the title the Great. By the
   peculiarity of his position in respect to ancient and modern times--by
   the extraordinary length of his reign, by the number and importance of
   the transactions in which he was engaged, by the extent and splendor of
   his conquests, by his signal services to the Church, and by the
   grandeur of his personal qualities--he impressed himself so profoundly
   upon the character of his times, that he stands almost alone and apart
   in the annals of Europe. For nearly a thousand years before him, or
   since the days of Julius Caesar, no monarch had won so universal and
   brilliant a renown; and for nearly a thousand years after him, or until
   the days of Charles V. of Germany, no monarch attained any thing like
   an equal dominion. A link between the old and new, he revived the
   Empire of the West, with a degree of glory that it had only enjoyed in
   its prime; while, at the same time, the modern history of every
   Continental nation was made to begin with him. Germany claims him as
   one of her most illustrious sons; France, as her noblest king; Italy,
   as her chosen emperor; and the Church as her most prodigal benefactor
   and worthy saint. All the institutions of the Middle Ages--political,
   literary, scientific, and ecclesiastical--delighted to trace their
   traditionary origins to his hand: he was considered the source of the
   peerage, the inspirer of chivalry, the founder of universities, and the
   endower of the churches; and the genius of romance, kindling its
   fantastic torches at the flame of his deeds, lighted up a new and
   marvellous world about him, filled with wonderful adventures and heroic
   forms. Thus by a double immortality, the one the deliberate award of
   history, and the other the prodigal gift of fiction, he claims the
   study of mankind."

   II. The Canonization of Charlemagne is perpetuated in the Officium in
   festo Sancti Caroli Magni imperatoris et confessoris, as celebrated in
   churches of Germany, France, and Spain. Baronius (Annal. ad ann. 814)
   says that the canonization was, not accepted by the Roman church,
   because Paschalis was no legitimate pope, but neither was it forbidden.
   Alban Butler, in his Lives of Saints, gives a eulogistic biography of
   the "Blessed Charlemagne," and covers his besetting sin with the
   following unhistorical assertion: "The incontinence, into which he fell
   in his youth, he expiated by sincere repentance, so that several
   churches in Germany and France honor him among the saints."

   the king of Lombardy, but not on the ground of divorce from his first
   wife, which would have furnished a very good reason, but from
   opposition to a union with the "perfidious, leprous, and fetid brood of
   the Lombards, a brood hardly reckoned human." Charles married the
   princess, to the delight of his mother, but repudiated her the next
   year and sent her back to her father. See Milman, Bk. IV., ch. 12 (II.

   (Charlemagne, patrice des Romains-Formation des états de l'église).

   Charlemagne inherited the protectorate of the temporal dominions of the
   pope which had been wrested from the Lombards by Pepin, as the Lombards
   had wrested them from the Eastern emperor. When the Lombards again
   rebelled and the pope (Hadrian) again appealed to the transalpine
   monarch for help, Charles in the third year of his sole reign (774)
   came to the rescue, crossed the Alps with an army--a formidable
   undertaking in those days--subdued Italy with the exception of a small
   part of the South still belonging to the Greek empire, held a triumphal
   entry in Rome, and renewed and probably enlarged his father's gift to
   the pope. The original documents have perished, and no contemporary
   authority vouches for the details; but the fact is undoubted. The gift
   rested only on the right of conquest. Henceforward he always styled
   himself "Rex Francorum et Longobardorum, et Patricius Romanorum." His
   authority over the immediate territory of the Lombards in Northern
   Italy was as complete as that in France, but the precise nature of his
   authority over the pope's dominion as Patrician of the Romans became
   after his death an apple of discord for centuries. Hadrian, to judge
   from his letters, considered himself as much an absolute sovereign in
   his dominion as Charles in his.

   In 781 at Easter Charles revisited Rome with his son Pepin, who on that
   occasion was anointed by the pope "King for Italy" ("Rex in Italiam").
   On a third visit., in 787, he spent a few days with his friend,
   Hadrian, in the interest of the patrimony of St. Peter. When Leo III.
   followed Hadrian (796) he immediately dispatched to Charles, as tokens
   of submission the keys and standards of the city, and the keys of the
   sepulchre of Peter.

   A few years afterwards a terrible riot broke out in Rome in which the
   pope was assaulted and almost killed (799). He fled for help to
   Charles, then at Paderborn in Westphalia, and was promised assistance.
   The next year Charles again crossed the Alps and declared his intention
   to investigate the charges of certain unknown crimes against Leo, but
   no witness appeared to prove them. Leo publicly read a declaration of
   his own innocence, probably at the request of Charles, but with a
   protest that this declaration should not be taken for a precedent. Soon
   afterwards occurred the great event which marks an era in the
   ecclesiastical and political history of Europe.

   The Coronation of Charles as Emperor.

   While Charles was celebrating Christmas in St. Peter's, in the year of
   our Lord 800, and kneeling in prayer before the altar, the pope, as
   under a sudden inspiration (but no doubt in consequence of a
   premeditated scheme), placed a golden crown upon his head, and the
   Roman people shouted three times: "To Charles Augustus, crowned by God,
   the great and pacific emperor of the Romans, life and victory!"
   Forthwith, after ancient custom, he was adored by the pope, and was
   styled henceforth (instead of Patrician) Emperor and Augustus. [250]

   The new emperor presented to the pope a round table of silver with the
   picture of Constantinople, and many gifts of gold, and remained in Rome
   till Easter. The moment or manner of the coronation may have been
   unexpected by Charles (if we are to believe his word), but it is hardly
   conceivable that it was not the result of a previous arrangement
   between him and Leo. Alcuin seems to have aided the scheme. In his view
   the pope occupied the first, the emperor the second, the king the third
   degree in the scale of earthly dignities. He sent to Charles from Tours
   before his coronation a splendid Bible with the inscription: Ad
   splendorem imperialis potentiae. [251]

   On his return to France Charles compelled all his subjects to take a
   new oath to him as "Caesar." He assumed the full title "Serenssimus
   Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus et pacificus imperator, Romanum
   gubernans imperium, qui et per misericordiam Dei rex Francorum et
   Longobardorum."

   Significance of the Act.

   The act of coronation was on the part of the pope a final declaration
   of independence and self-emancipation against the Greek emperor, as the
   legal ruler of Rome. Charles seems to have felt this, and hence he
   proposed to unite the two empires by marrying Irene, who had put her
   son to death and usurped the Greek crown (797). But the same rebellion
   had been virtually committed before by the pope in sending the keys of
   the city to Pepin, and by the French king in accepting this token of
   temporal sovereignty. Public opinion justified the act on the principle
   that might makes right. The Greek emperor, being unable to maintain his
   power in Italy and to defend his own subjects, first against the
   Lombards and then against the Franks, had virtually forfeited his
   claim.

   For the West the event was the re-establishment, on a Teutonic basis,
   of the old Roman empire, which henceforth, together with the papacy,
   controlled the history of the middle ages. The pope and the emperor
   represented the highest dignity and power in church and state. But the
   pope was the greater and more enduring power of the two. He continued,
   down to the Reformation, the spiritual ruler of all Europe, and is to
   this day the ruler of an empire much vaster than that of ancient Rome.
   He is, in the striking language of Hobbes, "the ghost of the deceased
   Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof."

   The Relation of the Pope and the Emperor.

   What was the legal and actual relation between these two sovereignties,
   and the limits of jurisdiction of each? This was the struggle of
   centuries. It involved many problems which could only be settled in the
   course of events. It was easy enough to distinguish the two in theory
   by, confining the pope to spiritual, and the emperor to temporal
   affairs. But on the theocratic theory of the union of church and state
   the two will and must come into frequent conflict.

   The pope, by voluntarily conferring the imperial crown upon Charles,
   might claim that the empire was his gift, and that the right of
   crowning implied the right of discrowning. And this right was exercised
   by popes at a later period, who wielded the secular as well as the
   spiritual sword and absolved nations of their oath of allegiance. A
   mosaic picture in the triclinium of Leo III. in the Lateran (from the
   ninth century) represents St. Peter in glory, bestowing upon Leo
   kneeling at his right hand the priestly stole, and upon Charles
   kneeling at his left, the standard of Rome. [252] This is the mediaeval
   hierarchical theory, which derives all power from God through Peter as
   the head of the church. Gregory VII. compared the church to the sun,
   the state to the moon who derives her light from the sun. The popes
   will always maintain the principle of the absolute supremacy of the
   church over the state, and support or oppose a government--whether it
   be an empire or a kingdom or a republic--according to the degree of its
   subserviency to the interests of the hierarchy. The papal Syllabus of
   1864 expresses the genuine spirit of the system in irreconcilable
   conflict with the spirit of modern history and civilization. The
   Vatican Palace is the richest museum of classical and mediaeval
   curiosities, and the pope himself, the infallible oracle of two hundred
   millions of souls, is by far the greatest curiosity in it.

   On the other hand Charles, although devotedly attached to the church
   and the pope, was too absolute a monarch to recognize a sovereignty
   within his sovereignty. He derived his idea of the theocracy from the
   Old Testament, and the relation between Moses and Aaron. He understood
   and exercised his imperial dignity pretty much in the same way as
   Constantine the Great and Theodosius the Great had done in the
   Byzantine empire, which was caesaro-papal in principle and practice,
   and so is its successor, the Russian empire. Charles believed that he
   was the divinely appointed protector of the church and the regulator of
   all her external and to some extent also the internal affairs. He
   called the synods of his empire without asking the pope. He presided at
   the Council of Frankfort (794), which legislated on matters of doctrine
   and discipline, condemned the Adoption heresy, agreeably to the pope,
   and rejected the image worship against the decision of the second
   oecumenical Council of Nicaea (787) and the declared views of several
   popes. [253] He appointed bishops and abbots as well as counts, and if
   a vacancy in the papacy, had occurred during the remainder of his life,
   he would probably have filled it as well as the ordinary bishoprics.
   The first act after his coronation was to summon and condemn to death
   for treason those who had attempted to depose the pope. He thus acted
   as judge in the case. A Council at Mayence in 813 called him in an
   official document "the pious ruler of the holy church." [254]

   Charles regarded the royal and imperial dignity as the hereditary
   possession of his house and people, and crowned his son, Louis the
   Pious, at Aix-la-Chapelle in 813, without consulting the pope or the
   Romans. [255] He himself as a Teuton represented both France and
   Germany. But with the political separation of the two countries under
   his successors, the imperial dignity was attached to the German crown.
   Hence also the designation: the holy German Roman empire.

   matters as clearly, secular. Charlemagne was present and presided in

   § 58. Survey of the History of the Holy Roman Empire.

   The readiness with which the Romans responded to the crowning act of
   Leo proves that the re-establishment of the Western empire was timely.
   The Holy Roman Empire seemed to be the necessary counterpart of the
   Holy Roman Church. For many, centuries the nations of Europe had been
   used to the concentration of all secular power in one head. It is true,
   several Roman emperors from Nero to Diocletian had persecuted
   Christianity by fire and sword, but Constantine and his successors had
   raised the church to dignity and power, and bestowed upon it all the
   privileges of a state religion. The transfer of the seat of empire from
   Rome to Constantinople withdrew from the Western church the protection
   of the secular arm, and exposed Europe to the horrors of barbarian
   invasion and the chaos of civil wars. The popes were among the chief
   sufferers, their territory, being again and again overrun and laid
   waste by the savage Lombards. Hence the instinctive desire for the
   protecting arm of a new empire, and this could only be expected from
   the fresh and vigorous Teutonic power which had risen beyond the Alps
   and Christianized by Roman missionaries. Into this empire "all the life
   of the ancient world was gathered; out of it all the life of the modern
   world arose." [256]

   The Empire and the Papacy, The Two Ruling Powers of the Middle Ages.

   Henceforward the mediaeval history of Europe is chiefly a history of
   the papacy and the empire. They were regarded as the two arms of God in
   governing the church and the world. This twofold government was upon
   the whole the best training-school of the barbarian for Christian
   civilization and freedom. The papacy acted as a wholesome check upon
   military despotism, the empire as a check upon the abuses of
   priestcraft. Both secured order and unity against the disintegrating
   tendencies of society; both nourished the great idea of a commonwealth
   of nations, of a brotherhood of mankind, of a communion of saints. By
   its connection with Rome, the empire infused new blood into the old
   nationalities of the South, and transferred the remaining treasures of
   classical culture and the Roman law to the new nations of the North.
   The tendency of both was ultimately self-destructive; they fostered,
   while seeming to oppose, the spirit of ecclesiastical and national
   independence. The discipline of authority always produces freedom as
   its legitimate result. The law is a schoolmaster to lead men to the
   gospel.

   Otho the Great.

   In the opening chapter of the history of the empire we find it under
   the control of a master-mind and in friendly alliance with the papacy.
   Under the weak successors of Charlemagne it dwindled down to a merely
   nominal existence. But it revived again in Otho I. or the Great
   (936-973), of the Saxon dynasty. He was master of the pope and defender
   of the Roman church, and left everywhere the impress of an heroic
   character, inferior only to that of Charles. Under Henry III.
   (1039-1056), when the papacy sank lowest, the empire again proved a
   reforming power. He deposed three rival popes, and elected a worthy,
   successor. But as the papacy rose from its degradation, it overawed the
   empire.

   Henry IV. and Gregory VII.

   Under Henry IV. (1056-1106) and Gregory VII. (1073-1085) the two power;
   came into the sharpest conflict concerning the right of investiture, or
   the supreme control in the election of bishops and abbots. The papacy
   achieved a moral triumph over the empire at Canossa, when the mightiest
   prince kneeled as a penitent at the feet of the proud successor of
   Peter (1077); but Henry recovered his manhood and his power, set up an
   antipope, and Gregory died in exile at Salerno, yet without yielding an
   inch of his principles and pretensions. The conflict lasted fifty
   years, and ended with the Concordat of Worms (Sept. 23, 1122), which
   was a compromise, but with a limitation of the imperial prerogative:
   the pope secured the right to invest the bishops with the ring and
   crozier, but the new bishop before his consecration was to receive his
   temporal estates as a fief of the crown by the touch of the emperor's
   sceptre.

   The House of Hohenstaufen.

   Under the Swabian emperors of the house of Hohenstaufen (1138-1254) the
   Roman empire reached its highest power in connection with the Crusades,
   in the palmy days of mediaeval chivalry, poetry and song. They excelled
   in personal greatness and renown the Saxon and the Salic emperors, but
   were too much concerned with Italian affairs for the good of Germany.
   Frederick Barbarossa (Redbeard), during his long reign (1152-1190), was
   a worthy successor of Charlemagne and Otho the Great. He subdued
   Northern Italy, quarrelled with pope Alexander III., enthroned two
   rival popes (Paschal III., and after his death Calixtus III.), but
   ultimately submitted to Alexander, fell at his feet at Venice, and was
   embraced by the pope with tears of joy and the kiss of peace (1177). He
   died at the head of an army of crusaders, while attempting to cross the
   Cydnus in Cilicia (June 10, 1190), and entered upon his long enchanted
   sleep in Kyffhäuser till his spirit reappeared to establish a new
   German empire in 1871. [257]

   Under Innocent III. (1198-1216) the papacy reached the acme of its
   power, and maintained it till the time of Boniface VIII. (1294-1303).
   Emperor Frederick II. (1215-1250), Barbarossa's grandson, was equal to
   the best of his predecessors in genius and energy, superior to them in
   culture, but more an Italian than a German, and a skeptic on the
   subject of religion. He reconquered Jerusalem in the fifth crusade, but
   cared little for the church, and was put under the ban by pope Gregory
   IX., who denounced him as a heretic and blasphemer, and compared him to
   the Apocalyptic beast from the abyss. [258] The news of his sudden
   death was hailed by pope Innocent IV. with the exclamation: "Let the
   heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad." His death was the collapse
   of the house of Hohenstaufen, and for a time also of the Roman empire.
   His son and successor Conrad IV. ruled but a few years, and his
   grandson Conradin, a bright and innocent youth of sixteen, was opposed
   by the pope, and beheaded at Naples in sight of his hereditary kingdom
   (October 29, 1268).

   Italy was at once the paradise and the grave of German ambition.

   The German Empire.

   After "the great interregnum" when might was right, [259] the Swiss
   count Rudolf of Hapsburg (a castle in the Swiss canton of Aargau) was
   elected emperor by the seven electors, and crowned at Aachen
   (1273-1291). He restored peace and order, never visited Italy, escaped
   the ruinous quarrels with the pope, built up a German kingdom, and laid
   the foundation of the conservative, orthodox, tenacious, and selfish
   house of Austria.

   The empire continued to live for more than five centuries with varying
   fortunes, in nominal connection with Rome and at the head of the
   secular powers in Christendom, but without controlling influence over
   the fortunes of the papacy and the course of Europe. Occasionally it
   sent forth a gleam of its universal aim, as under Henry VII., who was
   crowned in Rome and hailed by Dante as the saviour of Italy, but died
   of fever (if not of poison administered by a Dominican monk in the
   sacramental cup) in Tuscany (1313); under Sigismund, the convener and
   protector of the oecumenical Council at Constance which deposed popes
   and burned Hus (1414), a much better man than either the emperor or the
   contemporary popes; under Charles V. (1519-1558), who wore the crown of
   Spain and Austria as well as of Germany, and on whose dominions the sun
   never set; and under Joseph II. (1765-1790), who renounced the
   intolerant policy of his ancestors, unmindful of the pope's protest,
   and narrowly escaped greatness. [260] But the emperors after Rudolf,
   with a few exceptions, were no more crowned in Rome, and withdrew from
   Italy. [261] They were chosen at Frankfort by the Seven Electors, three
   spiritual, and four temporal: the archbishops of Mentz, Treves, and
   Cologne, the king of Bohemia, and the Electors of the Palatinate,
   Saxony, and Brandenburg (afterwards enlarged to nine). The competition,
   however, was confined to a few powerful houses, until in the 15th
   century the Hapsburgs grasped the crown and held it tenaciously, with
   one exception, till the dissolution. The Hapsburg emperors always cared
   more for their hereditary dominions, which they steadily increased by
   fortunate marriages, than for Germany and the papacy.

   The Decline and Fall of the Empire.

   Many causes contributed to the gradual downfall of the German empire:
   the successful revolt of the Swiss mountaineers, the growth of the
   independent kingdoms of Spain, France, and England, the jealousies of
   the electors and the minor German princes, the discovery of a new
   Continent in the West, the invasion of the Turks from the East, the
   Reformation which divided the German people into two hostile religions,
   the fearful devastations of the thirty years' war, the rise of the
   house of Hohenzollern and the kingdom of Prussia on German soil with
   the brilliant genius of Frederick II., and the wars growing out of the
   French Revolution. In its last stages it became a mere shadow, and
   justified the satirical description (traced to Voltaire), that the Holy
   Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. The last of
   the emperors, Francis II., in August 6th, 1806, abdicated the elective
   crown of Germany and substituted for it the hereditary crown of Austria
   as Francis I. (d. 1835).

   Thus the holy Roman empire died in peace at the venerable age of one
   thousand and six years.

   The Empire of Napoleon.

   Napoleon, hurled into sudden power by the whirlwind of revolution on
   the wings of his military genius, aimed at the double glory of a second
   Caesar and a second Charlemagne, and constructed, by arbitrary force, a
   huge military empire on the basis of France, with the pope as an
   obedient paid servant at Paris, but it collapsed on the battle fields
   of Leipzig and Waterloo, without the hope of a resurrection. "I have
   not succeeded Louis Quatorze," he said, "but Charlemagne." He dismissed
   his wife and married a daughter of the last German and first Austrian
   emperor; he assumed the Lombard crown at Milan; he made his ill-fated
   son "King of Rome" in imitation of the German "King of the Romans." He
   revoked "the donations which my predecessors, the French emperors have
   made," and appropriated them to France. "Your holiness," he wrote to
   Pius VII., who had once addressed him as his "very dear Son in Christ,"
   "is sovereign of Rome, but I am the emperor thereof." "You are right,"
   he wrote to Cardinal Fesch, his uncle, "that I am Charlemagne, and I
   ought to be treated as the emperor of the papal court. I shall inform
   the pope of my intentions in a few words, and if he declines to
   acquiesce, I shall reduce him to the same condition in which he was
   before Charlemagne." [262] It is reported that he proposed to the pope
   to reside in Paris with a large salary, and rule the conscience of
   Europe under the military, supremacy of the emperor, that the pope
   listened first to his persuasion with the single remark: "Comedian,"
   and then to his threats with the reply: "Tragedian," and turned him his
   back. The papacy utilized the empire of the uncle and the nephew, as
   well as it could, and survived them. But the first Napoleon swept away
   the effete institutions of feudalism, and by his ruthless and scornful
   treatment of conquered nationalities provoked a powerful revival of
   these very nationalities which overthrew and buried his own artificial
   empire. The deepest humiliation of the German nation, and especially of
   Prussia, was the beginning of its uprising in the war of liberation.

   The German Confederation.

   The Congress of Vienna erected a temporary substitute for the old
   empire in the German "Bund" at Frankfort. It was no federal state, but
   a loose confederacy of 38 sovereign states, or princes rather, without
   any popular representation; it was a rope of sand, a sham unity, under
   the leadership of Austria; and Austria shrewdly and selfishly used the
   petty rivalries and jealousies of the smaller principalities as a means
   to check the progress of Prussia and to suppress all liberal movements.

   The New German Empire.

   In the meantime the popular desire for national union, awakened by the
   war of liberation and a great national literature, made steady
   progress, and found at last its embodiment in a new German empire with
   a liberal constitution and a national parliament. But this great result
   was brought about by great events and achievements under the leadership
   of Prussia against foreign aggression. The first step was the brilliant
   victory of Prussia over Austria at Königgrätz, which resulted in the
   formation of the North German Confederation (1866). The second step was
   the still more remarkable triumph of united Germany in a war of
   self-defence against the empire of Napoleon III., which ended in the
   proclamation of William I. as German emperor by the united wishes of
   the German princes and peoples in the palace of Louis XIV. at
   Versailles (1870).

   Thus the long dream of the German nation was fulfilled through a series
   of the most brilliant military and diplomatic victories recorded in
   modern history, by the combined genius of Bismarck, Moltke, and
   William, and the valor, discipline, and intelligence of the German
   army.

   Simultaneously with this German movement, Italy under the lead of
   Cavour and Victor Emmanuel, achieved her national unity, with Rome as
   the political capital.

   But the new German empire is not a continuation or revival of the old.
   It differs from it in several essential particulars. It is the result
   of popular national aspiration and of a war of self-defence, not of
   conquest; it is based on the predominance of Prussia and North Germany,
   not of Austria and South Germany; it is hereditary, not elective; it is
   controlled by modern ideas of liberty and progress, not by mediaeval
   notions and institutions; it is essentially Protestant, and not Roman
   Catholic; it is a German, not a Roman empire. Its rise is indirectly
   connected with the simultaneous downfall of the temporal power of the
   pope, who is the hereditary and unchangeable enemy both of German and
   Italian unity and freedom. The new empire is independent of the church,
   and has officially no connection with religion, resembling in this
   respect the government of the United States; but its Protestant animus
   appears not only in the hereditary religion of the first emperor, but
   also in the expulsion of the Jesuits (1872), and the "Culturkampf"
   against the politico-hierarchical aspirations of the ultramontane
   papacy. When Pius IX., in a letter to William I. (1873), claimed a sort
   of jurisdiction over all baptized Christians, the emperor courteously
   informed the infallible pope that he, with all Protestants, recognized
   no other mediator between God and man but our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ. The new German empire will and ought to do full justice to the
   Catholic church, but "will never go to Canossa."

   We pause at the close of a long and weighty chapter in history; we
   wonder what the next chapter will be.

   [257] Friedrich Rückert has reproduced this significant German legend
   in a poem beginning: Der alte Barbarossa, Der Kaiser Friederich, Im

   Er ist niemals gestorben, Er lebt darin noch jetzt; Er hat im Schloss
   verborgen Zum Schlaf sich hingesetzt.
   Er hat hinabgenommen Des Reiches Herrlichkeit, Und wird einst

   [259] Schiller calls it "die kaiserlose, die schreckliche Zeit."

   [260] The pope Pius VI. even made a journey to Vienna, but when he
   extended his hand to the minister Kaunitz to kiss, the minister took it
   and shook it. Joseph in turn visited Rome, and was received by the
   people with the shout: "Evviva il nostro imperatore!"

   [261] Dante (Purgat. VII. 94) represents Rudolf of Hapsburg as seated
   gloomily apart in purgatory, and mourning his sin of neglecting
   "To heal the wounds that Italy have slain."
   Weary of the endless strife of domestic tyrants and factions in every
   city, Dante longed for some controlling power that should restore unity
   and peace to his beloved but unfortunate Italy. He expounded his
   political ideas in his work De Monarchia.

   [262] 2 In another letter to Fesch (Correspond. de l' empereur Napol.
   Ier, Tom. xi. 528), he writes, "Pour le pape je suis Charemagne. parce
   que comme Charlemagne je réunis la couronne de Prance à celle du
   Lombards et que mon empire confine avec l' Orient." Quoted by Bryce.

   § 59. The Papacy and the Empire from the Death of Charlemagne to
   Nicolas I a.d. 814-858). Note on the Myth of the Papess Joan.

   The power of Charlemagne was personal. Under his weak successors the
   empire fell to pieces, and the creation of his genius was buried in
   chaotic confusion; but the idea survived. His son and successor, Louis
   the Pious, as the Germans and Italians called him, or Louis the Gentle
   (le débonnaire) in French history (814-840), inherited the piety, and
   some of the valor and legislative wisdom, but not the genius and
   energy, of his father. He was a devoted and superstitious servant of
   the clergy. He began with reforms, he dismissed his father's concubines
   and daughters with their paramours from the court, turned the palace
   into a monastery, and promoted the Scandinavian mission of St. Ansgar.
   In the progress of his reign, especially after his second marriage to
   the ambitious Judith, he showed deplorable weakness and allowed his
   empire to decay, while he wasted his time between monkish exercises and
   field-sports in the forest of the Ardennes. He unwisely shared his rule
   with his three sons who soon rebelled against their father and engaged
   in fraternal wars.

   After his death the treaty of Verdun was concluded in 843. By this
   treaty the empire was divided; Lothair received Italy with the title of
   emperor, France fell to Charles the Bald, Germany to Louis the German.
   Thus Charlemagne's conception of a Western empire that should be
   commensurate with the Latin church was destroyed, or at least greatly
   contracted, and the three countries have henceforth a separate history.
   This was better for the development of nationality. The imperial
   dignity was afterwards united with the German crown, and continued
   under this modified form till 1806.

   During this civil commotion the papacy had no distinguished
   representative, but upon the whole profited by it. Some of the popes
   evaded the imperial sanction of their election. The French clergy
   forced the gentle Louis to make at Soissons a most humiliating
   confession of guilt for all the slaughter, pillage, and sacrilege
   committed during the civil wars, and for bringing the empire to the
   brink of ruin. Thus the hierarchy assumed control even over the civil
   misconduct of the sovereign and imposed ecclesiastical penance for ft.

   Note. The Myth of Johanna Papissa.

   We must make a passing mention of the curious and mysterious myth of
   papess Johanna, who is said during this period between Leo IV. (847)
   and Benedict III. (855) to have worn the triple crown for two years and
   a half. She was a lady of Mayence (her name is variously called Agnes,
   Gilberta, Johanna, Jutta), studied in disguise philosophy in Athens
   (where philosophy had long before died out), taught theology in Rome,
   under the name of Johannes Anglicus, and was elevated to the papal
   dignity as John VIII., but died in consequence of the discovery of her
   sex by a sudden confinement in the open street during a solemn
   procession from the Vatican to the Lateran. According to another
   tradition she was tied to the hoof of a horse, dragged outside of the
   city and stoned to death by the people, and the inscription was put on
   her grave:

   "Parce pater patrum papissae edere partum."

   The strange story originated in Rome, and was first circulated by the
   Dominicans and Minorites, and acquired general credit in the 13th and
   14th centuries. Pope John XX. (1276) called himself John XXI. In the
   beginning of the 15th century the bust of this woman-pope was placed
   alongside with the busts of the other popes at Sienna, and nobody took
   offence at it. Even Chancellor Gerson used the story as an argument
   that the church could err in matters of fact. At the Council in
   Constance it was used against the popes. Torrecremata, the upholder of
   papal despotism, draws from it the lesson that if the church can stand
   a woman-pope, she might stand the still greater evil of a heretical
   pope.

   Nevertheless the story is undoubtedly a mere fiction, and is so
   regarded by nearly all modern historians, Protestant as well as Roman
   Catholic. It is not mentioned till four hundred years later by Stephen,
   a French Dominican (who died 1261). [263] It was unknown to Photius and
   the bitter Greek polemics during the ninth and tenth centuries, who
   would not have missed the opportunity to make use of it as an argument
   against the papacy. There is no gap in the election of the popes
   between Leo and Benedict, who, according to contemporary historians,
   was canonically elected three days after the death of Leo IV. (which
   occurred July 17th, 855), or at all events in the same month, and
   consecrated two months after (Sept. 29th). See Jaffé, Regesta, p. 235.
   The myth was probably an allegory or satire on the monstrous government
   of women (Theodora and Marozia) over several licentious popes--Sergius
   III., John X., XI., and XII.--in the tenth century. So Heumann,
   Schröckh, Gibbon, Neander. The only serious objection to this solution
   is that the myth would be displaced from the ninth to the tenth
   century.

   Other conjectures are these: The myth of the female pope was a satire
   on John VIII. for his softness in dealing with Photius (Baronius); the
   misunderstanding of a fact that some foreign bishop (pontifex) in Rome
   was really a woman in disguise (Leibnitz); the papess was a widow of
   Leo IV. (Kist); a misinterpretation of the stella stercoraria
   (Schmidt); a satirical allegory on the origin and circulation of the
   false decretals of Isidor (Henke and Gfrörer); an impersonation of the
   great whore of the Apocalypse, and the popular expression of the belief
   that the mystery of iniquity was working in the papal court
   (Baring-Gould).

   David Blondel, first destroyed the credit of this mediaeval fiction, in
   his learned French dissertation on the subject (Amsterdam, 1649).
   spanheim defended it, and Mosheim credited it much to his discredit as
   an historian. See the elaborate discussion of Döllinger, Papst-Fabeln
   des Mittelalters, 2d ed. Munchen, 1863 (Engl. transl. N. Y., 1872, pp.
   4-58 and pp. 430-437). Comp. also Bianchi-Giovini, Esame critico degli
   atti e documenti della papessa Giovanna, Mil. 1845, and the long note
   of Gieseler, II. 30-32 (N. Y. ed.), which sums up the chief data in the
   case.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [263] The oldest testimony in the almost contemporary "Liber
   Pontificalis" of Anastasius is wanting in the best manuscripts, and
   must be a later interpolation. Döllinger shows that the myth, although
   it may have circulated earlier in the mouth of the people, was not
   definitely put into writing before the middle of the thirteenth
   century.

   During the chaotic confusion under the Carolingians, in the middle of
   the ninth century, a mysterious book made its appearance, which gave
   legal expression to the popular opinion of the papacy, raised and
   strengthened its power more than any other agency, and forms to a large
   extent the basis of the canon law of the church of Rome. This is a
   collection of ecclesiastical laws under the false name of bishop Isidor
   of Seville (died 636), hence called the "Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals."
   [264] He was the reputed (though not the real) author of an earlier
   collection, based upon that of the Roman abbot, Dionysius Exiguus, in
   the sixth century, and used as the law-book of the church in Spain,
   hence called the "Hispana." In these earlier collections the letters
   and decrees (Epistolae Decretales) of the popes from the time of
   Siricius (384) occupy a prominent place. [265] A decretal in the
   canonical sense is an authoritative rescript of a pope in reply to some
   question, while a decree is a papal ordinance enacted with the advice
   of the Cardinals, without a previous inquiry. A canon is a law ordained
   by a general or provincial synod. A dogma is an ecclesiastical law
   relating to doctrine. The earliest decretals had moral rather than
   legislative force. But as the questions and appeals to the pope
   multiplied, the papal answers grew in authority. Fictitious documents,
   canons, and decretals were nothing new; but the Pseudo-Isidorian
   collection is the most colossal and effective fraud known in the
   history of ecclesiastical literature.

   1. The contents of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. The book is divided
   into three parts. The first part contains fifty Apostolical Canons from
   the collection of Dionysius, sixty spurious decretals of the Roman
   bishops from Clement (d. 101) to Melchiades (d. 314). The second part
   comprehends the forged document of the donation of Constantine, some
   tracts concerning the Council of Nicaea, and the canons of the Greek,
   African, Gallic, and Spanish Councils down to 683, from the Spanish
   collection. The third part, after a preface copied from the Hispana,
   gives in chronological order the decretals of the popes from Sylvester
   (d. 335) to Gregory II. (d. 731), among which thirty-five are forged,
   including all before Damasus; but the genuine letters also, which are
   taken from the Isidorian collection, contain interpolations. In many
   editions the Capitula Angilramni are appended.

   All these documents make up a manual of orthodox doctrine and clerical
   discipline. They give dogmatic decisions against heresies, especially
   Arianism (which lingered long in Spain), and directions on worship, the
   sacraments, feasts and fasts, sacred rites and costumes, the
   consecration of churches, church property, and especially on church
   polity. The work breathes throughout the spirit of churchly and
   priestly piety and reverence.

   2. The sacerdotal system. Pseudo-Isidor advocates the papal theocracy.
   The clergy is a divinely instituted, consecrated, and inviolable caste,
   mediating between God and the people, as in the Jewish dispensation.
   The priests are the "familiares Dei," the "spirituales," the laity the
   "carnales." He who sins against them sins against God. They are subject
   to no earthly tribunal, and responsible to God alone, who appointed
   them judges of men. The privileges of the priesthood culminate in the
   episcopal dignity, and the episcopal dignity culminates in the papacy.
   The cathedra Petri is the fountain of all power. Without the consent of
   the pope no bishop can be deposed, no council be convened. He is the
   ultimate umpire of all controversy, and from him there is no appeal. He
   is often called "episcopus universalis" notwithstanding the protest of
   Gregory I.

   3. The aim of Pseudo-Isidor is, by such a collection of authoritative
   decisions to protect the clergy against the secular power and against
   moral degeneracy. The power of the metropolitans is rather lowered in
   order to secure to the pope the definitive sentence in the trials of
   bishops. But it is manifestly wrong if older writers have put the chief
   aim of the work in the elevation of the papacy. The papacy appears
   rather as a means for the protection of episcopacy in its conflict with
   the civil government. It is the supreme guarantee of the rights of the
   bishops.

   4. The genuineness of Pseudo-Isidor was not doubted during the middle
   ages (Hincmar only denied the legal application to the French church),
   but is now universally given up by Roman Catholic as well as Protestant
   historians.

   The forgery is apparent. It is inconceivable that Dionysius Exiguus,
   who lived in Rome, should have been ignorant of such a large number of
   papal letters. The collection moreover is full of anachronisms: Roman
   bishops of the second and third centuries write in the Frankish Latin
   of the ninth century on doctrinal topics in the spirit of the
   post-Nicene orthodoxy and on mediaeval relations in church and state;
   they quote the Bible after the; version of Jerome as amended under
   Charlemagne; Victor addresses Theophilus of Alexandria, who lived two
   hundred years later, on the paschal controversies of the second
   century. [266]

   The Donation of Constantine which is incorporated in this collection,
   is an older forgery, and exists also in several Greek texts. It affirms
   that Constantine, when he was baptized by pope Sylvester, a.d. 324 (he
   was not baptized till 337, by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia),
   presented him with the Lateran palace and all imperial insignia,
   together with the Roman and Italian territory. [267] The object of this
   forgery was to antedate by five centuries the temporal power of the
   papacy, which rests on the donations of Pepin and Charlemagne. [268]
   The only foundation in fact is the donation of the Lateran palace,
   which was originally the palace of the Lateran family, then of the
   emperors, and last of the popes. The wife of Constantine, Fausta,
   resided in it, and on the transfer of the seat of empire to
   Constantinople, he left it to Sylvester, as the chief of the Roman
   clergy and nobility. Hence it contains to this day the pontifical
   throne with the inscription: "Haec est papalis sedes et pontificalis."
   There the pope takes possession of the see of Rome. But the whole
   history of Constantine and his successors shows conclusively that they
   had no idea of transferring any part of their temporal sovereignty to
   the Roman pontiff.

   5. The authorship must be assigned to some ecclesiastic of the Frankish
   church, probably of the diocese of Rheims, between 847 and 865 (or
   857), but scholars differ as to the writer. [269] Pseudo-Isidor
   literally quotes passages from a Paris Council of 829, and agrees in
   part with the collection of Benedictus Levita, completed in 847; on the
   other hand he is first quoted by a French Synod at Chiersy in 857, and
   then by Hincmar of Rheims repeatedly since 859. All the manuscripts are
   of French origin. The complaints of ecclesiastical disorders,
   depositions of bishops without trial, frivolous divorces, frequent
   sacrilege, suit best the period of the civil wars among the grandsons
   of Charlemagne. In Rome the Decretals were first known and quoted in
   865 by pope Nicolaus I. [270]

   From the same period and of the same spirit are several collections of
   Capitula or Capitularia, i.e., of royal ecclesiastical ordinances which
   under the Carolingians took the place of synodical decisions. Among
   these we mention the collection of Ansegis, abbot of Fontenelles (827),
   of Benedictus Levita of Mayence (847), and the Capitula Angilramni,
   falsely ascribed to bishop Angilramnus of Metz (d. 701).

   6. Significance of Pseudo-Isidor. It consists not so much in the
   novelty of the views and claims of the mediaeval priesthood, but in
   tracing them back from the ninth to the third and second centuries and
   stamping them with the authority of antiquity. Some of the leading
   principles had indeed been already asserted in the letters of Leo I.
   and other documents of the fifth century, yea the papal animus may be
   traced to Victor in the second century and to the Judaizing opponents
   of St. Paul. But in this collection the entire hierarchical and
   sacerdotal system, which was the growth of several centuries, appears
   as something complete and unchangeable from the very beginning. We have
   a parallel phenomenon in the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons which
   gather into one whole the ecclesiastical decisions of the first three
   centuries, and trace them directly to the apostles or their disciple,
   Clement of Rome.

   Pseudo-Isidorus was no doubt a sincere believer in the hierarchical
   system; nevertheless his Collection is to a large extent a conscious
   high church fraud, and must as such be traced to the father of lies. It
   belongs to the Satanic element in the history of the Christian
   hierarchy, which has as little escaped temptation and contamination as
   the Jewish hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [264] The preface begins: "Isidorus Mercator servus Christi lectori
   conservo suo et parenti suo in Domino fideli (al. fidei) salutem.' The
   byname "Mercator," which is found in 30 of the oldest codices, is so
   far unexplained. Some refer it to Marius Mercator, a learned Occidental
   layman residing in Constantinople, who wrote against Pelagius and
   translated ecclesiastical records which pseudo-Isidorus made use of.
   Others regard it as a mistake for " Peccator" (a title of humility
   frequently used by priests and bishops, e.g. by St. Patrick in his "
   Confession"), which is found in 3 copies. " Mercatus" also occurs it,
   several copies, and this would be equivalent to redemptus, " Isidorus,
   the redeemed servant of Christ." See Hinschius and Richter, l.c.

   [265] The original name was decretale constitutum or decretalis
   epistola, afterwards decretalis. See Richter, l.c. p. 80.

   [266] The forgery was first suggested by Nicolaus de Cusa, in the
   fifteenth century, and Calvin (Inst. IV. 7, 11, 20), and then proved by
   the Magdeburg Centuries, and more conclusively by the Calvinistic
   divine David Blondel (1628) against the attempted vindication of the
   Jesuit Torres (Turrianus, 1572). The brothers Ballerini, Baronius,
   Bellarmin, Theiner, Walter, Möhler, Hefele, and other Roman Catholic
   scholars admit the forgery, but usually try to mitigate it and to
   underrate the originality and influence of Pseudo-Isidor. Some
   Protestant divines have erred in the opposite direction (as Richter
   justly observes, l.c. p. 117).

   [267] "Dominis meis beatissimis Petro et Paulo, et per eos etiam beato
   Sylvestro Patri nostro summo pontifici, et universalis urbis Romae
   papae, et omnibus ejus successoribus pontificibus . . concedimus
   palatium imperii nostri Lateranense ... deinde diadema, videlicet
   coronam capitis nostri simulque pallium, vel mitram .... . et omnia
   imperialia indumenta ... et imperialia sceptra . . et omnem
   possessionem imperialis culminis et gloriam potestatis nostrae ... Unde
   ut pontificalis apex non vilescat, sed magis amplius quam terreni
   imperii dignitas et gloriae potentia decoretur, ecce tam palatium
   nostrum, ut praedictum est, quamque Pomanae vobis et omnes Italiae seu
   occidentalium regionum provincias, loca et civitates beatissimo
   pontifici nostro, Sylvestro universali papae, concedimus atque
   relinquimus." In Migne, Tom. 130, p. 249 sq.

   [268] That Constantine made donations to Sylvester on occasion of his
   pretended baptism is related first in the Acta Sylvestri, then by
   Hadrian I. in a letter to Charlemagne (780). In the ninth century the
   spurious document appeared. The spuriousness was perceived as early as
   999 by the emperor Otho III. and proven by Laurentius Valla about 1440
   in De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione. The document is
   universally given up as a fiction, though Baronius defended the
   donation itself.

   [269] The following persons have been suggested as authors: Benedictus
   Levita (Deacon) of Mayence, whose Capitularium of about 847 agrees in
   several passages literally with the Decretals (Blondel, Knust, Walter);
   Rothad of Soissons (Phillips, Gfrörer); Otgar, archbishop of Mayence,
   who took a prominent part in the clerical rebellion against Louis the
   Pious (Ballerinii, Wasserschleben); Ebo, archbishop of Rheims, the
   predecessor of Hincmar and leader in that rebellion, or some unknown
   ecclesiastic in that diocese (Weizsäcker, von Noorden, Hinschius,
   Richter, Baxmann). The repetitions suggest a number of authors and a
   gradual growth.

   By a remarkable coincidence the publication of the Pseudo-Isidorian
   Decretals synchronized with the appearance of a pope who had the
   ability and opportunity to carry the principles of the Decretals into
   practical effect, and the good fortune to do it in the service of
   justice and virtue. So long as the usurpation of divine power was used
   against oppression and vice, it commanded veneration and obedience, and
   did more good than harm. It was only the pope who in those days could
   claim a superior authority in dealing with haughty and oppressive
   metropolitans, synods, kings and emperors.

   Nicolas I. is the greatest pope, we may say the only great pope between
   Gregory I. and Gregory VII. He stands between them as one of three
   peaks of a lofty mountain, separated from the lower peak by a plane,
   and from the higher peak by a deep valley. He appeared to his younger
   contemporaries as a "new Elijah," who ruled the world like a sovereign
   of divine appointment, terrible to the evil-doer whether prince or
   priest, yet mild to the good and obedient. He was elected less by the
   influence of the clergy than of the emperor Louis II., and consecrated
   in his presence; he lived with him on terms of friendship, and was
   treated in turn with great deference to his papal dignity. He
   anticipated Hildebrand in the lofty conception of his office; and his
   energy and boldness of character corresponded with it. The pope was in
   his view the divinely appointed superintendent of the whole church for
   the maintenance of order, discipline and righteousness, and the
   punishment of wrong and vice, with the aid of the bishops as his
   executive organs. He assumed an imperious tone towards the
   Carolingians. He regarded the imperial crown a grant of the vicar of
   St. Peter for the protection of Christians against infidels. The empire
   descended to Louis by hereditary right, but was confirmed by the
   authority of the apostolic see.

   The pontificate of Nicolas was marked by three important events: the
   controversy with Photius, the prohibition of the divorce of King
   Lothair, and the humiliation of archbishop Hincmar. In the first he
   failed, in the second and third he achieved a moral triumph.

   Nicolas and Photius.

   Ignatius, patriarch of Constantinople, of imperial descent and of
   austere ascetic virtue, was unjustly deposed and banished by the
   emperor Michael III. for rebuking the immorality of Caesar Bardas, but
   he refused to resign. Photius, the greatest scholar of his age, at home
   in almost every branch of knowledge and letters, was elected his
   successor, though merely a layman, and in six days passed through the
   inferior orders to the patriarchal dignity (858). The two parties
   engaged in an unrelenting warfare, and excommunicated each other.
   Photius was the first to appeal to the Roman pontiff. Nicolas, instead
   of acting as mediator, assumed the air of judge, and sent delegates to
   Constantinople to investigate the case on the spot. They were
   imprisoned and bribed to declare for Photius; but the pope annulled
   their action at a synod in Rome, and decided in favor of Ignatius
   (863). Photius in turn pronounced sentence of condemnation on the pope
   and, in his Encyclical Letter, gave classical expression to the
   objections of the Greek church against the Latin (867). The controversy
   resulted in the permanent alienation of the two churches. It was the
   last instance of an official interference of a pope in the affairs of
   the Eastern church.

   Nicolas and Lothair.

   Lothair II., king of Lorraine and the second son of the emperor
   Lothair, maltreated and at last divorced his wife, Teutberga of
   Burgundy, and married his mistress, Walrada, who appeared publicly in
   all the array and splendor of a queen. Nicolas, being appealed to by
   the injured lady, defended fearlessly the sacredness of matrimony; he
   annulled the decisions of synods, and deposed the archbishops of
   Cologne and Treves for conniving at the immorality of their sovereign.
   He threatened the king with immediate excommunication if he did not
   dismiss the concubine and receive the lawful wife. He even refused to
   yield when Teutberga, probably under compulsion, asked him to grant a
   divorce. Lothair, after many equivocations, yielded at last (865). It
   is unnecessary to enter into the complications and disgusting details
   of this controversy.

   Nicolas and Hincmar.

   In his controversy with Hincmar, Nicolas was a protector of the bishops
   and lower clergy against the tyranny of metropolitans. Hincmar,
   archbishop of Rheims, was the most powerful prelate of France, and a
   representative of the principle of Gallican independence. He was
   energetic, but ambitious and overbearing. He came three times in
   conflict with the pope on the question of jurisdiction. The principal
   case is that of Rothad, bishop of Soissons, one of his oldest
   suffragans, whom he deposed without sufficient reason and put into
   prison, with the aid of Charles the Bald (862). The pope sent his
   legate "from the side," Arsenius, to Charles, and demanded the
   restoration of the bishop. He argued from the canons of the Council of
   Sardica that the case must be decided by Rome even if Rothad had not
   appealed to him. He enlisted the sympathies of the bishops by reminding
   them that they might suffer similar injustice from their metropolitan,
   and that their only refuge was in the common protection of the Roman
   see. Charles desired to cancel the process, but Nicolas would not
   listen to it. He called Rothad to Rome, reinstated him solemnly in the
   church of St. Maria Maggiore, and sent him back in triumph to France
   (864) [271] Hincmar murmured, but yielded to superior power. [272]

   In this controversy Nicolas made use of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals,
   a copy of which came into his hands probably through Rotbad. He thus
   gave them the papal sanction; yet he must have known that a large
   portion of this forged collection, though claiming to proceed from
   early popes, did not exist in the papal archives. Hincmar protested
   against the validity of the new decretals and their application to
   France, and the protest lingered for centuries in the Gallican
   liberties till they were finally buried in the papal absolutism of the
   Vatican Council of 1870.

   For nearly two hundred years, from Nicolas to Hildebrand (867-1049),
   the papal chair was filled, with very few exceptions, by ordinary and
   even unworthy occupants.

   Hadrian II. (867-872) and John VIII. (872-882) defended the papal power
   with the same zeal as Nicolas, but with less ability, dignity, and
   success, and not so much in the interests of morality as for
   self-aggrandizement. They interfered with the political quarrels of the
   Carolingians, and claimed the right of disposing royal and imperial
   crowns.

   Hadrian was already seventy-five years of age, and well known for great
   benevolence, when he ascended the throne (he was born in 792). He
   inherited from Nicolas the controversies with Photius, Lothair, and
   Hincmar of Rheims, but was repeatedly rebuffed. He suffered also a
   personal humiliation on account of a curious domestic tragedy. He had
   been previously married, and his wife (Stephania) was still living at
   the time of his elevation. Eleutherius, a son of bishop Arsenius (the
   legate of Nicolas), carried away the pope's daughter (an old maid of
   forty years, who was engaged to another man), fled to the emperor
   Louis, and, when threatened with punishment, murdered both the pope's
   wife and daughter. He was condemned to death.

   This affair might have warned the popes to have nothing to do with
   women; but it was succeeded by worse scenes.

   John VIII. was an energetic, shrewd, passionate, and intriguing
   prelate, meddled with all the affairs of Christendom from Bulgaria to
   France and Spain, crowned two insignificant Carolingian emperors
   (Charles the Bald, 875, and Charles the Fat, 881), dealt very freely in
   anathemas, was much disturbed by the invasion of the Saracens, and is
   said to have been killed by a relative who coveted the papal crown and
   treasure. The best thing he did was the declaration, in the Bulgarian
   quarrel with the patriarch of Constantinople, that the Holy Spirit had
   created other languages for worship besides Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
   although he qualified it afterwards by saying that Greek and Latin were
   the only proper organs for the celebration of the mass, while barbarian
   tongues such as the Slavonic, may be good enough for preaching.

   His violent end was the beginning of a long interregnum of violence.
   The close of the ninth century gave a foretaste of the greater troubles
   of the tenth. After the downfall of the Carolingian dynasty the popes
   were more and more involved in the political quarrels and distractions
   of the Italian princes. The dukes Berengar of Friuli (888-924), and
   Guido of Spoleto (889-894), two remote descendants of Charlemagne
   through a female branch, contended for the kingdom of Italy and the
   imperial crown, and filled alternately the papal chair according to
   their success in the conflict. The Italians liked to have two masters,
   that they might play off one against the other. Guido was crowned
   emperor by Stephen VI. (V.) in February, 891, and was followed by his
   son, Lambert, in 894, who was also crowned. Formosus, bishop of Portus,
   whom John VIII. had pursued with bitter animosity, was after varying
   fortunes raised to the papal chair, and gave the imperial crown first
   to Lambert, but afterwards to the victorious Arnulf of Carinthia, in
   896. He roused the revenge of Lambert, and died of violence. His second
   successor and bitter enemy, Stephen VII. (VI.), a creature of the party
   of Lambert, caused his corpse to be exhumed, clad in pontifical robes,
   arraigned in a mock trial, condemned and deposed, stripped of the
   ornaments, fearfully mutilated, decapitated, and thrown into the Tiber.
   But the party of Berengar again obtained the ascendency; Stephen VII.
   was thrown into prison and strangled (897). This was regarded as a just
   punishment for his conduct towards Formosus. John IX. restored the
   character of Formosus. He died in 900, and was followed by Benedict
   IV., of the Lambertine or Spoletan party, and reigned for the now
   unusual term of three years and a half. [273]

   [273] According to Auxentius and Vulgarius, pope Stephen VII. was the
   author of the outrage on the corpse of Formosus; Liutprand traces it to
   Sergius III. in 898, when he was anti-pope of John IX. Baronius
   conjectures that Liutprand wrote Sergius for Stephanus. Hefele assents,

   The tenth century is the darkest of the dark ages, a century of
   ignorance and superstition, anarchy and crime in church and state. The
   first half of the eleventh century was little better. The dissolution
   of the world seemed to be nigh at hand. Serious men looked forward to
   the terrible day of judgment at the close of the first millennium of
   the Christian era, neglected their secular business, and inscribed
   donations of estates and other gifts to the church with the significant
   phrase "appropinquante mundi termino."

   The demoralization began in the state, reached the church, and
   culminated in the papacy. The reorganization of society took the same
   course. No church or sect in Christendom ever sank so low as the Latin
   church in the tenth century. The papacy, like the old Roman god Janus,
   has two faces, one Christian, one antichristian, one friendly and
   benevolent, one fiendish and malignant. In this period, it shows almost
   exclusively the antichristian face. It is an unpleasant task for the
   historian to expose these shocking corruptions; but it is necessary for
   the understanding of the reformation that followed. The truth must be
   told, with its wholesome lessons of humiliation and encouragement. No
   system of doctrine or government can save the church from decline and
   decay. Human nature is capable of satanic wickedness. Antichrist steals
   into the very temple of God, and often wears the priestly robes. But
   God is never absent from history, and His overruling wisdom always at
   last brings good out of evil. Even in this midnight darkness the stars
   were shining in the firmament; and even then, as in the days of Elijah
   the prophet, there were thousands who had not bowed their knees to
   Baal. Some convents resisted the tide of corruption, and were quiet
   retreats for nobles and kings disgusted with the vanities of the world,
   and anxious to prepare themselves for the day of account. Nilus,
   Romuald, and the monks of Cluny raised their mighty voice against
   wickedness in high places. Synods likewise deplored the immorality of
   the clergy and laity, and made efforts to restore discipline. The
   chaotic confusion of the tenth century, like the migration of nations
   in the fifth, proved to be only the throe and anguish of a new birth.
   It was followed first by the restoration of the empire under Otho the
   Great, and then by the reform of the papacy under Hildebrand.

   The Political Disorder.

   In the semi-barbarous state of society during the middle ages, a strong
   central power was needed in church and state to keep order. Charlemagne
   was in advance of his times, and his structure rested on no solid
   foundation. His successors had neither his talents nor his energy, and
   sank almost as low as the Merovingians in incapacity and debauchery.
   The popular contempt in which they were held was expressed in such
   epithets as "the Bald," "the Fat," "the Stammerer," "the Simple," "the
   Lazy," "the Child." Under their misrule the foundations of law and
   discipline gave way. Europe was threatened with a new flood of heathen
   barbarism. The Norman pirates from Denmark and Norway infested the
   coasts of Germany and France, burned cities and villages, carried off
   captives, followed in their light boats which they could carry on their
   shoulders, the course of the great rivers into the interior; they
   sacked Hamburg, Cologne, Treves, Rouen, and stabled their horses in
   Charlemagne's cathedral at Aix; they invaded England, and were the
   terror of all Europe until they accepted Christianity, settled down in
   Normandy, and infused fresh blood into the French and English people.
   In the South, the Saracens, crossing from Africa, took possession of
   Sicily and Southern Italy; they are described by pope John VIII. as
   Hagarenes, as children of fornication and wrath, as an army of locusts,
   turning the land into a wilderness. From the East, the pagan Hungarians
   or Magyars invaded Germany and Italy like hordes of wild beasts, but
   they were defeated at last by Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, and
   after their conversion to Christianity under their saintly monarch
   Stephen (997-1068), they became a wall of defence against the progress
   of the Turks.

   Within the limits of nominal Christendom, the kings and nobles
   quarreled among themselves, oppressed the people, and distributed
   bishoprics and abbeys among their favorites, or pocketed the income.
   The metropolitans oppressed the bishops, the bishops the priests, and
   the priests the laity. Bands of robbers roamed over the country and
   defied punishment. Might was right. Charles the Fat was deposed by his
   vassals, and died in misery, begging his bread (888). His successor,
   Arnulf of Carinthia, the last of the Carolingian line of emperors
   (though of illegitimate birth), wielded a victorious sword over the
   Normans (891) and the new kingdom of Moravia (894), but fell into
   trouble, died of Italian poison, and left the crown of Germany to his
   only legitimate son, Louis the Child (899-911), who was ruled by Hatto,
   archbishop of Mayence. This prelate figures in the popular legend of
   the "Mouse-Tower" (on an island in the Rhine, opposite Bingen), where a
   swarm of mice picked his bones and "gnawed the flesh from every limb,"
   because he had shut up and starved to death a number of hungry beggars.
   But documentary history shows him in a more favorable light. Louis died
   before attaining to manhood, and with him the German line of the
   Carolingians (911). The last shadow of an emperor in Italy, Berengar,
   who had been crowned in St. Peter's, died by the dagger of an assassin
   (924). The empire remained vacant for nearly forty years, until Otho, a
   descendant of the Saxon duke Widukind, whom Charlemagne had conquered,
   raised it to a new life.

   In France, the Carolingian dynasty lingered nearly a century longer,
   till it found an inglorious end in a fifth Louis called the Lazy ("le
   Fainéant"), and Count Hugh Capet became the founder of the Capetian
   dynasty, based on the principle of hereditary succession (987). He and
   his son Robert received the crown of France not from the pope, but from
   the archbishop of Rheims.

   Italy was invaded by Hungarians and Saracens, and distracted by war
   between rival kings and petty princes struggling for aggrandizement.
   The bishops and nobles were alike corrupt, and the whole country was a
   moral wilderness. [274]

   The Demoralization of the Papacy.

   The political disorder of Europe affected the church and paralyzed its
   efforts for good. The papacy itself lost all independence and dignity,
   and became the prey of avarice, violence, and intrigue, a veritable
   synagogue of Satan. It was dragged through the quagmire of the darkest
   crimes, and would have perished in utter disgrace had not Providence
   saved it for better times. Pope followed pope in rapid succession, and
   most of them ended their career in deposition, prison, and murder. The
   rich and powerful marquises of Tuscany and the Counts of Tusculum
   acquired control over the city of Rome and the papacy for more than
   half a century. And what is worse (incredibile, attamen verum), three
   bold and energetic women of the highest rank and lowest character,
   Theodora the elder (the wife or widow of a Roman senator), and her two
   daughters, Marozia and Theodora, filled the chair of St. Peter with
   their paramours and bastards. These Roman Amazons combined with the
   fatal charms of personal beauty and wealth, a rare capacity for
   intrigue, and a burning lust for power and pleasure. They had the
   diabolical ambition to surpass their sex as much in boldness and
   badness as St. Paula and St. Eustachium in the days of Jerome had
   excelled in virtue and saintliness. They turned the church of St. Peter
   into a den of robbers, and the residence of his successors into a
   harem. And they gloried in their shame. Hence this infamous period is
   called the papal Pornocracy or Hetaerocracy. [275]

   Some popes of this period were almost as bad as the worst emperors of
   heathen Rome, and far less excusable.

   Sergius III., the lover of Marozia (904-911), opened the shameful
   succession. Under the protection of a force of Tuscan soldiers he
   appeared in Rome, deposed Christopher who had just deposed Leo V., took
   possession of the papal throne, and soiled it with every vice; but he
   deserves credit for restoring the venerable church of the Lateran,
   which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 896 and robbed of
   invaluable treasures. [276]

   After the short reign of two other popes, John X., archbishop of
   Ravenna, was elected, contrary to all canons, in obedience to the will
   of Theodora, for the more convenient gratification of her passion
   (914-928). [277] He was a man of military ability and daring, placed
   himself at the head of an army--the first warrior among the popes--and
   defeated the Saracens. He then announced the victory in the tone of a
   general. He then engaged in a fierce contest for power with Marozia and
   her lover or husband, the Marquis Alberic I. Unwilling to yield any of
   her secular power over Rome, Marozia seized the Castle of St. Angelo,
   had John cast into prison and smothered to death, and raised three of
   her creatures, Leo VI., Stephen VII. (VIII.), and at last John XI, her
   own (bastard) son of only twenty-one years, successively to the papal
   chair (928-936). [278]

   After the murder of Alberic I. (about 926), Marozia, who called herself
   Senatrix and Patricia, offered her hand and as much of her love as she
   could spare from her numerous paramours, to Guido, Markgrave of
   Tuscany, who eagerly accepted the prize; and after his death she
   married king Hugo of Italy, the step-brother of her late husband (932);
   he hoped to gain the imperial crown, but he was soon expelled from Rome
   by a rebellion excited by her own son Alberic II., who took offence at
   his overbearing conduct for slapping him in the face. [279] She now
   disappears from the stage, and probably died in a convent. Her son, the
   second Alberic, was raised by the Romans to the dignity of Consul, and
   ruled Rome and the papacy from the Castle of St. Angelo for twenty-two
   years with great ability as a despot under the forms of a republic
   (932-954). After the death of his brother, John XI. (936), he appointed
   four insignificant pontiffs, and restricted them to the performance of
   their religious duties.

   John XII.

   On the death of Alberic in 954, his son Octavian, the grandson of
   Marozia, inherited the secular government of Rome, and was elected pope
   when only eighteen years of age. He thus united a double supremacy. He
   retained his name Octavian as civil ruler, but assumed, as pope, the
   name John XII., either by compulsion of the clergy and people, or
   because he wished to secure more license by keeping the two dignities
   distinct. This is the first example of such a change of name, and it
   was followed by his successors. He completely sunk his spiritual in his
   secular character, appeared in military dress, and neglected the duties
   of the papal office, though he surrendered none of its claims.

   John XII. disgraced the tiara for eight years (955-963). He was one of
   the most immoral and wicked popes, ranking with Benedict IX., John
   XXIII., and Alexander VI. He was charged by a Roman Synod, no one
   contradicting, with almost every crime of which depraved human nature
   is capable, and deposed as a monster of iniquity. [280]

   [274] Höfler (I. 16) asserts that every princely family of Italy in the
   tenth century was tainted with incestuous blood, and that it was
   difficult to distinguish wives and sisters mothers and daughters. See
   his genealogical tables appended to the first volume.

   [275] Liutprandi Antapodosis, II. 48 (Pertz, V. 297; Migne, CXXXVI.

   obtinuit dignitatem, nefario genuit adulterio, "etc. In the same ch. he
   calls the elder Theodora "meretrix satis impudentissima, Veneris calore
   succensa." This Theodora was the wife of Theophylactus, Roman Consul
   and Senator, probably of Byzantine origin, who appears in 901 among the
   Roman judges of Louis III. She called herself " Senatrix." She was the
   mistress of Adalbert of Tuscany, called the Rich (d. 926), and of pope
   John X. (d. 928). And yet she is addressed by Eugenius Vulgarius as
   "sanctissima et venerabilis matrona!" (See Dümmler, l.c. p. 146, and
   Hefele, IV. 575.) Her daughter Marozia (or Maruccia, the diminutive of
   Maria, Mariechen) was the boldest and most successful of the three. She
   was the mistress of pope Sergius III. and of Alberic I., Count of
   Tusculum (d. 926), and married several times. Comp. Liutprand, III. 43
   and 44. She perpetuated her rule through her son, Alberic II., and her
   grandson, pope John XII. With all their talents and influence, these
   strong-minded women were very, ignorant; the daughters of the younger
   Theodora could neither read nor write, and signed their name in 945
   with a +. (Gregorovius, III. 282 sq.) The Tusculan popes and the
   Crescentii, who controlled and disgraced the papacy in the eleventh
   century, were descendants of the same stock. The main facts of this
   shameful reign rest on good contemporary Catholic authorities (as
   Liutprand, Flodoard, Ratherius of Verona, Benedict of Soracte, Gerbert,
   the transactions of the Councils in Rome, Rheims, etc.), and are
   frankly admitted with devout indignation by Baronius and other Roman
   Catholic historians, but turned by them into an argument for the divine
   origin of the papacy, whose restoration to power appears all the more
   wonderful from the depth of its degradation. Möhler (Kirchgesch. ed. by
   Gama, II. 183) calls Sergius III., John X., John XI., and John XII."
   horrible popes," and says that " crimes alone secured the papal
   dignity!" Others acquit the papacy of guilt, since it was not
   independent. The best lesson which Romanists might derive from this
   period of prostitution is humility and charity. It is a terrible rebuke
   to pretensions of superior sanctity.

   [276] Baronius, following Liutprand, calls Sergius "homo vitiorum
   omnium servus." But Flodoard and the inscriptions give him a somewhat
   better character. See Hefele IV. 576, Gregorovius III. 269, and von
   Reumont II. 273.

   [277] Gfrörer makes him the paramour of the younger Theodora, which on
   chronological grounds is more probable; but Hefele, Gregorovius, von
   Peumont, and Greenwood link him with the elder Theodora. This seems to
   be the meaning of Liutprand (II. 47 and 48), who says that she fell in
   love with John for his great beauty, and actually forced him to sin
   (secumque hunc scortari non solum voluit, verum etiam atque etiam
   compulit). She could not stand the separation from her lover, and
   called him to Rome. Baronius treats John X. as a pseudopapa. Muratori,
   Duret, and Hefele dissent from Liutprand and give John a somewhat
   better character, without, however, denying his relation to Theodora.
   See Hefele, IV. 579 sq.

   [278] Liutprand, Antapodosis, III. 43 (Migne, l.c., 852): "Papam [John
   X.]custodia maniciparunt, in qua non multo post ea defunctus; aiunt
   enim quod cervical super os eius imponerent, sicque cum pessime su
   ffocarent. Quo mortuo ipsius Marotiae filium Johannem nomine [John XI.]
   quem ex Sergio papa meretrix genuerat, papam constituunt." The
   parentage of John XI. from pope Sergius is adopted by Gregorovius,
   Dümmler, Greenwood, and Baxmann, but disputed by Muratori, Hefele, and
   Gfrörer, who maintain that John XI. was the son of Marozia's husband,
   Alberic I., if they ever were married. For, according to Benedict of
   Soracte, Marozia accepted him "non quasi uxor, sed in consuetudinem
   malignam." Albericus Marchio was an adventurer before he became
   Markgrave, about 897, and must not be confounded with Albertus Marchio
   or Adalbert the Rich of Tuscany. See Gregorovius, III. 275; von
   Reumont, II. 228, 231, and the genealogical tables in Höfler, Vol. I.,
   Append. V. and VI.

   [280] Among the charges of the Synod against him were that he appeared
   constantly armed with sword, lance, helmet, and breastplate, that he
   neglected matins and vespers, that he never signed himself with the
   sign of the cross, that he was fond of hunting, that he had made a boy
   of ten years a bishop, and ordained a bishop or deacon in a stable,
   that he had mutilated a priest, that he had set houses on fire, like
   Nero, that he had committed homicide and adultery, had violated virgins
   and widows high and low, lived with his father's mistress, converted
   the pontifical palace into a brothel, drank to the health of the devil,
   and invoked at the gambling-table the help of Jupiter and Venus and
   other heathen demons! The emperor Otho would not believe these
   enormities until they, were proven, but the bishops replied, that they
   were matters of public notoriety requiring no proof. Before the Synod
   convened John XII. had made his escape from Rome, carrying with him the
   portable part of the treasury of St. Peter. But after the departure of
   the emperor he was readmitted to the city, restored for a short time,
   and killed in an act of adultery ("dum se cum viri cujusdam uxore
   oblectaret") by the enraged husband of his paramour. or by, the devil
   ("a diabolo est percussus"). Liutprand, De rebus gestis Ottonis (in
   Migne, Tom. XXXVI. 898-910). Hefele (IV. 619) thinks that he died of
   apoplexy.

   § 64. The Interference of Otho the Great.

   Comp., besides the works quoted in § 63, Floss: Die Papstwahl unter den
   Ottonen. Freiburg, 1858, and Köpke and Dummler: Otto der Grosse.
   Leipzig, 1876.

   From this state of infamy the papacy was rescued for a brief time by
   the interference of Otho I., justly called the Great (936973). He had
   subdued the Danes, the Slavonians, and the Hungarians, converted the
   barbarians on the frontier, established order and restored the
   Carolingian empire. He was called by the pope himself and several
   Italian princes for protection against the oppression of king Berengar
   II. (or the Younger, who was crowned in 950, and died in exile, 966).
   He crossed the Alps, and was anointed Roman emperor by John XII. in
   962. He promised to return to the holy see all the lost territories
   granted by Pepin and Charlemagne, and received in turn from the pope
   and the Romans the oath of allegiance on the sepulchre of St. Peter.

   Hereafter the imperial crown of Rome was always held by the German
   nation, but the legal assumption of the titles of Emperor and Augustus
   depended on the act of coronation by the pope.

   After the departure of Otho the perfidious pope, unwilling to obey a
   superior master, rebelled and entered into conspiracy with his enemies.
   The emperor returned to Rome, convened a Synod of Italian and German
   bishops, which indignantly deposed John XII. in his absence, on the
   ground of most notorious crimes, yet without a regular trial (963).
   [281]

   The emperor and the Synod elected a respectable layman, the chief
   secretary of the Roman see, in his place. He was hurriedly promoted
   through the orders of reader, subdeacon, deacon, priest and bishop, and
   consecrated as Leo VIII., but not recognized by the strictly
   hierarchical party, because he surrendered the freedom of the papacy to
   the empire. The Romans swore that they would never elect a pope again
   without the emperor's consent. Leo confirmed this in a formal document.
   [282]

   The anti-imperial party readmitted John XII., who took cruel revenge of
   his enemies, but was suddenly struck down in his sins by a violent
   death. Then they elected an anti-pope, Benedict V., but he himself
   begged pardon for his usurpation when the emperor reappeared, was
   divested of the papal robes, degraded to the order of deacon, and
   banished to Germany. Leo VIII. died in April, 965, after a short
   pontificate of sixteen months.

   The bishop of Narni was unanimously elected his successor as John XIII.
   (965-972) by the Roman clergy and people, after first consulting the
   will of the emperor. He crowned Otho II. emperor of the Romans
   (973-983). He was expelled by the Romans, but reinstated by Otho, who
   punished the rebellious city with terrible severity.

   Thus the papacy was morally saved, but at the expense of its
   independence or rather it had exchanged its domestic bondage for a
   foreign bondage. Otho restored to it its former dominions which it had
   lost during the Italian disturbances, but he regarded the pope and the
   Romans as his subjects, who owed him the same temporal allegiance as
   the Germans and Lombards.

   It would have been far better for Germany and Italy if they had never
   meddled with each other. The Italians, especially the Romans, feared
   the German army, but hated the Germans as Northern semi-barbarians, and
   shook off their yoke as soon as they had a chance. [283] The Germans
   suspected the Italians for dishonesty and trickery, were always in
   danger of fever and poison, and lost armies and millions of treasure
   without any return of profit or even military glory. [284] The two
   nations were always jealous of each other, and have only recently
   become friends, on the basis of mutual independence and
   non-interference.

   Protest Against Papal Corruption.

   The shocking immoralities of the popes called forth strong protests,
   though they did not shake the faith in the institution itself. A
   Gallican Synod deposed archbishop Arnulf of Rheims as a traitor to king
   Hugo Capet, without waiting for an answer from the pope, and without
   caring for the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals (991). The leading spirit of
   the Synod, Arnulf, bishop of Orleans, made the following bold
   declaration against the prostitution of the papal office: "Looking at
   the actual state of the papacy, what do we behold? John [XII.] called
   Octavian, wallowing in the sty of filthy concupiscence, conspiring
   against the sovereign whom he had himself recently crowned; then Leo
   [VIII.] the neophyte, chased from the city by this Octavian; and that
   monster himself, after the commission of many murders and cruelties,
   dying by the hand of an assassin. Next we see the deacon Benedict,
   though freely elected by the Romans, carried away captive into the
   wilds of Germany by the new Caesar [Otho I.] and his pope Leo. Then a
   second Caesar [Otho II.], greater in arts and arms than the first [?],
   succeeds; and in his absence Boniface, a very monster of iniquity,
   reeking with the blood of his predecessor, mounts the throne of Peter.
   True, he is expelled and condemned; but only to return again, and
   redden his hands with the blood of the holy bishop John [XIV.]. Are
   there, indeed, any bold enough to maintain that the priests of the Lord
   over all the world are to take their law from monsters of guilt like
   these-men branded with ignominy, illiterate men, and ignorant alike of
   things human and divine? If, holy fathers, we be bound to weigh in the
   balance the lives, the morals, and the attainments of the meanest
   candidate for the sacerdotal office, how much more ought we to look to
   the fitness of him who aspires to be the lord and master of all
   priests! Yet how would it fare with us, if it should happen that the
   man the most deficient in all these virtues, one so abject as not to be
   worthy of the lowest place among the priesthood, should be chosen to
   fill the highest place of all? What would you say of such a one, when
   you behold him sitting upon the throne glittering in purple and gold?
   Must he not be the 'Antichrist, sitting in the temple of God, and
   showing himself as God?' Verily such a one lacketh both wisdom and
   charity; he standeth in the temple as an image, as an idol, from which
   as from dead marble you would seek counsel. [285]

   "But the Church of God is not subject to a wicked pope; nor even
   absolutely, and on all occasions, to a good one. Let us rather in our
   difficulties resort to our brethren of Belgium and Germany than to that
   city, where all things are venal, where judgment and justice are
   bartered for gold. Let us imitate the great church of Africa, which, in
   reply to the pretensions of the Roman pontiff, deemed it inconceivable
   that the Lord should have invested any one person with his own plenary
   prerogative of judicature, and yet have denied it to the great
   congregations of his priests assembled in council in different parts of
   the world. If it be true, as we are informed by, common report, that
   there is in Rome scarcely a man acquainted with letters,--without
   which, as it is written, one may scarcely be a doorkeeper in the house
   of God,--with what face may he who hath himself learnt nothing set
   himself up for a teacher of others? In the simple priest ignorance is
   bad enough; but in the high priest of Rome,--in him to whom it is given
   to pass in review the faith, the lives, the morals, the discipline, of
   the whole body of the priesthood, yea, of the universal church,
   ignorance is in nowise to be tolerated .... Why should he not be
   subject in judgment to those who, though lowest in place, are his
   superiors in virtue and in wisdom? Yea, not even he, the prince of the
   apostles, declined the rebuke of Paul, though his inferior in place,
   and, saith the great pope Gregory [I.], 'if a bishop be in fault, I
   know not any one such who is not subject to the holy see; but if
   faultless, let every one understand that he is the equal of the Roman
   pontiff himself, and as well qualified as he to give judgment in any
   matter.' " [286]

   The secretary of this council and the probable framer of this
   remarkable speech was Gerbert, who became archbishop of Rheims,
   afterwards of Ravenna, and at last pope under the name of Sylvester II.
   But pope John XV. (or his master Crescentius) declared the proceedings
   of this council null and void, and interdicted Gerbert. His successor,
   Gregory V., threatened the kingdom of France with a general interdict
   unless Arnulf was restored. Gerbert, forsaken by king Robert I., who
   needed the favor of the pope, was glad to escape from his uncomfortable
   seat and to accept an invitation of Otho III. to become his teacher
   (995). Arnulf was reinstated in Rheims.

   Ottonis, and in Baronius, Annal. ad ann 963. Comp. also Greenwood, Bk
   VIII. ch. 12, Gfrörer, vol. III., p. iii., 1249 sqq., Giesebrecht, I.
   465 and 828, and Hefele, IV. 612 sqq. Gfrörer, without defending John
   XII., charges Otho with having first violated the engagement (p. 1253).
   The pope was three times summoned before the Synod, but the answer came
   from Tivoli that he had gone hunting. Baronius, Floss, and Hefele
   regard this synod as uncanonical.

   [282] Baronius, ad ann. 964, pronounced the document spurious, chiefly
   because it is very inconvenient to his ultramontane doctrine. It is
   printed in Mon. Germ. iv.2 (Leges, II. 167), and in a more extensive
   form from a MS. at Treves in Leonis VIII. privilegium de investituris,
   by H. J. Floss, Freib., 1858. This publication has changed the state of
   the controversy in favor of a genuine element in the document. See the
   discussion in Hefele, IV. 622 sqq.

   [283] This antipathy found its last expression and termination in the
   expulsion of the Austrians from Lombardy and Venice, and the formation
   of a united kingdom of Italy.

   [284] Ditmar of Merseburg, the historian of Henry II., expresses the
   sentiment of that time when he says (Chron. IV. 22): "Neither the
   climate nor the people suit our countrymen. Both in Rome and Lombardy
   treason is always at work. Strangers who visit Italy expect no
   hospitality: everything they require must be instantly paid for; and
   even then they must submit to be over-reached and cheated, and not
   unfrequently to be poisoned after all."

   [285] "Quid hunc, rev. Patres, in sublimi solio residentem veste
   purpurea et aurea radiantem, quid hunc, inqam, esse censetis? Nimirum
   si caritate destituitur, solaque inflatur et extollitur, Antichristus
   est, in templo Dei sedens, et se ostendens tamquam sit D Eus. Si autem
   nec caritate fundatur, nec scientia erigitur, in templo Dei tamquam
   statua, tanquam idolum est, a quo responsa petere, marmora consulere
   est."

   [286] The acts of this Synod were first published in the Magdeburg
   Centuries, then by Mansi, Conc. XIX. 107, and Pertz, Mon. V. 658.
   Baronius pronounced them spurious, and interspersed them with indignant
   notes; but Mansi (p. 107) says: "Censent vulgo omnes, Gerbertum reipsa
   et sincere recitasse acta concilii vere habiti." See Gieseler,
   Greenwood (Book VIII. ch. 6), and Hefele (IV. 637 sqq.). Hefele
   pronounces the speech schismatical.

   III., 1358-1590, and vol. IV., 1846); Gregorovius (vols. III. and IV.);

   569-762, and II. 1-431).

   The reform of the papacy was merely temporary. It was followed by a
   second period of disgrace, which lasted till the middle of the eleventh
   century, but was interrupted by a few respectable popes and signs of a
   coming reformation.

   After the death of Otho, during the short and unfortunate reign of his
   son, Otho II. (973-983), a faction of the Roman nobility under the lead
   of Crescentius or Cencius (probably a son of pope John X. and Theodora)
   gained the upper hand. [287] He rebelled against the imperial pope,
   Benedict VI., who was murdered (974), and elected an Italian anti-pope,
   Boniface VII., who had soon to flee to Constantinople, but returned
   after some years, murdered another imperial pope, John XIV. (983), and
   maintained himself on the blood-stained throne by a lavish distribution
   of stolen money till he died, probably by violence (985). [288]

   During the minority of Otho III., the imperialists, headed by Alberic,
   Count of Tusculum, and the popular Roman party under the lead of the
   younger Crescentius (perhaps a grandson of the infamous Theodora),
   contended from their fortified places for the mastery of Rome and the
   papacy. Bloodshed was a daily amusement. Issuing from their forts, the
   two parties gave battle to each other whenever they met on the street.
   They set up rival popes, and mutilated their corpses with insane fury.
   The contending parties were related. Marozia's son, Alberic, had
   probably inherited Tusculum (which is about fifteen miles from Rome).
   [289] After the death of Alberic of Tusculum, Crescentius acquired the
   government under the title of Consul, and indulged the Romans with a
   short dream of republican freedom in opposition to the hated rule of
   the foreign barbarians. He controlled pope John XV.

   Gregory V.

   Otho III., on his way to Rome, elected his worthy chaplain and cousin
   Bruno, who was consecrated as Gregory V. (996) and then anointed Otho
   III. emperor. He is the first pope of German blood. [290] Crescentius
   was treated with great leniency, but after the departure of the German
   army he stirred up a rebellion, expelled the German pope and elevated
   Philagathus, a Calabrian Greek, under the name of John XVI. to the
   chair of St. Peter. Gregory V. convened a large synod at Pavia, which
   unanimously pronounced the anathema against Crescentius and his pope.
   The emperor hastened to Rome with an army, stormed the castle of St.
   Angelo (the mole of Hadrian), and beheaded Crescentius as a traitor,
   while John XVI. by order of Gregory V. was, according to the savage
   practice of that age, fearfully mutilated, and paraded through the
   streets on an ass, with his face turned to the tail and with a
   wine-bladder on his head.

   Sylvester II.

   After the sudden and probably violent death of Gregory V. (999), the
   emperor elected, with the assent of the clergy and the people, his
   friend and preceptor, Gerbert, archbishop of Rheims, and then of
   Ravenna, to the papal throne. Gerbert was the first French pope, a man
   of rare learning and ability, and moral integrity. He abandoned the
   liberal views he had expressed at the Council at Rheims, [291] and the
   legend says that he sold his soul to the devil for the papal tiara. He
   assumed the significant name of Sylvester II., intending to aid the
   youthful emperor (whose mother was a Greek princess) in the realization
   of his utopian dream to establish a Graeco-Latin empire with old Rome
   for its capital, and to rule from it the Christian world, as
   Constantine the Great had done during the pontificate of Sylvester I.
   But Otho died in his twenty-second year, of Italian fever or of poison
   (1002). [292]

   Sylvester II. followed his imperial pupil a year after (1003). His
   learning, acquired in part from the Arabs in Spain, appeared a marvel
   to his ignorant age, and suggested a connection with magic. He sent to
   St. Stephen of Hungary the royal crown, and, in a pastoral letter to
   Europe where Jerusalem is represented as crying for help, he gave the
   first impulse to the crusades (1000), ninety years before they actually
   began. [293]

   In the expectation of the approaching judgment, crowds of pilgrims
   flocked to Palestine to greet the advent of the Saviour. But the first
   millennium passed, and Christendom awoke with a sigh of relief on the
   first day of the year 1001.

   Benedict VIII., and Emperor Henry II.

   Upon the whole the Saxon emperors were of great service to the papacy:
   they emancipated it from the tyranny of domestic political factions,
   they restored it to wealth, and substituted worthy occupants for
   monstrous criminals.

   During the next reign the confusion broke out once more. The
   anti-imperial party regained the ascendency, and John Crescentius, the
   son of the beheaded consul, ruled under the title of Senator and
   Patricius. But the Counts of Tusculum held the balance of power pretty
   evenly, and gradually superseded the house of Crescentius. They elected
   Benedict VIII. (1012-1024), a member of their family; while Crescentius
   and his friends appointed an anti-pope (Gregory).

   Benedict proved a very energetic pope in the defence of Italy against
   the Saracens. He forms the connecting link between the Ottonian and the
   Hildebrandian popes. He crowned Henry II, (1014), as the faithful
   patron and protector simply, not as the liege-lord, of the pope.

   This last emperor of the Saxon house was very devout, ascetic, and
   liberal in endowing bishoprics. He favored clerical celibacy. He aimed
   earnestly at a moral reformation of the church. He declared at a diet,
   that he had made Christ his heir, and would devote all he possessed to
   God and his church. He filled the vacant bishoprics and abbeys with
   learned and worthy men; and hence his right of appointment was not
   resisted. He died after a reign of twenty-two years, and was buried at
   his favorite place, Bamberg in Bavaria, where he had founded a
   bishopric (1007). He and his chaste wife, Kunigunde, were canonized by
   the grateful church (1146). [294]

   The Tusculan Popes. Benedict IX.

   With Benedict VIII. the papal dignity became hereditary in the Tusculan
   family. He had bought it by open bribery. He was followed by his
   brother John XIX., a layman, who bought it likewise, and passed in one
   day through all the clerical degrees.

   After his death in 1033, his nephew Theophylact, a boy of only ten or
   twelve years of age, [295] ascended the papal throne under the name of
   Benedict IX. (1033-1045). His election was a mere money bargain between
   the Tusculan family and the venal clergy and populace of Rome. Once
   more the Lord took from Jerusalem and Judah the stay and the staff, and
   gave children to be their princes, and babes to rule over them. [296]

   This boy-pope fully equaled and even surpassed John XII. in precocious
   wickedness. He combined the childishness of Caligala and the
   viciousness of Heliogabalus. [297] He grew worse as he advanced in
   years. He ruled like a captain of banditti, committed murders and
   adulteries in open day-light, robbed pilgrims on the graves of martyrs,
   and turned Rome into a den of thieves. These crimes went unpunished;
   for who could judge a pope? And his brother, Gregory, was Patrician of
   the city. At one time, it is reported, he had the crazy notion of
   marrying his cousin and enthroning a woman in the chair of St. Peter;
   but the father of the intended bride refused unless he abdicated the
   papacy. [298] Desiderius, who himself afterwards became pope (Victor
   III.), shrinks from describing the detestable life of this Benedict,
   who, he says, followed in the footsteps of Simon Magus rather than of
   Simon Peter, and proceeded in a career of rapine, murder, and every
   species of felony, until even the people of Rome became weary of his
   iniquities, and expelled him from the city. Sylvester III. was elected
   antipope (Jan., 1044), but Benedict soon resumed the papacy with all
   his vices (April 10, 1044), then sold it for one or two thousand pounds
   silver [299] to an archpresbyter John Gratian of the same house (May,
   1045), after he had emptied the treasury of every article of value,
   and, rueing the bargain, he claimed the dignity again (Nov., 1047),
   till he was finally expelled from Rome (July, 1048).

   Gregory VI.

   John Gratian assumed the name Gregory, VI. He was revered as a saint
   for his chastity which, on account of its extreme rarity in Rome, was
   called an angelic virtue. He bought the papacy with the sincere desire
   to reform it, and made the monk Hildebrand, the future reformer, his
   chaplain. He acted on the principle that the end sanctifies the means.

   Thus there were for a while three rival popes. Benedict IX. (before his
   final expulsion) held the Lateran, Gregory VI. Maria Maggiore,
   Sylvester III. St. Peter's and the Vatican. [300]

   Their feuds reflected the general condition of Italy. The streets of
   Rome swarmed with hired assassins, the whole country with robbers, the
   virtue of pilgrims was openly assailed, even churches and the tombs of
   the apostles were desecrated by bloodshed.

   Again the German emperor had to interfere for the restoration of order.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [287] He is called Crescentius de Theodora, and seems to have died in a
   convent about 984. Some make him the son of Pope John X. and the elder
   Theodora, others, of the younger Theodora. See Gregorovius, III. 407
   sqq; von Reumont, II. 292 sqq.; and the genealogy of the Crescentii in
   Höfler, I. 300.

   [288] Gerbert (afterwards pope Sylvester II.) called this Bonifacius a
   "Malefactor," (Malifacius) and "horrendum monstrum, cunctos mortales
   nequitia superans, etiam prioris pontificis sanguine
   cruentus."Gregorovius, III. 410.

   [289] The Tusculan family claimed descent from Julius Caesar and
   Octavian. See Gregorovius, IV. 10, and Giesebrecht II. 174; also the
   genealogical table of Höfler at the close of Vol. I.

   [290] Baronius, however, says that Stephen VIII. (939-942) was a
   German, and for this reason opposed by the Romans. Bruno was only
   twenty-four years old when elected. Höfler (I. 94 sqq.) gives him a
   very high character.

   [291] See preceding section, p. 290.

   [292] According to several Italian writers he was poisoned by
   Stephania, under the disguise of a loving mistress, in revenge of the
   murder of Crescentius, her husband. Muratori and Milman accept the
   story, but it is not mentioned by Ditmar (Chron. IV. 30), and
   discredited by Leo, Gfrörer, and Greenwood. Otho had restored to the
   son of Stephania all his father's property, and made him prefect of
   Rome. The same remorseless Stephania is said to have admininistered
   subtle poison to pope Sylvester II.

   [293] See Gfrörer, III. P. III. 1550 sq. He regards Sylvester II. one
   of the greatest of popes and statesmen who developed all the germs of
   the system, and showed the way to his successors. Comp. on him Milman,
   Bk. V. ch. 13; Giesebrecht, I. 613 sqq. and 690 sqq.

   [294] His historian, bishop Thitmar or Ditmar of Merseburg, relates
   that Henry never held carnal intercourse with his wife, and submitted
   to rigid penances and frequent flagellations for the subjugation of
   animal passions. But Hase (§ 160, tenth ed.) remarks: "Die Mönche, die
   er zu Gunsten der Bisthümer beraubt hat, dachten ihn nur eben von der
   Hölle gerettet; auch den Heiligenschein der jungfraeulichen Kaiserinhat
   der Teufel zu verdunkeln gewusst." Comp. C. Schurzfleisch, De
   innocentia Cunig., Wit., 1700. A. Noel, Leben der heil. Kunigunde,
   Luxemb. 1856. For a high and just estimate of Henry's character see
   Giesebrecht II. 94-96. "The legend," he says, "describes Henry as a
   monk in purple, as a penitent with a crown, who can scarcely drag along
   his lame body; it places Kunigunde at his side not as wife but as a
   nun, who in prayer and mortification of the flesh seeks with him the
   path to heaven. History gives a very different picture of king Henry
   and his wife. It bears witness that he was one of the most active and
   energetic rulers that ever sat on the German throne, and possessed a
   sharp understanding and a power of organization very rare in those
   times. It was a misfortune for Germany that such a statesman had to
   spend most of his life in internal and external wars. Honorable as he
   was in arms, he would have acquired a higher fame in times of peace."

   [295] Rodulfus Glaber, Histor. sui temporis, IV. 5 (in Migne, Tom. 142,
   p. 979): "puer ferme (fere) decennis;" but in V. 5: "fuerat sedi
   ordinatus quidam puer circiter annorum duodecim, contra jus nefasque."
   Hefele stated, in the first ed. (IV. 673), that Benedict was eighteen
   when elected. In the second ed. (p. 706) he corrects himself and makes
   him twelve years at his election.

   [296] Isa. 3:1-4.

   [297] Gregorovius, IV. 42, says: "Mit Benedict IX. erreichte das
   Papstthum aussersten Grad des sittlichen Verfalls, welcher nach den
   Gesetzen der menschlichen Natur den Umschlag zum Bessern erzeugt."

   [298] Bonitho, ed. Jaffé p. 50: "Post multa turpia adulteria et
   homicidia manibus Buis perpetrata, postremo cum vellet consobrinam
   accipere coniugem, filiam scilicet Girardi de Saxo, et ille diceret:
   nullo modo se daturum nisi renunciaret pontificatui ad quendam
   sacerdotem Johannem se contulit." A similar report is found in the
   Annales Altahenses. But Steindorff and Hefele ([V. 707) discredit the
   marriage project as a malignant invention or fable.

   [299] An old catalogue of popes (in Muratori, Script. III. 2, p. 345)
   states the sum as mille librae denariorum Papensium, but Benno as
   librae mille quingentae. Others give two thousand pounds as the sum.
   Otto of Freising adds that Benedict reserved besides the Peter's pence
   from England. See Giesebrecht, II. 643, and Hefele IV. 707.

   [300] Migne, Tom. 141, p. 1343. Steindorff and Hefele (IV. 708) dissent
   from this usual view of a three-fold schism, and consider Gregory, as
   the only pope. But all three were summoned to the Synod of Sutri and
   deposed; consequently they must all have claimed possession.

   Emperor Henry III., of the house of Franconia, was appealed to by the
   advocates of reform, and felt deeply the sad state of the church. He
   was only twenty-two years old, but ripe in intellect, full of energy
   and zeal, and aimed at a reformation of the church under the control of
   the empire, as Hildebrand afterwards labored for a reformation of the
   church under the control of the papacy.

   On his way to Rome for the coronation he held (Dec. 20, 1046) a synod
   at Sutri, a small town about twenty-five miles north of Rome, and a few
   days afterwards another synod at Rome which completed the work. [301]
   Gregory VI. presided at first. The claims of the three rival pontiffs
   were considered. Benedict IX. and Sylvester III. were soon disposed of,
   the first having twice resigned, the second being a mere intruder.
   Gregory VI. deserved likewise deposition for the sin of simony in
   buying the papacy; but as he had convoked the synod by order of the
   emperor and was otherwise a worthy person, he was allowed to depose
   himself or to abdicate. He did it in these words: "I, Gregory, bishop,
   servant of the servants of God, do hereby adjudge myself to be removed
   from the pontificate of the Holy Roman Church, because of the enormous
   error which by simoniacal impurity has crept into and vitiated my
   election." Then he asked the assembled fathers: "Is it your pleasure
   that so it shall be?" to which they unanimously replied: "Your pleasure
   is our pleasure; therefore so let it be." As soon as the humble pope
   had pronounced his own sentence, he descended from the throne, divested
   himself of his pontifical robes, and implored pardon on his knees for
   the usurpation of the highest dignity in Christendom. He acted as pope
   de facto, and pronounced himself no pope de jure. He was used by the
   synod for deposing his two rivals, and then for deposing himself. In
   that way the synod saved the principle that the pope was above every
   human tribunal, and responsible to God alone. This view of the case of
   Gregory, rests on the reports of Bonitho and Desiderius. According to
   other reports in the Annales Corbeienses and Peter Damiani, who was
   present at Sutri, Gregory was deposed directly by the Synod. [302] At
   all events, the deposition was real and final, and the cause was the
   sin of simony.

   But if simony vitiated an election, there were probably few legitimate
   popes in the tenth century when everything was venal and corrupt in
   Rome. Moreover bribery seems a small sin compared with the enormous
   crimes of several of these Judases. Hildebrand recognized Gregory VI.
   by adopting his pontifical name in honor of his memory, and yet he made
   relentless war the sin of simony. He followed the self-deposed pope as
   upon chaplain across the Alps into exile, and buried him in peace on
   the banks of the Rhine.

   Henry III. adjourned the Synod of Sutri to St. Peter's in Rome for the
   election of a new pope (Dec. 23 and 24, 1046). The synod was to elect,
   but no Roman clergyman could be found free of the pollution of "simony
   and fornication." Then the king, vested by the synod with the green
   mantle of the patriciate and the plenary authority of the electors,
   descended from his throne, and seated Suidger, bishop of Bamberg, a man
   of spotless character, on the vacant chair of St. Peter amid the loud
   hosannas of the assembly. [303] The new pope assumed the name of
   Clement II., and crowned Henry emperor on the festival of Christmas, on
   which Charlemagne had been crowned. The name was a reminder of the
   conflict of the first Clement of Rome with Simon Magus. But he outlived
   his election only nine months, and his body was transferred to his
   beloved Bamberg. The wretched Benedict IX. again took possession of the
   Lateran (till July 16, 1048). He died afterwards in Grotto Ferrata,
   according to one report as a penitent saint, according to another as a
   hardened sinner whose ghost frightened the living. A third German
   pontiff, Poppo, bishop of Brixen, called Damasus II., was elected, but
   died twenty-three days after his consecration (Aug. 10, 1048), of the
   Roman fever, if not of poison.

   The emperor, at the request of the Romans, appointed at Worms in
   December, 1048, Bruno, bishop of Toul, to the papal chair. He was a man
   of noble birth, fine appearance, considerable learning, unblemished
   character, and sincere piety, in full sympathy with the spirit of
   reform which emanated from Cluny. He accepted the appointment in
   presence of the Roman deputies, subject to the consent of the clergy
   and people of Rome. [304] He invited the monk Hildebrand to accompany
   him in his pilgrimage to Rome. Hildebrand refused at first, because
   Bruno had not been canonically elected, but by the secular and royal
   power; but he was persuaded to follow him.

   Bruno reached Rome in the month of February, 1049, in the dress of a
   pilgrim, barefoot, weeping, regardless of the hymns of welcome. His
   election was unanimously confirmed by the Roman clergy and people, and
   he was solemnly consecrated Feb. 12, as Leo IX. He found the papal
   treasury empty, and his own means were soon exhausted. He chose
   Hildebrand as his subdeacon, financier, and confidential adviser, who
   hereafter was the soul of the papal reform, till he himself ascended
   the papal throne in 1073.

   We stand here at the close of the deepest degradation and on the
   threshold of the highest elevation of the papacy. The synod of Sutri
   and the reign of Leo IX. mark the beginning of a disciplinary reform.
   Simony or the sale and purchase of ecclesiastical dignities, and
   Nicolaitism or the carnal sins of the clergy, including marriage,
   concubinage and unnatural vices, were the crying evils of the church in
   the eyes of the most serious men, especially the disciples of Cluny and
   of St. Romuald. A reformation therefore from the hierarchical
   standpoint of the middle ages was essentially a suppression of these
   two abuses. And as the corruption had reached its climax in the papal
   chair, the reformation had to begin at the head before it could reach
   the members. It was the work chiefly of Hildebrand or Gregory VII.,
   with whom the next period opens.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [301] The sources differ in the distribution of the work between the
   two synods: some assign it to Sutri, others to Rome, others divide it.
   Steindorff and Hefele (IV. 710) assume that Gregory and Sylvester were
   deposed at Sutri; Benedict (who did not appear at Sutri) was deposed in
   Rome. All agree that the new pope was elected in Rome.

   [302] See Jaffé, Steindorff, and Hefele (IV. 711 sq.).

   [303] According to the Annal. Corb., Suidger was elected "canonice as
   synodice ... unanimi cleri et populi electione."

   [304] So says Wibert, his friend and biographer, but Bonitho reports
   that Hildebrand induced him to submit first to a Roman election, since
   a pope elected by the emperor was not an apostolicus, but an
   apostaticus. See Baxmann, II. 215-217. Comp. also Hunkler: Leo IX. und

   § 68. The Consensus and Dissensus between the Greek and Latin Churches.

   No two churches in the world are at this day so much alike, and yet so
   averse to each other as the Oriental or Greek, and the Occidental or
   Roman. They hold, as an inheritance from the patristic age, essentially
   the same body of doctrine, the same canons of discipline, the same form
   of worship; and yet their antagonism seems irreconcilable. The very
   affinity breeds jealousy and friction. They are equally exclusive: the
   Oriental Church claims exclusive orthodoxy, and looks upon Western
   Christendom as heretical; the Roman Church claims exclusive
   catholicity, and considers all other churches as heretical or
   schismatical sects. The one is proud of her creed, the other of her
   dominion. In all the points of controversy between Romanism and
   Protestantism the Greek Church is much nearer the Roman, and yet there
   is no more prospect of a union between them than of a union between
   Rome and Geneva, or Moscow and Oxford. The Pope and the Czar are the
   two most powerful rival-despots in Christendom. Where the two churches
   meet in closest proximity, over the traditional spots of the birth and
   tomb of our Saviour, at Bethlehem and Jerusalem, they hate each other
   most bitterly, and their ignorant and bigoted monks have to be kept
   from violent collision by Mohammedan soldiers.

   I. Let us first briefly glance at the consensus.

   Both churches own the Nicene creed (with the exception of the
   Filioque), and all the doctrinal decrees of the seven oecumenical
   Synods from a.d. 325 to 787, including the worship of images.

   They agree moreover in most of the post-oecumenical or mediaeval
   doctrines against which the evangelical Reformation protested, namely:
   the authority of ecclesiastical tradition as a joint rule of faith with
   the holy Scriptures; the worship of the Virgin Mary, of the saints,
   their pictures (not statues), and relics; justification by faith and
   good works, as joint conditions; the merit of good works, especially
   voluntary celibacy and poverty; the seven sacraments or mysteries (with
   minor differences as to confirmation, and extreme unction or chrisma);
   baptismal regeneration and the necessity of water-baptism for
   salvation; transubstantiation and the consequent adoration of the
   sacramental elements; the sacrifice of the mass for the living and the
   dead, with prayers for the dead; priestly absolution by divine
   authority; three orders of the ministry, and the necessity of an
   episcopal hierarchy up to the patriarchal dignity; and a vast number of
   religious rites and ceremonies.

   In the doctrine of purgatory, the Greek Church is less explicit, yet
   agrees with the Roman in assuming a middle state of purification, and
   the efficacy of prayers and masses for the departed. The dogma of
   transubstantiation, too, is not so clearly formulated in the Greek
   creed as in the Roman, but the difference is very small. As to the Holy
   Scriptures, the Greek Church has never prohibited the popular use, and
   the Russian Church even favors the free circulation of her authorized
   vernacular version. But the traditions of the Greek Church are as
   strong a barrier against the exercise of private judgment and
   exegetical progress as those of Rome.

   II. The dissensus of the two churches covers the following points:

   1. The procession of the Holy Spirit: the East teaching the single
   procession from the Father only, the West (since Augustin), the double
   procession from the Father and the Son (Filioque).

   2. The universal authority and infallibility of the pope, which is
   asserted by the Roman, denied by the Greek Church. The former is a
   papal monarchy, the latter a patriarchal oligarchy. There are,
   according to the Greek theory, five patriarchs of equal rights, the
   pope of Rome, the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,
   and Jerusalem. They were sometimes compared to the five senses in the
   body. To them was afterwards added the patriarch of Moscow for the
   Russian church (which is now governed by the "Holy Synod"). To the
   bishop of Rome was formerly conceded a primacy of honor, but this
   primacy passed with the seat of empire to the patriarch of
   Constantinople, who therefore signed himself "Archbishop of New Rome
   and Oecumenical Patriarch. [305]

   3. The immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, proclaimed as a dogma
   by the pope in 1854, disowned by the East, which, however, in the
   practice of Mariolatry fully equals the West.

   4. The marriage of the lower clergy, allowed by the Eastern, forbidden
   by the Roman Church (yet conceded by the pope to the United Greeks).

   5. The withdrawal of the cup from the laity. In the Greek Church the
   laymen receive the consecrated bread dipped in the wine and
   administered with a golden spoon.

   6. A number of minor ceremonies peculiar to the Eastern Church, such as
   trine immersion in baptism, the use of leavened bread in the eucharist,
   infant-communion, the repetition of the holy unction (to; eujcevlion)
   in sickness.

   Notwithstanding these differences the Roman Church has always been
   obliged to recognize the Greek Church as essentially orthodox, though
   schismatic. And, certainly, the differences are insignificant as
   compared with the agreement. The separation and antagonism must
   therefore be explained fully as much and more from an alienation of
   spirit and change of condition.

   Note on the Eastern Orthodox Church.

   For the sake of brevity the usual terminology is employed in this
   chapter, but the proper name of the Greek Church is the Holy Oriental
   Orthodox Apostolic Church. The terms mostly in use in that church are
   Orthodox and Oriental (Eastern). The term Greek is used in Turkey only
   of the Greeks proper (the Hellens); but the great majority of Oriental
   Christians in Turkey and Russia belong to the Slavonic race. The Greek
   is the original and classical language of the Oriental Church, in which
   the most important works are written; but it has been practically
   superseded in Asiatic Turkey by the Arabic, in Russia and European
   Turkey by the Slavonic.

   The Oriental or Orthodox Church now embraces three distinct divisions:

   1. The Orthodox Church in Turkey (European Turkey and the Greek
   islands, Asia Minor, Syria and Palestine) under the patriarchs of
   Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.

   2. The state church of Russia, formerly under the patriarch of
   Constantinople, then under the patriarch of Moscow, since 1725 under
   the Holy Synod of St. Petersburg and the headship of the Czar. This is
   by far the largest and most important branch.

   3. The church of the kingdom of Greece under the Holy Synod of Greece
   (since 1833).

   There are also Greek Christians in Egypt, the Sinaitic Peninsula (the
   monks of the Convent of St. Catharine), the islands of the AEgean Sea,
   in Malta, Servia, Austria, etc.

   Distinct from the Orthodox Church are the Oriental Schismatics, the
   Nestorians, Armenians, Jacobites, Copts, and Abyssinians, who separated
   from the former on the ground of the christological controversies. The
   Maronites of Mount Lebanon were originally also schismatics, but
   submitted to the pope during the Crusades.

   The United Greeks acknowledge the supremacy of the pope, but retain
   certain peculiarities of the Oriental Church, as the marriage of the
   lower clergy, the native language in worship. They are found in lower
   Italy, Austria, Russia, and Poland.

   The Bulgarians, who likewise call themselves orthodox, and who by the
   treaty of Berlin in 1878 have been formed into a distinct principality,
   occupy an independent position between the Greek and the Roman
   Churches.

   § 69. The Causes of Separation.

   Church history, like the world's history, moves with the sun from East
   to West. In the first six centuries the Eastern or Greek church
   represented the main current of life and progress. In the middle ages
   the Latin church chiefly assumed the task of christianizing and
   civilizing the new races which came upon the stage. The Greek church
   has had no Middle Ages in the usual sense, and therefore no
   Reformation. She planted Christianity among the Slavonic races, but
   they were isolated from the progress of European history, and have not
   materially affected either the doctrine or polity or cultus of the
   church. Their conversion was an external expansion, not an internal
   development.

   The Greek and Latin churches were never organically united under one
   government, but differed considerably from the beginning in
   nationality, language, and various ceremonies. These differences,
   however, did not interfere with the general harmony of faith and
   Christian life, nor prevent cooperation against common foes. As long
   and as far as the genuine spirit of Christianity directed them, the
   diversity was an element of strength to the common cause.

   The principal sees of the East were directly founded by the
   apostles--with the exception of Constantinople--and had even a clearer
   title to apostolic succession and inheritance than Rome. The Greek
   church took the lead in theology down to the sixth or seventh century,
   and the Latin gratefully learned from her. All the oecumenical Councils
   were held on the soil of the Byzantine empire in or near
   Constantinople, and carried on in the Greek language. The great
   doctrinal controversies on the holy Trinity and Christology were fought
   out in the East, yet not without the powerful aid of the more steady
   and practical West. Athanasius, when an exile from Alexandria, found
   refuge and support in the bishop of Rome. Jerome, the most learned of
   the Latin fathers and a friend of Pope Damasus, was a connecting link
   between the East and the West, and concluded his labors in Bethlehem.
   Pope Leo I. was the theological master-spirit who controlled the
   council of Chalcedon, and shaped the Orthodox formula concerning the
   two natures in the one person of Christ. Yet this very pope strongly
   protested against the action of the Council which, in conformity with a
   canon of the second oecumenical Council, put him on a par with the new
   bishop of Constantinople.

   And here we approach the secret of the ultimate separation and
   incurable antagonism of the churches. It is due chiefly to three
   causes. The first cause is the politico- ecclesiastical rivalry of the
   patriarch of Constantinople backed by the Byzantine empire, and the
   bishop of Rome in connection with the new German empire. The second
   cause is the growing centralization and overbearing conduct of the
   Latin church in and through the papacy. The third cause is the
   stationary character of the Greek and the progressive character of the
   Latin church during the middle ages. The Greek church boasts of the
   imaginary perfection of her creed. She still produced considerable
   scholars and divines, as Maximus, John of Damascus, Photius,
   Oecumenius, and Theophylact, but they mostly confined themselves to the
   work of epitomizing and systematizing the traditional theology of the
   Greek fathers, and produced no new ideas, as if all wisdom began and
   ended with the old oecumenical Councils. She took no interest in the
   important anthropological and soteriological controversies which
   agitated the Latin church in the age of St. Augustin, and she continued
   to occupy the indefinite position of the first centuries on the
   doctrines of sin and grace. On the other hand she was much distracted
   and weakened by barren metaphysical controversies on the abstrusest
   questions of theology and christology; and these quarrels facilitated
   the rapid progress of Islâm, which conquered the lands of the Bible and
   pressed hard on Constantinople. When the Greek church became
   stationary, the Latin church began to develop her greatest energy; she
   became the fruitful mother of new and vigorous nations of the North and
   West of Europe, produced scholastic and mystic theology and a new order
   of civilization, built magnificent cathedrals, discovered a new
   Continent, invented the art of printing, and with the revival of
   learning prepared the way for a new era in the history of the world.
   Thus the Latin daughter outgrew the Greek mother, and is numerically
   twice as strong, without counting the Protestant secession. At the same
   time the Eastern church still may look forward to a new future among
   the Slavonic races which she has christianized. What she needs is a
   revival of the spirit and power of primitive Christianity.

   When once the two churches were alienated in spirit and engaged in an
   unchristian race for supremacy, all the little doctrinal and
   ritualistic differences which had existed long before, assumed an undue
   weight, and were branded as heresies and crimes. The bishop of Rome
   sees in the Patriarch of Constantinople an ecclesiastical upstart who
   owed his power to political influence, not to apostolic origin. The
   Eastern patriarchs look upon the Pope as an anti-christian usurper and
   as the first Protestant. They stigmatize the papal supremacy as "the
   chief heresy of the latter days, which flourishes now as its
   predecessor, Arianism, flourished in former days, and which like it,
   will in like manner be cast down and vanish away." [306]

   Comp. § 61, the Lit. in § 67, especially the letters of Photius and
   Nicolas.

   Hergenröther: Photius (Regensb. 1867-69, vol. I. 373 sqq.; 505 sqq.;
   and the second vol.), and his Monumenta Graeca ad Photium ejusque
   historiam pertinentia (Ratisb. 1869, 181 pages). Milman: Hist. of Latin

   chief documents are also given by Gieseler II. 213 sqq. (Am. ed.)

   The doctrinal difference on the procession of the Holy Spirit will be
   considered in the chapter on the Theological Controversies. Although it
   existed before the schism, it assumed a practical importance only in
   connection with the broader ecclesiastical and political conflict
   between the patriarch and the pope, between Constantinople and Rome.

   The first serious outbreak of this conflict took place after the middle
   of the ninth century, when Photius and Nicolas, two of the ablest
   representatives of the rival churches, came into collision. Photius is
   one of the greatest of patriarchs, as Nicolas is one of the greatest of
   popes. The former was superior in learning, the latter in
   statesmanship; while in moral integrity, official pride and obstinacy
   both were fairly matched, except that the papal ambition towered above
   the patriarchal dignity. Photius would tolerate no superior, Nicolas no
   equal; the one stood on the Council of Chalcedon, the other on
   Pseudo-Isidor.

   The contest between them was at first personal. The deposition of
   Ignatius as patriarch of Constantinople, for rebuking the immorality of
   Caesar Bardas, and the election of Photius, then a mere layman, in his
   place (858), were arbitrary and uncanonical acts which created a
   temporary schism in the East, and prepared the way for a permanent
   schism between the East and the West. Nicolas, being appealed to as
   mediator by both parties (first by Photius), assumed the haughty air of
   supreme judge on the basis of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, but was
   at first deceived by his own legates. The controversy was complicated
   by the Bulgarian quarrel. King Bogoris had been converted to
   Christianity by missionaries from Constantinople (861), but soon after
   applied to Rome for teachers, and the pope eagerly seized this
   opportunity to extend his jurisdiction (866).

   Nicolas, in a Roman Synod (863), decided in favor of the innocent
   Ignatius, and pronounced sentence of deposition against Photius with a
   threat of excommunication in case of disobedience. [307] Photius,
   enraged by this conduct and the Bulgarian interference, held a
   counter-synod, and deposed in turn the successor of St. Peter (867). In
   his famous Encyclical Letter of invitation to the Eastern patriarchs,
   he charged the whole Western church with heresy and schism for
   interfering with the jurisdiction over the Bulgarians, for fasting on
   Saturday, for abridging the time of Lent by a week, for taking
   milk-food (milk, cheese, and butter) during the quadragesimal fast, for
   enforcing clerical celibacy, and despising priests who lived in
   virtuous matrimony, and, most of all, for corrupting the Nicene Creed
   by the insertion of the Filioque, and thereby introducing two
   principles into the Holy Trinity. [308]

   This letter clearly indicates all the doctrinal and ritual differences
   which caused and perpetuated the schism to this day. The subsequent
   history is only a renewal of the same charges aggravated by the
   misfortunes of the Greek church, and the arrogance and intolerance of
   old Rome.

   Photius fell with the murder of his imperial patron, Michael III.
   (Sept. 23, 867). He was imprisoned in a convent, and deprived of
   society, even of books. He bore his misfortune with great dignity, and
   nearly all the Greek bishops remained faithful to him. Ignatius was
   restored after ten years of exile by the emperor Basil, the Macedonian
   (867-886), and entered into communication with Pope Hadrian II. (Dec.
   867). He convened a general council in the church of St. Sophia
   (October, 869), which is numbered by the Latins as the Eighth
   Oecumenical Council. The pontifical legates presided and presented a
   formula of union which every bishop was required to sign before taking
   part in the proceedings, and which contained an anathema against all
   heresies, and against Photius and his adherents. But the council was
   poorly attended (the number of bishops being at first only eighteen).
   Photius was forced to appear in the fifth session (Oct. 20), but on
   being questioned he either kept silence, or answered in the words of
   Christ before Caiaphas and Pilate. In the tenth and last session,
   attended by the emperor and his sons, and one hundred and two bishops,
   the decrees of the pope against Photius and in favor of Ignatius were
   confirmed, and the anathemas against the Monothelites and Iconoclasts
   renewed. The papal delegates signed "with reservation of the revision
   of the pope."

   But the peace was artificial, and broken up again immediately, after
   the Synod by the Bulgarian question, which involved the political as
   well as the ecclesiastical power of Constantinople. Ignatius himself
   was unwilling to surrender that point, and refused to obey when the
   imperious Pope John VIII. commanded, on pain of suspension and
   excommunication, that he should recall all the Greek bishops and
   priests from Bulgaria. But death freed him from further controversy
   (Oct. 23, 877).

   Photius was restored to the patriarchal see three days after the death
   of Ignatius, with whom he had been reconciled. He convened a council in
   November, 879, which lasted till March, 880, and is acknowledged by the
   Orientals as the Eighth Oecumenical Council, [309] but denounced by the
   Latins as the Pseudo-Synodus Photiana. It was three times as large as
   the Council of Ignatius, and held with great pomp in St. Sophia under
   the presidency of Photius. It annulled the Council of 869 as a fraud;
   it readopted the Nicene Creed with an anathema against the Filioque,
   and all other changes by addition or omission, and it closed with a
   eulogy on the unrivalled virtues and learning of Photius. To the Greek
   acts was afterwards added a (pretended) letter of Pope John VIII. to
   Photius, declaring the Filioque to be an addition which is rejected by
   the church of Rome, and a blasphemy which must be abolished calmly and
   by, degrees. [310] The papal legates assented to all, and so deceived
   their master by false accounts of the surrender of Bulgaria that he
   thanked the emperor for the service he had done to the Church by this
   synod.

   But when the pope's eyes were opened, he sent the bishop Marinus to
   Constantinople to declare invalid what the legates had done contrary to
   his instructions. For this Marinus was shut up in prison for thirty
   days. After his return Pope John VIII. solemnly pronounced the anathema
   on Photius, who had dared to deceive and degrade the holy see, and had
   added new frauds to the old. Marinus renewed the anathema after he was
   elected pope (882). Photius denied the validity of his election, and
   developed an extraordinary, literary activity.

   But after the death of the Emperor Basilius (886), he was again deposed
   by Leo VI., miscalled the Wise or the Philosopher, to make room for his
   youngest brother Stephen, at that time only sixteen years of age.
   Photius spent the last five years of his life in a cloister, and died
   891. For learning, energy, position, and influence, he is one of the
   most remarkable men in the history of Eastern Christianity. He
   formulated the doctrinal basis of the schism, checked the papal
   despotism, and secured the independence of the Greek church. He
   announced in an Encyclical of 866: "God be praised for all time to
   come! The Russians have received a bishop, and show a lively zeal for
   Christian worship." Roman writers have declared this to be a lie, but
   history has proved it to be an anticipation of an important fact, the
   conversion of a new nation which was to become the chief support of the
   Eastern church, and the most formidable rival of the papacy.

   Greek and Roman historians are apt to trace the guilt of the schism
   exclusively to one party, and to charge the other with unholy ambition
   and intrigue; but we must acknowledge on the one hand the righteous
   zeal of Nicolas for the cause of the injured Ignatius, and on the other
   the many virtues of Photius tried in misfortune, as well as his
   brilliant learning in theology, philology, philosophy, and history;
   while we deplore and denounce the schism as a sin and disgrace of both
   churches.

   Notes.

   The accounts of the Roman Catholic historians, even the best, are
   colored by sectarianism, and must be accepted with caution. Cardinal
   Hergenröther (Kirchengesch. I. 684) calls the Council of 879 a
   "Photianische Pseudo-Synode," and its acts "ein aecht byzantinisches
   Machwerk ganz vom Geiste des verschmitzten Photius durchdrungen."
   Bishop Hefele, in the revised edition of his Conciliengesch. (IV. 464
   sqq.), treats this Aftersynode, as he calls it, no better. Both follow
   in the track of their old teacher, Dr. Döllinger who, in his History of
   the Church (translated by Dr. Edward Cox, London 1841, vol. III. p.
   100), more than forty years ago, described this Synod "in all its parts
   as a worthy sister of the Council of Robbers of the year 449; with this
   difference, that in the earlier Synod violence and tyranny, in the
   later artifice, fraud, and falsehood were employed by wicked men to
   work out their wicked designs." But when in 1870 the Vatican Council
   sanctioned the historical falsehood of papal infallibility, Döllinger,
   once the ablest advocate of Romanism in Germany, protested against Rome
   and was excommunicated. Whatever the Latins may say against the Synod
   of Photius, the Latin Synod of 869 was not a whit better, and Rome
   understood the arts of intrigue fully as well as Constantinople. The
   whole controversy between the Greek and the Roman churches is one of
   the most humiliating chapters in the history of Christianity, and both
   must humbly confess their share of sin and guilt before a
   reconciliation can take place.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [307] The Synod, claiming to be the infallible organ of the Holy
   Spirit, compared Photius with a robber and adulterer for obtruding
   himself into the see of Constantinople during the lifetime of Ignatius,
   deprived him of all priestly honors and functions "by authority of
   Almighty God, St. Peter and St. Paul, the princes of the apostles, of
   all saints, of the six [why not seven?] ecumenical councils, as also by
   the judgment of the Holy Ghost," and threatened him and all his
   adherents with the anathema and excommunication from the eucharist till
   the moment of death, "that no one may dare hereafter from the state of
   the laity to break into the camp of the Lord, as has often been the
   case in the church of Constantinople." See on this Synod Hergenröther,
   Phot. I. 519 sqq., and Hefele IV. 269 sqq.

   [308] See the Encyclica ad Patriarchas Orientales in the original Greek
   in Photius, Opera II. 722-742 (ed. Migne), also in Gieseler II. 216 sq.
   Baronius (ad ann. 863 no. 34 sq.) gives it in Latin.

   [309] Strictly speaking, however, the Orthodox Eastern Church counts
   only seven OEcumenical Councils.

   [310] The Roman Catholic historians regard this letter as a Greek
   fraud. "Ich kann nicht glauben," says Hefele (IV. 482), "dass je ein
   Papst seine Stellung so sehr vergessen habe, wie es Johann VIII. gethan
   haben müsste, wenn dieser Brief ächt wäre. Es ist in demselben auch
   keine Spur des Papalbewusstseins, vielmehr ist die Superiorität des
   Photius fast ausdrücklich anerkannt."

   775 sqq. Gieseler: II. 221 sqq.

   We shall briefly sketch the progress and consolidation of the schism.

   The Difference About Tetragamy.

   The fourth marriage of the emperor Leo the Philosopher (886-912), which
   was forbidden by the laws of the Greek church, caused a great schism in
   the East (905). [311] The Patriarch Nicolas Mysticus solemnly protested
   and was deposed (906), but Pope Sergius III. (904-911), instead of
   siding with suffering virtue as Pope Nicolas had done, sanctioned the
   fourth marriage (which was not forbidden in the West) and the
   deposition of the conscientious patriarch.

   Leo on his death-bed restored the deposed patriarch (912). A Synod of
   Constantinople in 920, at which Pope John X. was represented, declared
   a fourth marriage illegal, and made no concessions to Rome. The Emperor
   Constantine, Leo's son, prohibited a fourth marriage by an edict;
   thereby casting a tacit imputation on his own birth. The Greek church
   regards marriage as a sacrament, and a necessary means for the
   propagation of the race, but a second marriage is prohibited to the
   clergy, a third marriage is tolerated in laymen as a sort of legal
   concubinage, and a fourth is condemned as a sin and a scandal. The pope
   acquiesced, and the schism slumbered during the dark tenth century. The
   venal Pope John XIX. (1024) was ready for an enormous sum to renounce
   all the claim of superiority over the Eastern patriarchs, but was
   forced to break off the negotiations when his treasonable plan was
   discovered.

   Cerularius and Leo IX.

   Michael Cerularius (or Caerularius), [312] who was patriarch from 1043
   to 1059, renewed and completed the schism. Heretofore the mutual
   anathemas were hurled only against the contending heads and their
   party; now the churches excommunicated each other. The Emperor
   Constantinus Monachus courted the friendship of the pope for political
   reasons, but his patriarch checkmated him. Cerularius, in connection
   with the learned Bulgarian metropolitan Leo of Achrida, addressed in
   1053 a letter to John, bishop of Trani, in Apulia (then subject to the
   Eastern rule), and through him to all the bishops of France and to the
   pope himself, charging the churches of the West that, following the
   practice of the Jews, and contrary to the usage of Christ, they employ
   in the eucharist unleavened bread; that they fast on Saturday in Lent;
   that they eat blood and things strangled in violation of the decree of
   the Council of Jerusalem (Acts, ch. 15); and that during the fast they
   do not sing the hallelujah. He invented the new name Azymites for the
   heresy of using unleavened bread (azyma) instead of common bread. [313]
   Nothing was said about the procession of the Spirit. This letter is
   only extant in the Latin translation of Cardinal Humbert. [314]

   Pope Leo IX. sent three legates under the lead of the imperious Humbert
   to Constantinople, with counter-charges to the effect that Cerularius
   arrogated to himself the title of "oecumenical" patriarch; that he
   wished to subject the patriarchs of Alexandria and of Antioch; that the
   Greeks rebaptized the Latins; that, like the Nicolaitans, they
   permitted their priests to live in wedlock; [315] that they neglected
   to baptize their children before the eighth day after birth; that, like
   the Pneumatomachi or Theomachi, they cut out of the symbol the
   Procession of the Spirit from the Son. [316] The legates were lodged in
   the imperial palace, but Cerularius avoided all intercourse with them.
   Finally, on the 16th of July, 1054, they excommunicated the patriarch
   and all those who should persistently censure the faith of the church
   of Rome or its mode of offering the holy sacrifice. They placed the
   writ on the altar of the church of Hagia Sophia with the words: "Videat
   Deus et judicet."

   Cerularius, supported by his clergy and the people, immediately
   answered by a synodical counter-anathema on the papal legates, and
   accused them of fraud. In a letter to Peter, the patriarch of Antioch
   (who at first acted the part of a mediator), he charged Rome with other
   scandals, namely, that two brothers were allowed to espouse two
   sisters; that bishops wore rings and engaged in warfare; that baptism
   was administered by a single immersion; that salt was put in the mouth
   of the baptized; that the images and relics of saints were not honored;
   and that Gregory the Theologian, Basil, and Chrysostom were not
   numbered among the saints. The Filioque was also mentioned. [317]

   The charge of the martial spirit of the bishops was well founded in
   that semi-barbarous age. Cerularius was all-powerful for several years;
   he dethroned one emperor and crowned another, but died in exile (1059).

   The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem adhered to the see
   of Constantinople. Thus the schism between the Christian East and West
   was completed. The number of episcopal sees at that time was nearly
   equal on both sides, but in the course of years the Latin church far
   outgrew the East.

   The Latin Empire in the East. 1204-1261.

   During the Crusades the schism was deepened by the brutal atrocities of
   the French and Venetian soldiers in the pillage of Constantinople
   (1204), the establishment of a Latin empire, and the appointment by the
   pope of Latin bishops in Greek sees. [318] Although this artificial
   empire lasted only half a century (1204-1261), it left a legacy of
   burning hatred in the memories of horrible desecrations and innumerable
   insults and outrages, which the East had to endure from the Western
   barbarians. Churches and monasteries were robbed and desecrated, the
   Greek service mocked, the clergy persecuted, and every law of decency
   set at defiance. In Constantinople "a prostitute was seated on the
   throne of the patriarch; and that daughter of Belial, as she is styled,
   sung and danced in the church to ridicule the hymns and processions of
   the Orientals." Even Pope Innocent III. accuses the pilgrims that they
   spared in their lust neither age nor sex, nor religious profession, and
   that they committed fornication, adultery, and incest in open day (in
   oculis omnium), "abandoning matrons and virgins dedicated to God to the
   lewdness of grooms." And yet this great pope insulted the Eastern
   church by the establishment of a Latin hierarchy on the ruins of the
   Byzantine empire. [319]

   nourishing bread (artosfromairo), as the sign of the new dispensation
   of joy and gladness; while the lifeless, unleavened bread (azumon)
   belongs to the Jewish dispensation. The Latins argued that artosmeans
   unleavened as well as leavened bread, and that Christ during the feast
   of the passover could not get any other but unleavened bread. They

   § 72. Fruitless Attempts at Reunion.

   The Greek emperors, hard pressed by the terrible Turks, who threatened
   to overthrow their throne, sought from time to time by negotiations
   with the pope to secure the powerful aid of the West. But all the
   projects of reunion split on the rock of papal absolutism and Greek
   obstinacy.

   The Council of Lyons. a.d. 1274. [320]

   Michael Palaeologus (1260-1282), who expelled the Latins from
   Constantinople (July 25, 1261), restored the Greek patriarchate, but
   entered into negotiations with Pope Urban IV. to avert the danger of a
   new crusade for the reconquest of Constantinople. A general council
   (the 14th of the Latins) was held at Lyons in 1273 and 1274 with great
   solemnity and splendor for the purpose of effecting a reunion. Five
   hundred Latin bishops, seventy abbots, and about a thousand other
   ecclesiastics were present, together with ambassadors from England,
   France, Germany, and other countries. Palaeologus sent a large embassy,
   but only three were saved from shipwreck, Germanus, ex-patriarch of
   Constantinople, Theophanes, metropolitan of Nicaea, and the chancellor
   of the empire. The pope opened the Synod (May 7, 1274) by the
   celebration of high mass, and declared the threefold object of the
   Synod to be: help for Jerusalem, union with the Greeks, and reform of
   the church. Bonaventura preached the sermon. Thomas Aquinas, the prince
   of schoolmen, who had defended the Latin doctrine of the double
   procession [321] was to attend, but had died on the journey to Lyons
   (March 7, 1274), in his 49th year. The imperial delegates were treated
   with marked courtesy abjured the schism, submitted to the pope and
   accepted the distinctive tenets of the Roman church.

   But the Eastern patriarchs were not represented, the people of
   Constantinople abhorred the union with Rome, and the death of the
   despotic Michael Palaeologus (1282) was also the death of the Latin
   party, and the formal revocation of the act of submission to the pope.

   The Council at Ferrara--Florence. a.d. 1438-1439. [322]

   Another attempt at reunion was made by John VII. Palaeologus in the
   Council of Ferrara, which was convened by Pope Eugenius IV. in
   opposition to the reformatory Council of Basle. It was afterwards
   transferred to Florence on account of the plague. It was attended by
   the emperor, the patriarch of Constantinople, and twenty-one Eastern
   prelates, among them the learned Bessarion of Nicaea, Mark of Ephesus,
   Dionysius of Sardis, Isidor of Kieff. The chief points of controversy
   were discussed: the procession of the Spirit, purgatory, the use of
   unleavened bread, and the supremacy of the pope. [323] Bessarion became
   a convert to the Western doctrine, and was rewarded by a cardinal's
   hat. He was twice near being elected pope (d. 1472). The decree of the
   council, published July 6, 1439, embodies his views, and was a complete
   surrender to the pope with scarcely a saving clause for the canonical
   rights and privileges of the Eastern patriarchs. The Greek formula on
   the procession, ex Patre per Filium, was declared to be identical with
   the Latin Filioque; the pope was acknowledged not only as the successor
   of Peter and Vicar of Christ, but also as "the head of the whole church
   and father and teacher of all Christians," but with variations in the
   Greek texts. [324] The document of reunion was signed by the pope, the
   emperor, many archbishops and bishops, the representatives of all the
   Eastern patriarchs except that of Constantinople, who had previously
   died at Florence, but had left as his last sentence a disputed
   submission to the catholic and apostolic church of old Rome. For the
   triumph of his cause the pope could easily promise material aid to his
   Eastern ally, to pay the expenses of the deputation, to support three
   hundred soldiers for the protection of Constantinople, and to send, if
   necessary, an army and navy for the defense of the emperor against his
   enemies.

   But when the humiliating terms of the reunion were divulged, the East
   and Russia rose in rebellion against the Latinizers as traitors to the
   orthodox faith; the compliant patriarchs openly recanted, and the new
   patriarch of Constantinople, Metrophanes, now called in derision
   Metrophonus or Matricide, was forced to resign.

   After the Fall of Constantinople.

   The capture of Constantinople by the Mohammedan Turks (1453) and the
   overthrow of the Byzantine empire put an end to all political schemes
   of reunion, but opened the way for papal propagandism in the East. The
   division of the church facilitated that catastrophe which delivered the
   fairest lands to the blasting influence of Islâm, and keeps it in power
   to this day, although it is slowly waning. The Turk has no objection to
   fights among the despised Christians, provided they only injure
   themselves and do not touch the Koran. He is tolerant from intolerance.
   The Greeks hate the pope and the Filioque as much as they hate the
   false prophet of Mecca; while the pope loves his own power more than
   the common cause of Christianity, and would rather see the Sultan rule
   in the city of Constantine than a rival patriarch or the Czar of
   schismatic Russia.

   During the nineteenth century the schism has been intensified by the
   creation of two new dogmas,--the immaculate conception of Mary (1854)
   and the infallibility of the pope (1870). When Pius IX. invited the
   Eastern patriarchs to attend the Vatican Council, they indignantly
   refused, and renewed their old protest against the antichristian
   usurpation of the papacy and the heretical Filioque. They could not
   submit to the Vatican decrees without stultifying their whole history
   and committing moral suicide. Papal absolutism [325] and Eastern
   stagnation are insuperable barriers to the reunion of the divided
   churches, which can only be brought about by great events and by the
   wonder-working power of the Spirit of God.

   § 73. Literature.

   I. The chief and almost only sources for this chapter are the acts of
   Synods, the lives of saints and missionaries, and the chronicles of
   monasteries. The Acta Sanctorum mix facts and legends in inextricable
   confusion. The most important are the biographies of the Irish, Scotch,
   and Anglo-Saxon missionaries, and the letters of Boniface. For the
   history, of France during the sixth and seventh centuries we have the
   Historia Francorum by Gregory of Tours, the Herodotus of France (d.
   594), first printed in Paris, 1511, better by Ruinart, 1699; best by
   Giesebrecht (in German), Berlin 1851, 9th ed. 1873, 2 vols.; and
   Gregorii Historiae Epitomata by his continuator, Fredegar, a clergyman
   of Burgundy (d. about 660), ed. by Ruinart, Paris 1699, and by Abel (in
   German), Berlin 1849. For the age of Charlemagne we have the
   Capitularies of the emperor, and the historical works of Einhard or
   Eginard (d. 840). See Ouvres complètes d' Eginard, réunies pour la

   § 74. General Character of Mediaeval Morals.

   The middle age of Western Christendom resembles the period of the
   Judges in the history of Israel when "the highways were unoccupied, and
   the travelers walked through by-ways," and when "every man did that
   which was right in his own eyes." [326] It was a time of civil and
   political commotions and upheavings, of domestic wars and foreign
   invasions. Society was in a chaotic state and bordering on the brink of
   anarchy. Might was right. It was the golden age of border-ruffians,
   filibusters, pirates and bold adventurers, but also of gallant knights,
   genuine heroes and judges, like Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, and Samuel of
   old. It presents, in striking contrasts, Christian virtues and heathen
   vices, ascetic self-denial and gross sensuality. Nor were there wanting
   idyllic episodes of domestic virtue and happiness which call to mind
   the charming story of Ruth from the period of the Judges.

   Upon the whole the people were more religious than moral. Piety was
   often made a substitute or atonement for virtue. Belief in the
   supernatural and miraculous was universal; scepticism and unbelief were
   almost unknown. Men feared purgatory and hell, and made great
   sacrifices to gain heaven by founding churches, convents, and
   charitable institutions. And yet there was a frightful amount of
   immorality among the rulers and the people. In the East the church had
   to contend with the vices of an effete civilization and a corrupt
   court. In Italy, France and Spain the old Roman vices continued and
   were even invigorated by the infusion of fresh and barbaric blood. The
   history of the Merovingian rulers, as we learn from Bishop Gregory of
   Tours, is a tragedy of murder, adultery, and incest, and ends in
   destruction. [327]

   The church was unfavorably affected by the state of surrounding
   society, and often drawn into the current of prevailing immorality.
   Yet, upon the whole, she was a powerful barrier against vice, and the
   chief, if not the only promoter of education, virtue and piety in the
   dark ages. From barbaric and semi-barbaric material she had to build up
   the temple of a Christian civilization. She taught the new converts the
   Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments the best
   popular summaries of faith, piety, and duty. She taught them also the
   occupations of peaceful life. She restrained vice and encouraged
   virtue. The synodical legislation was nearly always in the right
   direction. Great stress was laid on prayer and fasting, on acts of
   hospitality, charity, and benevolence, and on pilgrimages to sacred
   places. The rewards of heaven entered largely as an inducement for
   leading a virtuous and holy life; but it is far better that people
   should be good from fear of hell and love of heaven than ruin
   themselves by immorality and vice.

   A vast amount of private virtue and piety is never recorded on the
   pages of histor y, and is spent in modest retirement. So the wild
   flowers in the woods and on the mountains bloom and fade away unseen by
   human eyes. Every now and then incidental allusion is made to unknown
   saints. Pope Gregory mentions a certain Servulus in Rome who was a poor
   cripple from childhood, but found rich comfort and peace in the Bible,
   although he could not read himself, and had to ask pious friends to
   read it to him while he was lying on his couch; he never complained,
   but was full of gratitude and praise; when death drew near he requested
   his friends to sing psalms with him; then stopped suddenly and expired
   with the words: "Peace, hear ye not the praises of God sounding from
   heaven?" This man's life of patient suffering was not in vain, but a
   benediction to many who came in contact with it. "Those also serve who
   only stand and wait."

   The moral condition of the middle age varied considerably. The
   migration of nations was most unfavorable to the peaceful work of the
   church. Then came the bright reign of Charlemagne with his noble
   efforts for education and religion, but it was soon followed, under his
   weak successors, by another period of darkness which grew worse and
   worse till a moral reformation began in the convent of Cluny, and
   reached the papal chair under the lead of Hildebrand.

   Yet if we judge by the number of saints in the Roman Calendar, the
   seventh century, which is among the, darkest, was more pious than any
   of the preceding and succeeding centuries, except the third and fourth
   (which are enriched by the martyrs).

   Notes.

   The following is the table of saints in the Roman Calendar (according
   to Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints): Saints.

   First Century

   53

   Second Century

   43

   Third Century

   139

   Fourth Century

   213

   Fifth Century

   130

   Sixth Century

   123

   Seventh Century

   174

   Eighth Century

   Ninth Century

   27

   Fifteenth Century

   17

   Sixteenth Century

   24

   Seventeenth Century

   15

   Eighteenth Century

   In the first centuries the numerous but nameless martyrs of the
   Neronian and other persecutions are not separately counted. The Holy
   Innocents, the Seven Sleepers (in the third century), the Forty Martyrs
   of Sebaste (fourth century,) and other groups of martyrs are counted
   only one each. Lecky asserts too confidently that the seventh century
   was the most prolific in saints, and yet the most immoral. It is
   strange that the number of saints should have declined from the seventh
   century, while the church increased, and that the eighteenth century of
   infidelity should have produced five more saints than the seventeenth
   century. It would therefore be very unsafe to make this table the basis
   for

   [327] "It would be difficult," says Gibbon of this period, "to find
   anywhere more vice or less virtue." The judgments of Hallam, Milman,
   and Lecky are to the same effect. Compare also the description of
   Montalembert, quoted above, p. 82 sq.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 75. Clerical Morals.

   1. Social Position. The clergy stood, during the middle ages, at the
   head of society, and shared with kings and nobles the rule of the
   people. They had the guardianship of the souls and consciences of men,
   and handled the keys of the kingdom of heaven. They possessed nearly
   all the learning, but it was generally very limited, and confined to a
   little Latin without any Greek. Some priests descended from noble and
   even royal blood, others from slaves who belonged to monasteries. They
   enjoyed many immunities from public burdens, as military duty and
   taxation. Charlemagne and his successors granted to them all the
   privileges which the Eastern emperors from the time of Constantine had
   bestowed upon them. They could not be sued before a civil court, and
   had their own episcopal tribunals. No lay judge could apprehend or
   punish an ecclesiastic without the permission of his bishop.

   They were supported by the income from landed estates, cathedral funds,
   and the annual tithes which were enacted after the precedent of the
   Mosaic law. Pepin, by a decree of 764, imposed the payment of tithes
   upon all the royal possessions. Charlemagne extended it to all lands,
   and made the obligation general by a capitulary in 779. The tithes were
   regarded as the minimum contribution for the maintenance of religion
   and the support of the poor. They were generally paid to the bishop, as
   the administrator of all ecclesiastical goods. Many nobles had their
   own domestic chaplains who depended on their lords, and were often
   employed in degrading offices, as waiting at table and attending to
   horses and hounds.

   2. Morals. The priests were expected to excel in virtue as well as in
   education, and to commend their profession by an exemplary life. Upon
   the whole they were superior to their flock, but not unfrequently they
   disgraced their profession by scandalous immorality. According to
   ancient discipline every priest at his ordination was connected with a
   particular church except missionaries to heathen lands. But many
   priests defied the laws, and led an irregular wandering life as
   clerical tramps. They were forbidden to wear the sword, but many a
   bishop lost his life on the battle field and even some popes engaged in
   warfare. Drunkenness and licentiousness were common vices. Gregory of
   Tours mentions a bishop named Cautinus who, when intoxicated, had to be
   carried by four men from the table. Boniface gives a very unfavorable
   but partizan account of the French and German clergymen who acted
   independently of Rome. The acts of Synods are full of censures and
   punishments of clerical sins and vices. They legislated against
   fornication, intemperance, avarice, the habits of hunting, of visiting
   horse-races and theatres, and enjoined even corporal punishments. [328]

   Clerical immorality reached the lowest depth in the tenth and eleventh
   centuries, when Rome was a sink of iniquity, and the popes themselves
   set the worst example. But a new reform began with the Hildebrandian
   popes.

   3. Canonical Life. Chrodegang, bishop of Metz (a.d. 760), reformed the
   clergy by introducing, or reviving, after the example of St. Augustin,
   the "canonical" or semi-monastic life. The bishop and lower clergymen
   lived in the same house, near the cathedral, ate at the same table,
   prayed and studied together, like a family of monks, only differing
   from them in dress and the right of holding property or receiving fees
   for official services. Such an establishment was called Chapter, [329]
   and the members of it were called Canons. [330]

   The example was imitated in other places. Charlemagne made the
   canonical life obligatory on all bishops as far as possible. Many
   chapters were liberally endowed. But during the civil commotions of the
   Carolingians the canonical life degenerated or was broken up.

   4. Celibacy. In the East the lower clergy were always allowed to marry,
   and only a second marriage is forbidden. In the West celibacy was the
   prescribed rule, but most clergymen lived either with lawful wives or
   with concubines. In Milan all the priests and deacons were married in
   the middle of the eleventh century, but to the disgust of the severe
   moralists of the time. [331] Hadrian II. was married before he became
   pope, and had a daughter, who was murdered by her husband, together
   with the pope's wife, Stephania (868). [332] The wicked pope Benedict
   IX. sued for the daughter of his cousin, who consented on condition
   that he resign the papacy (1033). [333] The Hildebrandian popes, Leo
   IX. and Nicolas II., made attempts to enforce clerical celibacy all
   over the West. They identified the interests of clerical morality and
   influence with clerical celibacy, and endeavored to destroy natural
   immorality by enforcing unnatural morality. How far Gregory VII.
   succeeded in this part of his reform, will be seen in the next period.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [328] It seems incredible that there should have been an occasion for
   legislation against clergymen keeping houses of prostitution; and yet
   the Quinisexta or Trullan Synod of 692 enacted the canon: "He who keeps
   a brothel, if a clergyman, shall be deposed and excommunicated; if a
   layman, excommunicated." Hefele III. 341.

   [329] Capitulum, from the chapter of the Bible or of the monastic rules
   which were read in common every day. The name was applied both to the
   clerical brotherhood and to their habitation (chapter-house). The

   § 76. Domestic Life.

   The purity and happiness of home-life depend on the position of woman,
   who is the beating heart of the household. Female degradation was one
   of the weakest spots in the old Greek and Roman civilization. The
   church, in counteracting the prevailing evil, ran into the opposite
   extreme of ascetic excess as a radical cure. Instead of concentrating
   her strength on the purification and elevation of the family, she
   recommended lonely celibacy as a higher degree of holiness and a safer
   way to heaven.

   Among the Western and Northern barbarians she found a more favorable
   soil for the cultivation of Christian family life. The contrast which
   the heathen historian Tacitus and the Christian monk Salvian draw
   between the chastity of the Teutonic barbarians and the licentiousness
   of the Latin races is overdrawn for effect, but not without foundation.
   The German and Scandinavian tribes had an instinctive reverence for the
   female sex, as being inspired by a divinity, possessed of the prophetic
   gift, and endowed with secret charms. Their women shared the labors and
   dangers of men, emboldened them in their fierce battles, and would
   rather commit suicide than submit to dishonor. Yet the wife was
   entirely in the power of her husband, and could be bought, sold,
   beaten, and killed.

   The Christian religion preserved and strengthened the noble traits, and
   developed them into the virtues of chivalry; while it diminished or
   abolished evil customs and practices. The Synods often deal with
   marriage and divorce. Polygamy, concubinage, secret marriages,
   marriages with near relatives, mixed marriages with heathens or Jews or
   heretics were forbidden; the marriage tie was declared sacred and
   indissoluble (except by adultery); sexual intemperance restrained and
   forbidden on Sundays and during Lent; the personal independence of
   woman and her rights of property were advanced. The Virgin Mary was
   constantly held up to the imagination as the incarnation of female
   parity and devotion. Not unfrequently, however, marriages were
   dissolved by mutual consent from mistaken ascetic piety. When a married
   layman entered the priesthood or a convent, he usually forsook his
   wife. In a Roman Synod of 827 such separation was made subject to the
   approval of the bishop. A Synod of Rouen, 1072, forbade husbands whose
   wives had taken the veil, to marry another. Wives whose husbands had
   disappeared were forbidden by the same Synod to marry until the fact of
   death was made certain. [334]

   Upon the whole, the synodical legislation on the subject of marriage
   was wise, timely, restraining, purifying, and ennobling in its effect.
   The purest and brightest chapter in the history of Pope Nicolas I. is
   his protection of injured innocence in the person of the divorced wife
   of King Lothair of Lorraine. [335]

   History is a slow but steady progress of emancipation from the chains
   which sin has forged. The institution of slavery was universal in
   Europe during the middle ages among barbarians as well as among
   civilized nations. It was kept up by natural increase, by war, and by
   the slave-trade which was carried on in Europe more or less till the
   fifteenth century, and in America till the eighteenth. Not a few
   freemen sold themselves into slavery for debt, or from poverty. The
   slaves were completely under the power of their masters, and had no
   claim beyond the satisfaction of their physical wants. They could not
   bear witness in courts of justice. They could be bought and sold with
   their children like other property. The marriage tie was disregarded,
   and marriages between freemen and slaves were null and void. In the
   course of time slavery was moderated into serfdom, which was attached
   to the soil. Small farmers often preferred that condition to freedom,
   as it secured them the protection of a powerful nobleman against
   robbers and invaders. The condition of the serfs, however, during the
   middle ages was little better than that of slaves, and gave rise to
   occasional outbursts in the Peasant Wars, which occurred mostly in
   connection with the free preaching of the Gospel (as by Wiclif and the
   Lollards in England, and by Luther in Germany), but which were
   suppressed by force, and in their immediate effects increased the
   burdens of the dependent classes. The same struggle between capital and
   labor is still going on in different forms.

   The mediaeval church inherited the patristic views of slavery. She
   regarded it as a necessary evil, as a legal right based on moral wrong,
   as a consequence of sin and a just punishment for it. She put it in the
   same category with war, violence, pestilence, famine, and other evils.
   St. Augustin, the greatest theological authority of the Latin church,
   treats slavery as disturbance of the normal condition and relation. God
   did not, he says, establish the dominion of man over man, but only over
   the brute. He derives the word servus, as usual, from servare (to save
   the life of captives of war doomed to death), but cannot find it in the
   Bible till the time of the righteous Noah, who gave it as a punishment
   to his guilty son Ham; whence it follows that the word came "from sin,
   not from nature." He also holds that the institution will finally be
   abolished when all iniquity shall disappear, and God shall be all in
   all. [336]

   The church exerted her great moral power not so much towards the
   abolition of slavery as the amelioration and removal of the evils
   connected with it. Many provincial Synods dealt with the subject, at
   least incidentally. The legal right of holding slaves was never called
   in question, and slaveholders were in good and regular standing. Even
   convents held slaves, though in glaring inconsistency with their
   professed principle of equality and brotherhood. Pope Gregory the
   Great, one of the most humane of the popes, presented bondservants from
   his own estates to convents, and exerted all his influence to recover a
   fugitive slave of his brother. [337] A reform Synod of Pavia, over
   which Pope Benedict VIII., one of the forerunners of Hildebrand,
   presided (a.d. 1018), enacted that sons and daughters of clergymen,
   whether from free-women or slaves, whether from legal wives or
   concubines, are the property of the church, and should never be
   emancipated. [338] No pope has ever declared slavery incompatible with
   Christianity. The church was strongly conservative, and never
   encouraged a revolutionary or radical movement looking towards
   universal emancipation.

   But, on the other hand, the Christian spirit worked silently, steadily
   and irresistibly in the direction of emancipation. The church, as the
   organ of that spirit, proclaimed ideas and principles which, in their
   legitimate working, must root out ultimately both slavery and tyranny,
   and bring in a reign of freedom, love, and peace. She humbled the
   master and elevated the slave, and reminded both of their common origin
   and destiny. She enjoined in all her teaching the gentle and humane
   treatment of slaves, and enforced it by the all-powerful motives
   derived from the love of Christ, the common redemption and moral
   brotherhood of men. She opened her houses of worship as asylums to
   fugitive slaves, and surrendered them to their masters only on promise
   of pardon. [339] She protected the freedmen in the enjoyment of their
   liberty. She educated sons of slaves for the priesthood, with the
   permission of their masters, but required emancipation before
   ordination. [340] Marriages of freemen with slaves were declared valid
   if concluded with the knowledge of the condition of the latter. [341]
   Slaves could not be forced to labor on Sundays. This was a most
   important and humane protection of the right to rest and worship. [342]
   No Christian was permitted by the laws of the church to sell a slave to
   foreign lands, or to a Jew or heathen. Gregory I. prohibited the Jews
   within the papal jurisdiction to keep Christian slaves, which he
   considered an outrage upon the Christian name. Nevertheless even
   clergymen sometimes sold Christian slaves to Jews. The tenth Council of
   Toledo (656 or 657) complains of this practice, protests against it
   with Bible passages, and reminds the Christians that "the slaves were
   redeemed by the blood of Christ, and that Christians should rather buy
   than sell them." [343] Individual emancipation was constantly
   encouraged as a meritorious work of charity well pleasing to God, and
   was made a solemn act. The master led the slave with a torch around the
   altar, and with his hands on the altar pronounced the act of liberation
   in such words as these: "For fear of Almighty God, and for the care of
   my soul I liberate thee;" or: "In the name and for the love of God I do
   free this slave from the bonds of slavery."

   Occasionally a feeble voice was raised against the institution itself,
   especially from monks who were opposed to all worldly possession, and
   felt the great inconsistency of convents holding slave-property.
   Theodore of the Studium forbade his convent to do this, but on the
   ground that secular possessions and marriage were proper only for
   laymen. [344] A Synod of Chalons, held between 644 and 650, at which
   thirty-eight bishops and six episcopal representatives were present,
   prohibited the selling of Christian slaves outside of the kingdom of
   Clovis, from fear that they might fall into the power of pagans or
   Jews, and he introduces this decree with the significant words: "The
   highest piety and religion demand that Christians should be redeemed
   entirely from the bond of servitude." [345] By limiting the power of
   sale, slave-property was raised above ordinary property, and this was a
   step towards abolishing this property itself by legitimate means.

   Under the combined influences of Christianity, civilization, and
   oeconomic and political considerations, the slave trade was forbidden,
   and slavery gradually changed into serfdom, and finally abolished all
   over Europe and North America. Where the spirit of Christ is there is
   liberty.

   Notes.

   In Europe serfdom continued till the eighteenth century, in Russia even
   till 1861, when it was abolished by the Czar Alexander II. In the
   United States, the freest country in the world, strange to say, negro
   slavery flourished and waxed fat under the powerful protection of the
   federal constitution, the fugitive slave-law, the Southern state-laws,
   and "King Cotton," until it went out in blood (1861-65) at a cost far
   exceeding the most liberal compensation which Congress might and ought
   to have made for a peaceful emancipation. But passion ruled over
   reason, self-interest over justice, and politics over morals and
   religion. Slavery still lingers in nominally Christian countries of
   South America, and is kept up with the accursed slave-trade under
   Mohammedan rule in Africa, but is doomed to disappear from the bounds
   of civilization.

   § 78. Feuds and Private Wars. The Truce of God.

   A. Kluckhohn: Geschichte des Gottesfriedens. Leipzig 1857.

   Henry C. Lea: Superstition and Force. Essays on the Wager of Law--the
   Wager of Battle--the Ordeal--Torture. Phila. 1866 (407 pages).

   Among all barbarians, individual injury is at once revenged on the
   person of the enemy; and the family or tribe to which the parties
   belong identify themselves with the quarrel till the thirst for blood
   is satiated. Hence the feuds [346] and private wars, or deadly quarrels
   between families and clans. The same custom of self-help and unbridled
   passion prevails among the Mohammedan Arabs to this day.

   The influence of Christianity was to confine the responsibility for a
   crime to its author, and to substitute orderly legal process for
   summary private vengeance. The sixteenth Synod of Toledo (693) forbade
   duels and private feuds. [347] The Synod of Poitiers, a.d. 1000,
   resolved that all controversies should hereafter be adjusted by law and
   not by force. [348] The belligerent individuals or tribes were exhorted
   to reconciliation by a sealed agreement, and the party which broke the
   peace was excommunicated. A Synod of Limoges in 1031 used even the more
   terrible punishment of the interdict against the bloody feuds.

   These sporadic efforts prepared the way for one of the most benevolent
   institutions of the middle ages, the so-called "Peace" or "Truce of
   God." [349] It arose in Aquitania in France during or soon after a
   terrible famine in 1033, which increased the number of murders (even
   for the satisfaction of hunger) and inflicted untold misery upon the
   people. Then the bishops and abbots, as if moved by divine inspiration
   (hence "the Peace of God"), united in the resolution that all feuds
   should cease from Wednesday evening till Monday morning (a feriae
   quartae vespera usque ad secundam feriam, incipiente luce) on pain of
   excommunication. [350] In 1041 the archbishop Raimbald of Arles, the
   bishops Benedict of Avignon and Nitard of Nice, and the abbot Odilo of
   Clugny issued in their name and in the name of the French episcopate an
   encyclical letter to the Italian bishops and clergy, in which they
   solemnly implore them to keep the heaven-sent Treuga Dei, already
   introduced in Gaul, namely, to observe peace between neighbors, friends
   or foes on four days of the week, namely, on Thursday, on account of
   Christ's ascension, on Friday on account of his crucifixion, on
   Saturday in memory of his burial, on Sunday in memory of his
   resurrection. They add: "All who love this Treuga Dei we bless and
   absolve; but those who oppose it we anathematize and exclude from the
   church. He who punishes a disturber of the Peace of God shall be
   acquitted of guilt and blessed by all Christians as a champion of the
   cause of God."

   The peace-movement spread through all Burgundy and France, and was
   sanctioned by the Synods of Narbonne (1054), Gerundum in Spain (1068),
   Toulouse (1068), Troyes (1093), Rouen (1096), Rheims (1136), the
   Lateran (1139 and 1179), etc. The Synod of Clermont (1095), under the
   lead of Pope Urban II., made the Truce of God the general law of the
   church. The time of the Truce was extended to the whole period from the
   first of Advent to Epiphany, from Ashwednesday to the close of the
   Easter week, and from Ascension to the close of the week of Pentecost;
   also to the various festivals and their vigils. The Truce was announced
   by the ringing of bells. [351]

   Treue, and the English true troth, truce, and signifies a pledge of
   faith, given for a time to an enemy for keeping peace.

   [350] Rodull Glaber, a monk of Cluny, gives a graphic account of this
   famine and the origin of the Peace movement, in his Historia sui
   Temporis, lib. IV. c.4 and 5 (in Migne's Patrol. Tom. 142, fol.
   675-679). Hefele, IV. 698, traces the movement to Provence and to the
   year 1040 with a "perhaps," but Rodulf Glaber makes it begin "in
   Aquitaniae partibus anno incarnati Christi millesimo tricesimo tertio,"
   from whence it spread rapidly "per Arelatensem provinciam, atque
   Lugdunensem, sicque per universam Burgundiam, atque in ultimas Franciae

   was blessed by innumerable cures and a bountiful harvest. "Erat instar
   illius antiqui Mosaici magni Jubilaei." Balderich, in his Chronicle of
   the Bishops of Cambray, reports that in one of the French synods a
   bishop showed a letter which fell from heaven and exhorted to peace.
   The bishop of Cambray, however, dissented because he thought the
   resolution could not be carried out.

   especially used Lea, who gives ample authorities for his statements.)
   For synodical legislation on ordeals see Hefele, Vols. III. and IV.

   Another heathen custom with which the church had to deal, is the
   so-called Judgment of God or Ordeal, that is, a trial of guilt or
   innocence by a direct appeal to God through nature. [352] It prevailed
   in China, Japan, India, Egypt (to a less extent in Greece and Rome),
   and among the barbaric races throughout Europe. [353]

   The ordeal reverses the correct principle that a man must be held to be
   innocent until he is proved to be guilty, and throws the burden of
   proof upon the accused instead of the accuser. It is based on the
   superstitious and presumptuous belief that the divine Ruler of the
   universe will at any time work a miracle for the vindication of justice
   when man in his weakness cannot decide, and chooses to relieve himself
   of responsibility by calling heaven to his aid. In the Carlovingian
   Capitularies the following passage occurs: "Let doubtful cases be
   determined by the judgment of God. The judges may decide that which
   they clearly know, but that which they cannot know shall be reserved
   for the divine judgment. He whom God has reserved for his own judgment
   may not be condemned by human means."

   The customary ordeals in the middle ages were water-ordeals and
   fire-ordeals; the former were deemed plebeian, the latter (as well as
   the duel), patrician. The one called to mind the punishment of the
   deluge and of Pharaoh in the Red Sea; the other, the future punishment
   of hell. The water-ordeals were either by hot water, [354] or by cold
   water; [355] the fire-ordeals were either by hot iron, [356] or by pure
   fire. [357] The person accused or suspected of a crime was exposed to
   the danger of death or serious injury by one of these elements: if he
   escaped unhurt--if he plunged his arm to the elbow into boiling water,
   or walked barefoot upon heated plough-shares, or held a burning ball of
   iron in his hand, without injury, he was supposed to be declared
   innocent by a miraculous interposition of God, and discharged;
   otherwise he was punished.

   To the ordeals belongs also the judicial duel or battle ordeal. It was
   based on the old superstition that God always gives victory to the
   innocent. [358] It was usually allowed only to freemen. Aged and sick
   persons, women, children, and ecclesiastics could furnish substitutes,
   but not always. Mediaeval panegyrists trace the judicial duel back to
   Cain and Abel. It prevailed among the ancient Danes, Irish,
   Burgundians, Franks, and Lombards, but was unknown among the
   Anglo-Saxons before William the Conqueror, who introduced it into
   England. It was used also in international litigation. The custom died
   out in the sixteenth century. [359]

   The mediaeval church, with her strong belief in the miraculous, could
   not and did not generally oppose the ordeal, but she baptized it and
   made it a powerful means to enforce her authority over the ignorant and
   superstitious people she had to deal with. Several councils at Mainz in
   880, at Tribur on the Rhine in 895, at Tours in 925, at Mainz in 1065,
   at Auch in 1068, at Grau in 1099, recognized and recommended it; the
   clergy, bishops, and archbishops, as Hincmar of Rheims, and Burckhardt
   of Worms, and even popes like Gregory VII. and Calixtus II. lent it
   their influence. St. Bernard approved of the cold-water process for the
   conviction of heretics, and St. Ivo of Chartres admitted that the
   incredulity of mankind sometimes required an appeal to the verdict of
   Heaven, though such appeals were not commanded by, the law of God. As
   late as 1215 the ferocious inquisitor Conrad of Marburg freely used the
   hot iron against eighty persons in Strassburg alone who were suspected
   of the Albigensian heresy. The clergy prepared the combatants by
   fasting and prayer, and special liturgical formula; they presided over
   the trial and pronounced the sentence. Sometimes fraud was practiced,
   and bribes offered and taken to divert the course of justice. Gregory
   of Tours mentions the case of a deacon who, in a conflict with an Arian
   priest, anointed his arm before he stretched it into the boiling
   caldron; the Arian discovered the trick, charged him with using magic
   arts, and declared the trial null and void; but a Catholic priest,
   Jacintus from Ravenna, stepped forward, and by catching the ring from
   the bubbling caldron, triumphantly vindicated the orthodox faith to the
   admiring multitude, declaring that the water felt cold at the bottom
   and agreeably warm at the top. When the Arian boldly repeated the
   experiment, his flesh was boiled off the bones up to the elbow. [360]

   The Church even invented and substituted new ordeals, which were less
   painful and cruel than the old heathen forms, but shockingly profane
   according to our notions. Profanity and superstition are closely
   allied. These new methods are the ordeal of the cross, and the ordeal
   of the eucharist. They were especially used by ecclesiastics.

   The ordeal of the cross [361] is simply a trial of physical strength.
   The plaintiff and the defendant, after appropriate religious
   ceremonies, stood with uplifted arm before a cross while divine service
   was performed, and victory depended on the length of endurance. Pepin
   first prescribed this trial, by a Capitulary of 752, in cases of
   application by a wife for divorce. Charlemagne prescribed it in cases
   of territorial disputes which might arise between his sons (806). But
   Louis-le-Débonnaire, soon after the death of Charlemagne, forbade its
   continuance at a Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in 816, because this abuse
   of the cross tended to bring the Christian symbol into contempt. His
   son, the Emperor Lothair, renewed the prohibition. A trace of this
   ordeal is left in the proverbial allusion to an experimentum crucis.

   A still worse profanation was the ordeal of consecrated bread in the
   eucharist with the awful adjuration: "May this body and blood of our
   Lord Jesus Christ be a judgment to thee this day." [362] It was
   enjoined by a Synod of Worms, in 868, upon bishops and priests who were
   accused of a capital crime, such as murder, adultery, theft, sorcery.
   It was employed by Cautinus, bishop of Auvergne, at the close of the
   sixth century, who administered the sacrament to a Count Eulalius,
   accused of patricide, and acquitted him after he had partaken of it
   without harm. King Lothair and his nobles took the sacrament in proof
   of his separation from Walrada, his mistress, but died soon afterwards
   at Piacenza of a sudden epidemic, and this was regarded by Pope Hadrian
   II. as a divine punishment. Rudolfus Glaber records the case of a monk
   who boldly received the consecrated host, but forthwith confessed his
   crime when the host slipped out of his navel, white and pure as before.
   Sibicho, bishop of Speier, underwent the trial to clear himself of the
   charge of adultery (1049). Even Pope Hildebrand made use of it in
   self-defense against Emperor Henry IV. at Canossa, in 1077. "Lest I
   should seem," he said "to rely rather on human than divine testimony,
   and that I may remove from the minds of all, by immediate satisfaction,
   every scruple, behold this body of our Lord which I am about to take.
   Let it be to me this day a test of my innocence, and may the Omnipotent
   God this day by his judgment absolve me of the accusations if I am
   innocent, or let me perish by sudden death, if guilty." Then the pope
   calmly took the wafer, and called upon the trembling emperor to do the
   same, but Henry evaded it on the ground of the absence of both his
   friends and his enemies, and promised instead to submit to a trial by
   the imperial diet.

   The purgatorial oath, when administered by wonder-working relics, was
   also a kind of ordeal of ecclesiastical origin. A false oath on the
   black cross in the convent of Abington, made from the nails of the
   crucifixion, and derived from the Emperor Constantine, was fatal to the
   malefactor. In many cases these relics were the means of eliciting
   confessions which could not have been obtained by legal devices.

   The genuine spirit of Christianity, however, urged towards an abolition
   rather than improvement of all these ordeals. Occasionally such voices
   of protest were raised, though for a long time without effect. Avitus,
   bishop of Vienne, in the beginning of the sixth century, remonstrated
   with Gundobald for giving prominence to the battle-ordeal in the
   Burgundian code. St. Agobard, archbishop of Lyons, before the middle of
   the ninth century (he died about 840) attacked the duel and the ordeal
   in two special treatises, which breathe the gospel spirit of humanity,
   fraternity and peace in advance of his age. [363] He says that the
   ordeals are falsely called judgments of God; for God never prescribed
   them, never approved them, never willed them; but on the contrary, he
   commands us, in the law and the gospel, to love our neighbor as
   ourselves, and has appointed judges for the settlement of controversies
   among men. He warns against a presumptuous interpretation of providence
   whose counsels are secret and not to be revealed by water and fire.
   Several popes, Leo IV. (847-855), Nicolas I. (858-867), Stephen VI.
   (885-891), Sylvester II. (999-1003), Alexander II. (1061-1073),
   Alexander III. (1159-1181), Coelestin III. (1191-1198), Honorius III.
   (1222), and the fourth Lateran Council (1215), condemned more or less
   clearly the superstitious and frivolous provocation of miracles. [364]
   It was by their influence, aided by secular legislation, that these
   God-tempting ordeals gradually disappeared during the twelfth and
   thirteenth centuries, but the underlying idea survived in the torture
   which for a long time took the place of the ordeal.

   [352] From the Anglo-Saxon ordael or ordela (from or=ur, and
   dael=theil): German: Urtheilor Gottesurtheil; Dutch: oordeel; French:
   ordéal; L. Lat.; ordalium, ordale, ordela. See Du Cange sub. ordela,
   aquae frigidae judicium, Duellum, Ferrum candens; Skeat (Etymol. Dict.
   of the Engl. Lang.) sub. Deal.

   [353] See the proof in Lea, who finds in the wide prevalence of this
   custom a confirmation of the common origin of the Aryan or
   Indo-germanic races.

   [354] Judicium aquae ferventis, aeneum, cacabus, caldaria. This is
   probably the oldest form in Europe. See Lea, p. 196. It is usually
   referred to in the most ancient texts of law, and especially
   recommended by Hincmar of Rheims, as combining the elements of
   water--the judgment of the deluge--and of fire--the judgment of the
   last day. The accused was obliged, with his naked arm, to find a small
   stone or ring in a boiling caldron of water (this was called in German
   the Kesselfang), or simply to throw the hand to the wrist or to the
   elbow into boiling water. See Lea, p. 196 sqq.

   [355] Judicium aquae frigidae. It was not known in Europe before Pope
   Eugenius II. (824-827), who seems to have introduced it. The accused
   was bound with cords, and lowered with a rope into a reservoir or pond,
   with the prayer (St., Dunstan's formula): "Let not the water receive
   the body of him who, released from the weight of goodness, is upborne
   by the wind of iniquity." It was supposed that the pure element would
   not receive a criminal into its bosom. It required therefore in this
   case a miracle to convict the accused, as in the natural order of
   things he would escape. Lea (p. 221) relates this instance from a MS.
   in the British Museum In 1083, during the deadly struggle between the
   Empire and the Papacy, as personified in Henry IV. and Hildebrand, the
   imperialists related with great delight that some of the leading
   prelates of the papal court submitted the cause of their chief to this
   ordeal. After a three days' fast, and proper benediction of the water,
   they placed in it a boy to represent the Emperor, when to their horror
   he sank like a stone. On referring the result to Hildebrand, he ordered
   a repetition of the experiment, which was attended with the same
   result. Then, throwing him in, as a representative of the Pope, he
   obstinately floated during two trials, in spite of all efforts to force
   him under the surface, and an oath was exacted from them to maintain
   inviolable secrecy as to the unexpected result." James I. of England
   was a strict believer in this ordeal, and thought that the pure element
   would never receive those who had desecrated the privileges of holy
   baptism. Even as late as 1836, an old woman, reputed to be a witch, was
   twice plunged into the sea at Hela, near Danzig, and as she persisted
   in rising to the surface, she was pronounced guilty and beaten to
   death. See Lea, p. 228 and 229.

   [356] Judicium ferri or ferri candentis. A favorite mode, administered
   in two different forms, the one by six or twelve red-hot plough-shares
   (vomeres igniti), over which the person had to walk bare-footed; the
   other by a piece of red-hot iron, which he had to carry for a distance
   of nine feet or more. See Lea, p. 201 sq.

   [357] The accused had to stretch his hand into a fire; hence the French
   proverbial expression: "J'en mettrais la main au feu," as an
   affirmation of positive belief. Sometimes he had to walk bare-legged
   and bare-footed through the flames of huge pyres. Petrus Igneus gained
   his reputation and surname by an exploit of this kind. See examples in
   Lea, p. 209 sqq. Savonarola proposed this ordeal in 1498 to his enemies
   in proof of his assertion that the church needed a thorough
   reformation, and that his excommunication by Pope Alexander VI. was
   null and void, but he shrunk from the trial, lost his cause, and was
   hanged and burned after undergoing frightful tortures. He had not the
   courage of Hus at Constance, or Luther at Worms, and his attempted
   reformation left nothing but a tragic memory.

   [358] Tacitus (German, cap. 7) reports of the heathen Germans: "[Deum]
   adesse, bellantibus credunt."

   [359] See Lea, p. 75-174. The wager of battle, as a judicial
   institution, must not be confounded with the private duel which has
   been more or less customary among all races and in all ages, and still
   survives as a relic of barbarism, though misnamed "the satisfaction of
   a gentleman." The judicial duel aims at the discovery of truth and the
   impartial administration of justice, while the object of the private
   duel is personal vengeance and reparation of honor.

   child was drowned in the neighborhood. Lea, p. 231.

   Nothing can be more peremptory than the prohibition uttered by
   Alexander III. In 1181, Lucius III. pronounced null and void the
   acquittal of a priest charged with homicide, who had undergone the
   water-ordeal, and ordered him to prove his innocence with compurgators,
   and the blow was followed up by his successors. Under Innocent III.,
   the Fourth Council of Lateran, in 1215, formally forbade the employment
   of any ecclesiastical ceremonies in such trials; and as the moral
   influence of the ordeal depended entirely upon its religious
   associations, a strict observance of this canon must speedily have
   swept the whole system into oblivion. Yet at this very time the
   inquisitor Conrad of Marburg was employing in Germany the red-hot iron
   as a means of condemning his unfortunate victims by wholesale, and the
   chronicler relates that, whether innocent or guilty, few escaped the
   test. The canon of Lateran, however, was actively followed up by the
   Papal legates, and the effect was soon discernible." Lea, p. 272.

   The torture rests on the same idea as the ordeal. [365] It is an
   attempt to prove innocence or guilt by imposing a physical pain which
   no man can bear without special aid from God. When the ordeal had
   fulfilled its mission, the torture was substituted as a more convenient
   mode and better fitted for an age less superstitious and more
   sceptical, but quite as despotic and intolerant. It forms one of the
   darkest chapters in history. For centuries this atrocious system,
   opposed to the Mosaic legislation and utterly revolting to every
   Christian and humane feeling, was employed in civilized Christian
   countries, and sacrificed thousands of human beings, innocent as well
   as guilty, to torments worse than death.

   The torture was unknown among the Hindoos and the Semitic nations, but
   recognized by the ancient Greeks and Romans, as a regular legal
   proceeding. It was originally confined to slaves who were deemed unfit
   to bear voluntary testimony, and to require force to tell the truth.
   [366] Despotic emperors extended it to freemen, first in cases of
   crimen laesae majestatis. Pontius Pilate employed the scourge and the
   crown of thorns in the trial of our Saviour. Tiberius exhausted his
   ingenuity in inventing tortures for persons suspected of conspiracy,
   and took delight in their agony. The half-insane Caligula enjoyed the
   cruel spectacle at his dinner-table. Nero resorted to this cruelty to
   extort from the Christians the confession of the crime of incendiarism,
   as a pretext of his persecution, which he intensified by the diabolical
   invention of covering the innocent victims with pitch and burning them
   as torches in his gardens. The younger Pliny employed the torture
   against the Christians in Bithynia as imperial governor. Diocletian, in
   a formal edict, submitted all professors of the hated religion to this
   degrading test. The torture was gradually developed into a regular
   system and embodied in the Justinian Code. Certain rules were
   prescribed, and exemptions made in favor of the learned professions,
   especially the clergy, nobles, children below fourteen, women during
   pregnancy, etc. The system was thus sanctioned by the highest legal
   authorities. But opinions as to its efficiency differed. Augustus
   pronounced the torture the best form of proof. Cicero alternately
   praises and discredits it. Ulpian, with more wisdom, thought it unsafe,
   dangerous, and deceitful.

   Among the Northern barbarians the torture was at first unknown except
   for slaves. The common law of England does not recognize it. Crimes
   were regarded only as injuries to individuals, not to society, and the
   chief resource for punishment was the private vengeance of the injured
   party. But if a slave, who was a mere piece of property, was suspected
   of a theft, his master would flog him till he confessed. All doubtful
   questions among freemen were decided by sacramental purgation and the
   various forms of ordeal. But in Southern Europe, where the Roman
   population gave laws to the conquering barbarians, the old practice
   continued, or revived with the study of the Roman law. In Southern
   France and in Spain the torture was an unbroken ancestral custom.
   Alfonso the Wise, in the thirteenth century, in his revision of Spanish
   jurisprudence, known as Las Siete Partidas, retained the torture, but
   declared the person of man to be the noblest thing on earth, [367] and
   required a voluntary confession to make the forced confession valid.
   Consequently the prisoner after torture was brought before the judge
   and again interrogated; if be recanted, he was tortured a second, in
   grave cases, a third time; if he persisted in his confession, he was
   condemned. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the system of
   torture, was generally introduced in Europe, and took the place of the
   ordeal.

   The church, true to her humanizing instincts, was at first hostile to
   the whole system of forcing evidence. A Synod of Auxerre (585 or 578)
   prohibited the clergy to witness a torture. [368] Pope Gregory I.
   denounced as worthless a confession extorted by incarceration and
   hunger. [369] Nicolas I. forbade the new converts in Bulgaria to extort
   confession by stripes and by pricking with a pointed iron, as contrary
   to all law, human and divine (866) [370] Gratian lays down the general
   rule that "confessio cruciatibus extorquenda non est."

   But at a later period, in dealing with heretics, the Roman church
   unfortunately gave the sanction of her highest authority to the use of
   the torture, and thus betrayed her noblest instincts and holiest
   mission. The fourth Lateran Council (1215) inspired the horrible
   crusades against the Albigenses and Waldenses, and the establishment of
   the infamous ecclesiastico-political courts of Inquisition. These
   courts found the torture the most effective means of punishing and
   exterminating heresy, and invented new forms of refined cruelty worse
   than those of the persecutors of heathen Rome. Pope Innocent IV., in
   his instruction for the guidance of the Inquisition in Tuscany and
   Lombardy, ordered the civil magistrates to extort from all heretics by
   torture a confession of their own guilt and a betrayal of all their
   accomplices (1252). [371] This was an ominous precedent, which did more
   harm to the reputation of the papacy than the extermination of any
   number of heretics could possibly do it good. In Italy, owing to the
   restriction of the ecclesiastical power by the emperor, the inquisition
   could not fully display its murderous character. In Germany its
   introduction was resisted by the people and the bishops, and Conrad of
   Marburg, the appointed Inquisitor, was murdered (1233). But in Spain it
   had every assistance from the crown and the people, which to this day
   take delight in the bloody spectacles of bullfights. The Spanish
   Inquisition was established in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella by
   papal sanction (1478), reached its fearful height under the terrible
   General Inquisitor Torquemada (since 1483), and in its zeal to
   exterminate Moors, Jews, and heretics, committed such fearful excesses
   that even popes protested against the abuse of power, although with
   little effect. The Inquisition carried the system of torture to its
   utmost limits. After the Reformation it was still employed in trials of
   sorcery and witchcraft until the revolution of opinion in the
   eighteenth century swept it out of existence, together with cruel forms
   of punishment. This victory is due to the combined influence of
   justice, humanity, and tolerance.

   Notes.

   I. "The whole system of the Inquisition," says Lea (p. 331), "was such
   as to render the resort to torture inevitable. Its proceedings were
   secret; the prisoner was carefully kept in ignorance of the exact
   charges against him, and of the evidence upon which they were based. He
   was presumed to be guilty, and his judges bent all their energies to
   force him to confess. To accomplish this, no means were too base or too
   cruel. Pretended sympathizers were to be let into his dungeon, whose
   affected friendship might entrap him into an unwary admission;
   officials armed with fictitious evidence were directed to frighten him
   with assertions of the testimony obtained against him from
   supposititious witnesses; and no resources of fraud or guile were to be
   spared in overcoming the caution and resolution of the poor wretch
   whose mind had been carefully weakened by solitude, suffering, hunger,
   and terror. From this to the rack and estrapade the step was easily
   taken, and was not long delayed." For details see the works on the
   Inquisition. Llorente (Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne IV. 252,
   quoted by Gieseler III. 409 note 11) states that from 1478 to the end
   of the administration of Torquemada in 1498, when he resigned, "8800
   persons were burned alive, 6500 in effigy, and 90,004 punished with
   different kinds of penance. Under the second general-inquisitor, the
   Dominican, Diego Deza, from 1499 to 1506, 1664 persons were burned
   alive, 832 in effigy, 32,456 punished. Under the third
   general-inquisitor, the Cardinal and Archbishop of Toledo, Francis
   Ximenes de Cisneros, from 1507 to 1517, 2536 were burned alive, 1368 in
   effigy, 47,263 reconciled." Llorente was a Spanish priest and general
   secretary of the Inquisition at Madrid (from 1789-1791), and had access
   to all the archives, but his figures, as he himself admits, are based
   upon probable calculations, and have in some instances been disproved.
   He states, e.g. that in the first year of Torquemada's administration
   2000 persons were burned, and refers to the Jesuit Mariana (History of
   Spain), but Mariana means that during the whole administration of
   Torquemada "duo millia crematos igne." See Hefele, Cardinal Ximenes, p.
   346. The sum total of persons condemned to death by the Spanish
   Inquisition during the 330 years of its existence, is stated to be
   30,000. Hefele (Kirchenlexikon, v. 656) thinks this sum exaggerated,
   yet not surprising when compared with the number of witches that were
   burnt in Germany alone. The Spanish Inquisition pronounced its last
   sentence of death in the year 1781, was abolished under the French rule
   of Joseph Napoleon, Dec. 4, 1808, restored by Ferdinand VII. 1814,
   again abolished 1820, and (after another attempt to restore it) in
   1834. Catholic writers, like Balmez (I.c. chs. xxxvi. and xxxvii.) and
   Hefele (Cardinal Ximenes, p. 257-389, and in Wetzer and Welte's
   Kirchen-Lexicon, vol. V. 648-659), charge Llorente with inaccuracy in
   his figures, and defend the Catholic church against the excesses of the
   Spanish Inquisition, as this was a political rather than ecclesiastical
   institution, and had at least the good effect of preventing religious
   wars. But the Inquisition was instituted with the express sanction of
   Pope Sixtus IV. (Nov. 1, 1478), was controlled by the Dominican order
   and by Cardinals, and as to the benefit, the peace of the grave-yard is
   worse than war. Hefele adds, however (V. 657): "Nach all' diesen
   Bemerkungen sind wir öbrigens weit entfernt, der Spanichen Inquisition
   an sich das Wort reden zu wollen, vielmehr bestreiten wir der
   weltlichen Gewalt durchaus die Befugniss, das Gewissen zu knebeln, und
   sind von Herzensgrund aus jedem staatlichen Religionszwang abhold, mag
   er von einem Torquemada in der Dominikanerkutte, oder von einem
   Bureaucraten in der Staatsuniform ansgehen. Aber das wollten wir
   zeigen, dass die Inquisition das schaendliche Ungeheuer nicht war, wozu
   es Parteileidenschaft und Unwissenheit häufig stempeln wollten."

   II. The torture was abolished in England after 1640, in Prussia 1740,
   in Tuscany 1786, in France 1789, in Russia 1801, in various German
   states partly earlier, partly later (between 1740 and 1831), in Japan
   1873. Thomasius, Hommel, Voltaire, Howard, used their influence against
   it. Exceptional cases of judicial torture occurred in the nineteenth
   century in Naples, Palermo, Roumania (1868), and Zug (1869). See Lea,
   p. 389 sqq., and the chapter on Witchcraft in Lecky's History of
   Rationalism (vol. I. 27-154). The extreme difficulty of proof in trials
   of witchcraft seemed to make a resort to the torture inevitable.
   English witchcraft reached its climax during the seventeenth century,
   and was defended by King James I., and even such wise men as Sir
   Matthew Hale, Sir Thomas Browne, and Richard Baxter. When it was on the
   decline in England it broke out afresh in Puritan New England, created
   a perfect panic, and led to the execution of twenty-seven persons. In
   Scotland it lingered still longer, and as late as 1727 a woman was
   burnt there for witchcraft. In the Canton Glarus a witch was executed
   in 1782, and another near Danzig in Prussia in 1836. Lecky concludes
   his chapter with an eloquent tribute to those poor women, who died
   alone, hated, and unpitied, with the prospect of exchanging their
   torments on earth with eternal torments in hell.

   I add a noble passage on torture from Brace's Gesta Christi, p. 274 sq.
   "Had the 'Son of Man' been in body upon the earth during the Middle
   Ages, hardly one wrong and injustice would have wounded his pure soul
   like the system of torture. To see human beings, with the consciousness
   of innocence, or professing and believing the purest truths, condemned
   without proof to the most harrowing agonies, every groan or admission
   under pain used against them, their confessions distorted, their nerves
   so racked that they pleaded their guilt in order to end their tortures,
   their last hours tormented by false ministers of justice or religion,
   who threaten eternal as well as temporal damnation, and all this going
   on for ages, until scarce any innocent felt themselves safe under this
   mockery of justice and religion--all this would have seemed to the
   Founder of Christianity as the worst travesty of his faith and the most
   cruel wound to humanity. It need not be repeated that his spirit in
   each century struggled with this tremendous evil, and inspired the
   great friends of humanity who labored against it. The main forces in
   mediaeval society, even those which tended towards its improvement, did
   not touch this abuse. Roman law supported it. Stoicism was indifferent
   to it; Greek literature did not affect it; feudalism and arbitrary
   power encouraged a practice which they could use for their own ends;
   and even the hierarchy and a State Church so far forgot the truths they
   professed as to employ torture to support the 'Religion of Love.' But
   against all these powers were the words of Jesus, bidding men 'Love
   your enemies' 'Do good to them that despitefully use you!' and the like
   commands. working everywhere on individual souls, heard from pulpits
   and in monasteries, read over by humble believers, and slowly making
   their way against barbaric passion and hierarchic cruelty. Gradually,
   in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the books containing the
   message of Jesus circulated among all classes, and produced that state
   of mind and heart in which torture could not be used on a fellow-being,
   and in which such an abuse and enormity as the Inquisition was hurled
   to the earth."

   [366] "Their evidence was inadmissible, except when given under
   torture, and then by a singular confusion of logic, it was estimated as
   the most convincing kind of testimony." Lea, 283. "The modes of torture
   sanctioned by the Greeks were the wheel (trochos), the ladder or rack
   (klimax), the comb with sharp teeth (kuaphos), the low vault (kuphon)
   in which the unfortunate witness was thrust and bent double, the
   burning tiles (plinthoi) the heavy hog-skin whip (hustrichis), and the
   injection of vinegar into the nostrils." Lea, p. 284. The Romans used
   chiefly the scourge. The instruments of torture employed during the
   middle ages were the rack, the thumbscrew, the Spanish boot, iron
   gauntlets, heated iron stools, fire, the wheel, the strappado, enforced
   sleeplessness, and various mutilations. Brace says (p. 182) that " nine
   hundred(?) different instruments for inflicting pain were invented and
   used." One tenth of the number would be bad enough. Collections of
   these devilish instruments may be seen in the London Tower, and in
   antiquarian museums on the Continent.

   From the cruelties of superstition and bigotry we gladly turn to the
   queen of Christian graces, that "most excellent gift of charity," which
   never ceased to be exercised wherever the story of Christ's love for
   sinners was told and his golden rule repeated. It is a "bond of'
   perfectness" that binds together all ages and sections of Christendom.
   It comforted the Roman empire in its hoary age and agonies of death;
   and it tamed the ferocity of the barbarian invaders. It is impossible
   to overestimate the moral effect of the teaching and example of Christ,
   and of St. Paul's seraphic praise of charity upon the development of
   this cardinal virtue in all ages and countries. We bow with reverence
   before the truly apostolic succession of those missionaries, bishops,
   monks, nuns, kings, nobles, and plain men and women, rich or poor,
   known and unknown, who, from gratitude to Christ and pure love to their
   fellow-men, sacrificed home, health, wealth, life itself, to humanize
   and Christianize savages, to feed the hungry, to give drink to the
   thirsty, to entertain the stranger, to clothe the naked, to visit the
   sick, to call on the prisoner, to comfort the dying. We admire and
   honor also those exceptional saints who, in literal fulfillment or
   misunderstanding of the Saviour's advice to the rich youth, and in
   imitation of the first disciples at Jerusalem, sold all their
   possessions and gave them to the poor that they might become perfect.
   The admiration is indeed diminished, but not destroyed, if in many
   cases a large measure of refined selfishness was mixed with
   self-denial, and when the riches of heaven were the sole or chief
   inducement for choosing voluntary poverty on earth.

   The supreme duty of Christian charity was inculcated by all faithful
   pastors and teachers of the gospel from the beginning. In the apostolic
   and ante-Nicene ages it was exercised by regular contributions on the
   Lord's day, and especially at the communion and the agape connected
   with it. Every congregation was a charitable society, and took care of
   its widows and orphans, of strangers and prisoners, and sent help to
   distant congregations in need. [372]

   After Constantine, when the masses of the people flocked into the
   church, charity assumed an institutional form, and built hospitals and
   houses of refuge for the strangers, the poor, the sick, the aged, the
   orphans. [373] They appear first in the East, but soon afterwards also
   in the West. Fabiola founded a hospital in Rome, Pammachius one in the
   Portus Romanus, Paulinus one in Nola. At the time of Gregory I. there
   were several hospitals in Rome; he mentions also hospitals in Naples,
   Sicily, and Sardinia. These institutions were necessary in the greatly
   enlarged sphere of the church, and the increase of poverty, distress,
   and disaster which at last overwhelmed the Roman empire. They may in
   many cases have served purposes of ostentation, superseded or excused
   private charity, encouraged idleness, and thus increased rather than
   diminished pauperism. But these were abuses to which the best human
   institutions are subject.

   Private charity continued to be exercised in proportion to the degree
   of vitality in the church. The great fathers and bishops of the fourth
   and fifth centuries set an illustrious example of plain living and high
   thinking, of self-denial and liberality, and were never weary in their
   sermons and writings in enjoining the duty of charity. St. Basil
   himself superintended his extensive hospital at Caesarea, and did not
   shrink from contact with lepers; St. Gregory Nazianzen exhorted the
   brethren to be "a god to the unfortunate by imitating the mercy of
   God," for there is "nothing so divine as beneficence;" St. Chrysostom
   founded several hospitals in Constantinople, incessantly appealed to
   the rich in behalf of the poor, and directed the boundless charities of
   the noble widow Olympias. St. Ambrose, at once a proud Roman and an
   humble Christian, comforted the paupers in Milan, while he rebuked an
   emperor for his cruelty; Paulinus of Nola lived in a small house with
   his wife, Theresiâ and used his princely wealth for the building of a
   monastery, the relief of the needy, the ransoming of prisoners, and
   when his means were exhausted, he exchanged himself with the son of a
   widow to be carried away into Africa; the great Augustin declined to
   accept as a present a better coat than he might give in turn to a
   brother in need; St. Jerome founded a hospice in Bethlehem from the
   proceeds of his property, and induced Roman ladies of proud ancestry to
   sell their jewels, silk dresses, and palaces, for the poor, and to
   exchange a life of luxurious ease for a life of ascetic self-denial.
   Those examples shone like brilliant stars through the darkness of the
   middle ages.

   But the same fathers, it must be added, handed to the middle ages also
   the disturbing doctrine of the meritorious nature and atoning efficacy
   of charity, as "covering a multitude of sins," and its influence even
   upon the dead in purgatory. These errors greatly stimulated and largely
   vitiated that virtue, and do it to this day. [374]

   The Latin word caritas, which originally denotes dearness or costliness
   (from carus, dear), then esteem, affection, assumed in the church the
   more significant meaning of benevolence and beneficence, or love in
   active exercise, especially to the poor and suffering among our
   fellow-men. The sentiment and the deed must not be separated, and the
   gift of the hand derives its value from the love of the heart. Though
   the gifts are unequal, the benevolent love should be the same, and the
   widow's mite is as much blessed by God as the princely donation of the
   rich. Ambrose compares benevolence in the intercourse of men with men
   to the sun in its relation to the earth. "Let the gifts of the
   wealthy," says another father, "be more abundant, but let not the poor
   be behind him in love." Very often, however, charity was contracted
   into mere almsgiving. Praying, fasting, and almsgiving were regarded
   (as also among the Jews and Mohammedans) as the chief works of piety;
   the last was put highest. For the sake of charity it is right to break
   the fast or to interrupt devotion.

   Pope Gregory the Great best represents the mediaeval charity with its
   ascetic self-denial, its pious superstitions and utilitarian
   ingredients. He lived in that miserable transition period when the old
   Roman civilization was crumbling to pieces and the new civilization was
   not yet built up on its ruins. "We see nothing but sorrow," he says,
   "we hear nothing but complaints. Ah, Rome! once the mistress of the
   world, where is the senate? where the people? The buildings are in
   ruins, the walls are falling. Everywhere the sword! Everywhere death! I
   am weary of life! "But charity remained as an angel of comfort. It
   could not prevent the general collapse, but it dried the tears and
   soothed the sorrows of individuals. Gregory was a father to the poor.
   He distributed every month cart-loads of corn, oil, wine, and meat
   among them. What the Roman emperors did from policy to keep down
   insurrection, this pope did from love to Christ and the poor. He felt
   personally guilty when a man died of starvation in Rome. He set careful
   and conscientious men over the Roman hospitals, and required them to
   submit regular accounts of the management of funds. He furnished the
   means for the founding of a Xenodochium in Jerusalem. He was the chief
   promoter of the custom of dividing the income of the church into four
   equal parts, one for the bishop, one for the rest of the clergy, one
   for the church buildings, one for the poor. At the same time he was a
   strong believer in the meritorious efficacy of almsgiving for the
   living and the dead. He popularized Augustin's notion of purgatory,
   supported it by monkish fables, and introduced masses for the departed
   (without the so-called thirties, i.e. thirty days after death). He held
   that God remits the guilt and eternal punishment, but not the temporal
   punishment of sin, which must be atoned for in this life, or in
   purgatory. Thus be explained the passage about the fire (1 Cor. 3:11)
   which consumes wood, hay, and stubble, i.e. light and trifling sins
   such as useless talk, immoderate laughter, mismanagement of property.
   Hence, the more alms the better, both for our own salvation and for the
   relief of our departed relatives and friends. Almsgiving is the wing of
   repentance, and paves the way to heaven. This idea ruled supreme during
   the middle ages.

   Among the barbarians in the West charitable institutions were
   introduced by missionaries in connection with convents, which were
   expected to exercise hospitality to strangers and give help to the
   poor. The Irish missionaries cared for the bodies as well as for the
   souls of the heathen to whom they preached the gospel, and founded
   "Hospitalia Scotorum." The Council of Orleans, 549, shows acquaintance
   with Xenodochia in the towns. There was a large one at Lyons.
   Chrodegang of Metz and Alcuin exhort the bishops to found institutions
   of charity, or at least to keep a guest-room for the care of the sick
   and the stranger. A Synod at Aix in 815 ordered that an infirmary
   should be built near the church and in every convent. The Capitularies
   of Charlemagne extend to charitable institutions the same privileges as
   to churches and monasteries, and order that "strangers, pilgrims, and
   paupers" be duly entertained according to the canons.

   The hospitals were under the immediate supervision of the bishop or a
   superintendent appointed by him. They were usually dedicated to the
   Holy Spirit, who was represented in the form of a dove in some
   conspicuous place of the building. They received donations and
   legacies, and were made the trustees of landed estates. The church of
   the middle ages was the largest property-holder, but her very wealth
   and prosperity became a source of temptation and corruption, which in
   the course of time loudly called for a reformation.

   After we have made all reasonable deduction for a large amount of
   selfish charity which looked to the donor rather than the recipient,
   and for an injudicious profusion of alms which encouraged pauperism
   instead of enabling the poor to help themselves by honest work, we
   still have left one of the noblest chapters in the history of morals to
   which no other religion can furnish a parallel. For the regular
   gratuitous distribution of grain to the poor heathen of Rome, who under
   Augustus rose to 200,000, and under the Antonines to 500,000, was made
   from the public treasury and dictated by selfish motives of state
   policy; it called forth no gratitude; it failed of its object, and
   proved, together with slavery and the gladiatorial shows for the
   amusement of the people, one of the chief demoralizing influences of
   the empire. [375]

   Finally, we must not forget that the history of true Christian charity
   remains to a large part unwritten. Its power is indeed felt everywhere
   and every day; but it loves to do its work silently without a thought
   of the merit of reward. It follows human misery into all its lonely
   griefs with personal sympathy as well as material aid, and finds its
   own happiness in promoting the happiness of others. There is luxury in
   doing good for its own sake. "When thou doest alms," says the Lord,
   "let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms
   may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward
   thee." [376]

   Notes.

   Uhlhorn closes his first work with this judgment of mediaeval charity
   (p. 396 sq. of the English translation): "No period has done so much
   for the poor as the middle ages. What wholesale distribution of alms,
   what an abundance of institutions of the most various kinds, what
   numbers of hospitals for all manner of sufferers, what a series of
   ministrant orders, male and female, knightly and civil, what
   self-sacrifice and devotedness! In the mediaeval period all that we
   have observed germinating in the ancient Church, first attains its
   maturity. The middle ages, however, also appropriated whatever
   tendencies existed toward a one-sided and unsound development. Church
   care of the poor entirely perished, and all charity became
   institutional; monks and nuns, or members of the ministrant orders,
   took the place of the deacons--the diaconate died out. Charity became
   one-sidedly institutional and one-sidedly ecclesiastical. The church
   was the mediatrix of every exercise of charity, she became in fact the
   sole recipient, the sole bestower; for the main object of every work of
   mercy, of every distribution of alms, of every endowment, of all
   self-sacrifice in the service of the needy, was the giver's own
   salvation. The transformation was complete. Men gave and ministered no
   longer for the sake of helping and serving the poor in Christ, but to
   obtain for themselves and theirs, merit, release from purgatory, a high
   degree of eternal happiness. The consequence was, that poverty was not
   contended with, but fostered, and beggary brought to maturity; so that
   notwithstanding the abundant donations, the various foundations, the
   well-endowed institutions, distress was after all not mastered. Nor is
   it mastered yet. "The poor ye have always with you" (John 12:8).
   Riggenbach (l.c.) maintains that in the middle ages hospitals were mere
   provision-houses (Versorgungshäuser), and that the Reformation first
   asserted the principle that they should be also houses of moral reform
   (Rettungshäuser and Heilanstalten).

   Lecky, who devotes a part of the fourth chapter of his impartial
   humanitarian History of European Morals to this subject, comes to the
   following conclusion (II. 79, 85): "Christianity for the first time
   made charity a rudimentary virtue, giving it a leading place in the
   moral type, and in the exhortations of its teachers. Besides its
   general influence in stimulating the affections, it effected a complete
   revolution in this sphere, by regarding the poor as the special
   representatives of the Christian Founder, and thus making the love of
   Christ, rather than the love of man, the principle of charity .... The
   greatest things are often those which are most imperfectly realized;
   and surely no achievements of the Christian Church are more truly great
   than those which it has effected in the sphere of charity. For the
   first time in the history of mankind, it has inspired many thousands of
   men and women, at the sacrifice of all worldly interests, and often
   under circumstances of extreme discomfort or danger, to devote their
   entire lives to the single object of assuaging the sufferings of
   humanity. It has covered the globe with countless institutions of
   mercy, absolutely unknown to the whole Pagan world. It has indissolubly
   united, in the minds of men, the idea of supreme goodness with that of
   active and constant benevolence. It has placed in every parish a
   religious minister who, whatever may be his other functions, has at
   least been officially charged with the superintendence of an
   organization of charity, and who finds in this office one of the most
   important as well as one of the most legitimate sources of his power."

   [373] They are called Xenodochium and Xenodochia (xenodocheion) for
   strangers; ptochium or ptochotrophium (ptocheion, ptochotropheion) for
   the poor; orphanotrophium (orphanothropheion) for orphans;
   brephotrophium (brephotropheion) for foundlings house for the sick
   (nosokomeia, valetudinaria); for the aged (gerontokomeia); and for
   widows (cherotropheia); in Latin hospitium, hospitals, hospitalium
   (corresponding to the Greek xenodocheion). See Du Cange. Such
   institutions were unknown among the heathen; for the houses near the
   temples of Aeculapius were only intended for temporary shelter, not for
   care and attendance. The Emperor Julian's involuntary eulogy of the
   charity of the "Galilaeans " as he contemptuously called the
   Christians, and his abortive attempt to force the heathen to imitate
   it, are well known. See vol. III. 50.

   [374] See the numerous quotations from the fathers in Uhlhorn, p. 278
   sqq. "Countless times is the thought expressed that almsgiving is a
   safe investment of money at good interest with God in heaven." He
   thinks that "the doctrine of purgatory, and of the influence which
   almsgiving exercises even upon souls in purgatory, determined more than
   anything else the charity of the entire mediaeval period" (p. 287). The
   notion that alms have an atoning efficacy is expressed again and again
   in every variety of form as the motive of almsgiving which is
   predominant above all others. Even Augustin, the most evangelical among
   the fathers, teaches "that alms have power to extinguish and expiate
   sin," although he qualifies the maxim and confines the benefit to those
   who amend their lives. No one had greater influence upon the Latin
   church than the author of the City of God, in which, as Uhlhorn says,
   "he unconsciously wrote the programme of the middle ages."

   [375] "There can be," says Lecky, (II. 78), "no question that either in
   practice nor in theory, neither in the institution, that were founded
   nor in the place that was assigned to it in the scale of duties, did
   charity in antiquity occupy a position at all comparable to that which
   it has obtained by Christianity. Nearly all the relief was a State
   measure, dictated much more by policy than by benevolence; and the
   habit of selling young children, the innumerable expositions, the
   readiness of the poor to enroll themselves as gladiators, and the
   frequent famines, show how large was the measure of unrelieved
   distress. A very few pagan examples of charity have, indeed, descended
   to us."

   best MSS. and critical editions, and in the E. Revision.

   CHAPTER VII.

   MONASTICISM.

   See the Lit. on Monasticism in vol. II. 387, and III. 147 sq.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 82. Use of Convents in the Middle Ages.

   The monks were the spiritual nobility of the church, and represented a
   higher type of virtue in entire separation from the world and
   consecration to the kingdom of God. The patristic, ideal of piety
   passed over into the middle ages; it is not the scriptural nor the
   modern ideal, but one formed in striking contrast with preceding and
   surrounding heathen corruption. The monkish sanctity is a flight from
   the world rather than a victory over the world, an abstinence from
   marriage instead of a sanctification of marriage, chastity, outside
   rather than inside the order of nature, a complete suppression of the
   sensual passion in the place of its purification and control. But it
   had a powerful influence over the barbaric races, and was one of the
   chief converting and civilizing agencies. The Eastern monks lost
   themselves in idle contemplation and ascetic extravagances, which the
   Western climate made impossible; the Western monks were, upon the
   whole, more sober, practical, and useful. The Irish and Scotch convents
   became famous for their missionary zeal, and furnished founders of
   churches and patron saints of the people.

   Convents were planted by the missionaries among all the barbarous
   nations of Europe, as fast as Christianity progressed. They received
   special privileges and endowments from princes, nobles, popes, and
   bishops. They offered a quiet retreat to men and women who were weary
   of the turmoil of life, or had suffered shipwreck of fortune or
   character, and cared for nothing but to save their souls. They
   exercised hospitality to strangers and travelers, and were a great
   blessing in times when traveling was difficult and dangerous. [377]
   They were training schools of ascetic virtue, and the nurseries of
   saints. They saved the remnants of ancient civilization for future use.
   Every large convent had a library and a school. Scribes were employed
   in copying manuscripts of the ancient classics, of the Bible, and the
   writings of the fathers. To these quiet literary monks we are indebted
   for the preservation and transmission of nearly all the learning,
   sacred and secular, of ancient times. If they had done nothing else,
   they would be entitled to the lasting gratitude of the church and the
   world.

   During the wild commotion and confusion of the ninth and tenth
   centuries, monastic discipline went into decay. Often the very richs of
   convents, which were the reward of industry and virtue, became a snare
   and a root of evil. Avaricious laymen (Abba-comites) seized the control
   and perpetuated it in their families. Even princesses received the
   titles and emoluments of abbesses.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [377] As they are still in the East and on the Alps. Travelers will not
   easily forget the convents of Mt. Sinai in the Desert, Mar Saba near
   the Dead Sea, and the hospices on the Alpine passes of St. Bernard, St.
   Gotthard, and the Simplon. Lecky (II. 84) says: "By the monks the
   nobles were overawed, the poor protected, the sick tended, travelers
   sheltered, prisoners ransomed, the remotest spheres of suffering
   explored. During the darkest period of the middle ages, monks founded a
   refuge for pilgrims amid the horrors of the Alpine snows. A solitary
   hermit often planted himself, with his little boat, by a bridgeless
   stream, and the charity of his life was to ferry over the traveler."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 83. St. Benedict. St. Nilus. St. Romuald.

   Yet even in this dark period there were a few shining lights.

   St. Benedict of Aniane (750-821), of a distinguished family in the
   south of France, after serving at the court of Charlemagne, became
   disgusted with the world, entered a convent, founded a new one at
   Aniane after the strict rule of St. Benedict of Nursia, collected a
   library, exercised charity, especially during a famine, labored for the
   reform of monasticism, was entrusted by Louis the Pious with the
   superintendence of all the convents in Western France, and formed them
   into a "congregation," by bringing them under one rule. He attended the
   Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle in 817. Soon after his death (Feb. 12, 821)
   the fruits of his labors were destroyed, and the disorder became worse
   than before. [378]

   St. Nilus the younger, [379] of Greek descent, born at Rossano in
   Calabria [380] (hence Nilus Rossanensis), enlightened the darkness of
   the tenth century. He devoted himself, after the death of his wife,
   about 940, to a solitary life, following the model of St. Anthony and
   St. Hilarion, and founded several convents in Southern Italy. He was
   often consulted by dignitaries, and answered, like St. Anthony, without
   respect of person. He boldly rebuked Pope Gregory V. and Emperor Otho
   III. for bad treatment of an archbishop. When the emperor afterwards
   offered him any favor he might ask, Nilus replied: "I ask nothing from
   you but that you would save your soul; for you must die like every
   other man, and render an account to God for all your good and evil
   deeds." The emperor took the crown from his head, and begged the
   blessing of the aged monk. When a dissolute nobleman, who comforted
   himself with the example of Solomon, asked Nilus, whether that wise
   king was not saved, the monk replied: "We have nothing to do with
   Solomon's fate; but to us it is said, 'Every one that looketh on a
   woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
   heart.' We do not read of Solomon that he ever repented like Manasseh."
   To questions of idle curiosity he returned no answer, or he answered
   the fool according to his folly. So when one wished to know what kind
   of an apple Adam and Eve ate, to their ruin, he said that it was a
   crab-apple. In his old age he was driven from Calabria by invaders, and
   founded a little convent, Crypta Ferrata, near the famous Tusculum of
   Cicero. There he died peacefully when about ninety-six years old, in
   1005. [381]

   St. Romuald, the founder of the order of Camaldoli, was born early in
   the tenth century at Ravenna, of a rich and noble family, and entered
   the neighboring Benedictine convent of Classis, in his twentieth year,
   in order to atone, by a severe penance of forty days, for a murder
   which his father had committed against a relative in a dispute about
   property. He prayed and wept almost without ceasing. He spent three
   years in this convent, and afterwards led the life of a roaming hermit.
   He imposed upon himself all manner of self-mortification, to defeat the
   temptations of the devil. Among his devotions was the daily repetition
   of the Psalter from memory; a plain hermit, Marinus, near Venice, had
   taught him this mechanical performance and other ascetic exercises with
   the aid of blows. Wherever he went, he was followed by admiring
   disciples. He was believed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy and
   miracles, yet did not escape calumny. Emperor Otho III. paid him a
   visit in the year 1000 on an island near Ravenna. Romuald sent
   missionaries to heathen lands, and went himself to the border of
   Hungary with a number of pupils, but returned when he was admonished by
   a severe sickness that he was not destined for missionary life. He died
   in the convent Valle de Castro in 1027. [382]

   According to Damiani, who wrote his life fifteen years after his death,
   Romuald lived one hundred and twenty years, twenty in the world, three
   in a convent, ninety-seven as a hermit. [383]

   The most famous of Romuald's monastic retreats is Campo Maldoli, or
   Camaldoli in the Appennines, near Arezzo in Tuscany, which he founded
   about 1009. It became, through the influence of Damiani, his eulogist
   and Hildebrand's friend, the nucleus of a monastic order, which
   combined the cenobitic and eremitic life, and was distinguished by
   great severity. Pope Gregory XVI. belonged to this order.

   After the decay of monastic discipline during the ninth and tenth
   centuries, a reformation proceeded from the convent of Cluny in
   Burgundy, and affected the whole church. [384]

   It was founded by the pious Duke William of Aquitania in 910, to the
   honor of St. Peter and St. Paul, on the basis of the rule of St.
   Benedict.

   Count Bruno (d. 927) was the first abbot, and introduced severe
   discipline. His successor Odo (927-941), first a soldier, then a
   clergyman of learning, wisdom, and saintly character, became a reformer
   of several Benedictine convents. Neander praises his enlightened views
   on Christian life, and his superior estimate of the moral, as compared
   with the miraculous, power of Christianity. Aymardus (Aymard, 941-948),
   who resigned when he became blind, Majolus (Maieul to 994), who
   declined the papal crown, Odilo, surnamed "the Good" (to 1048), and
   Hugo (to 1109), continued in the same spirit. The last two exerted
   great influence upon emperors and popes, and inspired the reformation
   of the papacy and the church. It was at Cluny that Hildebrand advised
   Bishop Bruno of Toul (Leo IX.), who had been elected pope by Henry
   III., to seek first a regular election by the clergy in Rome; and thus
   foreshadowed his own future conflict with the imperial power. Odilo
   introduced the Treuga Dei and the festival of All Souls. Hugo,
   Hildebrand's friend, ruled sixty years, and raised the convent to the
   summit of its fame.

   Cluny was the centre (archimonasterium) of the reformed Benedictine
   convents, and its head was the chief abbot (archiabbas). It gave to the
   church many eminent bishops and three popes (Gregory VII., Urban II.,
   and Pascal II.). In the time of its highest prosperity it ruled over
   two thousand monastic establishments. The daily life was regulated in
   all its details; silence was imposed for the greater part of the day,
   during which the monks communicated only by signs; strict obedience
   ruled within; hospitality and benevolence were freely exercised to the
   poor and to strangers, who usually exceeded the number of the monks.
   During a severe famine Odilo exhausted the magazines of the convent,
   and even melted the sacred vessels, and sold the ornaments of the
   church and a crown which Henry II. had sent him from Germany. The
   convent stood directly under the pope's jurisdiction, and was highly
   favored with donations and privileges. [385] The church connected with
   it was the largest and richest in France (perhaps in all Europe), and
   admired for its twenty-five altars, its bells, and its costly works of
   art. It was founded by Hugo, and consecrated seventy years afterwards
   by Pope Innocent II. under the administration of Peter the Venerable
   (1131).

   The example of Cluny gave rise to other monastic orders, as the
   Congregation of the Vallombrosa (Vallis umbrosa), eighteen miles from
   Florence, founded by St. John Gualbert in 1038, and the Congregation of
   Hirsau in Württemberg, in 1069.

   But the very fame and prosperity of Cluny proved a temptation and cause
   of decline. An unworthy abbot, Pontius, wasted the funds, and was at
   last deposed and excommunicated by the pope as a robber of the church.
   Peter the Venerable, the friend of St. Bernard and kind patron of the
   unfortunate Abelard, raised Cluny by his wise and long administration
   (1122-1156) to new life and the height of prosperity. He increased the
   number of monks from 200 to 460, and connected 314 convents with the
   parent institution. In 1245 Pope Innocent IV., with twelve cardinals
   and all their clergy, two patriarchs, three archbishops, eleven
   bishops, the king of France, the emperor of Constantinople, and many
   dukes, counts and knights with their dependents were entertained in the
   buildings of Cluny. [386] This was the end of its prosperity. Another
   decline followed, from which Cluny never entirely recovered. The last
   abbots were merely ornamental, and wasted two-thirds of the income at
   the court of France. The French Revolution of 1789 swept the
   institution out of existence, and reduced the once famous buildings to
   ruins; but restorations have since been made. [387]

   A similar reformation of monasticism and of the clergy was attempted
   and partially carried out in England by St. Dunstan (925-May 19, 988),
   first as abbot of Glastonbury, then as bishop of Winchester and London,
   and last as archbishop of Canterbury (961) and virtual ruler of the
   kingdom. A monk of the severest type and a churchman of iron will, he
   enforced the Benedictine rule, filled the leading sees and richer
   livings with Benedictines, made a crusade against clerical marriage
   (then the rule rather than the exception), hoping to correct the
   immorality of the priests by abstracting them from the world, and
   asserted the theocratic rule of the church over the civil power under
   Kings Edwy and Edgar; but his excesses called forth violent contentions
   between the monks and the seculars in England. He was a forerunner of
   Hildebrand and Thomas à Becket. [388]

   [384] Cluny or Clugny (Cluniacum) is twelve miles northwest of Macon.
   The present town has about four thousand inhabitants. Its chief
   interest consists in the remains of mediaeeval architecture.

   [385] The wealth of the abbey was proverbial. Hurter quotes from Lorain
   the saying in Burgundy: "En tout pays ou le, rent vente, L' Abbaye de
   Cluny a rente."

   [387] The material of the church was sold during the Revolution for not
   much more than 100,000 francs. When Napoleon Bonaparte passed through
   Macon, be was invited to visit Cluny, but declined with the answer:
   "You have allowed your great and beautiful church to be sold and
   ruined, you are a set of Vandals; I shall not visit Cluny." Lorain, as
   quoted by Hurter, p. 47. The last abbot of Cluny was Cardinal Dominicus
   de la Rochefaucauld, who died in exile a.d.1800.

   Comp. Lit. in § 87.

   The discipline of the Catholic church is based on the power of the keys
   intrusted to the apostles and their successors, and includes the
   excommunication and restoration of delinquent members. It was
   originally a purely spiritual jurisdiction, but after the establishment
   of Christianity as the national religion, it began to affect also the
   civil and temporal condition of the subjects of punishment. It obtained
   a powerful hold upon the public mind from the universal belief of the
   middle ages that the visible church, centering in the Roman papacy, was
   by divine appointment the dispenser of eternal salvation, and that
   expulsion from her communion, unless followed by repentance and
   restoration, meant eternal damnation. No heresy or sect ever claimed
   this power.

   Discipline was very obnoxious to the wild and independent spirit of the
   barbaric races. It was exercised by the bishop through synodical
   courts, which were held annually in the dominions of Charlemagne for
   the promotion of good morals. Charlemagne ordered the bishops to visit
   their parishes once a year, and to inquire into cases of incest,
   patricide, fratricide, adultery, and other vices contrary to the laws
   of God. [389] Similar directions were given by Synods in Spain and
   England. The more extensive dioceses were divided into several
   archdeaconries. The archdeacons represented the bishops, and, owing to
   this close connection, they possessed a power and jurisdiction superior
   to that of the priests. Seven members of the congregation were
   entrusted with a supervision, and had to report to the inquisitorial
   court on the state of religion and morals. Offences both ecclesiastical
   and civil were punished at once with fines, fasting, pilgrimages,
   scourging, imprisonment. The civil authorities aided the bishops in the
   exercise of discipline. Public offences were visited with public
   penance; private offences were confessed to the priest, who immediately
   granted absolution on certain conditions.

   The discipline of the Latin church in the middle ages is laid down in
   the so-called "Penitential Books." [390] They regulate the order of
   penitence, and prescribe specific punishments for certain sins, as
   drunkenness, fornication, avarice, perjury, homicide, heresy, idolatry.
   The material is mostly derived from the writings of the fathers, and
   from the synodical canons of Ancyra (314), Neocaesarea (314), Nicaea
   (325), Gangra (362), and of the North African, Frankish, and Spanish
   councils down to the seventh century. The common object of these
   Penitentials is to enforce practical duties and to extirpate the
   ferocious and licentious passions of heathenism. They present a very
   dark picture of the sins of the flesh. They kept alive the sense of a
   moral government of God, who punishes every violation of his law, but
   they lowered the sense of guilt by fostering the pernicious notion that
   sin may be expiated by mechanical exercises and by the payment of a sum
   of money.

   There were many such books, British, Irish, Frankish, Spanish, and
   Roman. The best known are the Anglo-Saxon penitentials of the seventh
   and eighth centuries, especially that of Theodore, archbishop of
   Canterbury (669-690). He was a Greek by birth, of Tarsus in Cilicia,
   and reduced the disciplinary rules of the East and West to a system. He
   was not the direct author of the book which bears his name, but it was
   drawn up under his direction, published during his life-time and by his
   authority, and contains his decisions in answer to various questions of
   a priest named Eoda and other persons on the subject of penance and the
   whole range of ecclesiastical discipline. The genuine text has recently
   been brought to light from early MSS. by the combined labors of German
   and English scholarship. [391] The introduction and the book itself are
   written in barbarous Latin. Traces of the Greek training of Theodore
   may be seen in the references to St. Basil and to Greek practices. Next
   to Theodore's collection there are Penitentials under the name of the
   venerable Bede (d. 735), and of Egbert, archbishop of York (d. 767).
   [392]

   The earliest Frankish penitential is the work of Columban, the Irish
   missionary (d. 615). He was a severe monastic disciplinarian and gave
   prominence to corporal punishment among the penalties for offences. The
   Cummean Penitential (Poenit. Cummeani) is of Scotch-Irish origin, and
   variously assigned to Columba of Iona (about 597), to Cumin, one of his
   disciples, or to Cummean, who died in Columban's monastery at Bobbio
   (after 711). Haltigar, bishop of Cambray, in the ninth century (about
   829) published a "Roman Penitential," professedly derived from Roman
   archives, but in great part from Columban, and Frankish sources. An
   earlier work which bears the name "Poenitentiale Romanum," from the
   first part of the eighth century, has a more general character, but its
   precise origin is uncertain. The term "Roman" was used to designate the
   quality of a class of Penitentials which enjoyed a more than local
   authority. [393] Rabanus Maurus (d. 855) prepared a "Liber
   Poenitentitae" at the request of the archbishop Otgar of Mayence (841).
   Almost every diocese had its own book of the kind, but the spirit and
   the material were substantially the same.

   Notes.

   As specimens of these Penitential Books, we give the first two chapters
   from the first book of the Poenitentiale Theodori (Archbishop of
   Canterbury), as printed in Haddan and Stubbs, Councils and Eccles. Doc.
   relating to Great Britain and Ireland, vol. IIIrd. p. 177 sqq. We
   insert a few better readings from other MSS. used by Wasserschleben.

   The remaining chapters of the first book treat De Avaritia Furtiva; De

   jejunia ecclesiae Dei; De communione Eucharistiae, vel Sacrificio; De
   Reconciliatione; De Penitentia Nubentium specialiter; De Cultura
   Idolorum. The last chapter shows how many heathen superstitions
   prevailed in connection with gross immorality, which the church
   endeavored to counteract by a mechanical legalism. The second book
   treats De Ecclesiae Ministerio; De tribus gratlibus; De Ordinatione; De
   Baptismo et Confirmatione; De Missa Defunctorum, etc.

   canonischen Rechts dargestellt. Tübingen 1857 (560 pages). By the same
   author: Die Suspension der Kirchendiener. Tüb. 1862.

   Henry C. Lea: Excommunication, in his Studies in Church History
   (Philadelphia 1869), p. 223-475.

   The severest penalties of the church were excommunication, anathema,
   and interdict. They were fearful weapons in the hands of the hierarchy
   during the middle ages, when the church was believed to control
   salvation, and when the civil power enforced her decrees by the strong
   arm of the law. The punishment ceases with repentance, which is
   followed by absolution. The sentence of absolution must proceed from
   the bishop who pronounced the sentence of excommunication; but in
   articulo mortis every priest can absolve on condition of obedience in
   case of recovery.

   1. Excommunication was the exclusion from the sacraments, especially
   the communion. In the dominions of Charlemagne it was accompanied with
   civil disabilities, as exclusion from secular tribunals, and even with
   imprisonment and seizure of property. A bishop could excommunicate any
   one who refused canonical obedience. But a bishop could only be
   excommunicated by the pope, and the pope by no power on earth. [394]
   The sentence was often accompanied with awful curses upon the bodies
   and souls of the offender. The popes, as they towered above ordinary
   bishops, surpassed them also in the art of cursing, and exercised it
   with shocking profanity. Thus Benedict VIII., who crowned Emperor Henry
   II. (a.d. 1014), excommunicated some reckless vassals of William II.,
   Count of Provence, who sought to lay unhallowed hands upon the property
   of the monastery of St. Giles, [395] and consigned them to Satan with
   terrible imprecations, although be probably thought he was only
   following St. Peter's example in condemning Ananias and Sapphira, and
   Simon Magus. [396]

   "Hardened sinners" (says Lea) "might despise such imprecations, but
   their effect on believers was necessarily unutterable, when, amid the
   gorgeous and impressive ceremonial of worship, the bishop, surrounded
   by twelve priests bearing flaming candles, solemnly recited the awful
   words which consigned the evil-doer and all his generation to eternal
   torment with such fearful amplitude and reduplication of malediction,
   and as the sentence of perdition came to its climax, the attending
   priests simultaneously cast their candles to the ground and trod them
   out, as a symbol of the quenching of a human soul in the eternal night
   of hell. To this was added the expectation, amounting almost to a
   certainty, that Heaven would not wait for the natural course of events
   to confirm the judgment thus pronounced, but that the maledictions
   would be as effective in this world as in the next. Those whom
   spiritual terrors could not subdue thus were daunted by the fearful
   stories of the judgment overtaking the hardened sinner who dared to
   despise the dread anathema."

   2. The Anathema is generally used in the same sense as excommunication
   or separation from church communion and church privileges. But in a
   narrower sense, it means the "greater" excommunication, [397] which
   excludes from all Christian intercourse and makes the offender an
   outlaw; while the "minor" excommunication excludes only from the
   sacrament. Such a distinction was made by Gratian and Innocent III. The
   anathema was pronounced with more solemn ceremonies. The Council of
   Nicaea, 335, anathematized the Arians, and the Council of Trent, 1563,
   closed with three anathemas on all heretics.

   3. The Interdict [398] extended over a whole town or diocese or
   district or country, and involved the innocent with the guilty. It was
   a suspension of religion in public exercise, including even the rites
   of marriage and burial; only baptism and extreme unction could be
   performed, and they only with closed doors. It cast the gloom of a
   funeral over a country, and made people tremble in expectation of the
   last judgment. This exceptional punishment began in a small way in the
   fifth century. St. Augustin justly reproved Auxilius, a brother bishop,
   who abused his power by excommunicating a whole family for the offence
   of the head, and Pope Leo the Great forbade to enforce the penalty on
   any who was not a partner in the crime. [399] But the bishops and popes
   of the middle ages, from the eleventh to the thirteenth century,
   thought otherwise, and resorted repeatedly to this extreme remedy of
   enforcing obedience. They had some basis for it in the custom of the
   barbarians to hold the family or tribe responsible for crimes committed
   by individual members.

   The first conspicuous examples of inflicting the Interdict occurred in
   France. Bishop Leudovald of Bayeux, after consulting with his brother
   bishops, closed in 586 all the churches of Rouen and deprived the
   people of the consolations of religion until the murderer of
   Pretextatus, Bishop of Rouen, who was slain at the altar by a hireling
   of the savage queen Fredegunda, should be discovered. [400] Hincmar of
   Laon inflicted the interdict on his diocese (869), but Hincmar of
   Rheims disapproved of it and removed it. The synod of Limoges
   (Limoisin), in 1031, enforced the Peace of God by the interdict in
   these words which were read in the church: "We excommunicate all those
   noblemen (milites) in the bishopric of Limoges who disobey the
   exhortations of their bishop to hold the Peace. Let them and their
   helpers be accursed, and let their weapons and horses be accursed! Let
   their lot be with Cain, Dathan, and Abiram! And as now the lights are
   extinguished, so their joy in the presence of angels shall be
   destroyed, unless they repent and make satisfaction before dying." The
   Synod ordered that public worship be closed, the altars laid bare,
   crosses and ornaments removed, marriages forbidden; only clergymen,
   beggars, strangers and children under two years could be buried, and
   only the dying receive the communion; no clergyman or layman should be
   shaved till the nobles submit. A signal in the church on the third hour
   of the day should call all to fall on their knees to pray. All should
   be dressed in mourning. The whole period of the interdict should be
   observed as a continued fast and humiliation. [401]

   The popes employed this fearful weapon against disobedient kings, and
   sacrificed the spiritual comforts of whole nations to their
   hierarchical ambition. Gregory VII. laid the province of Gnesen under
   the interdict, because King Bolislaw II. had murdered bishop Stanislaus
   of Cracow with his own hand. Alexander II. applied it to Scotland
   (1180), because the king refused a papal bishop and expelled him from
   the country. Innocent III. suspended it over France (1200), because
   king Philip Augustus had cast off his lawful wife and lived with a
   concubine. [402] The same pope inflicted this punishment upon England
   (March 23, 1208), hoping to bring King John (Lackland) to terms. The
   English interdict lasted over six years during which all religious
   rites were forbidden except baptism, confession, and the viaticum.

   Interdicts were only possible in the middle ages when the church had
   unlimited power. Their frequency and the impossibility of full
   execution diminished their power until they fell into contempt and were
   swept out of existence as the nations of Europe outgrew the discipline
   of priestcraft and awoke to a sense of manhood.

   "Benedict Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, to Count William and

   accursed in their bodies, and let their souls be delivered to
   destruction and perdition and torture. Let them be damned with the
   damned: let them be scourged with the ungrateful; let them perish with

   Christ, did not believe but sought to crucify Him. Let them be accursed
   with the heretics who labored to destroy the church. Let them be
   accursed with those who blaspheme the name of God. Let them be accursed
   with those who despair of the mercy of God. Let them be accursed with
   those who he damned in Hell. Let them be accursed with the impious and
   sinners unless they amend their ways, and confess themselves in fault
   towards St. Giles. Let them be accursed in the four quarters of the
   earth. In the East be they accursed, and in the West disinherited; in
   the North interdicted, and in the South excommunicate. Be they accursed
   in the day-time and excommunicate in the night-time. Accursed be they
   at home and excommunicate abroad; accursed in standing and
   excommunicate in sitting; accursed in eating, accursed in drinking,
   accursed in sleeping, and excommunicate in waking; accursed when they
   work and excommunicate when they rest. Let them be accursed in the
   spring time and excommunicate in the summer; accursed in the autumn and
   excommunicate in the winter. Let them be accursed in this world and
   excommunicate in the next. Let their lands pass into the hands of the
   stranger, their wives be given over to perdition, and their children
   fall before the edge of the sword. Let what they eat be accursed, and
   accursed be what they leave, so that he who eats it shall be accursed.
   Accursed and excommunicate be the priest who shall give them the body
   and blood of the Lord, or who shall visit them in sickness. Accursed
   and excommunicate be he who shall carry them to the grave and shall
   dare to bury them. Let them be excommunicate, and accursed with all
   curses if they do not make amends and render due satisfaction. And know
   this for truth, that after our death no bishop nor count, nor any
   secular power shall usurp the seigniory of the blessed St. Giles. And
   if any presume to attempt it, borne down by, all the foregoing curses,
   they never shall enter the kingdom of Heaven, for the blessed St. Giles
   committed his monastery to the lordship of the blessed Peter."

   For the authoritative teaching of the Roman church on the Sacramentum
   Poenitentiae see Conc. Trident. Sess. XIV. held 1551.

   The word repentance or penitence is an insufficient rendering for the
   corresponding Greek metanoia, which means a radical change of mind or
   conversion from a sinful to a godly life, and includes, negatively, a
   turning away from sin in godly sorrow (repentance in the narrower
   sense) and, positively, a turning to Christ by faith with a
   determination to follow him. [403] The call to repent in this sense was
   the beginning of the preaching both of John the Baptist, and of Jesus
   Christ. [404]

   In the Latin church the idea of repentance was externalized and
   identified with certain outward acts of self-abasement or
   self-punishment for the expiation of sin. The public penance before the
   church went out of use during the seventh or eighth century, except for
   very gross offences, and was replaced by private penance and
   confession. [405] The Lateran Council of 1215 under Pope Innocent III.
   made it obligatory upon every Catholic Christian to confess to his
   parish priest at least once a year. [406]

   Penance, including auricular confession and priestly absolution, was
   raised to the dignity of a sacrament for sins committed after baptism.
   The theory on which it rests was prepared by the fathers (Tertullian
   and Cyprian), completed by the schoolmen, and sanctioned by the Roman
   church. It is supposed that baptism secures perfect remission of past
   sins, but not of subsequent sins, and frees from eternal damnation, but
   not from temporal punishment, which culminates in death or in
   purgatory. Penance is described as a "laborious kind of baptism," and
   is declared by the Council of Trent to be necessary to salvation for
   those who have fallen after baptism, as baptism is necessary for those
   who have not yet been regenerated. [407]

   The sacrament of penance and priestly, absolution includes three
   elements: contrition of the heart, confession by the mouth,
   satisfaction by good works. [408] On these conditions the priest grants
   absolution, not simply by a declaratory but by a judicial act. The good
   works required are especially fasting and almsgiving. Pilgrimages to
   Jerusalem, Rome, Tours, Compostella, and other sacred places were
   likewise favorite satisfactions. Peter Damiani recommended voluntary
   self-flagellation as a means to propitiate God. These pious exercises
   covered in the popular mind the whole idea of penance. Piety was
   measured by the quantity of good works rather than by quality of
   character.

   Another mediaeval institution must here be mentioned which is closely
   connected with penance. The church in the West, in her zeal to prevent
   violence and bloodshed, rightly favored the custom of the barbarians to
   substitute pecuniary compensation for punishment of an offence, but
   wrongly applied this custom to the sphere of religion. Thus money,
   might be substituted for fasting and other satisfactions, and was
   clothed with an atoning efficacy. This custom seems to have proceeded
   from the church of England, and soon spread over the continent. [409]
   It degenerated into a regular traffic, and became a rich source for the
   increase of ecclesiastical and monastic property.

   Here is the origin of the indulgences so called, that is the remission
   of venial sins by the payment of money and on condition of contrition
   and prayer. The practice was justified by the scholastic theory that
   the works of supererogation of the saints constitute a treasury of
   extra-merit and extra-reward which is under the control of the pope.
   Hence indulgence assumed the special meaning of papal dispensation or
   remission of sin from the treasury of the overflowing merits of saints,
   and this power was extended even to the benefit of the dead in
   purgatory. [410]

   Indulgences may be granted by bishops and archbishops in their
   dioceses, and by the pope to all Catholics. The former dealt with it in
   retail, the latter in wholesale. The first instances of papal
   indulgence occur in the ninth century under Paschalis I. and John VIII.
   who granted it to those who had fallen in war for the defence of the
   church. Gregory VI. in 1046 promised it to all who sent contributions
   for the repair of the churches in Rome. Urban II., at the council of
   Clermont (1095), offered to the crusaders "by the authority of the
   princes of the Apostles, Peter and Paul," plenary indulgence as a
   reward for a journey to the Holy Land. The same offer was repeated in
   every crusade against the Mohammedans and heretics. The popes found it
   a convenient means for promoting their power and filling their
   treasury. Thus the granting of indulgences became a periodical
   institution. Its abuses culminated in the profane and shameful traffic
   of Tetzel under Leo X. for the benefit of St. Peter's church, but were
   overruled in the Providence of God for the Reformation and a return to
   the biblical idea of repentance.

   Note.

   The charge is frequently made against the papal court in the middle
   ages that it had a regulated scale of prices for indulgences, and this
   is based on the Tax Tables of the Roman Chancery published from time to
   time. Roman Catholic writers (as Lingard, Wiseman) say that the taxes
   are merely fees for the expedition of business and the payment of
   officials, but cannot deny the shameful avarice of some popes. The
   subject is fully discussed by Dr. T. L. Green (R.C.), Indulgences,
   Sacramental Absolutions, and the Tax-Tables of the Roman Chancery and
   Penitentiary, considered, in reply to the Charge of Venality, London
   (Longmans) 1872, and, on the Protestant side, by Dr. Richard Gibbings
   (Prof. of Ch. Hist. in the University of Dublin), The Taxes of the
   Apostolic Penitentiary; or, the Prices of Sins in the Church of Rome,
   Dublin 1872. Gibbings reprints the Taxae Sacrae Poenitentiariae Romanae
   from the Roman ed. of 1510 and the Parisian ed. of 1520, which cover 21
   pages in Latin, but the greater part of the book (164 pages) is an
   historical introduction and polemical discussion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [403] Penitence is from the Latin poenitentia, and this is derived from
   poena, poine(compensation, satisfaction, punishment). Jerome introduced
   the word, or rather retained it, in the Latin Bible, for metanoia, and
   poenitentiam agere for metanoeinHence the Douay version: to do penance.
   Augustin, Isidor, Rabanus Maurus, Peter Lombard, and the R. Catholic
   theologians connect the term with the penal idea (poena, punitio) and
   make it cover the whole penitential discipline. The English repentance,
   to repent, and the German Busse, Bussethun follow the Vulgate, but have
   changed the meaning in evangelical theology in conformity to the Greek
   metanoia.

   [404] Matt. 3:2; 4:17; Mark 1:15. Luther renewed the call in his 95
   Theses which begin with the same idea, in opposition to the traffic in
   indulgences.

   [405] Pope Leo the Great (440-461) was the first prelate in the West
   who sanctioned the substitution of the system of secret humiliation by
   auricular confession for the public exomologesis. Ep. 136. Opera I.
   355.

   [406] Can. 21: "Omnis utriusque sexus fidelis, postquam ad annos
   discretionis pervenerit, omnia sua solus peccata confiteatur fideliter,
   saltem semel in anno, proprio sacerdoti."Violation of this law of
   auricular confession was threatened with excommunication and refusal of
   Christian burial. See Hefele V. 793.

   [407] Conc. Trid. Sess. XIV. cap.2 (Schaff's Creeds I. 143). The
   Council went so far in Canon VI. (II. 165) as to anathematize any one
   "who denies that sacramental confession was instituted or is necessary
   to salvation, of divine right; or who says that the manner of
   confessing secretly to a priest alone, which the church has ever
   observed from the beginning (?), and doth observe, is alien from the
   institution and command of Christ, and is a human invention."

   [408] Contritio cordis, confessio oris, satisfactio operis. See Conc.
   Trid. Sess. XIV. cap. 3-6 (Creeds, II. 143-153). The usual Roman
   Catholic definition of this sacrament is: "Sacramentum poenitentiae est
   sacramentum a Christo institutum, quo homini contrito, confesso et
   satisfacturo (satisfacere volenti) per juridicam sacerdotis
   absolutionem peccata post baptismum commissa remittuntur." Oswald, Die
   dogmat. Lehre von den heil. Sacramenten der katholischen Kirche,II. 17
   (3rd ed. Münster 1870).

   [409] Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury is the reputed author of this
   commutation of penance for a money-payment. See his Penitential I. 3
   and 4, and the seventh penitential canon ascribed to him, in Haddan and
   Stubbs III. 179, 180, 211. "Si quis"says Theodore, "pro ultione
   propinqui hominem occiderit, peniteat sicut homicida, VII. vel X.
   annos. Si tamen reddere vult propinquis petuniam aestimationis, levior
   erit penitentia, id est, dimidio spatii."The Synod of Clove-ho
   (probably Abingdon), held under his successor, Cuthbert, for the
   reformation of abuses, in September 747, decreed in the 26th canon that
   alms were no longer to be given for diminishing or commuting the
   fastings and other works of satisfaction. See Haddan and Stubbs, III.
   371 sq.

   [410] This theory was fully developed by Thomas Aquinas and other
   schoolmen (see Gieseler II. 521 sq.), and sanctioned by the Council of
   Trent in the 25th Session, held Dec. 4, 1563 (Creeds II. 205 sq.),
   although the Council forbids "all evil gains" and other abuses which
   have caused "the honorable name of indulgences to be blasphemed by
   heretics." The popes still exercise from time to time the right of
   granting plenary indulgences, though with greater caution than their
   mediaeval predecessors.

   CHURCH AND STATE.

   Comp. vol. III. ch. III. and the Lit. there quoted
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 88. Legislation.

   Mediaeval Christianity is not a direct continuation of the ante-Nicene
   Christianity in hostile conflict with the heathen state, but of the
   post-Nicene Christianity in friendly union with a nominally Christian
   state. The missionaries aimed first at the conversion of the rulers of
   the barbarian races of Western and Northern Europe. Augustin, with his
   thirty monks, was provided by Pope Gregory with letters to princes, and
   approached first King Ethelbert and Queen Bertha in Kent. Boniface
   leaned on the pope and Charles Martel. The conversion of Clovis decided
   the religion of the Franks. The Christian rulers became at once the
   patrons of the church planted among their subjects, and took
   Constantine and Theodosius for their models. They submitted to the
   spiritual authority of the Catholic church, but aspired to its temporal
   government by the appointment of bishops, abbots, and the control over
   church-property. Hence the frequent collisions of the two powers, which
   culminated in the long conflict between the pope and the emperor.

   The civil and ecclesiastical relations of the middle ages are so
   closely intertwined that it is impossible to study or understand the
   one without the other. In Spain, for instance, the synods of Toledo
   were both ecclesiastical councils and royal parliaments; after the
   affairs of the church were disposed of, the bishops and nobles met
   together for the enactment of civil laws, which were sanctioned by the
   king. The synods and diets held under Charlemagne had likewise a double
   character. In England the bishops were, and are still, members of the
   House of Lords, and often occupied seats in the cabinet down to the
   time of Cardinal Wolsey, who was Archbishop of York and Chancellor of
   England. The religious persecutions of the middle ages were the joint
   work of church and state.

   This union has a bright and a dark side. It was a wholesome
   training-school for barbarous races, it humanized and ennobled the
   state; but it secularized the church and the clergy, and hindered the
   development of freedom by repressing all efforts to emancipate the mind
   from the yoke of despotic power. The church gained a victory over the
   world, but the world gained also a victory over the church. St. Jerome,
   who witnessed the first effects of the marriage of the church with the
   Roman empire, anticipated the experience of later ages, when he said:
   "The church by its connection with Christian princes gained in power
   and riches, but lost in virtues." [411] Dante, who lived in the golden
   age of the mediaeval hierarchy, and believed the fable of the donation
   of Constantine to Sylvester, traced the ills of the church to "that
   marriage-dower" which the first wealthy pope received from the first
   Christian emperor.

   The connection of the ecclesiastical and civil powers is embodied in
   the legislation which regulates the conduct of man in his relations to
   his fellow-men, and secures social order and national welfare. It is an
   index of public morals as far as it presupposes and fixes existing
   customs; and where it is in advance of popular sentiment, it expresses
   a moral ideal in the mind of the lawgivers to be realized by the
   educational power of legal enactments.

   During the middle ages there were three systems of jurisprudence: the
   Roman law, the Barbaric law, and the Canon law. The first two proceeded
   from civil, the third from ecclesiastical authority. The civil law
   embodies the records and edicts of emperors and kings, the enactments
   of diets and parliaments, the decisions of courts and judges. The
   ecclesiastical law embodies the canons of councils and decretals of
   popes. The former is heathen in origin, but improved and modified by
   Christianity; the latter is the direct production of the church, yet as
   influenced by the state of mediaeval society. Both rest on the union of
   church and state, and mutually support each other, but it was difficult
   to draw the precise line of difference, and to prevent occasional
   collisions of jurisdiction.

   The Justinian code (527-534) transmitted to the middle ages the
   legislative wisdom and experience of republican and imperial Rome with
   the humanizing improvements of Stoic philosophy and the Christian
   religion, but at the same time with penal laws against every departure
   from the orthodox Catholic creed, which was recognized and protected as
   the only religion of the state. It maintained its authority in the
   Eastern empire. It was partly preserved, after the destruction of the
   Western empire among the Latin inhabitants of Italy, France, and Spain,
   in a compilation from the older Theodosian code (429438), which
   contained the post-Constantinian laws, with fragments from earlier
   collections.

   In the twelfth century the Roman law (after the discovery of a copy of
   the Pandects at Amalfi in 1135, which was afterwards transferred to
   Florence) began to be studied again with great enthusiasm. A famous
   school of civil law was established at Bologna. Similar schools arose
   in connection with the Universities at Paris, Naples, Padua, and other
   cities. The Roman civil law (Corpus juris civilis), in connection with
   the ecclesiastical or canon law (Corpus juris canonici), was gradually
   adopted all over the Continent of Europe, and the Universities granted
   degrees in both laws conjointly.

   Thus Rome, substituting the law for the sword, ruled the world once
   more for centuries, and subdued the descendants of the very barbarians
   who had destroyed her empire. The conquered gave laws to the
   conquerors, mindful of the prophetic line of Virgil:

   "Tu, regere imperio populos, Romane, memento."

   Notes.

   The anti-heretical part of the Roman law, on which persecution was
   based, is thus summed up by Dean Milman (Bk III. ch. 5): "A new class
   of crimes, if not introduced by Christianity, became multiplied,
   rigorously defined, mercilessly condemned. The ancient Roman theory,
   that the religion of the State must be the religion of the people,
   which Christianity had broken to pieces by its inflexible resistance,
   was restored in more than its former rigor. The code of Justinian
   confirmed the laws of Theodosius and his successors, which declared
   certain heresies, Manicheism and Donatism, crimes against the State, as
   affecting the common welfare. The crime was punishable by confiscation
   of all property, and incompetency to inherit or to bequeath. Death did
   not secure the hidden heretic from prosecution; as in high treason, he
   might be convicted in his grave. Not only was his testament invalid,
   but inheritance could not descend through him. All who harbored such
   heretics were liable to punishment; their slaves might desert them, and
   transfer themselves to an orthodox master. The list of proscribed
   heretics gradually grew wider. The Manicheans were driven still farther
   away from the sympathies of mankind; by one Greek constitution they
   were condemned to capital punishment. Near thirty names of less
   detested heretics are recited in a law of Theodosius the younger, to
   which were added, in the time of Justinian, Nestorians, Eutychians,
   Apollinarians. The books of all these sects were to be burned; yet the
   formidable number of these heretics made no doubt the general execution
   of the laws impossible. But the Justinian code, having defined as
   heretics all who do not believe the Catholic faith, declares such
   heretics, as well as Pagans, Jews, and Samaritans, incapable of holding
   civil or military offices, except in the lowest ranks of the latter;
   they could attain to no civic dignity which was held in honor, as that
   of the defensors, though such offices as were burdensome might be
   imposed even on Jews. The assemblies of all heretics were forbidden,
   their books were to be collected and burned, their rites, baptisms, and
   ordinations prohibited. Children of heretical parents might embrace
   orthodoxy; the males the parent could not disinherit, to the females he
   was bound to give an adequate dowry. The testimony of Manicheans, of
   Samaritans, and Pagans could not be received; apostates to any of these
   sects and religions lost all their former privileges, and were liable
   to all penalties."

   The first and greatest legislator of the Germanic nations is
   Charlemagne, the founder of the Holy Roman Empire (800-814). What
   Constantine the Great, Theodosius the Great, and Justinian did for the
   old Roman empire on the basis of heathen Rome and the ancient
   Graeco-Latin church, Charlemagne did for the new Roman Empire in the
   West on the basis of Germanic customs and the Latin church centred in
   the Roman papacy. He was greater, more beneficial and enduring in his
   influence as a legislator than as a soldier and conqueror. [412] He
   proposed to himself the herculean task to organize, civilize and
   Christianize the crude barbarian customs of his vast empire, and he
   carried it out with astonishing wisdom. His laws are embodied in the
   Capitularia, i.e. laws divided into chapters. They are the first great
   law-book of the French and Germans. [413] They contain his edicts and
   ordinances relating to ecclesiastical, political, and civil
   legislation, judicial decisions and moral precepts. The influence of
   the church and the Christian religion is here more direct and extensive
   than in the Roman Code, and imparts to it a theocratic element which
   approaches to the Mosaic legislation. The Roman Catholic church with
   her creed, her moral laws, her polity, was the strongest bond of union
   which held the Western barbarians together and controlled the views and
   aims of the emperor. He appears, indeed, as the supreme ruler clothed
   with sovereign authority. But he was surrounded by the clergy which was
   the most intelligent and influential factor in legislation both in the
   synod and in the imperial diet. The emperor and his nobles were under
   the power of the bishops, and the bishops were secular lords and
   politicians as well as ecclesiastics. The ecclesiastical affairs were
   controlled by the Apocrisiarius [414] (a sort of minister of worship);
   the secular affairs, by the Comes palatii; [415] both were aided in
   each province by a delegated bishop and count who were to work in
   harmony. On important questions the pope was consulted. [416] The
   legislation proceeded from the imperial will, from ecclesiastical
   councils, and from the diet or imperial assembly. The last consisted of
   the dignitaries of church and state, the court officials, bishops,
   abbots, dukes, counts, etc., and convened every spring. The emperor was
   surrounded at his court by the most eminent statesmen, clergymen and
   scholars, from whom he was anxious to learn without sacrificing his
   right to rule. His court was a school of discipline and of that
   gentlemanly courtesy and refinement which became a distinguishing
   feature of chivalry, and Charlemagne shone in poetry as the first model
   cavalier.

   The legislation of the Carolingian Capitularies is favorable to the
   clergy, to monasteries, to the cause of good morals and religion. The
   marriage tie is protected, even among slaves; the license of divorce
   restrained; divorced persons are forbidden to marry again during the
   life-time of the other party. The observance of Sunday is enjoined for
   the special benefit of the laboring classes. Ecclesiastical discipline
   is enforced by penal laws in cases of gross sins such as incest.
   Superstitious customs, as consulting soothsayers and the Scriptures for
   oracles, are discouraged, but the ordeal is enjoined. Wholesome moral
   lessons are introduced, sometimes in the language of the Scriptures:
   the people are warned against perjury, against feud, against shedding
   Christian blood, against the oppression of the poor (whose cause should
   be heard by the judges before the cause of the rich). They are exhorted
   to learn the Apostles' Creed and to pray, to love one another and to
   live in peace, "because they have one Father in heaven." Cupidity is
   called "a root of all evil." Respect for the dead is encouraged.
   Hospitality is recommended for the reason that he who receives a little
   child in the name of Christ, receives him.

   This legislation was much neglected under the weak successors of
   Charlemagne, but remains a noble monument of his intentions.

   Institutes of England (London 1840). Matthew Hale: History of the
   Common Law (6th ed. by Runnington, 1820). Reeve: History of the English

   the Relations of Civil Law to Church Property (N. York 1875).

   England never accepted the Roman civil law, and the canon law only in
   part. The island in its isolation was protected by the sea against
   foreign influence, and jealous of it. It built up its own system of
   jurisprudence on the basis of Anglo-Saxon habits and customs. The
   English civil law is divided into Common Law or lex non scripta (i.e.
   not written at first), and Statute Law or lex scripta. They are related
   to each other as oral tradition and the Bible are in theology. The
   Common Law embodies the ancient general and local customs of the
   English people, handed down by word of mouth from time immemorial, and
   afterwards recorded in the decisions of judges who are regarded as the
   living oracles of interpretation and application, and whose decisions
   must be adhered to in similar cases of litigation. It is Anglo-Saxon in
   its roots, and moulded by Norman lawyers, under the influence of
   Christian principles of justice and equity. Blackstone, the standard
   expounder of English law, says, "Christianity is a part of the Common
   Law of England." [417] Hence the laws against religious offences, as
   blasphemy, profane swearing, desecration of the Lord's Day, apostasy
   from Christianity, and heresy. [418]

   The Christian character of English legislation is due in large measure
   to the piety of the Anglo-Saxon kings, especially Alfred the Great
   (849-901), and Edward III., the Confessor 1004-1066, canonized by
   Alexander III., 1166), who prepared digests of the laws of the realm.
   Their piety was, of course, ascetic and monastic, but enlightened for
   their age and animated by the spirit of justice and charity. The former
   is styled Legum Anglicanarum Conditor, the latter Legum Anglicanarum
   Restitutor.

   Alfred's Dome-Book or Liber justicialis was lost during the irruption
   of the Danes, but survived in the improved code of Edward the
   Confessor. Alfred was for England what Charlemagne was for France and
   Germany, a Christian ruler, legislator, and educator of his people. He
   is esteemed "the wisest, best, and greatest king that ever reigned in
   England." Although he was a great sufferer from epilepsy or some
   similar bodily infirmity which seized him suddenly from time to time
   and made him despair of life, he performed, like St. Paul in spite of
   his thorn in the flesh, an incredible amount of work. The grateful
   memory of his people ascribed to him institutions and laws, rights and
   privileges which existed before his time, but in many respects he was
   far ahead of his age. When he ascended the throne, "hardly any one
   south of the Thames could understand the ritual of the church or
   translate a Latin letter." He conceived the grand scheme of popular
   national education. For this end he rebuilt the churches and
   monasteries which had been ruined by the Danes, built new ones,
   imported books from Rome, invited scholars from the Continent to his
   court, translated with their aid Latin works (as Gregory's Pastoral
   Care, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, and Boethius's Consolations of
   Philosophy) into the Anglo-Saxon, collected the laws of the country,
   and remodelled the civil and ecclesiastical organization of his
   kingdom.

   His code is introduced with the Ten Commandments and other laws taken
   from the Bible. It protects the stranger in memory of Israel's sojourn
   in Egypt; it gives the Christian slave freedom in the seventh year, as
   the Mosaic law gave to the Jewish bondman; it protects the laboring man
   in his Sunday rest; it restrains blood thirsty passions of revenge by
   establishing bots or fines for offences; it enjoins the golden rule (in
   the negative form), not to do to any man what we would not have done to
   us. [419]

   "In all these words of human brotherhood, of piety, and the spirit of
   justice, of pity and humanity, uttered by the barbaric lawgivers of a
   wild race, there speaks a great Personality--the embodiment of the
   highest sympathy and most disinterested virtue of mankind. It cannot be
   said indeed that these religious influences, so apparently genuine,
   produced any powerful effect on society in Anglo-Saxon England, though
   they modified the laws. Still they began the history of the religious
   forces in England which, though obscured by much formalism and
   hypocrisy and weakened by selfishness, have yet worked out slowly the
   great moral and humane reforms in the history of that country, and have
   tended with other influences to make it one of the great leaders of
   modern progress." [420]

   Notes.

   John Richard Green, in his posthumous work, The Conquest of England (N.
   York ed. 1884, p. 179 sq.), pays the following eloquent and just
   tribute to the character of King Aelfred (as he spells the name):
   "Aelfred stands in the forefront of his race, for he is the noblest as
   he is the most complete embodiment of all that is great, all that is
   lovable in the English temper, of its practical energy, its patient and
   enduring force, of the reserve and self-control that give steadiness
   and sobriety to a wide outlook and a restless daring, of its temperance
   and fairness, its frankness and openness, its sensitiveness to
   affection, its poetic tenderness, its deep and reverent religion.
   Religion, indeed, was the groundwork of Aelfred's character. His temper
   was instinct with piety. Everywhere, throughout his writings that
   remain to us, the name of God, the thought of God, stir him to
   outbursts of ecstatic adoration. But of the narrowness, the want of
   proportion, the predominance of one quality over another, which
   commonly goes with an intensity of religious feeling or of moral
   purpose, he showed no trace. He felt none of that scorn of the world
   about him which drove the nobler souls of his day to monastery or
   hermitage. Vexed as he was by sickness and constant pain, not only did
   his temper take no touch of asceticism, but a rare geniality, a
   peculiar elasticity and mobility of nature, gave color and charm to his
   life .... Little by little men came to recognize in Aelfred a ruler of
   higher and nobler stamp than the world had seen. Never had it seen a
   king who lived only for the good of his people .... 'I desire,' said
   the king, 'to leave to the men that come after me a remembrance of me
   in good works. His aim has been more than fulfilled .... While every
   other name of those earlier times has all but faded from the
   recollection of Englishmen, that of Aelfred remains familiar to every
   English child.'

   [417] Comment. Bk IV. ch. 4. The same may be said of the United States
   as far as they have adopted the Common Law of the mother country. It is
   so declared by the highest courts of New York, Pennsylvania, and
   Massachusetts, and by many eminent judges, but with this essential
   modification that those parts of the Common Law of England which imply
   the union of church and state are inapplicable to the United States
   where they are separated. Justice Strong (l.c. p. 32) says: "The laws
   and institutions of all the States are built on the foundation of
   reverence for Christianity." The court of Pennsylvania states the law
   in this manner: "Christianity is and always has been a part of the
   Common Law of this State. Christianity without the spiritual artillery
   of European countries--not Christianity founded on any particular
   religious tenets--not Christianity with an established church and
   titles and spiritual courts, but Christianity with liberty of
   conscience to all men."

   § 92. The Mass.

   Comp. vol. III. § 96-101 and the liturgical Lit. there quoted; also the
   works on Christian and Ecclesiastical Antiquities, e.g. Siegel III.
   361-411.

   The public worship centered in the celebration of the mass as an
   actual, though unbloody, repetition of the sacrifice of Christ for the
   sins of the world. In this respect the Eastern and Western churches are
   fully agreed to this day. They surround this ordinance with all the
   solemnity of a mysterious symbolism. They differ only in minor details.

   Pope Gregory I. improved the Latin liturgy, and gave it that shape
   which it substantially retains in the Roman church. [421] He was filled
   with the idea that the eucharist embodies the reconciliation of heaven
   and earth, of eternity and time, and is fraught with spiritual benefit
   for the living and the pious dead in one unbroken communion. When the
   priest offers the unbloody sacrifice to God, the heavens are opened,
   the angel are present, and the visible and invisible worlds united.
   [422]

   Gregory introduced masses for the dead, [423] in connection with the
   doctrine of purgatory which he developed and popularized. They were
   based upon the older custom of praying for the departed, and were
   intended to alleviate and abridge the penal sufferings of those who
   died in the Catholic faith, but in need of purification from remaining
   infirmities. Very few Catholics are supposed to be prepared for heaven;
   and hence such masses were often ordered beforehand by the dying, or
   provided by friends. [424] They furnished a large income to priests.
   The Oriental church has no clearly defined doctrine of purgatory, but
   likewise holds that the departed are benefited by prayers of the
   living, "especially such as are offered in union with the oblation of
   the bloodless sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ, and by works
   of mercy done in faith for their memory." [425]

   The high estimate of the efficacy of the sacrament led also to the
   abuse of solitary masses, where the priest celebrates without
   attendants. [426] This destroys the original character of the
   institution as a feast of communion with the Redeemer and the redeemed.
   Several synods in the age of Charlemagne protested against the
   practice. The Synod of Mainz in 813 decreed: "No presbyter, as it seems
   to us, can sing masses alone rightly, for how will he say sursum corda!
   or Dominus vobiscum! when there is no one with him?" A reformatory
   Synod of Paris, 829, prohibits these masses, and calls them a
   "reprehensible practice," which has crept in "partly through neglect,
   partly through avarice." [427]

   The mysterious character of the eucharist was changed into the
   miraculous and even the magical with the spread of the belief in the
   doctrine of transubstantiation. But the doctrine was contested in two
   controversies before it triumphed in the eleventh century. [428]

   The language of the mass was Greek in the Eastern, Latin in the Western
   church. The Latin was an unknown tongue to the barbarian races of
   Europe. It gradually went out of use among the descendants of the
   Romans, and gave place to the Romanic languages. But the papal church,
   sacrificing the interests of the people to the priesthood, and rational
   or spiritual worship [429] to external unity, retained the Latin
   language in the celebration of the mass to this day, as the sacred
   language of the church. The Council of Trent went so far as to put even
   the uninspired Latin Vulgate practically on an equality with the
   inspired Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. [430]

   adesse, summis ima sociari, terrena coelestibus jungi, unumque ex

   them are the Missae de Sanctis, celebrated on the anniversaries of the
   saints, and to their honor, though the sacrifice is always offered to
   God.

   [424] Even popes, though addressed by the title "Holiness," while
   living, have to pass through purgatory, and need the prayers of the
   faithful. On the marble sarcophagus of Pius IX., who reigned longer
   than any of his predecessors, and proclaimed his own infallibility in
   the Vatican Council (1870), are the words: "Orate pro eo." Prayers and
   masses are said only for the dead in purgatory, not for the saints in
   heaven who do not need them, nor for the damned in hell who would not
   profit by them.

   [425] Quoted from the Longer Catechism of the Eastern Church (Schaff,
   Creeds II. 504). The Greeks have in their ritual special strophes or
   antiphones for the departed, called nekrosima. Mone, Lat. Hymnen des
   Mittel alters, II. 400, gives some specimens from John of Damascus and
   others. He says, that the Greeks have more hymns for the departed than
   the Latins, but that the Latins have older hymni pro defunctis,
   beginning with Prudentius.

   the Vulgate (April 8, 1546); but when the edition of Pope Sixtus V.
   appeared in 1589 and was enjoined upon the church "by the fullness of
   apostolic power," it was found to be so full of errors and blunders
   that it had to be cancelled, and a new edition prepared under Clement
   VIII. in 1592, which remains the Roman standard edition to this day.

   § 93. The Sermon.

   As the chief part of divine service was unintelligible to the people,
   it was all the more important to supplement it by preaching and
   catechetical instruction in the vernacular tongues. But this is the
   weak spot in the church of the middle ages. [431]

   Pope Gregory I. preached occasionally with great earnestness, but few
   popes followed his example. It was the duty of bishops to preach, but
   they often neglected it. The Council of Clovesho, near London, which
   met in 747 under Cuthbert, archbishop of Canterbury, for the
   reformation of abuses, decreed that the bishops should annually visit
   their parishes, instruct and exhort the abbots and monks, and that all
   presbyters should be able to explain the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's
   Prayer, the mass, and the office of baptism to the people in the
   vernacular. [432] A Synod of Tours, held in the year 813, and a Synod
   of Mainz, held under Rabanus Maurus in 847, decreed that every bishop
   should have a collection of homilies and translate them clearly "in
   rusticam Romanam linguam aut Theotiscam, i.e. into French (Romance) or
   German," "in order that all may understand them." [433]

   The great majority of priests were too ignorant to prepare a sermon,
   and barely understood the Latin liturgical forms. A Synod of Aix, 802,
   prescribed that they should learn the Athanasian and Apostles' Creed,
   the Lord's Prayer with exposition, the Sacramentarium or canon of the
   mass, the formula of exorcism, the commendatio animae, the Penitential,
   the Calendar and the Roman cantus; they should learn to understand the
   homilies for Sundays and holy days as models of preaching, and read the
   pastoral theology of Pope Gregory. This was the sum and substance of
   clerical learning. [434] The study of the Greek Testament and the
   Hebrew Scriptures was out of the question, and there was hardly a
   Western bishop or pope in the middle ages who was able to study the
   divine oracles in the original.

   The best, therefore, that the priests and deacons, and even most of the
   bishops could do was to read the sermons of the fathers. Augustin had
   given this advice to those who were not skilled in composition. It
   became a recognized practice in France and England. Hence the
   collection of homilies, called Homiliaria, for the Gospels and Epistles
   of Sundays and holy days. They are mostly patristic compilations.
   Bede's collection, called Homilice de Tempore, contains thirty-three
   homilies for the summer, fifteen for the winter, twenty-two for Lent,
   besides sermons on saints' days. Charlemagne commissioned Paulus
   Diaconus or Paul Warnefrid (a monk of Monte Cassino and one of his
   chaplains, the historian of the Lombards, and writer of poems on
   saints) to prepare a Homiliarium (or Omiliarius) about a.d. 780, and
   recommended it for adoption in the churches of France. It follows the
   order of Sundays and festivals, is based on the text of the Vulgate,
   and continued in use more or less for several centuries. [435] Other
   collections were made in later times, and even the Reformed church of
   England under Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth found it necessary to
   provide ignorant clergymen with two Books of Homilies adapted to the
   doctrines of the Reformation.

   In this connection we must allude again to the poetic reproductions of
   the Bible history, namely, the divine epos of Caedmon, the Northumbrian
   monk (680), the Saxon Heliand" (Heiland, i.e. Saviour, about 880), and
   the "Christ" or Gospel Harmony of Otfrid (a pupil of Rabanus Maurus,
   about 870). These works were effective popular sermons on the history
   of redemption, and are at the same time the most valuable remains of
   the Anglo-Saxon and old high German dialects of the Teutonic language.
   [436]

   It was, however, not till the Reformation of the sixteenth century that
   the sermon and the didactic element were restored and fully recognized
   in their dignity and importance as regular and essential parts of
   public worship. I say, worship, for to expound the oracles of God, and
   devoutly to listen to such exposition is or ought to be worship both on
   the part of the preacher and on the part of the hearer, as well as
   praying and singing.

   The general church histories mostly neglect or ignore hymnology, which
   is the best reflection of Christian life and worship.

   The classical period of Greek church poetry extends from about 650 to
   820, and nearly coincides with the iconoclastic controversy. The
   enthusiasm for the worship of saints and images kindled a poetic
   inspiration, and the chief advocates of that worship were also the
   chief hymnists. [437] Their memory is kept sacred in the Eastern
   church. Their works are incorporated in the ritual books, especially
   the Menaea, which contain in twelve volumes (one for each month) the
   daily devotions and correspond to the Latin Breviary. [438] Many are
   still unpublished and preserved in convent libraries. They celebrate
   the holy Trinity and the Incarnation, the great festivals, and
   especially also the Virgin Mary, the saints and martyrs, and sacred
   icons.

   The Greek church poetry is not metrical and rhymed, but written in
   rhythmical prose for chanting, like the Psalms, the hymns of the New
   Testament, the Gloria in Excelsis and the Te Deum. The older hymnists
   were also melodists and composed the music. [439] The stanzas are
   called troparia; [440] the first troparion is named hirmos, because it
   strikes the tune and draws the others after it. [441] Three or more
   stanzas form an ode; three little odes are a triodion; nine odes or
   three triodia form a canon. The odes usually end with a doxology (doxa)
   and a stanza in praise of Mary the Mother of God (theotokion). [442] A
   hymn with a tune of its own is called an idiomelon. [443]

   This poetry fills, according to Neale, more than nine tenths or four
   fifths of the Greek service books. It has been heretofore very little
   known and appreciated in the West, but is now made accessible. [444] It
   contains some precious gems of genuine Christian hymns, buried in a
   vast mass of monotonous, bombastic and tasteless laudations of unknown
   confessors and martyrs, and wonder-working images. [445]

   The Greek church poetry begins properly with the anonymous but
   universally accepted and truly immortal Gloria in Excelsis of the third
   century. [446] The poems of Gregory of Nazianzus (d. 390), and Synesius
   of Cyrene (d. about 414), who used the ordinary classical measures, are
   not adapted and were not intended for public worship. [447]

   The first hymnist of the Byzantine period, is Anatolius patriarch of
   Constantinople (d. about 458). He struck out the new path of harmonious
   prose, and may be compared to Venantius Fortunatus in the West. [448]

   We now proceed to the classical period of Greek church poetry.

   In the front rank of Greek hymnists stands St. John Of Damascus,
   surnamed Mansur (d. in extreme old age about 780). He is the greatest
   systematic theologian of the Eastern church and chief champion of
   image-worship against iconoclasm under the reigns of Leo the Isaurian
   (717-741), and Constantinus Copronymus (741-775). He spent a part of
   his life in the convent of Mar Sâba (or St. Sabas) in the desolate
   valley of the Kedron, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. [449] He was
   thought to have been especially inspired by the Virgin Mary, the patron
   of that Convent, to consecrate his muse to the praise of Christ. He
   wrote a great part of the Octoechus, which contains the Sunday services
   of the Eastern church. His canon for Easter Day is called "the golden
   Canon" or "the queen of Canons," and is sung at midnight before Easter,
   beginning with the shout of joy, "Christ is risen," and the response,
   "Christ is risen indeed." His memory is celebrated December 4. [450]

   Next to him, and as melodist even above him in the estimation of the
   Byzantine writers, is St. Cosmas Of Jerusalem, called the Melodist. He
   is, as Neale says, "the most learned of the Greek poets, and the
   Oriental Adam of St. Victor." Cosmas and John of Damascus were
   foster-brothers, friends and fellow-monks at Mar Sâba, and corrected
   each other's compositions. Cosmas was against his will consecrated
   bishop of Maiuma near Gaza in Southern Palestine, by John, patriarch of
   Jerusalem. He died about 760 and is commemorated on the 14th of
   October. The stichos prefixed to his life says:


   "Where perfect sweetness dwells, is Cosmas gone;

   But his sweet lays to cheer the church live on." [451]

   The third rank is occupied by St. Theophanes, surnamed the Branded,
   [452] one of the most fruitful poets. He attended the second Council of
   Nicaea (787). During the reign of Leo the Arminian (813) he suffered
   imprisonment, banishment and mutilation for his devotion to the Icons,
   and died about 820. His "Chronography" is one of the chief sources for
   the history of the image-controversy. [453]

   The following specimen from Adam's lament of his fall is interesting:


   "Adam sat right against the Eastern gate,

   By many a storm of sad remembrance tost:

   O me! so ruined by the serpent's hate!

   O me! so glorious once, and now so lost!

   So mad that bitter lot to choose!

   Beguil'd of all I had to lose!

   Must I then, gladness of my eyes, --

   Must I then leave thee, Paradise,

   And as an exile go?

   And must I never cease to grieve

   How once my God, at cool of eve,

   Came down to walk below?

   O Merciful! on Thee I call:

   O Pitiful! forgive my fall!"

   The other Byzantine hymnists who preceded or succeeded those three
   masters, are the following. Their chronology is mostly uncertain or
   disputed.

   Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople in the reign of Heracleus
   (610-641), figures in the beginning of the Monotheletic controversy,
   and probably suggested the union formula to that emperor. He is
   supposed by Christ to be the author of a famous and favorite hymn
   Akathistos, in praise of Mary as the deliverer of Constantinople from
   the siege of the Persians (630), but it is usually ascribed to Georgius
   Pisida. [454]

   Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem (629), celebrated in Anacreontic
   metres the praises of Christ, the apostles, and martyrs, and wrote
   idiomela with music for the church service [455]

   Maximus The Confessor (580-662), the leader and martyr of the orthodox
   dyotheletic doctrine in the Monotheletic controversy, one of the
   profoundest divines and mystics of the Eastern Church, wrote a few
   hymns. [456]

   Germanus (634-734), bishop of Cyzicus, then patriarch of Constantinople
   (715), was deposed, 730, for refusing to comply with the iconoclastic
   edicts of the Emperor Leo the Isaurian (717-741), and died in private
   life, aged about one hundred years. He is "regarded by the Greeks as
   one of their most glorious Confessors" (Neale). Among his few poetical
   compositions are stanzas on Symeon the Stylite, on the prophet Elijah,
   on the Decollation of John the Baptist, and a canon on the
   wonder-working Image in Edessa. [457]

   Andrew Of Crete (660-732) was born at Damascus, became monk at
   Jerusalem, deacon at Constantinople, archbishop of Crete, took part in
   the Monotheletic Synod of 712, but afterwards returned to orthodoxy. In
   view of this change and his advocacy of the images, he was numbered
   among the saints. He is regarded as the inventor of the Canons. His
   "Great Canon" is sung right through on the Thursday of Mid-Lent week,
   which is called from that hymn. It is a confession of sin and an
   invocation of divine mercy. It contains no less than two hundred and
   fifty (Neale says, three hundred) stanzas. [458]

   John of Damascus reduced the unreasonable length of the canons.

   Another Andrew, called jAndreva" Puro'" or Purrov", is credited with
   eight idiomela in the Menaea, from which Christ has selected the praise
   of Peter and Paul as the best. [459]

   Stephen The Sabaite (725-794) was a nephew of John of Damascus, and
   spent fifty-nine years in the convent of Mar Sâba, which is pitched,
   like an eagle's nest, on the wild rocks of the Kedron valley. He is
   commemorated on the 13th of July. He struck the key-note of Neale's
   exquisite hymn of comfort, "Art thou weary," which is found in some
   editions of the Octoechus. He is the inspirer rather than the author of
   that hymn, which is worthy of a place in every book of devotional
   poetry. [460]

   Romanus, deacon in Berytus, afterwards priest in Constantinople, is one
   of the most original and fruitful among the older poets. Petra ascribes
   to him twenty-five hymns. He assigned him to the reign of Anastasius I.
   (491-518), but Christ to the reign of Anastasius II. (713-719), and
   Jacobi with greater probability to the time of Constantinus Pogonatus
   (681-685). [461]

   Theodore Of The Studium (a celebrated convent near Constantinople) is
   distinguished for his sufferings in the iconoclastic controversy, and
   died in exile, 826, on the eleventh of November. He wrote canons for
   Lent and odes for the festivals of saints. The spirited canon on Sunday
   of Orthodoxy in celebration of the final triumph of image-worship in
   842, is ascribed to him, but must be of later date as he died before
   that victory. [462]

   Joseph Of The Studium, a brother of Theodore, and monk of that convent,
   afterwards Archbishop of Thessalonica (hence also called
   Thessalonicensis), died in prison in consequence of tortures inflicted
   on him by order of the Emperor Theophilus (829-842). He is sometimes
   confounded (even by Neale) with Joseph Hymnographus; but they are
   distinguished by Nicephorus and commemorated on different days. [463]

   Theoctistus Of The Studium (about 890) is the author of a "Suppliant
   Canon to Jesus," the only thing known of him, but the sweetest
   Jesus-hymn of the Greek Church. [464]

   Joseph, called Hymnographus (880), is the most prolific, most
   bombastic, and most tedious of Greek hymn-writers. He was a Sicilian by
   birth, at last superintendent of sacred vessels in a church at
   Constantinople. He was a friend of Photius, and followed him into
   exile. He is credited with a very large number of canons in the Mencaea
   and the Octoechus. [465]

   Tarasius, patriarch of Constantinople (784), was the chief mover in the
   restoration of Icons and the second Council of Nicaea (787). He died
   Feb. 25, 806. His hymns are Unimportant. [466]

   EUTHYMIUS, usually known as Syngelus or Syncellus (died about 910), is
   the author of a penitential canon to the Virgin Mary, which is much
   esteemed in the East. [467]

   Elias, bishop of Jerusalem about 761, and Orestes, bishop of the same
   city, 996-1012, have been brought to light as poets by the researches
   of Pitra from the libraries of Grotta Ferrata, and other convents.

   In addition to these may be mentioned Methodius (846) [468] Photius,
   Patriarch of Constantinople (d. 891), Metrophanes of Smyrna (900), Leo
   VI., or the Philosopher, who troubled the Eastern Church by a fourth
   marriage (886-917), Symeon Metaphrastes (Secretary and Chancellor of
   the Imperial Court at Constantinople, about 900), Kasias, Nilus
   Xanthopulus, Joannes Geometra, and Mauropus (1060). With the last the
   Greek hymnody well nigh ceased. A considerable number of hymns cannot
   be traced to a known author. [469]

   We give in conclusion the best specimens of Greek hymnody as reproduced
   and adapted to modern use by Dr. Neale.

   'Tis the Day of Resurrection.
   (Anagstaseos hemera.)

   By St. John of Damascus.


   'Tis the Day of Resurrection,

   Earth, tell it out abroad!

   The Passover of gladness,

   The Passover of God!

   From death to life eternal,

   From earth unto the sky,

   Our Christ hath brought us over,

   With hymns of victory.


   Our hearts be pure from evil,

   That we may see aright

   The Lord in rays eternal

   Of resurrection light:

   And, listening to His accents,

   May hear, so calm and plain,

   His own "All hail!"--and hearing,

   May raise the victor strain.


   Now let the heavens be!

   Let earth her song begin!

   Let the round world keep triumph,

   And all that is therein:

   In grateful exultation

   Their notes let all things blend,

   For Christ the Lord hath risen,

   Our joy that hath no end.

   Jesu, name all names above.

   (Ihsou' glukuvtate.)

   By St. Theoctistus of the Studium.


   Jesu, name all names above,

   Jesu, best and dearest,

   Jesu, Fount of perfect love,

   Holiest, tenderest, nearest!

   Jesu, source of grace completest,

   Jesu truest, Jesu sweetest,

   Jesu, Well of power divine,

   Make me, keep me, seal me Thine!

   Jesu, open me the gate

   Which the sinner entered,

   Who in his last dying state

   Wholly on Thee ventured.

   Thou whose wounds are ever pleading,

   And Thy passion interceding,

   From my misery let me rise

   To a home in Paradise!


   Thou didst call the prodigal;

   Thou didst pardon Mary:

   Thou whose words can never fall

   Love can never vary,

   Lord, amidst my lost condition

   Give--for Thou canst give--contrition!

   Thou canst pardon all mine ill

   If Thou wilt: O say, "I will!"


   Woe, that I have turned aside

   After fleshly pleasure!

   Woe, that I have never tried

   For the heavenly treasure!

   Treasure, safe in homes supernal;

   Incorruptible, eternal!

   Treasure no less price hath won

   Than the Passion of the Son!


   Jesu, crowned with thorns for me,

   Scourged for my transgression!

   Witnessing, through agony,


   That Thy good confession;

   Jesu, clad in purple raiment,

   For my evils making payment;

   Let not all thy woe and pain,

   Let not Calvary be in vain!


   When I reach Death's bitter sea,

   And its waves roll higher,

   Help the more forsaking me,

   As the storm draws nigher:

   Jesu, leave me not to languish,

   Helpless, hopeless, full of anguish!

   Tell me,--"Verily, I say,

   Thou shalt be with me to-day!"


   Art thou weary?

   (Kovpon te kai; kavmaton.)


   By St. Stephen The Sabaite.


   Art thou weary, art thou languid,

   Art thou sore distrest?

   "Come to me"--saith One--"and coming

   Be at rest!"


   Hath He marks to lead me to Him,

   If He be my Guide?

   "In His feet and hands are wound-prints,

   And His side."


   Is there diadem, as Monarch,

   That His brow adorns?

   "Yea, a crown in very surety,

   But of thorns!"


   If I find Him, if I follow,

   What His guerdon here?

   "Many a sorrow, many a labor,

   Many a tear."


   If I still hold closely to Him,

   What hath He at last?

   Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,

   Jordan past!"


   If I ask Him to receive me,

   Will He say me nay?

   Not till earth, and not till heaven

   Pass away!"


   Finding, following, keeping, struggling

   Is He sure to bless?

   Angels, martyrs, prophets, virgins,

   Answer, Yes!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   [437] Neale and Pitra point out this connection, and Jacobi (l.c. p.
   210 sq.) remarks: "Im Kampfe für die Bilder steigerte sich die Glut der
   sinnlichen Frömmigkeit, und mit dem Siege der Bilderverehrung im
   neunten Jahrhundert ist eine innerliche und aeusserliche Zunahme des
   Heiligenkultus und namentlich ein Wachsthum der Marienvehrung
   unverkennbar."

   [438] The Menaia(sc. biblia, Monatsbücher) are published at Venice in
   the Tipografia Greca (he Hellenike tupographia tou phoinikos). Each
   month has its separate title: Menaion tou Ianouariou or Men Ianouarios
   ,etc. January begins with the commemoration of the circumcision of our
   Lord and the commemoration of St. Basil the Great, and December ends
   with the mneme tes hosias Metros hemon Melanes tes Rhomaias .The copy
   before me (from the Harvard University Library) is dated 1852, and
   printed in beautiful Greek type, with the directions in red ink. On
   older editions see Mone, Lat. Hymnen, II. p. x. sqq. The other books of
   the Greek Ritual are the Paracletice (Parakletike, sc. biblos) or great
   Octoechus (Oktoechos, sc. biblos), which contains the Sunday services
   the Triodion (Triodion, the Lent-volume), and the Pentecostarion
   (Pentekostarion, the office for Easter-tide). " On a moderate
   computation," says Neale, " these volumes comprise 5,000 closely
   printed quarto pages, in double columns, of which at least 4,000 are
   poetry." See the large works of Leo Allatius, De libris eccles.
   Graecorum; Goar, Euchologion sive Rituale Graecorum, and especially the
   Second volume of Neale's History of the Holy Eastern Church (1850), p.
   819 sqq.

   [439] Hence they were called melodoias well as poietaiin distinction
   from the mere humnographoi. The Greek service books are also music
   books. Christ discusses Byzantine music, and gives some specimens in
   Prol. p. CXI-CXLII.

   [440] Troparion, the diminutive of tropos, as modulus is of modus, was
   originally a musical term.

   [441] Eirmos, tractus, a train, series, was likewise originally a
   musical term like akolouthiaand the Latin jubilatio, sequentia. See §
   96.

   [442] Theotokion, sc. troparion(more rarely, but more correctly, with
   the accent on the ante-penultima, theotokion), from theotokos, Deipara.
   The stauro-theotokion celebrates Mary at the cross, and corresponds to
   the Stabat Mater dolorosa of the Latins.

   [443] Hidiomelon. There are several other designations of various kinds
   of poems, as akolouthia(the Latin sequentia), anabathmoi(tria
   antiphona), antiphonon, apolutikion (breve troparium sub finem officii
   vespertini), aposticha, automelon, exaposteilarion, eothina, kathisma,
   katabasia, kontaria, makarismoi, megalunaria, oikoi, prosomoia,
   stichera, triodia, tetraoda, diodia, psalterion, tropologion. These
   terms and technical forms are fully discussed by Christ in the
   Prolegomena. Comp. also the Introduction of Neale

   [444] By Vormbaum (in the third volume of Daniel's Thesaurus which
   needs reconstruction), Pitra, and Christ. The Continental writers seem
   to be ignorant of Dr. Neale, the best English connoisseur of the
   liturgical and poetic literature of the Greek church. His translations
   are, indeed, very free reproductions and transfusions, but for this
   very reason better adapted to Western taste than the originals. The
   hymn of Clement of Alexandria in praise of the Logos has undergone a
   similar transformation by Dr. Henry M. Dexter, and has been made useful
   for public worship. See vol. II. 231.

   [445] Even Neale, with all his admiration for the Greek Church, admits
   that the Menaea contain a "deluge of worthless compositions: tautology
   repeated till it becomes almost sickening; the merest commonplace,
   again and again decked in the tawdry shreds of tragic language, ind
   twenty or thirty times presenting the same thought in slightly varying
   terms." (Hymns E.Ch. p. 88 sq., 3d ed.)

   [446] See vol. II. 227, and add to the Lit. there quoted: Christ, p.
   38-40, who gives from the Codex Alexandrinus and other MSS. the Greek
   text of the morning hymn (the expanded Angelic anthem Doxa en
   hupsistois theo) and two evening hymns Aineite, paides . kurion, and
   Phos hilaron hagias doxes) of the Greek church.

   [447] See vol. III. 581 and 921. Christ begins his collection with the
   hymns of Synesius, p. 3-23, and of Gregory Nazianzen, 23-32.

   [448] See the specimens in vol. III. 583-585. Neale begins his
   translations with Anatolius. Christ treats of him p. XLI, and gives his
   stichera anastasimafind three idiomela(hymns with their own melody),
   113-117. More than a hundred poems in the Menaea and the Octoechus bear
   the name of Anatolius, but Christ conjectures that stichera anatolika
   is a generic name, like katanuktikaand nekrosima.

   [449] See a description of this most curious structure in all
   Palestine, in my book Through Bible Lands (N. Y. 1879), p. 278 sqq.

   [450] The poetry of John of D. in his Opera ed. Le Quien (Par. 1712),
   Tom. I. 673-693; Poëtae Graeci veteres (Colon. 1614), Tom. II. 737
   sqq.; Christ, Anthol. gr. Prol. XLIV. sqq., p. 117-121, and p. 205-236.
   Vormbaum, in Daniel, III. 80-97, gives six of his odes in Greek;
   Bässler, 162-164, two (and two in German, 21, 22); Neale nine English
   versions. The best of his hymns and canons are Eis ten christou
   gennesin(or eis ten theogonian), Eis ta theophaneia, Eis ten kuriaken
   tou Pascha, Eis ten pentekosten, Eis ten analepsin tou Christou,Euche,
   Idiomela en akolouthia tou exodiastikou, Eis ten koimesin tes
   theotokou.. The last begins with this stanza (Christ, p. 229): Anoixo
   to stoma mou, kai plerothesetai pneumatos; kai logou epeuxomai te
   basilidi metri; kai ophthesomai phaidrospanegurizon; kai aso gethomenos
   tautes ta thaumata.

   [451] Gallandi, Bibl. Patrum, XIII. 234 sqq.; Christ, XLIX sq.,
   161-164. Christ calls him "princeps melodorum graecorum," and gives ten
   of his canons and several triodia; Daniel (III. 55-79) twelve odes.
   Among the best are Eis ten tou Christou gennesin, Eis ta theophaneia,
   Eis ten pentekosten, Pros Christon, Eis ten hupsosin tou staurou, Eis
   to mega sabbaton. Neale has reproduced eight odes of Cosmas and a cento
   on the Transfiguration. The Nativity hymn begins (Christ p. 165):
   Christos gennatai; doxasate; Christos ex ouranon; apantesate; Christos
   epi ges ; hupsothete; asate to kurio pasa he ge, kai en euphrosune
   anumnesate, laoi, hoti dedoxastai.

   [452] oGraptos, with reference to his sufferings.

   [453] According to Christ (Prol. XLIV), he was after the restoration of
   the images in the churches of Constantinople, 842, elected metropolitan
   of Nicaea and died in peace. But according to the Bollandists and other
   authorities, he died much earlier in exile at Samothrace about 818 or
   820, in consequence of his sufferings for the Icons. Neale reports that
   Theophanes was betrothed in childhood to a lady named Megalis, but
   persuaded her, on their wedding day, to retire to a convent. Christ
   gives several of his idiomela and stichera necrosima, p. 121-130. See
   also Daniel, III. 110-112, and Neale's translations of the idiomela on
   Friday of Cheese-Sunday (i.e. Quinquagesima), and the stichera at the
   first vespers of Cheese-Sunday (90-95). The last is entitled by Neale:
   "Adam's Complaint," and he thinks that Milton, "as an universal
   scholar," must, in Eve's lamentation, have had in his eye the last
   stanza which we give in the text. But this is very doubtful. The
   Chronographia of Theophanes is published in the Bonn. ed. of the
   Byzantine historians, 1839, and in Migne's "Patrol. Graeca," Tom. 108
   (1861). His biography see in the Acta Sanct. ed. Bolland. in XII.
   Martii.

   [454] Christ (p. LII sq., p. 140-147) reasons chiefly from
   chronological considerations. The poem is called akathistos(sc. humnos)
   testheotokou, because it was chanted while priest and people were
   standing. During the singing of other hymns they were seated; hence the
   latter are called kathismata, (from kathizesthai). See Christ, Prol. p.
   LXII and p. 54 sqq. Jacobi says of the Akathistos (l.c. p. 230): " Was
   Enthusiasmus für die heilige Jungfrau, was Kenntniss biblischer Typen,
   überhaupt religiöser Gegenstände und Gedanken zu leisten vermochten,
   was Schmuck der Sprache. Gewandtheit des Ausdrucks, Kunst der Rhythmen
   und der Reime hinzufügen komnten, das ist hier in unübertroffenem Masse
   bewirkt."

   [455] Christ, XXVII, XXXV, LIII, 43-47 (anakreontika), and 96
   (idiomelatonTheophaneion). Daniel, III. 20-46, gives thirteen pieces of
   Sophronius from Pet. Metranga, Spicilegium Romanum, 1840, Tom. IV.

   [456] Poetae Gr. vet. Tom. II. 192 sqq. Daniel, III. 97-103, gives
   three hymns, among them a beautiful humnoshiketerioseisChristonChrist
   omits Maximus.

   [457] See his Opera in Migne's "Patrol. Graeca" Tom. 98 (1865); and his
   poems in Christ, XLIII. 98 (idiomelonon the Nativity); Daniel, III. 79,
   a hymn in praise of Mary, beginning Salpisomen en salpingi asmaton, and
   ending with ascribing to her almighty power of intercession: Ouden gar
   adunaton te mesiteia sou.

   [458] Fr. Combefisius first edited the works of Andreas Cretensis, Par.
   1644. Christ, 147-161, gives the first part of "the great canon" (about
   one-fourth), and a new canon in praise of Peter. The last is not in the
   Menaea but has been brought to light from Paris and Vatican MSS. by
   Card. Pitra. Daniel, III. 47-54, has seven hymns of Andreas, of which
   the first is on the nativity, beginning: Euphrainesthe dikaioi; Ouranoi
   agalliasthe; Skirtesate ta hore, Tou Christou gennethentos. Neale
   translated four: Stichera for Great Thursday; Troparia for Palm Sunday;
   a portion of the Great Canon; Stichera for the Second Week of the Great
   Fast. His Opera in Migne's " Patrol. Gr." T. 97(1860), p. 1306sqq.

   [460] Christ and Daniel ignore Stephen. Neale calls the one and only
   hymn which he translated, "Idiomela in the Week of the First Oblique
   Tone," and adds: "These stanzas, which strike me as very sweet, are not
   in all the editions of the Octoechus." He ascribes to him also a
   poetical composition on the Martyrs of the monastery of Mar Sâba (March
   20), and one on the Circumcision. "His style," he says, "seems formed
   on that of S. Cosmas, rather than on that of his own uncle. He is not
   deficient in elegance and richness of typology, but exhibits something
   of sameness, and is occasionally guilty of very hard metaphors."

   [461] Christ, 131-140, gives his "Psalm of the Holy Apostles," and a
   Nativity hymn. Comp. p. li. sq. Jacobi (p. 203 sq.) discusses the data
   and traces in Romanus allusions to the Monotheletic controversy, which
   began about a.d.630. He gives a German version in part of the beautiful
   description of the benefits of redemption, p. 221 sq.

   [462] Christ, p. 101 sq.; Daniel, III. 101-109. Neale has translated
   four odes of Theodorus Studita, one on the judgment-day
   (hokurioserchetai). Pitra has brought to light from MSS. eighteen of
   his poems on saints. See his Opera in Migne " Patr. Gr." 99.

   [463] Christ, p. xlvii.: "Nicephorus duos Iosephos hymnorum scriptores
   recenset, quorum alterum Studiorum monasterii socium, alterum
   peregrinum dicit. Priorem intelligo Iosephum fratrem minorem Theodori,

   hymns formerly ascribed to Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, during
   the Monotheletic controversy, as Paranikas has shown (Christ, Prol., p.

   [468] Not to be confounded with Methodius Eubulius, of Patara, the
   martyr (d. 311), who is also counted among the poets for his psalm of
   the Virgins in praise of chastity (parthenion); see vol. II. 811, and
   Christ, p. 33-37. Bässler (p.4 sq.) gives a German version of it by
   Fortlage.

   [469] Pitra concludes his collection with eighty-three anonymous hymns,
   thirty-two of which he assigns to the poets of the Studium. See also

   Clichtovaeus (Paris 1515, Bas. 1517 and 1519.), Cassander (Col. 1556),
   Ellinger (Frankf. a. M. 1578), Georg Fabricius (Poetarum Veterum

   § 96. Latin Hymns and Hymnists.

   The Latin church poetry of the middle ages is much better known than
   the Greek, and remains to this day a rich source of devotion in the
   Roman church and as far as poetic genius and religious fervor are
   appreciated. The best Latin hymns have passed into the Breviary and
   Missal (some with misimprovements), and have been often reproduced in
   modern languages. The number of truly classical hymns, however, which
   were inspired by pure love to Christ and can be used with profit by
   Christians of every name, is comparatively small. The poetry of the
   Latin church is as full of Mariolatry and hagiolatry as the poetry of
   the Greek church. It is astonishing what an amount of chivalrous and
   enthusiastic devotion the blessed Mother of our Lord absorbed in the
   middle ages. In Mone's collection the hymns to the Virgin fill a whole
   volume of 457 pages, the hymns to saints another volume of 579 pages,
   while the first volume of only 461 pages is divided between hymns to
   God and to the angels. The poets intended to glorify Christ through his
   mother, but the mother overshadows the child, as in the pictures of the
   Madonna. She was made the mediatrix of all divine grace, and was almost
   substituted for Christ, who was thought to occupy a throne of majesty
   too high for sinful man to reach without the aid of his mother and her
   tender human sympathies. She is addressed with every epithet of praise,
   as Mater Dei, Dei Genitrix, Mater summi Domini, Mater misericordiae,
   Mater bonitatis, Mater dolorosa, Mater jucundosa, Mater speciosa, Maris
   Stella, Mundi domina, Mundi spes, Porta paradisi, Regina coeli, Radix
   gratiae, Virgo virginum, Virgo regia Dei. Even the Te Deum was adapted
   to her by the distinguished St. Bonaventura so as to read "Te Matrem
   laudamus, Te Virginem confitemur." [470]

   The Latin, as the Greek, hymnists were nearly all monks; but an emperor
   (Charlemagne?) and a king (Robert of France) claim a place of honor
   among them.

   The sacred poetry of the Latin church may be divided into three
   periods: 1, The patristic period from Hilary (d. 368) and Ambrose (d.
   397) to Venantius Fortunatus (d. about 609) and Gregory I. (d. 604); 2,
   the early mediaeval period to Peter Damiani (d. 1072); 3, the classical
   period to the thirteenth century. The first period we have considered
   in a previous volume. Its most precious legacy to the church universal
   is the Te Deum laudamus. It is popularly ascribed to Ambrose of Milan
   (or Ambrose and Augustin jointly), but in its present completed form
   does not appear before the first half of the sixth century, although
   portions of it may be traced to earlier Greek origin; it is, like the
   Apostles' Creed, and the Greek Gloria in Excelsis, a gradual growth of
   the church rather than the production of any individual. [471] The
   third period embraces the greatest Latin hymnists, as Bernard of
   Morlaix (monk of Cluny about 1150), Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153),
   Adam of St. Victor (d. 1192), Bonaventura (d. 1274), Thomas Aquinas (d.
   1274), Thomas a Celano (about 1250), Jacopone (d. 1306), and produced
   the last and the best Catholic hymns which can never die, as Hora
   Novisasima; Jesu dulcis memoria; Salve caput cruentatum; Stabat Mater;
   and Dies Irae. In this volume we are concerned with the second period.

   Venantius Fortunatus, of Poitiers, and his cotemporary, Pope Gregory
   I., form the transition from the patristic poetry of Sedulius and
   Prudentius to the classic poetry of the middle ages.

   Fortunatus (about 600) [472] was the fashionable poet of his day. A
   native Italian, he emigrated to Gaul, travelled extensively, became
   intimate with St. Gregory of Tours, and the widowed queen Radegund when
   she lived in ascetic retirement, and died as bishop of Poitiers. He was
   the first master of the trochaic tetrameter, and author of three
   hundred poems, chief among which are the two famous passion hymns:


   "Vexilla regis prodeunt,"

   "The Royal Banners forward go;"

   and


   "Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis,"

   "Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle."

   Both have a place in the Roman Breviary. [473]

   Gregory I. (d. 604), though far inferior to Fortunatus in poetic
   genius, occupies a prominent rank both in church poetry and church
   music. He followed Ambrose in the metrical form, the prayer-like tone,
   and the churchly spirit, and wrote for practical use. He composed about
   a dozen hymns, several of which have found a place in the Roman
   Breviary. [474] The best is his Sunday hymn:


   "Primo dierum omnium,"

   "On this first day when heaven on earth,"

   or, as it has been changed in the Breviary,


   "Primo die quo Trinitas,"

   "To-day the Blessed Three in One

   Began the earth and skies;

   To-day a Conqueror, God the Son,

   Did from the grave arise;

   We too will wake, and, in despite

   Of sloth and languor, all unite,

   As Psalmists bid, through the dim night

   Waiting with wistful eyes." [475]

   The Venerable Bede (d. 735) wrote a beautiful ascension hymn


   "Hymnum canamus gloriae,"

   "A hymn of glory let us sing;"

   and a hymn for the Holy innocents,


   "Hymnum canentes Martyrum,"

   "The hymn of conquering martyrs raise." [476]

   Rabanus Maurus, a native of Mainz (Mayence) on the Rhine, a pupil of
   Alcuin, monk and abbot in the convent of Fulda, archbishop of Mainz
   from 847 to 856, was the chief Poet of the Carolingian age, and the
   first German who wrote Latin hymns. Some of them have passed into the
   Breviary. [477]

   He is probably the author of the pentecostal Veni, Creator Spiritus.
   [478] It outweighs all his other poems. It is one of the classical
   Latin hymns, and still used in the Catholic church on the most solemn
   occasions, as the opening of Synods, the creating of popes and the
   crowning of kings. It was invested with a superstitious charm. It is
   the only Breviary hymn which passed into the Anglican liturgy as part
   of the office for ordaining priests and consecrating bishops. [479] The
   authorship has been variously ascribed to Charlemagne, [480] to Gregory
   the Great, [481] also to Alcuin, and even to Ambrose, without any good
   reason. It appears first in 898, is found in the MS. containing the
   Poems of Rabanus Maurus, and in all the old German Breviaries; it was
   early and repeatedly translated into German [482] and agrees very well
   in thought and expression with his treatise on the Holy Spirit. [483]

   We give the original with two translations. [484]


   Veni, Creator Spiritus,

   Mentes tuorum visita.

   Imple superna gratia

   Quo tu creasti pectora.

   Creator, Spirit, Lord of Grace,

   O make our hearts Thy dwelling-place,

   And with Thy might celestial aid

   The souls of those whom Thou hast made.


   Qui Paracletus diceris,

   Donum Dei altissimi,

   Fons vivus, ignis, charitas,

   Et spiritalis unctio.

   Come from the throne of God above,

   O Paraclete, O Holy Dove,

   Come, Oil of gladness, cleansing Fire,

   And Living Spring of pure desire.


   Tu septiformis munere,

   Dextrae Dei tu digitus,

   Tu rite Promissum Patris,

   Sermone ditans guttura.

   O Finger of the Hand Divine,

   The sevenfold gifts of Grace are Thine,

   And touched by Thee the lips proclaim

   All praise to God's most holy Name.


   Accende lumen sensibus,

   Infunde amorem cordibus;

   Infirma nostri corporis,

   Virtute firmans perpetim. [485]

   Then to our souls Thy light impart,

   And give Thy Love to every heart

   Turn all our weakness into might,

   O Thou, the Source of Life and Light.


   Hostem repellas longius,

   Pacemque dones protinus.

   Ductore sic te praevio,

   Vitemus omne noxium.

   Protect us from the assailing foe,

   And Peace, the fruit of Love, bestow;

   Upheld by Thee, our Strength and Guide,

   No evil can our steps betide.


   Per te sciamus, da Patrem,

   Noscamus atque Filium,

   Te utriusque Spiritum,

   Credamus omni tempore.

   Spirit of Faith, on us bestow

   The Father and the Son to know;

   And, of the Twain, the Spirit, Thee;

   Eternal One, Eternal Three.


   [Sit laus Patri cum Filio,

   Sancto simul Paracleto,

   Nobisque mittat Filius

   Charisma Sancti Spiritus.] [486]

   To God the Father let us sing;

   To God the Son, our risen King;

   And equally with These adore

   The Spirit, God for evermore.


   [Praesta hoc Pater piissime,

   Patrique compar unice,

   Cum Spiritu Paracleto,

   Regnans per omne saeculum.] See note above.


   O Holy Ghost, Creator come!

   Thy people's minds pervade;

   And fill, with Thy supernatural grace,

   The souls which Thou hast made.


   Kindle our senses to a flame,

   And fill our hearts with love,

   And, through our bdies' weakness,

   still

   Pour valor from above!


   Thou who art called the Paraclete,

   The gift of God most high-

   Thou living fount, and fire and love,

   Our spirit's pure ally;


   Drive further off our enemy,

   And straightway give us peace;

   That with Thyself as such a guide,

   We may from evil cease.


   Thou sevenfold giver of all good;

   Finger of God's right hand;

   Thou promise of the Father, rich

   In words for every land;


   Through Thee may we the Father know,

   And thus confess the Son;

   For Thee, from both the Holy Ghost,

   We praise while time shall run.

   In this connection we mention the Veni, Sancte Spiritus, the other
   great pentecostal hymn of the middle ages. It is generally ascribed to
   King Robert of France (970-1031), the son and success or of Hugh Capet.
   [487] He was distinguished for piety and charity, like his more famous
   successor, St. Louis IX., and better fitted for the cloister than the
   throne. He was disciplined by the pope (998) for marrying a distant
   cousin, and obeyed by effecting a divorce. He loved music and poetry,
   founded convents and churches, and supported three hundred paupers. His
   hymn reveals in terse and musical language an experimental knowledge of
   the gifts and operations of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. It is
   superior to the companion hymn, Veni, Creator Spiritus. Trench calls it
   "the loveliest" of all the Latin hymns, but we would give this praise
   rather to St. Bernard's Jesu dulcis memoria ("Jesus, the very thought
   of Thee"). The hymn contains ten half-stanzas of three lines each with
   a refrain in ium. Each line has seven syllables, and ends with a double
   or triple rhyme; the third line rhymes with the third line of the
   following half-stanza. Neale has reproduced the double ending of each
   third line (as "brilliancy"--"radiancy").


   Veni, Sancte Spiritus,

   Et emittee coelitus

   Lucis tuae radium.

   Holy Spirit, God of light!

   Come, and on our inner sight

   Pour Thy bright and heavenly ray!


   Veni, Pater pauperum,

   Veni, dator munerum,

   Veni, lumen cordium.

   Father of the lowly! come;

   Here, Great Giver! be Thy home,

   Sunshine of our hearts, for aye!


   Consolator optime,

   Dulcis hospes animae,

   Dulce refrigerium:

   Inmost Comforter and best!

   Of our souls the dearest Guest,

   Sweetly all their thirst allay;


   In labore requies,

   In aestu temperies,

   In fletu solatium.

   In our toils be our retreat,

   Be our shadow in the heat,

   Come and wipe our tears away.


   O lux beatissima,

   Reple cordis intima,

   Tuorum fidelium.

   O Thou Light, all pure and blest!

   Fill with joy this weary breast,

   Turning darkness into day.


   Sine tuo numine

   Nihil est in homine

   Nihil est innoxium,

   For without Thee nought we find,

   Pure or strong in human kind,

   Nought that has not gone astray.


   Lava quod est sordidum,

   Riga quod est aridum,

   Sana quod est saucium.

   Wash us from the stains of sin,

   Gently soften all within,

   Wounded spirits heal and stay.


   Flecte quod est rigidum,

   Fove quod est languidum,

   Rege quod est devium.

   What is hard and stubborn bend,

   What is feeble soothe and tend,

   What is erring gently sway.


   Da tuis fidelibus,

   In te confitentibus,

   Sacrum septenarium;

   To Thy faithful servants give,

   Taught by Thee to trust and live,

   Sevenfold blessing from this day;


   Da virtutis meritum,

   Da salutis exitum,

   Da perenne gaudium. [488]

   Make our title clear, we pray,

   When we drop this mortal clay;

   Then,--O give us joy for aye.489

   The following is a felicitous version by an American divine. [489]


   Come, O Spirit! Fount of grace!

   From thy heavenly dwelling-place

   One bright morning beam impart:

   Come, O Father of the poor;

   Come, O Source of bounties sure;

   Come, O Sunshine of the heart!


   O! thrice blessed light divine!

   Come, the spirit's inmost shrine

   With Thy holy presence fill;

   Of Thy brooding love bereft,

   Naught to hopeless man is left;

   Naught is his but evil still.


   Comforter of man the best!

   Making the sad soul thy guest;

   Sweet refreshing in our fears,

   In our labor a retreat,

   Cooling shadow in the heat,

   Solace in our falling tears.


   Wash away each earthly stain,

   Flow o'er this parched waste again,

   Real the wounds of conscience sore,

   Bind the stubborn will within,

   Thaw the icy chains of sin,

   Guide us, that we stray no more.


   Give to Thy believers, give,

   In Thy holy hope who live,

   All Thy sevenfold dower of love;

   Give the sure reward of faith,

   Give the love that conquers death,

   Give unfailing joy above.

   Notker, surnamed the Older, or Balbulus ("the little Stammerer, "from a
   slight lisp in his speech), was born about 850 of a noble family in
   Switzerland, educated in the convent of St. Gall, founded by Irish
   missionaries, and lived there as an humble monk. He died about 912, and
   was canonized in 1512. [490]

   He is famous as the reputed author of the Sequences (Sequentiae), a
   class of hymns in rythmical prose, hence also called Proses (Prosae).
   They arose from the custom of prolonging the last syllable in singing
   the Allelu-ia of the Gradual, between the Epistle and the Gospel, while
   the deacon was ascending from the altar to the rood-loft (organ-loft),
   that he might thence sing the Gospel. This prolongation was called
   jubilatio or jubilus, or laudes, on account of its jubilant tone, and
   sometimes sequentia (Greek ajkolouqiva), because it followed the
   reading of the Epistle or the Alleluia. Mystical interpreters made this
   unmeaning prolongation of a mere sound the echo of the jubilant music
   of heaven. A further development was to set words to these notes in
   rythmical prose for chanting. The name sequence was then applied to the
   text and in a wider sense also to regular metrical and rhymed hymns.
   The book in which Sequences were collected was called Sequentiale.
   [491]

   Notker marks the transition from the unmeaning musical sequence to the
   literary or poetic sequence. Over thirty poems bear his name. His
   first, attempt begins with the line


   "Laudes Deo concinat orbis ubique totus."

   More widely circulated is his Sequence of the Holy Spirit:


   "Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis gratia."

   "The grace of the Holy Spirit be present with us." [492]

   The best of all his compositions, which is said to have been inspired
   by the sight of the builders of a bridge over an abyss in the
   Martinstobe, is a meditation on death (Antiphona de morte):


   "Media vita in morte sumus:

   Quem quaerimus adiutorem nisi te, Domine,

   Qui pro peccatis nostris juste irasceris?

   Sancte Deus, sancte fortis,

   Sancte et misericors Salvator:

   Amarae morti ne tradas nos." [493]

   This solemn prayer is incorporated in many burial services. In the Book
   of Common Prayer it is thus enlarged:


   "In the midst of life we be in death:

   Of whom may we seek for succour, but of Thee,

   O Lord, which for our sins justly art moved?

   Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,

   O holy and most merciful Saviour,

   Deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.

   Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.

   Shut not up thy merciful eyes to our prayers:

   But spare us, Lord most holy,

   O God most mighty,

   O holy and merciful Saviour,

   Thou most worthy Judge eternal,

   Suffer us not, at our last hour,

   For any pains of death,

   To fall from Thee." [494]

   Peter Damiani (d. 1072), a friend of Hildebrand and promoter of his
   hierarchical refrms, wrote a solemn hymn on the day of death:


   "Gravi me terrore pulsas vitae dies ultima"," [495]

   "With what heavy fear thou smitest."

   He is perhaps also the author of the better known descriptive poem on
   the Glory and Delights of Paradise, which is usually assigned to St.
   Augustin:


   "Ad perennis vitae fontem mens sitivit arida,

   Claustra carnis praesto frangi clausa quaerit anima:

   Gliscit, ambit, eluctatur exsul frui patria." [496]

   The subordinate hymn-writers of our period are the following: [497]

   Isidor of Seville (Isidoris Hispalensis, 560-636). A hymn on St.
   Agatha: "Festum insigne prodiit."

   Cyxilla of Spain. Hymnus de S. Thurso et sociis: Exulta nimium turba
   fidelium."

   Eugenius of Toledo. Oratio S. Eugenii Toletani Episcopi: "Rex Deus."

   Paulus Diaconus (720-800), of Monte Casino, chaplain of Charlemagne,
   historian of the Lombards, and author of a famous collection of
   homilies. On John the Baptist ("Ut queant laxis), [498] and on the
   Miracles of St. Benedict (Fratres alacri pectore).

   Odo of Cluny (d. 941). A hymn on St. Mary Magdalene day, "Lauda, Mater
   Ecclesiae," translated by Neale: "Exalt, O mother Church, to-day, The
   clemency of Christ, thy Lord." It found its way into the York Breviary.

   Godescalcus (Gottschalk, d. about 950, not to be confounded with his
   predestinarian namesake, who lived in the ninth century), is next to
   Notker, the best writer of sequences or proses, as "Laus Tibi, Christe"
   ("Praise be to Thee, O Christ"), and Coeli enarrant ("The heavens
   declare the glory"), both translated by Neale.

   Fulbert Of Chartres (died about 1029) wrote a paschal hymn adopted in
   several Breviaries: "Chorus novae Jerusalem" ("Ye choirs of New
   Jerusalem"), translated by Neale.

   A few of the choicest hymns of our period, from the sixth to the
   twelfth century are anonymous. [499] To these belong:

   "Hymnum dicat turba fratrum." A morning hymn mentioned by Bede as a
   fine specimen of the trochaic tetrameter.

   "Sancti venite." A communion hymn.

   "Urbs beata Jerusalem." [500] It is from the eighth century, and one of
   those touching New Jerusalem hymns which take their inspiration from
   the last chapter of St. John's Apocalypse, and express the Christian's
   home-sickness after heaven. The following is the first stanza (with
   Neale's translation):


   "Urbs beata Jerusalem,

   Dicta pacis visio,

   Quae construitur in coelo

   Vivis ex lapidibus,

   Et angelis coronata

   Ut sponsata comite."


   Blessed City, Heavenly Salem,

   Vision dear of Peace and Love,

   Who, of living stones upbuilded,

   Art the joy of Heav'n above,

   And, with angel cohorts circled,

   As a bride to earth dost move!"

   "Apparebit repentina." An alphabetic and acrostic poem on the Day of
   Judgment, based on Matt. 25:31-36; from the seventh century; first
   mentioned by Bede, then long lost sight of; the forerunner of the Dies
   Irae, more narrative than lyrical, less sublime and terrific, but
   equally solemn. The following are the first lines in Neale's admirable
   translation: [501]


   "That great Day of wrath and terror,

   That last Day of woe and doom,

   Like a thief that comes at midnight,

   On the sons of men shall come;

   When the pride and pomp of ages

   All shall utterly have passed,

   And they stand in anguish, owning

   That the end is here at last;

   And the trumpet's pealing clangor,

   Through the earth's four quarters spread,

   Waxing loud and ever louder,

   Shall convoke the quick and dead:

   And the King of heavenly glory

   Shall assume His throne on high,

   And the cohorts of His angels

   Shall be near Him in the sky:

   And the sun shall turn to sackcloth,

   And the moon be red as blood,

   And the stars shall fall from heaven,

   Whelm'd beneath destruction's flood.

   Flame and fire, and desolation

   At the Judge's feet shall go:

   Earth and sea, and all abysses

   Shall His mighty sentence know."

   "Ave, Maris Stella." This is the favorite mediaeval Mary hymn, and
   perhaps the very best of the large number devoted to the worship of the
   "Queen of heaven," which entered so deeply into the piety and devotion
   of the Catholic church both in the East and the West. It is therefore
   given here in full with the version of Edward Caswall. [502]


   "Ave, Maris Stella, [503]

   Dei Mater alma

   Atque semper Virgo,

   Felix coeli porta.

   Hail, thou Star-of-Ocean,

   Portal of the sky,

   Ever-Virgin Mother

   Of the Lord Most High!


   Sumens illud Ave

   Gabrielis ore,

   Funda nos in pace,

   Mutans nomen Evae. [504]

   Oh, by Gabriel's Ave

   Uttered long ago

   Eva's name reversing,

   'Stablish peace below!


   Solve vincla reis

   Profer lumen coecis,

   Mala nostra pelle,

   Bona cuncta posce.

   Break the captive's fetters,

   Light on blindness pour,

   All our ills expelling,

   Every bliss implore.


   Monstra te esse matrem, [505]

   Sumat per te precem,

   Qui pro nobis natus

   Tulit esse tuus.

   Show thyself a mother,

   Offer Him our sighs,

   Who, for us Incarnate,

   Did not thee despise.


   Virgo singularis,

   Inter omnes mitis,

   Nos culpis solutos

   Mites facet castos.

   Virgin of all virgins!

   To thy shelter take us--

   Gentlest of the gentle!

   Chaste and gentle make us.


   Vitam praesta puram

   Iter para tutum,

   Ut videntes Iesum

   Semper collaetemur.

   Still as on we journey,

   Help our weak endeavor,

   Till with thee and Jesus,

   We rejoice for ever.


   Sit laus Deo Patri,

   Summo Christo decus,

   Spiritui Sancto

   Honor trinus et unus.

   Through the highest heaven

   To the Almighty Three,

   Father, Son, and Spirit,

   One same glory be.

   The Latin hymnody was only, for priests and monks, and those few who
   understood the Latin language. The people listened to it as they do to
   the mass, and responded with the Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, which
   passed from the Greek church into the Western litanies. As the modern
   languages of Europe developed themselves out of the Latin, and out of
   the Teutonic, a popular poetry arose during the thirteenth and
   fourteenth centuries, and afterwards received a powerful impulse from
   the Reformation. Since that time the Protestant churches, especially in
   Germany and England, have produced the richest hymnody, which speaks to
   the heart of the people in their own familiar tongue, and is, next to
   the Psalter, the chief feeder of public and private devotion. In this
   body of evangelical hymns the choicest Greek and Latin hymns in various
   translations, reproductions, and transformations occupy an honored
   place and serve as connecting links between past and modern times in
   the worship of the same God and Saviour.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [470] See the Marianic Te Deum in Daniel, II. 293; and in Mone, II. 229
   sq.

   [471] A curious mediaeval legend makes the Te Deum the joint product of
   St. Ambrose and St. Augustin, which was alternately uttered by both, as
   by inspiration, while Augustin ascended from the baptismal font;
   Ambrose beginning: Te Deum laudamus, Augustin responding; "Te Dominum
   confitemur." But neither the writings of one or the other contain the
   slightest trace of the hymn and its origin. The first historic
   testimony of its existence and use is the eleventh rule of St. Benedict
   of Nursia, a.d. 529, which prescribes to the monks of Monte Casino:
   "Post guartum autem responsorium incipiat Abbas hymnum Te Deum
   laudamus." But five or eight lines of the hymn are found in Greek as a
   part of the Gloria in Excelsis (Doxaenhupsistois, etc. ) in the
   Alexandrian Codex of the Bible which dates from the fifth century. See
   Daniel, II 289 sqq.;Christ p. 39 (from kathhemeran to eistousaionas),
   and Kayser, 437 sqq. Daniel traces the whole Te Deum to a lost Greek
   original (of which the lines in the Cod. Alex. are a fragment), Kayser
   to an unknown Latin author in the second half of the fifth century,
   i.e. about one hundred years after the death of St. Ambrose.

   [472] The dates of his birth and death are quite uncertain, and
   variously stated from 530 or 550 to 600 or 609.

   [473] See two Latin texts with critical notes in Daniel, I. 160 sqq.,
   rhymed English Versions by Mant, Caswall, and Neale. The originals are
   not rhymed, but very melodious. See vol. III. 597. The Opera of
   Fortunatus were edited by Luchi, Rom. 1786, and Migne in "Patrol. Lat."
   vol. 88 (Paris 1850). Comp. Ampère, Hist. littér. II. 275 sqq.; Ebert,
   l.c. I. 494 sqq. Fortunatus is a very interesting character, and
   deserves a special monograph. Kayser devotes to him three chapters (p.
   386-434).

   [474] Daniel, I. 175-183, gives ten hymns of Gregory, and an additional
   one (Laudes canamus) in vol. V. 248. Mone adds some more of doubtful
   authorship, I. 370, 376 sqq.; III. 325 sqq., and includes hymns in
   praise of Gregory, as "O decus sacerdotum, flosque sanctorum." English
   translations of his Breviary hymns in Mant, Chambers, Caswall, Newman.
   On his merits as a poet, see Ebert, I. 827 sqq. Luther, in his
   Tischreden (which are a strange mixture of truth and fiction), declared
   the passion hymn Rex Christe, factor omnium, to be the best of all
   hymns ("der allerbeste Hymnus"), but this extravagant praise is
   inconsistent with the poetic taste of Luther and the fact that he did
   not reproduce it in German.

   [475] From Newman's free reproduction (in Verses on Various Occasions).
   See the Latin text in both recensions in Daniel, I. 175,

   [476] Daniel, I. 206 sq.; Mone, I.1 ("Primo Deus coeli globum") and 284
   (Ave sacer Christi sanguis). The hymn for the infant martyrs at
   Bethlehem is far inferior to the Salvete flores martyrum of Prudentius.
   The first of the hymns quoted in the text is translated by Mrs. Charles
   and by Neale. German versions by Königsfeld (Ihr Siegeshymnen schallet
   laut, and Unschuld'ger Kinder Martyrschaar), Knapp, and others. Bede
   composed also a metrical history, of St. Cuthbert, which Newman has
   translated in part ("Between two comrades dear").

   [477] His carmina were edited from an old MS. found in the convent of
   Fulda by Christopher Brower, a Jesuit, in 1617 (as an appendix to the
   poems of Venantius Fortunatus), and reprinted in Migne's Rab.
   MauriOpera (1852) Vol. VI. f. 1583-1682. Comp. Kunstmann, Hrabamus
   Magnentius Maurus, Mainz 1841; Koch, I. 90-93; Ebert, II. 120-145;
   Hauck in Herzog2XII. 459-465. Hauck refers to Dümmler on the MS.
   tradition of the poem, of R. M.

   [478] So Brower, and quite recently S. W. Duffield, in an article In
   Schaff's "Rel. Encycl." III. 2608 sq. Also Clément, Carmina, etc., p.
   379.

   [479] 9 In the abridged and not very happy translation of Bishop Cosin
   (only four stanzas), beginning:
   "Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire, And lighten with celestial fire.
   Thou the anointing Spirit art, Who dost thy sevenfold gift, impart."
   It was introduced into the Prayer Book after the Restoration, 1662. The
   alternate ordination hymn, "Come, Holy Ghost, eternal God," appeared in
   1549, and was altered in 1662.

   [480] By Tomasi (I. 375) and even Daniel (I. 213, sq.; IV. 125),
   apparently also by Trench (p. 167). Tomasi based his view on an
   impossible tradition reported by the Bollandists (Acta SS. Apr. 1,
   587), that Notker sent to Charlemagne (who died a hundred years before)
   his sequence Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis gratia, and received in
   response the Veni, Creator Spiritus from the emperor (whose Latin
   scholarship was not sufficient for poetic composition). The author of
   the article "Hymns" in the 9th ed. of the "Encycl. Brit." revives the
   legend, but removes the anachronism by substituting for Charlemagne his
   nephew, Charles the Bald (who was still less competent for the task).

   [481] By Mone (I. 242, note), Koch, Wackernagel. Mone's reasons are
   "the classical metre with partial rhymes, and the prayer-like
   treatment."

   [482] In the twelfth and thirteenth century (Komm, Schöpfer, heiliger
   Geist), as also by Luther (Komm, Gott Schöpfer, heiliger Geist), by
   Königsfeld (Komm, Schöpfer, heil'ger Geist, erfreu), and others. The
   oldest German translator (as reported by Daniel, I. 214), says that he
   who recites this hymn by day or by night, is secure against all enemies
   visible or invisible.

   [483] As contained in his work De Universo 1. I. c.3 (in Migne's
   edition of the Opera, V. 23-26). Here he calls the Holy Spirit digitus
   Dei (as in the hymn), and teaches the double procession which had come
   to be the prevailing doctrine in the West since the adoption of the
   Filioque at the Synod of Aix in Creed. The scanning of Paraclêtus with
   a long penultimate differs from that 809, though under protest of Leo
   III. against its insertion into the Nicene of other Latin poets
   (Paraecletos).

   [484] The Latin text is from Brower, as reprinted in Migne (VI. 1657),
   with the addition of the first doxology. The first translation is by
   Robert Campbell, 1850, the second by Rev. S. W. Duffield, made for this
   work, Feb. 1884. Other English versions by Wither (1623), Drummond
   (1616), Cosin (1627), Tate (1703), Dryden (1700), Isaac Williams
   (1839), Bishop Williams (1845), Mant ("Come, Holy Ghost, Creator
   blest"), Benedict ("Spirit, heavenly life bestowing"), MacGill
   ("Creator Holy Spirit! come"), Morgan ("Creator Spirit, come in love"),
   in the Marquess of Bute's Breviary ("Come, Holy Ghost, Creator come").
   See nine of these translations in Odenheimer and Bird, Songs of the
   Spirit, N. Y. 1871, p. 167-180. German versions are almost as numerous.
   Comp. Daniel, I. 213; IV. 124; Mone, I. 242; Koch, 1. 74 sq.

   [485] Perpetim, adv., perpetually, constantly. Some copies read perpeti
   (from perpes).

   [486] The concluding conventional benediction in both forms is a later
   addition. The first is given by Daniel (I. 214), and Mone (I. 242), the
   second in the text of Rabanus Maurus. The scanning of Paraecletos
   differs in both from that in the second stanza.

   [487] A few writers claim it for Pope Innocent III.

   [488] See the Latin text in Daniel II. 35; V. 69; Mone, I. 244. In ver.
   8 line 2 Daniel reads frigidum for languidum.

   [489] Dr. E. A. Washburn, late rector of Calvary Church, New York, a
   highly accomplished scholar (d. 1881). The version was made in 1860 and
   published in "Voices from a Busy Life," N. Y. 1883, p. 142.

   Schaff-Herzog II. 1668); and Ans. Schubiger, Die Sängerschule St.
   Gallens vom 8ten his 12ten Jahrh. (Einsiedlen, 1858). Daniel II. 3-31
   gives thirty-five pieces under the title Notker et Notkeriana. Neale
   (p. 32) gives a translation of one sequence: Sancti Spiritus adsit
   nobis gratia.

   [491] For further information on Sequences see especially Neale's
   Epistola Critica de Sequentiis at the beginning of the fifth vol. of
   Daniel's Thes. (p. 3-36), followed by literary notices of Daniel; also
   the works of Bartsch and Kehrein (who gives the largest collection),
   and Duffield in Schaff's Rel. Encyl. III. 161. Neale defines a
   sequentia: "prolongatio syllabae tou Alleluia."

   [492] Translated by Neale, p. 32.

   [493] Daniel, II. 329; Mone, I. 397. Several German versions, one by
   Luther (1524): "Mitten wir im Leben sind mit dem Tod umfangen." This
   version is considerably enlarged and has been translated into English
   by Miss Winkworth in "Lyra Germanica" : "In the midst of life behold
   Death has girt us round. See notes in Schaff's Deutsches Gesangbuch,
   No. 446.

   [494] The text is taken from The First Book of Edward VI., 1549 (as
   republished by Dr. Morgan Dix, N. Y. 1881, p. 268). In the revision of
   the Prayer Book the third line was thus improved: O Lord, who for our
   sins art justly displeased (irasceris)."

   [495] Daniel, I. 224. English Versions by Neale, Benedict, and Washburn
   (l. c. p. 145). German translation by Königsfeld: "Wie du mich mit
   Schrecken schüttelst." Neale (p. 52) calls this "an awful hymn, the
   Dies Irae of individual life." His version begins:
   "O what terror in thy forethought, Ending scene in mortal life!"

   [496] Daniel, I. 116-118 (Rhythmus de gloria et gaudiis Paradisi),
   under the name of St. Augustin. So also Clément, Carmina, p. 162-166,
   who says that it is, attributed to Augustin "per les melleurs
   critiques," and that it is "un reflet de la Cité de Dieu." But the
   great African father put his poetry into prose, and only furnished
   inspiring thoughts to poets. German translation by Königsfeld (who
   gives it likewise under the name of St. Augustin) "Nach des ew'gen
   Lebens Quellen."

   [497] See their hymns in Daniel, I. 183 sqq., and partly in Mone, and
   Clément.

   [498] From this poem (see Daniel I. 209 sq.) Guido of Arezzo got names
   for the six notes Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La: "Ut queant laxis Re-sonare
   fibris Mi-ra gestorum Fa-muli tuorum, Sol ve polluti La-bii reatum,
   Sancte Joannes."

   [499] See Daniel, Hymni adespotoi circa sec. VI-IX. conscripti, I. 191
   sqq. Mone gives a larger number.

   [500] In the Roman Breviary: "Coelestis urbs Jerusalem." Neale thinks
   that the changes in the revised Breviary of Urban VIII. have deprived
   "this grand hymn of half of its beauty."

   [501] See the original in Daniel, I. 194. Other English translations by
   Mrs. Charles, and E. C. Benedict. In German by Königsfeld: "Plötzlich
   wird der Tag erscheinen."

   [502] Daniel (I. 204) says of this hymn: "Hic hymnus Marianus, quem
   Catholica semper ingenti cum favore prosecuta est, in omnibus
   breviarriis, quae inspiciendi unquam mihi occasio data est, ad honorem
   beatissimae virginis cantandus praescribitur, inprimis in
   Annunciatione; apud permultos tamen aliis quoque diebus Festis Marianis
   adscriptus est. Quae hymni reverentia ad recentiora usque tempora
   permansit." It is one of the few hymns which Urban VIII. did not alter
   in his revision of the Breviary. Mone (II. 216, 218, 220, 228) gives
   four variations of Ave Maris Stella, which is used as the text.

   [503] This designation of Mary is supposed to be meant for a
   translation of the name; maria being taken for the plural of mare: see
   Gen. I: 10 (Vulgate) "congregationes aquarum appellavit maria. Et vidit
   Deus, quod esset bonum." (See the note in Daniel, I. 205). Surely a
   most extraordinary exposition, not to say imposition, yet not too
   far-fetched for the middle ages, when Greek and Hebrew were unknown,
   when the Scriptures were supposed to have four senses, and allegorical
   and mystical fancies took the place of grammatical and historical
   exegesis.

   [504] The comparison of Mary with Eve--the mother of obedience
   contrasted with the mother of disobedience, the first Eve bringing in
   guilt and ruin, the second, redemption and bliss--is as old as Irenaeus
   (about 180) and is the fruitful germ of Mariolatry. The mystical change
   of Eva and Ave is mediaeval--a sort of pious conundrum.

   [505] The words of our Lord to John: "Behold thy mother" (John 19:27),
   were supposed to be spoken to all Christians.

   § 97. The Seven Sacraments.

   Mediaeval Christianity was intensely sacramental, sacerdotal and
   hierarchical. The ideas of priest, sacrifice, and altar are closely
   connected. The sacraments were regarded as the channels of all grace
   and the chief food of the soul. They accompanied human life from the
   cradle to the grave. The child was saluted into this world by the
   sacrament of baptism; the old man was provided with the viaticum on his
   journey to the other world.

   The chief sacraments were baptism and the eucharist. Baptism was
   regarded as the sacrament of the new birth which opens the door to the
   kingdom of heaven the eucharist as the sacrament of sanctification
   which maintains and nourishes the new life.

   Beyond these two sacraments several other rites were dignified with
   that name, but there was no agreement as to the number before the
   scholastic period. The Latin sacramentum, like the Greek mystery (of
   which it is the translation in the Vulgate), was long used in a loose
   and indefinite way for sacred and mysterious doctrines and rites.
   Rabanus Maurus and Paschasius Radbertus count four sacraments,
   Dionysius Areopagita, six; Damiani, as many as twelve. By the authority
   chiefly of Peter the Lombard and Thomas Aquinas the sacred number seven
   was at last determined upon, and justified by various analogies with
   the number of virtues, and the number of sins, and the necessities of
   human life. [506]

   But seven sacraments existed as sacred rites long before the church was
   agreed on the number. We find them with only slight variations
   independently among the Greeks under the name of "mysteries" as well as
   among the Latins. They are, besides baptism and the eucharist (which is
   a sacrifice as well as a sacrament): confirmation, penance (confession
   and absolution), marriage, ordination, and extreme unction.

   Confirmation was closely connected with baptism as a sort of
   supplement. It assumed a more independent character in the case of
   baptized infants and took place later. It may be performed in the Greek
   church by any priest, in the Latin only by the bishop. [507]

   Penance was deemed necessary for sins after baptism. [508]

   Ordination is the sacrament of the hierarchy and indispensable for the
   government of the church.

   Marriage lies at the basis of the family and society in church and
   state, and was most closely and jealously guarded by the church against
   facility of divorce, against mixed marriages, and marriages between
   near relatives.

   Extreme unction with prayer (first mentioned among the sacraments by a
   synod of Pavia in 850, and by Damiani) was the viaticum for the
   departure into the other world, and based on the direction of St. James
   5:14, 15 (Comp. Mark 6:13; 16:18). At first it was applied in every
   sickness, by layman as well as priest, as a medical cure and as a
   substitute for amulets and forms of incantation; but the Latin church
   afterwards confined it to of extreme danger.

   The efficacy of the sacrament was defined by the scholastic term ex
   opere operato, that is, the sacrament has its intended effect by virtue
   of its institution and inherent power, independently of the moral
   character of the priest and of the recipient, provided only that it be
   performed in the prescribed manner and with the proper intention and
   provided that the recipient throw no obstacle in the way. [509]

   Three of the Sacraments, namely baptism, confirmation, and ordination,
   have in addition the effect of conferring an indelible character. [510]
   Once baptized always baptized, though the benefit may be forfeited for
   ever; once ordained always ordained, though a priest may be deposed and
   excommunicated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [506] Otto, bishop of Bamberg (between 1139 and 1189), is usually
   reported to have introduced the seven sacraments among the Pomeranians
   whom he had converted to Christianity, but the discourse on which this
   tradition rests is of doubtful genuineness. The scholastic number seven
   was confirmed by the Council of Florence (the Greek delegates
   assenting), and by the Council of Trent which anathematizes all who
   teach more or less, Sess. VII. can. I. The Protestant churches admit
   only two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper, because these alone
   are especially commanded by Christ to be observed. Yet ordination and
   marriage, and in some churches confirmation also, are retained as
   solemn religious ceremonies.

   [507] The Lutheran church retains confirmation by the minister, the
   Anglican church by the bishop.

   [508] See above, § 87.

   [509] Here, too, the Protestant (at least the Reformed) confessions
   differ from the Roman Catholic by requiring faith in active exercise as
   a condition of receiving the benefit of the sacrament. In the case of
   infant baptism the faith of the parents or responsible guardians is
   taken into account. Without such faith the sacrament would be wasted
   and profaned.

   [510] Character indelebilis

   § 98. The Organ and the Bell.

   To the external auxiliaries of worship were added the organ and the
   bell.

   The Organ, [511] in the sense of a particular instrument (which dates
   from the time of St. Augustin), is a development of the Syrinx or
   Pandean pipe, and in its earliest form consisted of a small box with a
   row of pipes in the top, which were inflated by the performer with the
   mouth through means of a tube at one end. It has in the course of time
   undergone considerable improvements. The use of organs in churches is
   ascribed to Pope Vitalian (657-672). Constantine Copronymos sent an
   organ with other presents to King Pepin of France in 767. Charlemagne
   received one as a present from the Caliph Haroun al Rashid, and had it
   put up in the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle. The art of organ-building
   was cultivated chiefly in Germany. Pope John VIII. (872-882) requested
   Bishop Anno of Freising to send him an organ and an organist.

   The attitude of the churches towards the organ varies. It shared to
   some extent the fate of images, except that it never was an object of
   worship. The poetic legend which Raphael has immortalized by one of his
   master-pieces, ascribes its invention to St. Cecilia, the patron of
   sacred music. The Greek church disapproves the use of organs. The Latin
   church introduced it pretty generally, but not without the protest of
   eminent men, so that even in the Council of Trent a motion was made,
   though not carried, to prohibit the organ at least in the mass. The
   Lutheran church retained, the Calvinistic churches rejected it,
   especially in Switzerland and Scotland; but in recent times the
   opposition has largely ceased. [512]

   The Bell is said to have been invented by Paulinus of Nola (d. 431) in
   Campania; [513] but he never mentions it in his description of
   churches. Various sonorous instruments were used since the time of
   Constantine the Great for announcing the commencement of public
   worship. Gregory of Tours mentions a "signum" for calling monks to
   prayer. The Irish used chiefly hand-bells from the time of St. Patrick,
   who himself distributed them freely. St. Columba is reported to have
   gone to church when the bell rang (pulsante campana) at midnight. Bede
   mentions the bell for prayer at funerals. St. Sturm of Fulda ordered in
   his dying hours all the bells of the convent to be rung (779). In the
   reign of Charlemagne the use of bells was common in the empire. He
   encouraged the art of bel-founding, and entertained bell-founders at
   his court. Tancho, a monk of St. Gall, cast a fine bell, weighing from
   four hundred to five hundred pounds, for the cathedral at
   Aix-la-Chapelle. In the East, church bells are not mentioned before the
   end of the ninth century.

   Bells, like other church-furniture, were consecrated for sacred use by
   liturgical forms of benediction. They were sometimes even baptized; but
   Charlemagne, in a capitulary of 789, forbids this abuse. [514] The
   office of bell-ringers [515] was so highly esteemed in that age that
   even abbots and bishops coveted it. Popular superstition ascribed to
   bells a magical effect in quieting storms and expelling pestilence.
   Special towers were built for them. [516] The use of church bells is
   expressed in the old lines which are inscribed in many of them:


   "Lauda Deum verum, plebem voco, congrego clerum,

   Defunctos ploro, pestem fugo, festaque honoro." [517]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [511] Organum from the Greek organon, which is used in the Septuagint
   for several musical terms in Hebrew, as cheli, chinor (cithara), nephel
   (nablium), yugab. See the passages in Trommius, Concord. Gr. V. LXX,
   II. 144.

   [513] Hence the names campanum, or campana, nola(continued in the
   Italian language), but it is more probable that the name is derived
   from Campanian brass (aes campanum), which in early times furnished the
   material for bells. In later Latin it is called cloqua, cloccum,
   clocca, cloca, also tintinnabulum, English: clock; German: Glocke;
   French: cloche; Irish: clog (comp. the Latin clangere and the German
   klopfen).

   [514] "Ut cloccae non baptizentur." According to Baronius, Annal. ad a.
   968, Pope John XIII. baptized the great bell of the Lateran church, and
   called it John. The reformers of the. sixteenth century renewed the
   protest of Charlemagne, and abolished the baptism of bells as a
   profanation of the sacrament, See Siegel, Handbuch der christl.
   kirchlichen Alterthümer, II. 243.

   [515] Campanarii, campanatores.

   [516] Called Campanile. The one on place of San Marco at Venice is
   especially celebrated.

   Glocken, in the archaeological works of Smith and Cheetham, Wetzer and
   Welte, and Herzog. Schiller has made the bell the subject of his
   greatest lyric poem, which ends with this beautiful description of its
   symbolic meaning: "Und diess sei fortan ihr Beruf, Wozu der Meister sie
   erschuf: Hoch über'm niedern Erdenleben Soll sie im blauen Himmelszelt,
   Die Nachbarin des Donners, schweben Und gränzen an die Sternenwelt;
   Soll eine Stimme sein von oben, Wie der Gestirne helle Shaar, Die ihren
   Schöpfer wandelnd loben Und führen das bekränzte Jahr. Nur ewigen und
   ersten Dingen Sei ihr metall'ner Mund geweiht, Und stündlich mit den
   schnellen Schwinger Berühr' im Fluge sie die Zeit. Dem Schicksal leihe
   sie die Zunge; Selbst herzlos, ohne Mitgefühl, Begleite sie mit ihrem
   Schwunge Des Lebens wechselvolles Spiel. Und wie der Klang im Ohr
   vergehet, Der mächtig tönend ihr entschallt, So lehre sie, dass nichts
   bestehet, Dass alles Irdische verhallt."

   § 99. The Worship of Saints.

   Comp. vol. III. §§ 81-87 (p. 409-460).

   The Worship of Saints, handed down from the Nicene age, was a Christian
   substitute for heathen idolatry and hero-worship, and well suited to
   the taste and antecedents of the barbarian races, but was equally
   popular among the cultivated Greeks. The scholastics made a distinction
   between three grades of worship: 1) adoration (latreia), which belongs
   to God alone; 2) veneration (douleia), which is due to the saints as
   those whom God himself has honored, and who reign with him in heaven;
   3) special veneration (huperdouleia), which is due to the Virgin Mary
   as the mother of the Saviour and the queen of all saints. But the
   people did not always mind this distinction, and the priests rather
   encouraged the excesses of saint-worship. Prayers were freely addressed
   to the saints, though not as the givers of the blessings desired, but
   as intercessors and advocates. Hence the form "Pray for us" (Ora pro
   nobis).

   The number of saints and their festivals multiplied very rapidly. Each
   nation, country, province or city chose its patron saint, as Peter and
   Paul in Rome, St. Ambrose in Milan, St. Martin, St. Denys (Dionysius)
   and St. Germain in France, St. George in England, St. Patrick in
   Ireland, St. Boniface in Germany, and especially the Virgin Mary, who
   has innumerable localities and churches under her care and protection.
   The fact of saintship was at first decided by the voice of the people,
   which was obeyed as the voice of God. Great and good men and women who
   lived in the odor of sanctity and did eminent service to the cause of
   religion as missionaries or martyrs or bishops or monks or nuns, were
   gratefully remembered after their death; they became patron saints of
   the country or province of their labors and sufferings, and their
   worship spread gradually over the entire church. Their relics were held
   sacred; their tombs were visited by pilgrims. The metropolitans usually
   decided on the claims of saintship for their province down to a.d.
   1153. [518] But to check the increase and to prevent mistakes, the
   popes, since Alexander III. a.d. 1170, claimed the exclusive right of
   declaring the fact, and prescribing the worship of a saint throughout
   the whole (Latin) Catholic church. [519] This was done by a solemn act
   called canonization. From this was afterwards distinguished the act of
   beatification, which simply declares that a departed Catholic Christian
   is blessed (beatus) in heaven, and which within certain limits permits
   (but does not prescribe) his veneration. [520]

   The first known example of a papal canonization is the canonization of
   Ulrich, bishop of Augsburg (d. 973), by John XV. who, at a Lateran
   synod composed of nineteen dignitaries, in 993, declared him a saint at
   the request of Luitolph (Leuthold), his successor in the see of
   Augsburg, after hearing his report in person on the life and miracles
   of Ulrich. His chief merit was the deliverance of Southern Germany from
   the invasion of the barbarous Magyars, and his devotion to the
   interests of his large diocese. He used to make tours of visitation on
   an ox-cart, surrounded by a crowd of beggars and cripples. He made two
   pilgrimages to Rome, the second in his eighty-first year, and died as
   an humble penitent on the bare floor. The bull puts the worship of the
   saints on the ground that it redounds to the glory of Christ who
   identifies himself with his saints, but it makes no clear distinction
   between the different degrees of worship. It threatens all who
   disregard this decree with the anathema of the apostolic see. [521]

   A mild interpretation of the papal prerogative of canonization reduces
   it to a mere declaration of a fact preceded by a careful examination of
   the merits of a case before the Congregation of Rites. But nothing
   short of a divine revelation can make such a fact known to mortal man.
   The examination is conducted by a regular process of law in which one
   acts as Advocatus Diaboli or accuser of the candidate for canonization,
   and another as Advocatus Dei. Success depends on the proof that the
   candidate must have possessed the highest sanctity and the power of
   working miracles either during his life, or through his dead bones, or
   through invocation of his aid. A proverb says that it requires a
   miracle to prove a miracle. Nevertheless it is done by papal decree on
   such evidence as is satisfactory to Roman Catholic believers. [522]

   The question, how the saints and the Virgin Mary can hear so many
   thousands of prayers addressed to them simultaneously in so many
   different places, without being clothed with the divine attributes of
   omniscience and omnipresence, did not disturb the faith of the people.
   The scholastic divines usually tried to solve it by the assumption that
   the saints read those prayers in the omniscient mind of God. Then why
   not address God directly?

   In addition to the commemoration days of particular saints, two
   festivals were instituted for the commemoration of all the departed.

   The Festival of All Saints [523] was introduced in the West by Pope
   Boniface IV. on occasion of the dedication of the Pantheon in Rome,
   which was originally built by Agrippa in honor of the victory of
   Augustus at Actium, and dedicated to Jupiter Vindex; it survived the
   old heathen temples, and was presented to the pope by the Emperor
   Phocas, a.d. 607; whereupon it was cleansed, restored and dedicated to
   the service of God in the name of the ever-Virgin Mary and all martyrs.
   Baronius tells us that at the time of dedication on May 13 the bones of
   martyrs from the various cemeteries were in solemn procession
   transferred to the church in twenty-eight carriages. [524] From Rome
   the festival spread during the ninth century over the West, and Gregory
   IV. induced Lewis the Pious in 835 to make it general in the Empire.
   The celebration was fixed on the first of November for the convenience
   of the people who after harvest had a time of leisure, and were
   disposed to give thanks to God for all his mercies.

   The Festival of All Souls [525] is a kind of supplement to that of All
   Saints, and is celebrated on the day following (Nov. 2). Its
   introduction is traced to Odilo, Abbot of Cluny, in the tenth century.
   It spread very soon without a special order, and appealed to the
   sympathies of that age for the sufferings of the souls in purgatory.
   The worshippers appear in mourning; the mass for the dead is celebrated
   with the "Dies irae, Dies illa," and the oft-repeated "Requiem aeternam
   dona eis, Domine." In some places (e.g. in Munich) the custom prevails
   of covering the graves on that day with the last flowers of the season.

   The festival of Michael the Archangel, [526] the leader of the angelic
   host, was dedicated to the worship of angels, [527] on the 29th of
   September. [528] It rests on no doctrine and no fact, but on the sandy
   foundation of miraculous legends. [529] We find it first in the East.
   Several churches in and near Constantinople were dedicated to St.
   Michael, and Justinian rebuilt two which had become dilapidated. In the
   West it is first mentioned by a Council of Mentz in 813, as the
   "dedicatio S. Michaelis," among the festivals to be observed; and from
   that time it spread throughout the Church in spite of the apostolic
   warning against angelolatry (Col. 2:18; Rev. 19:10; 22:8, 9). [530]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [518] Sometimes also bishops, synods, and, in cases of political
   importance, kings and emperors. The last case of a metropolitan
   canonization is ascribed to the archbishop of Rouen, a.d.1153, in favor
   of St. Gaucher, or Gaultier, abbot of Pontoise (d. April 9, 1130). But
   Labbe and Alban Butler state that he was canonized by Celestine III. in
   1194. It seems that even at a later date some bishops exercised a
   limited canonization; hence the prohibition of this practice as
   improper by Urban VIII. in 1625 and 1634.

   [519] The occasion of the papal decision in 1170 was the fact that the
   monks of a convent in the diocese of Lisieux worshiped as a saint their
   prefect, who had been killed in the refectory by two of their number in
   a state of intoxication.

   [520] Comp. on this subject Benedict XIV. (Lambertini): De Servorum Dei
   Beatificatione et Beatorum Canonisatione. Bononisae 1734-'38; ed. II.
   Venet. et Patav. 1743, 4 vol. fol. Ferraris: Bibliotheca Canonica, a.
   v. "Veneratio Sanctorum." Canonization includes seven privileges: 1)
   recognition as saint by the whole (Roman) church; 2) invocation in
   public and private prayers; 3) erection of churches and altars to the
   honor of the saints; 4) invocation at the celebration of the mass; 5)
   appointment of special days of commemoration; 6) exhibition of their
   images with a crown on their head; 7) exhibition of their bones and
   relics for veneration. The question whether the papal bulls of
   canonization are infallible and de fide, or only sententia communis et
   certa, seems to be still disputed among Roman Catholics.

   [521] See Mansi, XIX. f. 169-179. The bull is signed by, the pope, five
   bishops, nine cardinal priests, an archdeacon and four deacons. It
   decrees that the memory of Saint Udalricus be venerated "affectu
   piisimo et devotione fidelissima," and be dedicated to divine worship
   ("divino cultui dicata"). It justifies it by the reason "quoniam sic
   adoramus (!) et colimus reliquius m et confessorum, ut eum, Cuius
   martyres et confessores sunt, adoremus Honaramus servos ut honor
   redundet in Dominum, qui dixit: Qui vos recipit me recipit': ac proinde
   nos, qui fiduciam nostrae justitiae non habemus, illorum precibus et
   meritis apud clementissimum Deum jugiter adiuvemur." The bull mentions
   many miracles of Ulrich, "quae sive in corpore, sive extra corpus gesta
   sunt, videlicet Caecos illuminasse, daemones ab obsessis effugasse,
   paralyticos curasse, et quam plurima alia signa gessisse." On the life
   of St. Ulrich see the biography by his friend and companion Gerhard
   (between 983 and 993), best edition by Wirtz in the Monum. G.
   Scriptores, IV. 377 sqq.; Acta Sanct., Bolland. ad 4 Jul.; Mabillon,
   Ada Ordinis S. B., V. 415-477; Braun, Gesch. der Bischöfe von
   Augsburg(Augsb. 1813), vol. I.; Schrödl, in Wetzer and Welte, vol. XI.
   370-383, and Vogel in Herzog1vol. XVI. 624-628. Ulrich cannot be the
   author of a tract against celibacy which was first published under his
   name by Flacius in his Catalogus Testium Veritatis, but dates from the
   year 1059 when Pope Nicolas II. issued a decree enforcing celibacy. See
   Vogel, l.c. p. 627.

   [522] The most recent acts of canonization occurred in our generation.
   Pope Pius IX. canonized in 1862 with great solemnity twenty-six
   Japanese missionaries and converts of the Franciscan order, who died in
   a persecution in 1597. Leo XIII. canonized, December 8, 1881, four
   comparatively obscure saints of ascetic habits and self-denying
   charity, namely, Giovanni Battista de Rossi, Lorenzo di Brindisi,
   Giuseppe Labre, and Clara di Montefalco. A Roman priest describes "the
   blessed Labre" as a saint who "never washed, never changed his linen,
   generally slept under the arches of the Colosseum and prayed for hours
   together in the Church of the Orphanage where there is a tablet to his
   memory." St. Labre evidently did not believe that "cleanliness is next
   to godliness"

   [523] Omnium Sanctorum Natalis, or Festivas, Solemnitas,
   Allerheiligenfest. The Greek church had long before a similar festival
   in commemoration of all martyrs on the first Sunday after Pentecost,
   called KuriaketonHagionpanton. Chrysostom, in a sermon for that day,
   says that on the Octave of Pentecost the Christians were surrounded by
   the host of martyrs. In the West the first Sunday after Pentecost was
   devoted to the Trinity, and closed the festival part of the church
   year. See vol. III. 408.

   [524] Martyrologio Romano, May 13 and Nov. 1. The Pantheon or Rotunda,
   like Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's Cathedral in London, contains
   the ashes of other distinguished men besides saints, and is the
   resting-place of Raphael, and since 1883 even of Victor Emanuel, the
   founder of the Kingdom of Italy, whom the pope regards as a robber of
   the patrimony of Peter.

   [525] Omnium Fidelium defunctorum Memoria orCommemoratio,
   Allerseelentag.

   [526] Festum S. Michaelis, or Michaelis Archangeli, Michaelmas.

   [527] Hence also called Festum omnium Angelorum, St. Michael and all
   Angels.

   [528] In the Eastern church on November 8. The origin of the Eastern
   celebration is obscure.

   [529] Namely, sundry apparitions of Michael, at Chonae, near Colossae,
   in Monte Gargano in the diocese of Sipontum in Apulia (variously
   assigned to a.d.492, 520, and 536), in Monte Tumba in Normandy (about
   710), and especially one to Pope Gregory I. in Rome, or his successor,
   Boniface III. (607-610), after a pestilence over the Moles Hadriani,
   which ever since has been called the Castello di St. Angelo, and is
   adorned by the statue of an angel.

   [530] See vol. III. 444 sq. Acta Sanct., Sept. 29; Siegel, Handbuch der
   christl. Kirchl. Alterthümer, III. 419-425; Smith & Cheetham, II.
   1176-1180; also Augusti, Binterim, and the monographs mentioned by
   Siegel, p. 419. The angel-worship in Colossae was heretical and
   probably of Essenic origin. See the commentaries in loc., especially
   Lightfoot, p. 101 sqq. A council of Laodicea near Colossae, about 363,
   found it necessary strongly to forbid angelolatry as then still
   prevailing in Phrygia. St. Augustin repeatedly objects to it, De vera
   Rel. 110; Conf. X. 42; De Civ. D. X. 19, 25.

   The literature on the image-controversy is much colored by the
   doctrinal stand-point of the writers. Gibbon treats it with cold
   philosophical indifference, and chiefly in its bearing on the political
   fortunes of the Byzantine empire.

   With the worship of saints is closely, connected a subordinate worship
   of their images and relics. The latter is the legitimate application of
   the former. But while the mediaeval churches of the East and West--with
   the exception of a few protesting voices--were agreed on the worship of
   saints, there was a violent controversy about the images which kept the
   Eastern church in commotion for more than a century (a.d. 724-842), and
   hastened the decline of the Byzantine empire.

   The abstract question of the use of images is connected with the
   general subject of the relation of art to worship. Christianity claims
   to be the perfect and universal religion; it pervades with its
   leavening power all the faculties of man and all departments of life.
   It is foreign to nothing which God has made. It is in harmony with all
   that is true, and beautiful, and good. It is friendly to philosophy,
   science, and art, and takes them into its service. Poetry, music, and
   architecture achieve their highest mission as handmaids of religion,
   and have derived the inspiration for their noblest works from the
   Bible. Why then should painting or sculpture or any other art which
   comes from God, be excluded from the use of the Church? Why should not
   Bible history as well as all other history admit of pictorial and
   sculptured representation for the instruction and enjoyment of children
   and adults who have a taste for beauty? Whatever proceeds from God must
   return to God and spread his glory.

   But from the use of images for ornament, instruction and enjoyment
   there is a vast step to the worship of images, and experience proves
   that the former can exist without a trace of the latter. In the middle
   ages, however, owing to the prevailing saint-worship, the two were
   inseparable. The pictures were introduced into churches not as works of
   art, but as aids and objects of devotion. The image-controversy was
   therefore a, purely practical question of worship, and not a
   philosophical or artistic question. To a rude imagination an ugly and
   revolting picture served the devotional purpose even better than one of
   beauty and grace. It was only towards the close of the middle ages that
   the art of Christian painting began to produce works of high merit.
   Moreover the image-controversy was complicated with the second
   commandment of the decalogue which clearly and wisely forbids, if not
   all kinds of figurative representations of the Deity, at all events
   every idolatrous and superstitious use of pictures. It was also beset
   by the difficulty that we have no authentic pictures of Christ, the
   Madonna and the Apostles or any other biblical character.

   We have traced in previous volumes the gradual introduction of sacred
   images from the Roman Catacombs to the close of the sixth century. The
   use of symbols and pictures was at first quite innocent and spread
   imperceptibly with the growth of the worship of saints. The East which
   inherited a love for art from the old Greeks, was chiefly devoted to
   images, the Western barbarians who could not appreciate works of art,
   cared more for relics.

   We may distinguish three theories, of which two came into open conflict
   and disputed the ground till the year 842.

   1. The theory of Image-Worship. It is the orthodox theory, denounced by
   the opponents as a species of idolatry, [531] but strongly supported by
   the people, the monks, the poets, the women, the Empresses Irene and
   Theodora, sanctioned by the seventh oecumenical Council (787) and by
   the popes (Gregory II., Gregory III. and Hadrian I). It maintained the
   right and duty of using and worshipping images of Christ, the Virgin,
   and the saints, but indignantly rejected the charge of idolatry, and
   made a distinction (often disregarded in practice) between a limited
   worship due to pictures, [532] and adoration proper due to God alone.
   [533] Images are a pictorial Bible, and speak to the eye even more
   eloquently than the word speaks to the ear. They are of special value
   to the common people who cannot read the Holy Scriptures. The honors of
   the living originals in heaven were gradually transferred to their
   wooden pictures on earth; the pictures were reverently kissed and
   surrounded by the pagan rites of genuflexion, luminaries, and incense;
   and prayers were thought to be more effective if said before them.
   Enthusiasm for pictures went hand in hand with the worship of saints,
   and was almost inseparable from it. It kindled a poetic inspiration
   which enriched the service books of the Greek church. The chief
   hymnists, John of Damascus, Cosmas of Jerusalem, Germanus, Theophanes,
   Theodore of the Studium, were all patrons of images, and some of them
   suffered deposition, imprisonment, and mutilation for their zeal; but
   the Iconoclasts did not furnish a single poet. [534]

   The chief argument against this theory was the second commandment. It
   was answered in various ways. The prohibition was understood to be
   merely temporary till the appearance of Christ, or to apply only to
   graven images, or to the making of images for idolatrous purposes.

   On the other hand, the cherubim over the ark, and the brazen serpent in
   the wilderness were appealed to as examples of visible symbols in the
   Mosaic worship. The incarnation of the Son of God furnished the divine
   warrant for pictures of Christ. Since Christ revealed himself in human
   form it can be no sin to represent him in that form. The significant
   silence of the Gospels concerning his personal appearance was supplied
   by fictitious pictures ascribed to St. Luke, and St. Veronica, and that
   of Edessa. A superstitious fancy even invented stories of
   wonder-working pictures, and ascribed to them motion, speech, and
   action.

   It should be added that the Eastern church confines images to colored
   representations on a plane surface, and mosaics, but excludes
   sculptures and statues from objects of worship. The Roman church makes
   no such restriction.

   2. The Iconoclastic theory occupies the opposite extreme. Its advocates
   were called image-breakers. [535] It was maintained by the energetic
   Greek emperors, Leo III. and his son Constantine, who saved the
   tottering empire against the invasion of the Saracens; it was popular
   in the army, and received the sanction of the Constantinopolitan Synod
   of 754. It appealed first and last to the second commandment in the
   decalogue in its strict sense as understood by the Jews and the
   primitive Christians. It was considerably strengthened by the successes
   of the Mohammedans who, like the Jews, charged the Christians with the
   great sin of idolatry, and conquered the cities of Syria, Palestine,
   and Egypt in spite of the sacred images which were relied on for
   protection and miraculous interposition. The iconoclastic Synod of 754
   denounced image-worship as a relapse into heathen idolatry, which the
   devil had smuggled into the church in the place of the worship of God
   alone in spirit and in truth.

   The iconoclastic party, however, was not consistent; for it adhered to
   saint-worship which is the root of image-worship, and instead of
   sweeping away all religious symbols, it retained the sign of the cross
   with all its superstitious uses, and justified this exception by the
   Scripture passages on the efficacy of the cross, though these refer to
   the sacrifice of the cross, and not to the sign.

   The chief defect of iconoclasm and the cause of its failure was its
   negative character. It furnished no substitute for image-worship, and
   left nothing but empty walls which could not satisfy the religious
   wants of the Greek race. It was very different from the iconoclasm of
   the evangelical Reformation, which put in the place of images the
   richer intellectual and spiritual instruction from the Word of God.

   3. The Moderate theory sought a via media between image-worship and
   image-hatred, by distinguishing between the sign and the thing, the use
   and the abuse. It allowed the representation of Christ and the saints
   as aids to devotion by calling to remembrance the persons and facts set
   forth to the eye. Pope Gregory I. presented to a hermit at his wish a
   picture of Christ, of Mary, and of St. Peter and St. Paul, with a
   letter in which he approves of the natural desire to have a visible
   reminder of an object of reverence and love, but at the same time
   warned him against superstitious use. "We do not," he says, "kneel down
   before the picture as a divinity, but we adore Him whose birth or
   passion or sitting on the throne of majesty is brought to our
   remembrance by the picture." The same pope commended Serenus, bishop of
   Marseilles, for his zeal against the adoration of pictures, but
   disapproved of his excess in that direction, and reminded him of the
   usefulness of such aids for the people who had just emerged from pagan
   barbarism and could not instruct themselves out of the Holy Scriptures.
   The Frankish church in the eighth and ninth centuries took a more
   decided stand against the abuse, without, however, going to the extent
   of the iconoclasts in the East.

   In the course of time the Latin church went just as far if not further
   in practical image-worship as the Eastern church after the seventh
   oecumenical council. Gregory II. stoutly resisted the iconoclastic
   decrees of the Emperor Leo, and made capital out of the controversy for
   the independence of the papal throne. Gregory III. followed in the same
   steps, and Hadrian sanctioned the decree of the second council of
   Nicaea. Image-worship cannot be consistently opposed without
   surrendering the worship of saints.

   The same theories and parties reappeared again in the age of the
   Reformation: the Roman as well as the Greek church adhered to
   image-worship with an occasional feeble protest against its abuses, and
   encouraged the development of fine arts, especially in Italy; the
   radical Reformers (Carlstadt, Zwingli, Calvin, Knox) renewed the
   iconoclastic theory and removed, in an orderly way, the pictures from
   the churches, as favoring a refined species of idolatry and hindering a
   spiritual worship; the Lutheran church (after the example set by Luther
   and his friend Lucas Kranach), retained the old pictures, or replaced
   them by new and better ones, but freed from former superstition. The
   modern progress of art, and the increased mechanical facilities for the
   multiplication of pictures have produced a change in Protestant
   countries. Sunday School books and other works for old and young abound
   in pictorial illustrations from Bible history for instruction; and the
   masterpieces of the great religious painters have become household
   ornaments, but will never be again objects of worship, which is due to
   God alone.

   Notes.

   The Council of Trent, Sess. XXV. held Dec. 1563, sanctions, together
   with the worship of saints and relics, also the "legitimate use of
   images" in the following terms: "Moreover, that the images of Christ,
   of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints, are to be had and
   retained particularly in temples, and that due honor and veneration are
   to be given them; not that any divinity, or virtue, is believed to be
   in them, on account of which they are to be worshiped; or that anything
   is to be asked of them; or that trust is to be reposed in images, as
   was of old done by the Gentiles, who placed their hope in idols; but
   because the honor which is shown them is referred to the prototypes
   which those images represent; in such wise that by the images which we
   kiss, and before which we uncover the head, and prostrate ourselves, we
   adore Christ, and we venerate the saints, whose similitude they bear:
   as, by the decrees of Councils, and especially of the second Synod of
   Nicaea, has been defined against the opponents of images." The
   Profession of the Tridentine Faith teaches the same in art. IX. (See
   Schaff, Creeds, II. p. 201, 209).

   The modern standards of the Eastern Church reiterate the decision of
   the seventh (Ecumenical Council. The Synod of Jerusalem, or the
   Confession of Dositheus, includes pictures of Christ, the mother of
   God, the saints and the holy angels who appeared to some of the
   patriarchs and prophets, also the symbolic representation of the Holy
   Spirit under the form of a dove, among the objects of worship
   (proskunou'men kai; timw'men kai; ajspazovmeqa). See Schaff, l.c. II.
   436. The Longer Russian Catechism, in the exposition of the second
   commandment (Schaff, II. 527), thus speaks of this subject:

   "What is an icon (eikon)?

   "The word is Greek, and means an image or representation. In the
   Orthodox Church this name designates sacred representations of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, God incarnate, his immaculate Mother, and his saints.

   "Is the use of holy icons agreeable to the second commandment?

   It would then, and then only, be otherwise, if any one were to make
   gods of them; but it is not in the least contrary to this commandment
   to honor icons as sacred representations, and to use them for the
   religious remembrance of God's works and of his saints; for when thus
   used icons are books, writen(sic) with the forms of persons and things
   instead of letters. (See Greg. Magn. lib. ix. Ep. 9, ad Seren. Epis.).

   "What disposition of mind should we have when we reverence icons?

   "While we look on them with our eyes, we should mentally look to God
   and to the saints, who are represented on them."

   § 101. The Iconoclastic War, and the Synod of 754.

   The history of the image-controversy embraces three periods: 1) The war
   upon images and the abolition of image-worship by the Council of
   Constantinople, a.d. 726-754. 2) The reaction in favor of
   image-worship, and its solemn sanction by the second Council of Nicaea,
   a.d. 754-787. 3) The renewed conflict of the two parties and the final
   triumph of image-worship, a.d. 842.

   Image-worship had spread with the worship of saints, and become a
   general habit among the people in the Eastern church to such an extent
   that the Christian apologists had great difficulty to maintain their
   ground against the charge of idolatry constantly raised against them,
   not only by the Jews, but also by the followers of Islam, who could
   point to their rapid successes in support of their abhorrence of every
   species of idolatry. Churches and church-books, palaces and private
   houses, dresses and articles of furniture were adorned with religious
   pictures. They took among the artistic Greeks the place of the relics
   among the rude Western nations. Images were made to do service as
   sponsors in the name of the saints whom they represented. Fabulous
   stories of their wonder-working power were circulated and readily
   believed. Such excesses naturally called forth a reaction.

   Leo III., called the Isaurian (716-741), a sober and energetic, but
   illiterate and despotic emperor, who by his military talents and
   successes had risen from the condition of a peasant in the mountains of
   Isauria to the throne of the Caesars, and delivered his subjects from
   the fear of the Arabs by the new invention of the "Greek fire," felt
   himself called, as a second Josiah, to use his authority for the
   destruction of idolatry. The Byzantine emperors did not scruple to
   interfere with the internal affairs of the church, and to use their
   despotic power for the purpose. Leo was influenced by a certain bishop
   Constantinus [536] of Nakolia in Phrygia, and by a desire to break the
   force of the Mohammedan charge against the Christians. In the sixth
   year of his reign he ordered the forcible baptism of Jews and
   Montanists (or Manichaeans); the former submitted hypocritically and
   mocked at the ceremony; the latter preferred to set fire to their
   meeting-houses and to perish in the flames. Then, in the tenth year
   (726), [537] he began his war upon the images. At first he only
   prohibited their worship, and declared in the face of the rising
   opposition that he intended to protect the images against profanation
   by removing them beyond the reach of touch and kiss. But in a second
   edict (730), he commanded the removal or destruction of all the images.
   The pictured walls were to be whitewashed. He replaced the magnificent
   picture of Christ over the gate of the imperial palace by a plain
   cross. He removed the aged Germanus, patriarch of Constantinople, and
   put the iconoclastic Anastasius in his place.

   These edicts roused the violent opposition of the clergy, the monks,
   and the people, who saw in it an attack upon religion itself. The
   servants who took down the picture from the palace gate were killed by
   the mob. John of Damascus and Germanus, already known to us as
   hymnists, were the chief opponents. The former was beyond the reach of
   Leo, and wrote three eloquent orations, one before, two after the
   forced resignation of Germanus, in defence of image-worship, and
   exhausted the argument. [538] The islanders of the Archipelago under
   the control of monks rose in open rebellion, and set up a pretender to
   the throne; but they were defeated, and their leaders put to death. Leo
   enforced obedience within the limits of the Eastern empire, but had no
   power among the Christian subjects of the Saracens, nor in Rome and
   Ravenna, where his authority was openly set at defiance. Pope Gregory
   II. told him, in an insulting letter (about 729), that the children of
   the grammar-school would throw their tablets at his head if he avowed
   himself a destroyer of images, and the unwise would teach him what he
   refused to learn from the wise [539] . Seventy years afterwards the
   West set up an empire of its own in close connection with the bishop of
   Rome.

   Constantine V., surnamed Copronymos, [540] during his long reign of
   thirty-four years (741-775), kept up his father's policy with great
   ability, vigor and cruelty, against popular clamor, sedition and
   conspiracy. His character is very differently judged according to the
   doctrinal views of the writers. His enemies charge him with monstrous
   vices, heretical opinions, and the practice of magical arts; while the
   iconoclasts praise him highly for his virtues, and forty years after
   his death still prayed at his tomb. His administrative and military
   talents and successes against the Saracens, Bulgarians, and other
   enemies, as well as his despotism and cruelty (which he shares with
   other Byzantine emperors) are beyond dispute.

   He called an iconoclastic council in Constantinople in 754, which was
   to be the seventh oecumenical, but was afterwards disowned as a
   pseudo-synod of heretics. It numbered three hundred and thirty
   subservient bishops under the presidency of Archbishop Theodosius of
   Ephesus (the son of a former emperor), and lasted six months (from Feb.
   10th to Aug. 27th); but the patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, and
   Alexandria, being under Moslem rule, could not attend, the see of
   Constantinople was vacant, and Pope Stephen III. disregarded the
   imperial summons. The council, appealing to the second commandment and
   other Scripture passages denouncing idolatry (Rom. 1:23, 25; John
   4:24), and opinions of the Fathers (Epiphanius, Eusebius, Gregory
   Nazianzen, Chrysostom, etc.), condemned and forbade the public and
   private worship of sacred images on pain of deposition and
   excommunication, but (inconsistently) ordered at the same time that no
   one should deface or meddle with sacred vessels or vestments ornamented
   with figures, and formally declared its agreement with the six
   oecumenical councils, and the lawfulness of invoking the blessed Virgin
   and saints. It denounced all religious representations by painter or
   sculptor as presumptuous, pagan and idolatrous. Those who make pictures
   of the Saviour, who is God as well as man in one inseparable person,
   either limit the incomprehensible Godhead to the bounds of created
   flesh, or confound his two natures, like Eutyches, or separate them,
   like Nestorius, or deny his Godhead, like Arius; and those who worship
   such a picture are guilty of the same heresy and blasphemy. The
   eucharist alone is the proper image of Christ. A three-fold anathema
   was pronounced on the advocates of image-worship, even the great John
   of Damascus under the name of Mansur, who is called a traitor of
   Christ, an enemy of the empire, a teacher of impiety, and a perverter
   of the Scriptures. The acts of the Synod were destroyed except the
   decision (o{ro") and a brief introduction, which are embodied and
   condemned in the acts of the second Nicene Council. [541]

   The emperor carried out the decree with great rigor as far as his power
   extended. The sacred images were ruthlessly destroyed and replaced by
   white-wash or pictures of trees, birds, and animals. The bishops and
   clergy submitted; but the monks who manufactured the pictures,
   denounced the emperor as a second Mohammed and heresiarch, and all the
   iconoclasts as heretics, atheists and blasphemers, and were subjected
   to imprisonment, flagellation, mutilation, and all sorts of
   indignities, even death. The principal martyrs of images during this
   reign (from 761-775) are Petrus Kalabites (i.e. the inhabitant of a
   hut, kaluvbh), Johannes, Abbot of Monagria, and Stephanus, Abbot of
   Auxentius, opposite Constantinople (called "the new Stephanus," to
   distinguish him from the proto-martyr). The emperor made even an
   attempt to abolish the convents. [542]

   § 102. The Restoration of Image-Worship by the Seventh Oecumenical
   Council, 787.

   Leo IV., called Chazarus (775-780), kept up the laws against images,
   though with more moderation. But his wife Irene of Athens distinguished
   for beauty, talent, ambition and intrigue, was at heart devoted to
   image-worship, and after his death and during the minority of her son
   Constantine VI. Porphyrogenitus, labored with shrewdness and
   perseverance for its restoration (780-802). At first she proclaimed
   toleration to both parties, which she afterwards denied to the
   iconoclasts. She raised the persecuted monks to the highest dignities,
   and her secretary, Tarasius, to the patriarchal throne of
   Constantinople, with the consent of Pope Hadrian, who was willing to
   overlook the irregularity of the sudden election of a layman in
   prospect of his services to orthodoxy. She removed the iconoclastic
   imperial guard, and replaced it by one friendly to her views.

   But the crowning measure was an oecumenical council, which alone could
   set aside the authority of the iconoclastic council of 754. Her first
   attempt to hold such a council at Constantinople in 786 completely
   failed. The second attempt, owing to more careful preparations,
   succeeded.

   Irene convened the seventh oecumenical council in the year 787, at
   Nicaea, which was less liable to iconoclastic disturbances than
   Constantinople, yet within easy reach of the court, and famous as the
   seat of the first and weightiest oecumenical council. It was attended
   by about three hundred and fifty bishops, [543] under the presidency of
   Tarasius, and held only eight sessions from September 24 to October 23,
   the last in the imperial palace of Constantinople. Pope Hadrian I. sent
   two priests, both called Peter, whose names stand first in the Acts.
   The three Eastern patriarchs, who were subject to the despotic rule of
   the Saracens, could not safely leave their homes; but two Eastern
   monks, John, and Thomas, who professed to be syncelli of two of these
   patriarchs and to have an accurate knowledge of the prevailing
   orthodoxy of Egypt and Syria, were allowed to sit and vote in the place
   of those dignitaries, although they had no authority from them, and
   were sent simply by a number of their fellow-monks. [544]

   The Nicene Council nullified the decrees of the iconoclastic Synod of
   Constantinople, and solemnly sanctioned a limited worship (proskynesis)
   of images. [545]

   Under images were understood the sign of the cross, and pictures of
   Christ, of the Virgin Mary, of angels and saints. They may be drawn in
   color or composed of Mosaic or formed of other suitable materials, and
   placed in churches, in houses, and in the street, or made on walls and
   tables, sacred vessels and vestments. Homage may be paid to them by
   kissing, bowing, strewing of incense, burning of lights, saying prayers
   before them; such honor to be intended for the living objects in heaven
   which the images represented. The Gospel book and the relics of martyrs
   were also mentioned among the objects of veneration.

   The decree was fortified by a few Scripture passages about the Cherubim
   (Ex. 25:17-22; Ezek. 41:1, 15, 19; Heb. 9:1-5), and a large number of
   patristic testimonies, genuine and forged, and alleged miracles
   performed by images. [546] A presbyter testified that he was cured from
   a severe sickness by a picture of Christ. Bishop after bishop, even
   those who had been members of the Synod of 754, renounced his
   iconoclastic opinions, and large numbers exclaimed together: "We all
   have sinned, we all have erred, we all beg forgiveness." Some professed
   conscientious scruples, but were quieted when the Synod resolved that
   the violation of an oath which was contrary to the law of God, was no
   perjury. At the request of one of the Roman delegates, an image was
   brought into the assembly, and reverently kissed by all. At the
   conclusion, the assembled bishops exclaimed unanimously: "Thus we
   believe. This is the doctrine of the apostles. Anathema upon all who do
   not adhere to it, who do not salute the images, who call them idols,
   and who charge the Christians with idolatry. Long life to the emperors!
   Eternal memory to the new Constantine and the new Helena! God protect
   their reign! Anathema upon all heretics! Anathema especially upon
   Theodosius, the false bishop of Ephesus, as also upon Sisinnius and
   Basilius! The Holy Trinity has rejected their doctrines." Then follows
   an anathema upon other distinguished iconoclasts, and all who do not
   confess that Christ's humanity has a circumscribed form, who do not
   greet the images, who reject the ecclesiastical traditions, written or
   unwritten; while eternal memory is given to the chief champions of
   image-worship, Germanus of Constantinople, John of Damascus, and George
   of Cyprus, the heralds of truth. [547]

   The decrees of the Synod were publicly proclaimed in an eighth session
   at Constantinople in the presence of Irene and her son, and, signed by
   them; whereupon the bishops, with the people and soldiers, shouted in
   the usual form: "Long live the Orthodox queen-regent." The empress sent
   the bishops home with rich presents.

   The second Council of Nicaea stands far below the first in moral
   dignity and doctrinal importance, and occupies the lowest grade among
   the seven oecumenical synods; but it determined the character of
   worship in the oriental church for all time to come, and herein lies
   its significance. Its decision is binding also upon the Roman church,
   which took part in it by two papal legates, and defended it by a letter
   of Pope Hadrian to Charlemagne in answer to the Libri Carolini.
   Protestant churches disregard the council because they condemn
   image-worship as a refined form of idolatry and as a fruitful source of
   superstition; and this theory is supported by the plain sense of the
   second commandment, the views of the primitive Christians, and,
   negatively, by the superstitions which have accompanied the history of
   image-worship down to the miracle-working Madonnas of the nineteenth
   century. At the same time it may be readily conceded that the decree of
   Nicaea has furnished aid and comfort to a low and crude order of piety
   which needs visible supports, and has stimulated the development of
   Christian art. Iconoclasm would have killed it. It is, however, a
   remarkable fact that the Catholic Raphael and Michael Angelo, and the
   Protestant Lucas Kranach and Albrecht Dürer, were contemporaries of the
   Reformers, and that the art of painting reached its highest perfection
   at the period when image-worship for a great part of Christendom was
   superseded by the spiritual worship of God alone.

   A few months after the Nicene Council, Irene dissolved the betrothal of
   her son, the Emperor Constantine, to Rotrude, a daughter of
   Charlemagne, which she herself had brought about, and forced him to
   marry an Armenian lady whom he afterward cast off and sent to a
   convent. [548] From this time dates her rupture with Constantine. In
   her ambition for despotic power, she rendered him odious by encouraging
   his bad habits, and at last incapable of the throne by causing his eyes
   to be plucked out, while he was asleep, with such violence that he died
   of it (797). It is a humiliating fact that Constantine the Great, the
   convener of the first Nicene Council, and Irene, the convener of the
   second and last, are alike stained with the blood of their own
   offspring, and yet honored as saints in the Eastern church, in whose
   estimate orthodoxy covers a multitude of sins. [549] She enjoyed for
   five years the fruit of unnatural cruelty to her only child. As she
   passed through the streets of Constantinople, four patricians marched
   on foot before her golden chariot, holding the reins of four milk-white
   steeds. But these patricians conspired against their queen and raised
   the treasurer Nicephorus to the throne, who was crowned at St. Sophia
   by the venal patriarch. Irene was sent into exile on the Isle of
   Lesbos, and had to earn her bread by the labors of her distaff as she
   had done in the days of her youth as an Athenian virgin. She died of
   grief in 803. With her perished the Isaurian dynasty. Startling changes
   of fortune were not uncommon among princes and patriarchs of the
   Byzantine empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [543] The accounts vary between 330 and 367. The Acts are signed by 308
   bishops and episcopal representatives. Nicephorus, the almost
   contemporaneous patriarch of Constantinople, in a letter to Leo III.,
   mentions only 150. See Hefele, III. 460.

   [544] Theodore of the Studium, himself a zealous advocate of
   image-worship, exposes this trick, and intimates that the council was
   not strictly oecumenical, although he sometimes gives it that name. The
   question connected with these two irresponsible monks is discussed with
   his usual minuteness and prolixity by Walch, X. 551-558. See also
   Neander, III. 228, and Hefele, III. 459.

   [545] The definition (oros) sanctions the aspasmos kai timetike
   proskunesis, osculum (or salutatio) et honoraria adoratio, but not
   alethine latreia he prepei mone te theia phusei, vera latria, quae
   solam divinam naturam decet. Mansi, XIII. 378 sq. The term Gr.
   ajpasmov" embraces salutation and kiss, the proskunesis, bowing the
   knee, and other demonstrations of reverence, see p. 450.

   [546] Walch (X. 572) says of these proofs from tradition: "Die
   untergeschobenen Schriften, die in der Hauptsache nichts entscheidenden
   Stellen und die mit grosser Unwissenheit verdrehten Aussprüche sind so
   haeufig, dass man sich beides über die Unwissenheit und Unverschämtheit
   nicht genug verwundern kann, welche in diesen Sammlungen sichtbar
   sind." Even moderate Roman Catholic historians, as Alexander Natalia
   and Fleury, admit quietly the errors in some patristic quotations.

   [547] See the acts of the council in the twelfth and thirteenth vols.
   of Mansi, and a summary in Hefele, III. 460-482. On the different texts
   and defective Latin versions, see Walch, X. 420-422, and Hefele, III.
   486. Gibbon calls the acts "a curious monument of superstition and
   ignorance, of falsehood and folly." This is too severe, but not without
   some foundation. The personal character of Irene cuts a deep shadow
   over the Council, and would have been condemned even by the Byzantine
   historians, if her devotion to images had not so blinded them and Roman
   historians, like Baronius and Maimbourg, that they excuse her darkest
   crimes and overwhelm her with praise.

   [548] Charlemagne afterwards offered Irene his hand with a view to
   unite the Eastern and Western empires, and she accepted the offer; but
   her prime-minister, Aëtius, who wished to raise his own brother, Leo,
   to the throne, prevented the marriage.

   [549] The memory of Irene is celebrated by the Greeks on the 15th of
   August. Her patriarch, Tarasius (d. 806), is canonized in the Roman as
   well as the Greek Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 103. Iconoclastic Reaction, and Final Triumph of Image-Worship, a.d.
   842.

   Walch, X. 592-828. Hefele, IV. 1-6; 38-47; 104-109.

   During the five reigns which succeeded that of Irene, a period of
   thirty-eight years, the image-war was continued with varying fortunes.
   The soldiers were largely iconoclastic, the monks and the people in
   favor of image-worship. Among these Theodore of the Studium was
   distinguished by his fearless advocacy and cruel sufferings under Leo
   V., the Armenian (813-820), who was slain at the foot of the altar.
   Theophilus (829-842) was the last and the most cruel of the
   iconoclastic emperors. He persecuted the monks by imprisonment,
   corporal punishment, and mutilation. [550]

   But his widow, Theodora, a second Irene, without her vices, [551] in
   the thirteenth year of her regency during the minority of Michael the
   Drunkard, achieved by prudent and decisive measures the final and
   permanent victory of image-worship. She secured absolution for her
   deceased husband by the fiction of a death-bed repentance, although she
   had promised him to make no change. The iconoclastic patriarch, John
   the Grammarian, was banished and condemned to two hundred lashes; the
   monk Methodius of opposite tendency (honored as a confessor and saint)
   was put in his place; the bishops trembled and changed or were deposed;
   the monks and the people were delighted. A Synod at Constantinople (the
   acts of it are lost) reënacted the decrees of the seven oecumenical
   Councils, restored the worship of images, pronounced the anathema upon
   all iconoclasts, and decided that the event should be hereafter
   commemorated on the first Sunday in Lent by a solemn procession and a
   renewal of the anathema on the iconoclastic heretics.

   On the 19th of February, 842, the images were again introduced into the
   churches of Constantinople. It was the first celebration of the "Sunday
   of Orthodoxy," [552] which afterwards assumed a wider meaning, as a
   celebration of victory over all heresies. It is one of the most
   characteristic festivals of the Eastern church. The old oecumenical
   Councils are dramatically represented, and a threefold anathema is
   pronounced upon all sorts of heretics such as atheists,
   antitrinitarians, upon those who deny the virginity of Mary before or
   after the birth of Christ, the inspiration of the Scriptures, or the
   immortality of the soul, who reject the mysteries (sacraments), the
   traditions and councils, who deny that orthodox princes rule by divine
   appointment and receive at their unction the Holy Ghost, and upon all
   iconoclasts. After this anathema follows the grateful commemoration of
   the orthodox confessors and "all who have fought for the orthodox faith
   by their words, writings, teaching, sufferings, and godly example, as
   also of all the protectors and defenders of the Church of Christ." In
   conclusion the bishops, archimandrites and priests kiss the sacred
   icons. [553]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [550] Hefele, IV. 105, says that under this reign the famous poets,
   Theophanes and his brother, Theodore of the Studium, were punished with
   two hundred lashes and the branding of Greek mock-verses on their
   forehead, whence they received the name "the Marked" (graptoi). But,
   according to the Bollandists, Theophanes died in 820, and Hefele
   himself, III. 370, puts his death in 818, although in vol. IV. 108 be
   reports that Theophanes graptoswas made bishop of Smyrna by Theodora,
   842. See on this conflict in chronology above, p. 407.

   [551] The tongue of slander, however, raised the story of her criminal
   intimacy with the patriarch Methodius, whom she had appointed. The
   court instituted an investigation during which the patriarch by
   indecent exposure furnished the proof of the physical impossibility of
   sexual sin on his part; whereupon the accuser confessed that she had
   been bribed by his iconoclastic predecessor. Hefele, IV. 109.

   § 104. The Caroline Books and the Frankish Church on Image-Worship.

   I. Libri Carolini, first ed. by Elias Philyra (i.e., Jean du Tillet, or
   Tilius, who was suspected of Calvinism, but afterwards became bishop of
   Meaux), from a French (Paris) MS., Paris, 1549; then by Melchior
   Goldast in his collection of imperial decrees on the image-controversy,
   Francof., 1608 (67 sqq.), and in the first vol. of his Collection of
   Constitutiones imperiales, with the addition of the last ch. (lib. IV.,
   c. 29), which was omitted by Tilius; best ed. by Ch. A. Heumann,
   Hanover, 1731, under the title: Augusta Concilii Nicaeni II. Censura,
   h. e., Caroli Magni de impio imaginum cultu libri IV., with prolegomena
   and notes. The ed. of Abbé Migne, in his "Patrol. Lat.," Tom. 98, f.
   990-1248 (in vol. II. of Opera Caroli M.), is a reprint of the ed. of
   Tilius, and inferior to Heumann's ed. ("Es ist zu bedauern," says
   Hefele, III. 696, "dass Migne, statt Besseres, entschieden Geringeres
   geboten hat, als man bisher schon besass".)

   II. Walch devotes the greater part of the eleventh vol. to the history
   of image-worship in the Frankish Church from Pepin to Louis the Pious.

   The church of Rome, under the lead of the popes, accepted and supported
   the seventh oecumenical council, and ultimately even went further than
   the Eastern church in allowing the worship of graven as well as painted
   images. But the church in the empire of Charlemagne, who was not on
   good terms with the Empress Irene, took a position between
   image-worship and iconoclasm.

   The question of images was first discussed in France under Pepin in a
   synod at Gentilly near Paris, 767, but we do not know with what result.
   [554] Pope Hadrian sent to Charlemagne a Latin version of the acts of
   the Nicene Council; but it was so incorrect and unintelligible that a
   few decades later the Roman librarian Anastasius charged the translator
   with ignorance of both Greek and Latin, and superseded it by a better
   one.

   Charlemagne, with the aid of his chaplains, especially Alcuin, prepared
   and published, three years after the Nicene Council, an important work
   on image-worship under the title Quatuor Libri Carolini (790). [555] He
   dissents both from the iconoclastic synod of 754 and the
   anti-iconoclastic synod of 787, but more from the latter, which he
   treats very disrespectfully. [556] He decidedly rejects image-worship,
   but allows the use of images for ornament and devotion, and supports
   his view with Scripture passages and patristic quotations. The spirit
   and aim of the book is almost Protestant. The chief thoughts are these:
   God alone is the object of worship and adoration (colondus et
   adorandus). Saints are only to be revered (venerandi). Images can in no
   sense be worshipped. To bow or kneel before them, to salute or kiss
   them, to strew incense and to light candles before them, is idolatrous
   and superstitious. It is far better to search the Scriptures, which
   know nothing of such practices. The tales of miracles wrought by images
   are inventions of the imagination, or deceptions of the evil spirit. On
   the other hand, the iconoclasts, in their honest zeal against idolatry,
   went too far in rejecting the images altogether. The legitimate and
   proper use of images is to adorn the churches and to perpetuate and
   popularize the memory of the persons and events which they represent.
   Yet even this is not necessary; for a Christian should be able without
   sensual means to rise to the contemplation of the virtues of the saints
   and to ascend to the fountain of eternal light. Man is made in the
   image of God, and hence capable of receiving Christ into his soul. God
   should ever be present and adored in our hearts. O unfortunate memory,
   which can realize the presence of Christ only by means of a picture
   drawn in sensuous colors. The Council of Nicaea committed a great wrong
   in condemning those who do not worship images.

   The author of the Caroline books, however, falls into the same
   inconsistency as the Eastern iconoclasts, by making an exception in
   favor of the sign of the cross and the relics of saints. The cross is
   called a banner which puts the enemy to flight, and the honoring of the
   relics is declared to be a great means of promoting piety, since the
   saints reign with Christ in heaven, and their bones will be raised to
   glory; while images are made by men's hands and return to dust.

   A Synod in Frankfort, a.d. 794, the most important held during the
   reign of Charlemagne, and representing the churches of France and
   Germany, in the presence of two papal legates (Theophylactus and
   Stephanus), endorsed the doctrine of the Libri Carolini, unanimously
   condemned the worship of images in any form, and rejected the seventh
   oecumenical council. [557] According to an old tradition, the English
   church agreed with this decision. [558]

   Charlemagne sent a copy of his book, or more probably an extract from
   it (85 Capitula or Capitulare de Imaginibus) through Angilbert, his
   son-in-law, to his friend Pope Hadrian, who in a long answer tried to
   defend the Eastern orthodoxy of Nicaea with due respect for his Western
   protector, but failed to satisfy the Frankish church, and died soon
   afterwards (Dec. 25, 795). [559]

   A Synod of Paris, held under the reign of Charlemagne's son and
   successor, Louis the Pious, in the year 825, renewed the protest of the
   Frankfort Synod against image-worship and the authority of the second
   council of Nicaea, in reply to an embassy of the Emperor Michael
   Balbus, and added a slight rebuke to the pope. [560]

   Notes.

   The Caroline Books, if not written by Charlemagne, are at all events
   issued in his name; for the author repeatedly calls Pepin his father,
   and speaks of having undertaken the work with the consent of the
   priests in his dominion (conniventia sacerdotum in regno a Deo nobis
   concesso). The book is first mentioned by Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims
   in the ninth century as directed against the pseudo-Synodus Graecorum
   (the second Nicene Council), and he quotes a passage from a copy which
   he saw in the royal palace. The second mention and quotation was made
   by the papal librarian Augustin Steuchus (d. 1550) from a very old copy
   in the Bibliotheca Palatina. As soon as it appeared in print, Flavius
   and other Protestant polemics used it against Rome. Baronius,
   Bellarmin, and other Romanists denied the genuineness, and ascribed the
   book to certain heretics in the age of Charlemagne, who sent it to Rome
   to be condemned; some declared it even a fabrication of the radical
   reformer Carlstadt! But Sirmond and Natalis Alexander convincingly
   proved the genuineness. More recently Dr. Floss (R.C.) of Bonn, revived
   the doubts (1860), but they are permanently removed since Professor
   Reifferscheid (1866) discovered a new MS. from the tenth century in the
   Vatican library which differs from the one of Steuchus, and was
   probably made in the Cistercian Convent at Marienfeld in Westphalia.
   "Therefore," writes Bishop Hefele in 1877 (III. 698), "the genuineness
   of the Libri Carolini is hereafter no longer to be questioned (nicht
   mehr zu beanstanden)."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [554] See Walch, XI. 7-36; Hefele, III. 461-463. The sources are
   silent. Walch carefully gives the different conjectures of Baronius,
   Pagi, Daillé, Natalis, Alexander, Maimburg, Fleury, Sirmond, Spanheim,
   Basnage, Semler. Nothing new has been added since. But the preceding
   iconoclastic zeal of Bishop Serenus of Marseilles, and the succeeding
   position of Charlemagne and the Frankish church, rather favor the
   inference of Sirmond and Spanheim, that the synod rejected the worship
   of images.

   [555] Alcuin's share in the composition appears from the similarity of
   thoughts in his Commentary on John, and the old English tradition that
   he wrote a book against the Council of Nicaea. See Walch, XI. 65 sqq.;
   Hefele, III. 697.

   [556] He calls it posterior tempore, non tamen posterior crimine,
   eloquentia, sensuque carens, synodus ineptissima, etc. He distrusted a
   Council in which the Church of his dominions was not represented. He
   also objected to a woman assuming the office of teacher in the church,
   as being contrary to the lex divina and lex naturae (III. 13, ed.
   Migne, fol. 1136). He had reason to be angry with Irene for dissolving
   the betrothal of her son with his daughter.

   [557] The Synod is often called universalis, and condemned Adoptionism
   (see Hefele, III. 678 sqq. ). The decision against images see in Mansi,
   xiii. 909. The chief passage is: "Sanctissimi Patres nostri omnimodis
   et adorationem et servitutem eis [sc. imaginibus Sanctorum] renuentes
   contemserunt atque, consentientes condemnaverunt." Einhard made the
   following entry in his Annals ad a.d.794 (in Pertz, Monum. I. 181, and
   Gieseler II. 67): "Synodus etiam, quae ante paucos annos in
   Constantinopoli [where the Nicene Synod was closed] sub Herena
   [Irene,]et Constantino filio ejus congregata, et ab ipsis non solum
   septima, verum etiam universalis est appellata, ut nec septima nec
   universalis haberetur dicereturve, quasi supervacua in totum ab omnibus
   [the bishops assembled at Frankfort] abdicata est." Baronius,
   Bellarmin, and even Hefele (III. 689), charge this Synod with
   misrepresenting the Council of Nicaea, which sanctioned the worship (in
   a wider sense), but not the adoration, of images. But the Latin
   version, which the pope sent to Charlemagne, rendered
   proskunesisuniformly by adoratio, and Anastasius, the papal librarian,
   did the same in his improved translation, thus giving double sanction
   to the confusion.

   [558] This rests partly on the probable share which the Anglo-Saxon
   Alcuin had in the composition of the Caroline Books, partly on the
   testimony of Simeon of Durham (about 1100). See Twysden's Hist. Angl.
   Scriptores decem I, III; Mon. Hist. Brit., p. 667; Wilkin's Conc. Magn.
   Brit., I. 73; Gieseler, II. 67, note 6, and Hardwick's Church Hist. of
   the Middle Age, p. 78, note 3.

   [559] There is a difference of opinion whether Charlemagne sent to the
   pope his whole book, or only an abridgement, and whether he sent
   Angilbert before or after the Frankfort synod to Rome. Hefele (III.
   713) decides that the Capitula (85) were an extract of the Libri
   Carolini (121 chs.), and that Angilbert was twice in Rome, a.d.792 and
   794. Hadrian's answer must have been written at all events before Dec.
   25, 795. It is printed in Mansi, XIII. 759-810, and Migne, Opera Car.
   M. II. fol. 1247-1292. It is full of glaring blunders. Bishop Hefele
   (p. 716) divides the responsibility between the (fallible) pope, the
   emperor, and the copyists.

   [560] Mansi, XIV. 415 sqq.; Walch, XI. 95 sqq.; Gieseler, II. 68;
   Hefele, IV. 41 sqq. (second ed. 1879). Walch says (p. 98) that the
   Roman church played comedy with the acts of this Synod. Mansi was the
   first to publish them, but he did it with an excuse, and added as
   indispensable the refutation of Bellarmin in the appendix to his tract
   De Cultu Imaginum. Hefele and Hergenröther represent this synod as
   being guilty of the same injustice to the Nicene Council as the Synod
   of Frankfort; but this does not alter the fact.

   The opposition to image-worship and other superstitious practices
   continued in the Frankish church during the ninth century.

   Two eminent bishops took the lead in the advocacy of a more spiritual
   and evangelical type of religion. In this they differed from the
   rationalistic and destructive iconoclasts of the East. They were
   influenced by the writings of Paul and Augustin, those inspirers of all
   evangelical movements in church history; with this difference, however,
   that Paul stands high above parties and schools, and that Augustin,
   with all his anti-Pelagian principles, was a strong advocate of the
   Catholic theory of the church and church-order.

   Agobard (in Lyonese dialect Agobaud or Aguebaud), a native of Spain,
   but of Gallic parents, and archbishop of Lyons (816-841), figures
   prominently in the political and ecclesiastical history of France
   during the reign of Louis the Pious. He is known to us already as an
   opponent of the ordeal, the judicial duel and other heathen customs.
   [561] His character presents singular contrasts. He was a rigid
   ecclesiastic and sacerdotalist, and thoroughly orthodox in dogma
   (except that he denied the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures); but,
   on the other hand, a sworn enemy of all superstition, and advocate of
   liberal views in matters of worship. [562] He took part in the
   rebellion of Lothaire against his father Louis in 833, which deprived
   him of his bishopric and left a serious stain on his character, but he
   was afterwards reconciled to Louis and recovered the bishopric. He
   opposed Adoptionism as a milder form of the Nestorian heresy. He
   attacked the Jews, who flocked to Lyons in large numbers, and charges
   them with insolent conduct towards the Christians. In this he shared
   the intolerance of his age. But, on the other hand, he wrote a book
   against image-worship. [563] He goes back to the root of the
   difficulty, the worship of saints. He can find no authority for such
   worship. The saints themselves decline it. It is a cunning device of
   Satan to smuggle heathen idolatry, into the church under pretext of
   showing honor to saints. He thus draws men away from a spiritual to a
   sensual worship. God alone should be adored; to him alone must we
   present the sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart. Angels and holy
   men who are crowned with victory, and help us by their intercessions,
   may be loved and honored, but not worshiped. "Cursed be the man that
   trusteth in man" (Jer. 17:5). We may look with pleasure on their
   pictures, but it is better to be satisfied with the simple symbol of
   the cross (as if this were not liable to the same abuse). Agobart
   approves the canon of Elvira, which forbade images altogether. He says
   in conclusion: "Since no man is essentially God, save Jesus our
   Saviour, so we, as the Scripture commands, shall bow our knees to his
   name alone, lest by giving this honor to another we may be estranged
   from God, and left to follow the doctrines and traditions of men
   according to the inclinations of our hearts." [564]

   Agobard was not disturbed in his position, and even honored as a saint
   in Lyons after his death, though his saintship is disputed. [565] His
   works were lost, until Papirius Masson discovered a MS. copy and
   rescued it from a bookbinder's hands in Lyons (1605).

   Claudius, bishop of Turin (814-839), was a native of Spain, but spent
   three years as chaplain at the court of Louis the Pious and was sent by
   him to the diocese of Turin. He wrote practical commentaries on nearly
   all the books of the Bible, at the request of the emperor, for the
   education of the clergy. They were mostly extracted from the writings
   of Augustin, Jerome, and other Latin fathers. Only fragments remain. He
   was a great admirer of Augustin, but destitute of his wisdom and
   moderation. [566]

   He found the Italian churches full of pictures and picture-worshipers.
   He was told that the people did not mean to worship the images, but the
   saints. He replied that the heathen on the same ground defend the
   worship of their idols, and may become Christians by merely changing
   the name. He traced image-worship and saint-worship to a Pelagian
   tendency, and met it with the Augustinian view of the sovereignty of
   divine grace. Paul, he says, overthrows human merits, in which the
   monks now most glory, and exalts the grace of God. We are saved by
   grace, not by works. We must worship the Creator, not the creature.
   "Whoever seeks from any creature in heaven or on earth the salvation
   which he should seek from God alone, is an idolater." The departed
   saints themselves do not wish to be worshipped by us, and cannot help
   us. While we live, we may aid each other by prayers, but not after
   death. He attacked also the superstitious use of the sign of the cross,
   going beyond Charlemagne and Agobard. He met the defence by carrying it
   to absurd conclusions. If we worship the cross, he says, because Christ
   suffered on it, we might also worship every virgin because he was born
   of a virgin, every manger because he was laid in a manger, every ship
   because he taught from a ship, yea, every ass because he rode on an ass
   into Jerusalem. We should bear the cross, not adore it. He banished the
   pictures, crosses and crucifixes from the churches, as the only way to
   kill superstition. He also strongly opposed the pilgrimages. He had no
   appreciation of religious symbolism, and went in his Puritanic zeal to
   a fanatical extreme.

   Claudius was not disturbed in his seat; but, as he says himself, he
   found no sympathy with the people, and became "an object of scorn to
   his neighbors," who pointed at him as "a frightful spectre." He was
   censured by Pope Paschalis I. (817-824), and opposed by his old friend,
   the Abbot Theodemir of the diocese of Nismes, to whom he had dedicated
   his lost commentary on Leviticus (823), by Dungal (of Scotland or
   Ireland, about 827), and by Bishop Jonas of Orleans (840), who unjustly
   charged him with the Adoptionist and even the Arian heresy. Some
   writers have endeavored, without proof, to trace a connection between
   him and the Waldenses in Piedmont, who are of much later date. [567]

   Jonas of Orleans, Hincmar of Rheims, and Wallafrid Strabo still
   maintained substantially the moderate attitude of the Caroline books
   between the extremes of iconoclasm and image-worship. But the
   all-powerful influence of the popes, the sensuous tendency and
   credulity of the age, the ignorance of the clergy, and the grosser
   ignorance of the people combined to secure the ultimate triumph of
   image-worship even in France. The rising sun of the Carolingian age was
   obscured by the darkness of the tenth century.

   angelus, in quaestionibus solvendis acutus, in revincendis haereticis
   circumspectus, in explicandis Scripturis canonicis cautus." In the same
   place, he says of Paul that his epistles are wholly given to destroy
   man's merits and to exalt God's grace ("ut merita hominum tollat, unde
   maxime nunc monachi gloriantur, et gratiam Dei commendet"). On his
   Augustinianism, see the judicious remarks of Neander. Reuter (I. 20)
   calls him both a biblical reformer and a critical rationalist.

   Waldensergeshichte längst aufgegeben. Dabei soll nicht geleugnet
   werden, dass die Tendenzen des Claudius sich noch eine zeitlang in
   Italien erhalten haben; es ist soeben bemerkt worden, dass, nach dem

   die geringste Spur vorhanden."

   CHAPTER XI.

   DOCTRINAL CONTROVERSIES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 106. General Survey.

   Our period is far behind the preceding patristic and the succeeding
   scholastic in doctrinal importance, but it mediates between them by
   carrying the ideas of the fathers over to the acute analysis of the
   schoolmen, and marks a progress in the development of the Catholic
   system. It was agitated by seven theological controversies of
   considerable interest.

   1. The controversy about the single or double Procession of the Holy
   Spirit. This belongs to the doctrine of the Trinity and was not
   settled, but divides to this day the Greek and Latin churches.

   2. The Monotheletic controversy is a continuation of the Eutychian and
   Monophysitic controversies of the preceding period. It ended with the
   condemnation of Monotheletism and an addition to the Chalcedonian
   Christology, namely, the doctrine that Christ has two wills as well as
   two natures.

   3. The Adoptionist controversy is a continuation of the Nestorian.
   Adoptionism was condemned as inconsistent with the personal union of
   the two natures in Christ.

   4 and 5. Two Eucharistic controversies resulted in the general
   prevalence of the doctrine of transubstantiation.

   6. The Predestinarian controversy between Gottschalk and Hincmar tended
   to weaken the influence of the Augustinian system, and to promote
   semi-Pelagian views and practices.

   7. The Image-controversy belongs to the history of worship rather than
   theology, and has been discussed in the preceding chapter. [568]

   The first, second, and seventh controversies affected the East and the
   West; the Adoptionist, the two Eucharistic, and the Predestinarian
   controversies were exclusively carried on in the West, and ignored in
   the East.

   § 107. The Controversy on the Procession of the Holy Spirit.

   See the Lit. in § 67 p. 304 sq. The arguments for both sides of the
   question were fully discussed in the Union Synod of Ferrara-Florence,
   1438-'39; see Hefele: Conciliengesch. VII. P. II. p. 683 sqq.; 706
   sqq.; 712 sqq.

   The Filioque-controversy relates to the eternal procession of the Holy
   Spirit, and is a continuation of the trinitarian controversies of the
   Nicene age. It marks the chief and almost the only important dogmatic
   difference between the Greek and Latin churches. It belongs to
   metaphysical theology, and has far less practical value than the
   regenerating and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of
   men. But it figures very largely in history, and has occasioned,
   deepened, and perpetuated the greatest schism in Christendom. The
   single word Filioque keeps the oldest, largest, and most nearly related
   churches divided since the ninth century, and still forbids a reunion.
   The Eastern church regards the doctrine of the single procession as the
   corner-stone of orthodoxy, and the doctrine of the double procession as
   the mother of all heresies. She has held most tenaciously to her view
   since the fourth century, and is not likely ever to give it up. Nor can
   the Roman church change her doctrine of the double procession without
   sacrificing the principle of infallibility.

   The Protestant Confessions agree with the Latin dogma, while on the
   much more vital question of the papacy they agree with the Eastern
   church, though from a different point of view. The church of England
   has introduced the double procession of the Spirit even into her
   litany. [569] It should be remembered, however, that this dogma was not
   a controverted question in the time of the Reformation, and was
   received from the mediaeval church without investigation. Protestantism
   is at perfect liberty to go back to the original form of the Nicene
   Creed if it should be found to be more in accordance with the
   Scripture. But the main thing for Christians of all creeds is to
   produce "the fruit of the Spirit, which is love, joy, peace,
   long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness,
   self-control."

   Let us first glance at the external history of the controversy.

   1. The New Testament. The exegetical starting-point and foundation of
   the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit is the word of our
   Lord in the farewell address to his disciples: When the Paraclete (the
   Advocate) is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
   Spirit of truth, who proceedeth (or, goeth forth) from the Father, he
   shall bear witness of me." [570]

   On this passage the Nicene fathers based their doctrine of the
   procession of the Holy Spirit, [571] as his personal property or
   characteristic individuality [572] while the unbegotten Fatherhood
   [573] belongs to the person of the Father, and the eternal generation
   [574] to the person of the Son.

   Our Lord says neither that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father
   alone, nor that he proceeds from the Father and the Son. But in several
   other passages of the same farewell addresses he speaks of the Spirit
   as being sent by the Father and the Son, and promises this as a future
   event which was to take place after his departure, and which actually
   did take place on the day of Pentecost and ever since. [575]

   On these passages is based the doctrine of the mission of the Spirit.
   [576] This is regarded as a temporal or historical act, and must be
   distinguished from the eternal procession in the Trinity itself. In
   other words, the procession belongs to the Trinity of essence, and is
   an intertrinitarian process (like the eternal generation of the Son),
   but the mission belongs to the Trinity of revelation in the historical
   execution of the scheme of redemption. In this exegesis the orthodox
   divines of the Greek and Latin churches are agreed. They differ on the
   source of the procession, but not on the mission.

   Modern exegetes, who adhere closely to the grammatical sense, and are
   not governed by dogmatic systems, incline mostly to the view that no
   metaphysical distinction is intended in those passages, and that the
   procession of the Spirit from the Father, and the mission of the Spirit
   by the Father and the Son, refer alike to the same historic event and
   soteriological operation, namely, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on
   the day of Pentecost, and his continued work in the church and in the
   heart of believers. The Spirit "proceeds" when he "is sent" on his
   divine mission to glorify the Son and to apply the redemption to men.
   The Saviour speaks of the office and work of the Spirit rather than of
   his being and essence. Nevertheless there is a difference which must
   not be overlooked. In the procession, the Spirit is active: in the
   mission, he is passive; the procession is spoken of in the present
   tense (ejkporeuvetai) as a present act, the mission in the future tense
   (pevmyw) as a future act, so that the former seems to belong to the
   eternal Trinity of essence, the latter to the historical or economical
   Trinity of revelation. Now God indeed reveals himself as he actually
   is, and we may therefore reason back from the divine office of the
   Spirit to his divine nature, and from his temporal mission to his
   eternal relation. Yet it may be questioned whether such inference
   justifies the doctrine of a double procession in the absence of any
   express Scripture warrant. [577]

   2. The Nicene Creed, in its original form of 325, closes abruptly with
   the article: "And [we believe] into the Holy Spirit. [578] In the
   enlarged form (which is usually traced to the Council of
   Constantinople, 381, and incorporated in its acts since 451, but is
   found earlier in Epiphanius, 373, and Cyril of Jerusalem, 362, we have
   the addition: "the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the
   Father," etc. [579] This form was generally adopted in the Eastern
   churches since the Council of Chalcedon, 451 (at which both forms were
   recited and confirmed), and prevails there to this day unaltered. It is
   simply the Scripture phrase without any addition, either of the Greek
   "alone," or of the Latin "and from the Son." The Greek church
   understood the clause in an exclusive sense, the Latin church, since
   Augustin and Leo I., in an incomplete sense. [580]

   The Latin church had no right to alter an oecumenical creed without the
   knowledge and consent of the Greek church which had made it; for in the
   oecumenical Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople the Western church
   was scarcely represented, at Nicaea only by one bishop (Hosius of
   Spain), in the second not at all; and in the Council of Chalcedon the
   delegates of Pope Leo I. fully agreed to the enlarged Greek form of the
   Nicene symbol, yet without the Filioque, which was then not thought of,
   although the doctrine of the double procession was already current in
   the West. A departure from this common symbolical standard of the most
   weighty oecumenical councils by a new addition, without consent of the
   other party, opened the door to endless disputes.

   The Enlargement of the Nicene Creed.

   The third national Synod of Toledo in Spain, a.d. 589, held after the
   conversion of King Reccared to the Catholic faith, in its zeal for the
   deity of Christ against the Arian heresy which lingered longest in that
   country, and without intending the least disrespect to the Eastern
   church, first inserted the clause Filioque in the Latin version of the
   Nicene Creed. [581] Other Spanish synods of Toledo did the same. [582]

   From Spain the clause passed into the Frankish church. It was discussed
   at the Synod of Gentilly near Paris in 767, but we do not know with
   what result. [583] The Latin view was advocated by Paulinus of Aquileja
   (796), [584] by Alcuin (before 804), and by Theodulf of Orleans. [585]
   It was expressed in the so-called Athanasian Creed, which made its
   appearance in France shortly before or during the age of Charlemagne.
   [586] The clause was sung in his chapel. He brought the matter before
   the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in 809, which decided in favor of the
   double procession. [587] He also sent messengers to Pope Leo III., with
   the request to sanction the insertion of the clause in the Nicene
   Creed. The pope decided in favor of the doctrine of the double
   procession, but protested against the alteration of the creed, and
   caused the Nicene Creed, in its original Greek text and the Latin
   version, to be engraved on two tablets and suspended in the Basilica of
   St. Peter, as a perpetual testimony against the innovation. [588] His
   predecessor, Hadrian I., had a few years before (between 792 and 795)
   defended the Greek formula of John of Damascus and patriarch Tarasius,
   that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son. [589] But the
   violent assault of Photius upon the Latin doctrine, as heretical, drove
   the Latin church into the defensive. Hence, since the ninth century,
   the, Filioque was gradually introduced into the Nicene Creed all over
   the West, and the popes themselves, notwithstanding their
   infallibility, approved what their predecessors had condemned. [590]

   The coincidence of the triumph of the Filioque in the West with the
   founding of the new Roman Empire is significant; for this empire
   emancipated the pope from the Byzantine rule.

   The Greek church, however, took little or no notice of this innovation
   till about one hundred and fifty years later, when Photius, the learned
   patriarch of Constantinople, brought it out in its full bearing and
   force in his controversy with Nicolas I., the pope of old Rome. [591]
   He regarded the single procession as the principal part of the doctrine
   concerning the Holy Spirit on which the personality and deity of the
   Spirit depended, and denounced the denial of it as heresy and
   blasphemy. After this time no progress was made for the settlement of
   the difference, although much was written on both sides. The chief
   defenders of the Greek view, after the controversy with Photius, were
   Theophylactus, Euthymius Zigabenus, Nicolaus of Methone, Nicetus
   Choniates, Eustratius, and in modern times, the Russian divines,
   Prokovitch, Zoernicav, Mouravieff, and Philaret. The chief defenders of
   the Latin doctrine are Aeneas, bishop of Paris, [592] Ratramnus (or
   Bertram), a monk of Corbie, in the name of the French clergy in the
   ninth century, [593] Anselm of Canterbury (1098), [594] Peter
   Chrysolanus, archbishop of Milan (1112), [595] Anselm of Havelberg
   (1120), [596] and Thomas Aquinas (1274), [597] and in more recent
   times, Leo Alacci, Michael Le Quien, and Cardinal Hergenröther. [598]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [569] "O God the Holy Ghost, who proceedeth from the Father and the
   Son, have mercy upon us miserable sinners." No orthodox Greek or
   Russian Christian could join an Anglican in this prayer without treason
   to his church. It is to be understood, however, that some of the
   leading divines of the church of England condemn the insertion of the
   Filioque in the Creed. Dr. Neale (Introduction to the History of the
   Holy Eastern Church, vol. II. p. 1168) concludes that this insertion
   "in the inviolable Creed was an act utterly unjustifiable, and throws
   on the Roman church the chief guilt in the horrible schism of 1054. It
   was done in the teeth of the veto passed in the sixth session of the
   Council of Ephesus, in the fifth of Chalcedon, in the sixth collation
   of the second of Constantinople, and in the seventh of the third of
   Constantinople. It was done against the express command of a most holy
   Pope, himself a believer in the double Procession, who is now with God.
   No true union--experience has shown it--can take place--between the
   churches till the Filioque be omitted from the Creed, even if a truly
   oecumenical Synod should afterwards proclaim the truth of the
   doctrine." Bishop Pearson was of the same opinion as to the insertion,
   but approved of the Latin doctrine. He says (in his Exposition of the
   Creed, Art. VIII): "Now although the addition of the words to the
   formal Creed without the consent, and against the protestation of the
   Oriental Church, be not justifiable; yet that which was added, is
   nevertheless certainly a truth, and may be so used in that Creed by
   them who believe the same to be a truth; so long as they pretend it not
   to be a definition of that Council, but an addition or explication
   inserted, and condemn not those who, out of a greater respect to such
   synodical determinations, will admit of no such insertion, nor speak
   any other language than the Scriptures and their fathers spake."

   [570] John 15:26: ho Parakletos... to pneuma tes aletheias, ho para tou
   Patros ekporeuetai(Vulg.: procedit). The verb ekporeuomai(med. ),
   procedo, may in itself describe either proceeding from a source, or
   proceeding on a mission; but in the former case ek, out of, would be a
   more suitable preposition than para, from the side of. Hence the Nicene
   Creed and the Greek fathers substitute ekfor parain stating their
   dogma. The para, however, does not exclude the ekand the Father is in
   any case the source of the Spirit. The question is only, whether he is
   the sole source, or jointly with the Son.

   [577] On the exegetical question, see the commentaries on John 15:26
   and the parallel passages by Lange (Am. ed., p. 469), Luthardt, Meyer,
   Weiss (6th ed. of Meyer), Alford, Westcott, Godet. Lange says: "To the
   Father doubtless belongs the honor of being the first archefrom which
   the Son himself proceeds; but since the Holy Spirit is at the same time
   the Spirit of the Son, unto whom it is also given to have life in
   himself, the diatouhuiou(ektoupatros) of the Greek theology is not
   sufficient." Godet in loc.: " It is difficult (with Luthardt, Meyer,
   and most modems) to refer the words: who proceedeth from the Father, to
   the same fact as the former: whom I will send to you from the Father,
   as this would be mere tautology. Besides, the future pempso. I will
   send, refers to an historical fact to take place at an undefined
   period, while the present ekporeuetai, proceedeth, seems to refer to a
   permanent, divine, and therefore eternal relation. As the historic fact
   of the incarnation corresponds to the eternal generation of the Son, so
   the pentecostal effusion of the Holy Spirit to the eternal procession
   of the Spirit from God. The divine facts of revelation are based upon
   the Trinitarian relations, and are, so to speak, their reflections.
   (Les faits de la révélation reposent sur les relations trinitaires. Ils
   en sont comme les reflets.) As the incarnation of the Son is related to
   His eternal generation, so is the mission of the Holy Spirit to His
   procession with the divine essence.--The Latin Church, starting from
   the words,I will send, is not wrong in affirming the Filioque, nor the
   Greek church, starting from the words: from the Father, in maintaining
   per Filium, and the subordination. To harmonize these two views, we
   must place ourselves at the christological stand-point of St. John's
   Gospel, according to which the homoousia and the subordination are both
   at the same time true (sont vrais simultanément)." Milligan and Moulton
   in loc. (in Schaff's Revision Com. ): " The words 'which goeth forth
   from the Father,' are not intended to express any metaphysical relation
   between the First and Third Persons of the Trinity, but to lead our
   thoughts back to the fact that, as it is the distinguishing
   characteristic of Jesus that He comes from the Father, so One of like
   Divine power and glory is now to take His place. The same words 'from
   the Father' are again added to 'I will send,' because the Father is the
   ultimate source from which the Spirit as well as the Son 'goes forth,'
   and really the Giver of the Spirit through the Son who asks for Him
   (comp. 14:16). In the power of this Spirit, therefore, the connection
   of the disciples with the Father will, in the time to come, be not less
   close, and their strength from the Father not less efficacious, than it
   had been while Jesus was Himself beside them."

   [582] The fourth Council of Toledo (633) likewise repeated the Creed
   with the Filioque, see Hefele III. 79. All the other Councils of Toledo
   (a.d.638, 646, 655, 675, 681, 683, 684, 688, 694) begin with a
   confession of faith, several with the unaltered Nicene creed, others
   with enlarged forms.

   Holy Spirit from the Son was necessary for salvation; but the pope
   replied that other things were necessary for salvation, and yet not
   mentioned in the creed. He also advised to omit the signing of the
   clause in the imperial chapel; all other churches in France would
   follow the example of omission, and thus the offence given would be
   most easily removed.

   § 108. The Arguments for and against the Filioque.

   We proceed to the statement of the controverted doctrines and the chief
   arguments.

   I. The Greek and Latin churches agree in holding-

   (1) The personality and deity of the third Person of the holy Trinity.

   (2) The eternal procession (ekporeusis, prochessio) of the Holy Spirit
   within the Trinity.

   (3) The temporal mission (pempsis, missio) of the Holy Spirit from the
   Father and the Son, beginning with the day of Pentecost, and continued
   ever since in the church.

   II. They differ on the source of the eternal procession of the Spirit,
   whether it be the Father alone, or the Father and the Son. The Greeks
   make the Son and the Spirit equally dependent on the Father, as the one
   and only source of the Godhead; the Latins teach an absolute
   co-ordination of the three Persons of the Trinity as to essence, but
   after all admit a certain kind of subordination as to dignity and
   office, namely, a subordination of the Son to the Father, and of the
   Spirit to both. The Greeks approach the Latins by the admission that
   the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son (this was the
   doctrine of Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus); the Latins
   approach the Greeks by the admission that the Spirit proceeds chiefly
   (principaliter) from the Father (Augustin). But little or nothing is
   gained by this compromise. The real question is, whether the Father is
   the only source of the Deity, and whether the Son and the Spirit are
   co-ordinate or subordinate in their dependence on the Father.

   1. The Greek doctrine in its present shape. The Holy Spirit proceeds
   from the Father alone (ek monou tou patros), as the beginning (arche),
   cause or root (aitia, rize, chausa, radix), and fountain (pege) of the
   Godhead, and not from the Son. [599]

   John of Damascus, who gave the doctrine of the Greek fathers its
   scholastic shape, about a.d. 750, one hundred years before the
   controversy between Photius and Nicolas, maintained that the procession
   is from the Father alone, but through the Son, as mediator. [600] The
   same formula, Ex Patre per Filium, was used by Tarasius, patriarch of
   Constantinople, who presided over the seventh oecumenical Council
   (787), approved by Pope Hadrian I., and was made the basis for the
   compromise at the Council of Ferrara (1439), and at the Old Catholic
   Conference at Bonn (1875). But Photius and the later Eastern
   controversialists dropped or rejected the per Filium, as being nearly
   equivalent to ex Filio or Filioque, or understood it as being
   applicable only to the mission of the Spirit, and emphasized the
   exclusiveness of the procession from the Father. [601]

   The arguments for the Greek doctrine are as follows:

   (a) The words of Christ, John 15:26, understood in an exclusive sense.
   As this is the only passage of the Bible in which the procession of the
   Spirit is expressly taught, it is regarded by the Greeks as conclusive.

   (b) The supremacy or monarchia of the Father. He is the source and root
   of the Godhead. The Son and the Spirit are subordinated to him, not
   indeed in essence or substance (oujsiva), which is one and the same,
   but in dignity and office. This is the Nicene subordinatianism. It is
   illustrated by the comparison of the Father with the root, the Son with
   the stem, the Spirit with the fruit, and such analogies as the sun, the
   ray, and the beam; the fire, the flame, and the light.

   (c) The analogy of the eternal generation of the Son, which is likewise
   from the Father alone, without the agency of the Spirit.

   (d) The authority of the Nicene Creed, and the Greek fathers,
   especially Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrus, and John of Damascus. The Antiochean
   school is clearly on the Greek side; but the Alexandrian school leaned
   to the formula through the Son (dia; tou' uiJou', per Filium). The
   Greeks claim all the Greek fathers, and regard Augustin as the inventor
   of the Latin dogma of the double procession.

   The Latin doctrine is charged with innovation, and with dividing the
   unity of the Godhead, or establishing two sources of the Deity. But the
   Latins replied that the procession was from one and the same source
   common to both the Father and the Son.

   2. The Latin theory of the double procession is defended by the
   following arguments:

   (a) The passages where Christ says that he will send the Spirit from
   the Father (John 15:26; 16:7); and that the Father will send the Spirit
   in Christ's name (14:26); and where he breathes the Spirit on his
   disciples (20:22). The Greeks refer all these passages to the temporal
   mission of the Spirit, and understand the insufflation to be simply a
   symbolical act or sacramental sign of the pentecostal effusion which
   Christ had promised. The Latins reply that the procession and the
   mission are parallel processes, the one ad intra, the other ad extra.

   (b) The equality of essence (oJmoousiva) of the Father and Son to the
   exclusion of every kind of subordinationism (since Augustin) requires
   the double procession. The Spirit of the Father is also the Spirit of
   the Son, and is termed the Spirit of Christ. But, as already remarked,
   Augustin admitted that the Spirit proceeds chiefly from the Father, and
   this after all is a kind of subordination of dignity. The Father has
   his being (oujsiva) from himself, the Son and the Spirit have it from
   the Father by way of derivation, the one by generation, the other by
   procession.

   (c) The temporal mission of the Spirit is a reflection of his eternal
   procession. The Trinity of revelation is the basis of all our
   speculations on the Trinity of essence. We know the latter only from
   the former.

   (d) The Nicene Creed and the Nicene fathers did not understand the
   procession from the Father in an exclusive sense, but rather in
   opposition to the Pneumatomachi who denied the divinity of the Holy
   Spirit. Some Greek fathers, as Epiphanius, Cyril of Alexandria, and
   John of Damascus, teach the Latin doctrine. This is not the case
   exactly. The procession of the Spirit "through the Son," is not
   equivalent to the procession "from the Son," but implies a
   subordination.

   (e) The Latin fathers are in favor of Filioque, especially Ambrose,
   Augustin, Jerome, Leo I., Gregory I. [602]

   (f) The insertion of the Filioque is as justifiable as the other and
   larger additions to the Apostles' Creed and to the original Nicene
   Creed of 325, and was silently accepted, or at least not objected to by
   the Greek church until the rivalry of the Patriarch of Constantinople
   made it a polemical weapon against the Pope of Rome. To this the Greeks
   reply that the other additions are consistent and were made by common
   consent, but the Filioque was added without the knowledge and against
   the teaching of the East by churches (in Spain and France) which had
   nothing to do with the original production.

   This controversy of the middle ages was raised from the tomb by the Old
   Catholic Conference held in Bonn, 1875, under the lead of the learned
   historian, Dr. Döllinger of Munich, and attended by a number of German
   Old Catholic, Greek and Russian, and high Anglican divines. An attempt
   was made to settle the dispute on the basis of the teaching of the
   fathers before the division of the Eastern and Western churches,
   especially the doctrine of John of Damascus, that is, the single
   procession of the Spirit from the Father mediated through the Son. The
   Filioque was surrendered as an unauthorized and unjustifiable
   interpolation.

   But the Bonn Conference has not been sanctioned by any ecclesiastical
   authority, and forms only an interesting modern episode in the, history
   of this controversy, and in the history of the Old Catholic communion.

   Then follow the proofs from John 15:26, and the Greek fathers. In the
   same question, the formula khai `ek thou huihou (Filioque) is rejected
   as a later adulteration. In the heat of the controversy, it was even
   stigmatized as a sin against the Holy Ghost. The Longer Russian
   Catechism, on the Eighth Article of the Nicene Creed (in Schaff's
   Creeds, etc., II. 481), denies that the doctrine of the single
   procession admits of any change or supplement, for the following
   reasons: " First, because the Orthodox Church repeats the ver y words
   of Christ, and his words are doubtless the exact and perfect expression
   of the truth. Secondly, because the Second Ecumenical Council, whose
   chief object was to establish the true doctrine respecting the Holy
   Spirit, has without doubt sufficiently set forth the same in the Creed;
   and the Catholic Church has acknowledged this so decidedly that the
   third Oecumenical Council in its seventh canon forbade the composition
   of any new creed." Then the Catechism quotes the following passage from
   John of Damascus: " Of the Holy Ghost, we both say that He is from the
   Father, and call Him the Spirit of the Father; while we nowise say that
   He is from the Son, but only call Him the Spirit of the Son." (Theol.,
   lib. l.c. 11, v. 4.)

   writings, stated by Hergenröther, Photius, I. 691 sq.; and in the

   his monograph on John of Damascus (Gotha, 1879, p. 283 sq. ), thus sums
   up the views of this great divine on the procession: 1) The Holy Spirit
   proceeds from the Father and rests in the Son. 2) He does not proceed
   from the Son, but from the Father through the Son. 3) He is the image
   of the Son, as the Son is the image of the Father. 4) He forms the
   mediation between the Father and the Son, and is through the Son
   connected with the Father.

   § 110. The Doctrine of Two Wills in Christ.

   The Monotheletic or one-will controversy is a continuation of the
   Christological contests of the post-Nicene age, and closely connected
   with the Monophysitic controversy. [604]

   This question had not been decided by the ancient fathers and councils,
   and passages from their writings were quoted by both parties. But in
   the inevitable logic of theological development it had to be agitated
   sooner or later, and brought to a conciliar termination.

   The controversy had a metaphysical and a practical aspect.

   The metaphysical and psychological aspect was the relation of will to
   nature and to person. Monotheletism regards the will as an attribute of
   person, Dyotheletism as an attribute of nature. It is possible to
   conceive of an abstract nature without a will; it is difficult to
   conceive of a rational human nature without impulse and will; it is
   impossible to conceive of a human person without a will. Reason and
   will go together, and constitute the essence of personality. Two wills
   cannot coexist in an ordinary human being. But as the personality of
   Christ is complex or divine-human, it may be conceived of as including
   two consciousnesses and two wills. The Chalcedonian Christology at all
   events consistently requires two wills as the necessary complement of
   two rational natures; in other words, Dyotheletism is inseparable from
   Dyophysitism, while Monotheletism is equally inseparable from
   Monophysitism, although it acknowledged the Dyophysitism of Chalcedon.
   The orthodox doctrine saved the integrity and completeness of Christ's
   humanity by asserting his human will. [605]

   The practical aspect of the controversy is connected with the nature of
   the Redeemer and of redemption, and was most prominent with the
   leaders. The advocates of Monotheletism were chiefly concerned to guard
   the unity of Christ's person and work. They reasoned that, as Christ is
   but one person, he can only have one will; that two wills would
   necessarily conflict, as in man the will of the flesh rebels against
   the Spirit; and that the sinlessness of Christ is best secured by
   denying to him a purely human will, which is the root of sin. They made
   the pre-existing divine will of the Logos the efficient cause of the
   incarnation and redemption, and regarded the human nature of Christ
   merely as the instrument through which he works and suffers, as the
   rational soul works through the organ of the body. Some of them held
   also that in the perfect state the human will of the believer will be
   entirely absorbed in the divine will, which amounts almost to a
   pantheistic absorption of the human personality in the divine.

   The advocates of Dyotheletism on the other hand contended that the
   incarnation must be complete in order to have a complete redemption;
   that a complete incarnation implies the assumption of the human will
   into union with the pre-existing divine will of the Logos; that the
   human will is the originating cause of sin and guilt, and must
   therefore be redeemed, purified, and sanctified; that Christ, without a
   human will, could not have been a full man, could not have been
   tempted, nor have chosen between good and evil, nor performed any moral
   and responsible act.

   The Scripture passages quoted by Agatho and other advocates of the
   two-will doctrine, are Matt. 26:39 ("Not as I will, but as Thou wilt");
   Luke 22:42 ("Not my will, but thine be done"); John 6:38 ("I am come
   down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that
   sent me"). For the human will were quoted Luke 2:51 ("he was subject"
   to his parents); Phil. 2:8 ("obedient unto death"), also John 1:43;
   17:24; 19:28; Matt. 27:34; for the divine will, Luke 13:34; John 5:21.

   These Scripture passages, which must in the end decide the controversy,
   clearly teach the human will of Jesus, but the other will from which it
   is distinguished, is the will of his heavenly Father, to which he was
   obedient unto death. The orthodox dogma implies the identity of the
   divine will of Christ with the will of God the Father, and assumes that
   there is but one will in the divine tripersonality. It teaches two
   natures and one person in Christ, but three persons and one nature in
   God. Here we meet the metaphysical and psychological difficulty of
   conceiving of a personality without a distinct will. But the term
   personality is applied to the Deity in a unique and not easily
   definable sense. The three Divine persons are not conceived as three
   individuals.

   The weight of argument and the logical consistency on the basis of the
   Chalcedonian Dyophysitism, which was acknowledged by both parties,
   decided in favor of the two-will doctrine. The Catholic church East and
   West condemned Monotheletism as a heresy akin to Monophysitism. The
   sixth oecumenical Council in 680 gave the final decision by adopting
   the following addition to the Chalcedonian Christology: [606]

   "And we likewise preach two natural wills in him [Jesus Christ], and
   two natural operations undivided, inconvertible, inseparable, unmixed,
   according to the doctrine of the holy fathers; and the two natural
   wills [are] not contrary (as the impious heretics assert), far from it!
   but his human will follows the divine will, and is not resisting or
   reluctant, but rather subject to his divine and omnipotent will. [607]
   For it was proper that the will of the flesh should be moved, but be
   subjected to the divine will, according to the wise Athanasius. For as
   his flesh is called and is the flesh of the God Logos, so is also the
   natural will of his flesh the proper will of the Logos, as he says
   himself: 'I came from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the
   Father who sent me' (John 6:38). ... Therefore we confess two natural
   wills and operations, harmoniously united for the salvation of the
   human race." [608]

   The theological contest was carried on chiefly in the Eastern church
   which had the necessary learning and speculative talent; but the final
   decision was brought about by the weight of Roman authority, and Pope
   Agatho exerted by his dogmatic epistle the same controlling influence
   over the sixth oecumenical Council, as Pope Leo I. had exercised over
   the fourth. In this as well as the older theological controversies the
   Roman popes--with the significant exception of Honorius--stood firmly
   on the side of orthodoxy, while the patriarchal sees of the East were
   alternately occupied by heretics as well as orthodox.

   The Dyotheletic decision completes the Christology of the Greek and
   Roman churches, and passed from them into the Protestant churches; but
   while the former have made no further progress in this dogma, the
   latter allows a revision and reconstruction, and opened new avenues of
   thought in the contemplation of the central fact and truth of the
   divine-human personality of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [604] The name Monotheletism is derived from mononand thelema, will.
   The heresy, whether expressive of the teacher or the doctrine, always
   gives name to the controversy and the sect which adopts it. The
   champions of the heretical one-will doctrine are called (first by John
   of Damascus). Monotheletai, or Monotheletai, Monotheletes, or
   Monothelites; the orthodox two-will doctrine is called Dyotheletism
   (from duothelemata), and its advocates Duotheletai, Dyothelites. The
   corresponding doctrines as to one nature or two natures of the Redeemer
   are termed Monophysitism and Dyophysitism.

   [605] This benefit, however, was lost by the idea of the impersonality
   (anhypostasia) of the human nature of Christ, taught by John of
   Damascus in his standard exposition of the orthodox Christology. His
   object was to exclude the idea of a double personality. But it is
   impossible to separate reason and will from personality, or to assert
   the impersonality of Christ's humanity without running into docetism.
   The most which can be admitted is the Enhypostasia, i.e. the
   incorporation or inclusion of the human nature of Jesus in the one
   divine personality of the Logos. The church has never officially
   committed itself to the doctrine of the impersonality.

   "Cum duas autem naturas duasque, naturales voluntates, et duas
   naturales operationes confitemur in uno Domino nostro J. Ch., non
   contrarias eas, nec adversas ad alterutrum dicimus (sicut a via
   veritatis errantes apostolicam traditionem accusant, absit haec
   impietas a fidelium cordibus), nec tanquam separatas in duabus personis
   vel subsistentiis, sed duas dicimus unum eundemque Dominum nostrum J.
   Ch., sicut naturas, ita et naturales in se voluntates et operationes
   habere, divinam scilicet a humanam: divinam quidem voluntatem et
   operationem habere ex aeterno cum coëssentiali Patre, communem; humanam
   temporaliter ex nobis cum nostra natura susceptam." Agatho quotes
   Scripture passages and testimonies of the fathers, but does not define
   the mode in which the two wills cooperate.

   § 111. History of Monotheletism and Dyotheletism.

   The triumph of Dyotheletism was the outcome of a bitter conflict of
   nearly fifty years (633 to 680). The first act reaches to the issue of
   the Ekthesis (638), the second to the issue of the Type (648), the
   third and last to the sixth oecumenical Council (680). The theological
   leaders of Monophysitism were Theodore, bishop of Pharan in Arabia
   (known to us only from a few fragments of his writings), Sergius and
   his successors Pyrrhus and Paul in the patriarchal see of
   Constantinople, and Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria; the political
   leaders were the Emperors Heraclius and Constans II.

   The champions of the Dyotheletic doctrine were Sophronius of Palestine,
   Maximus of Constantinople, and the popes Martin and Agatho of Rome; the
   political supporter, the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus (668-685).

   1. The strife began in a political motive, but soon assumed a
   theological and religious aspect. The safety of the Byzantine empire
   was seriously threatened, first by the Persians, and then by the Arabs,
   and the danger was increased by the division among Christians. The
   Emperor Heraclius (610-640) after his return from the Persian campaign
   desired to conciliate the Monophysites, who were more numerous than the
   orthodox in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt. [609] He hoped, by a union of
   the parties, to protect these countries more effectually against the
   Mohammedan invaders. The Monophysites took offence at the catholic
   inference of two energies (ejnevrgeiai) in the person of Christ. The
   emperor consulted Sergius, the patriarch of Constantinople (since 610),
   who was of Syrian (perhaps Jacobite) descent. They agreed upon the
   compromise-formula of "one divine-human energy" (miva qeandrikh;
   ejnevrgeia). [610] Sergius secured the consent of Pope Honorius
   (625-638), who was afterwards condemned for heresy. Cyrus, the orthodox
   patriarch of Alexandria, published the formula (633), and converted
   thousands of Monophysites. [611]

   But Sophronius, a learned and venerable monk in Palestine, who happened
   to be in Alexandria at that time, protested against the
   compromise-formula as a cunning device of the Monophysites. When he
   became patriarch of Jerusalem (in 633 or 634), he openly confessed, in
   a synodical letter to the patriarchs, the doctrine of Dyotheletism as a
   necessary part of the Chalcedonian Christology. It is one of the most
   important documents in this controversy. [612]

   A few years afterwards, the Saracens besieged and conquered Jerusalem
   (637); Sophronius died and was succeeded by a Monotheletic bishop.

   In the year 638 the Emperor issued, as an answer to the manifesto of
   Sophronius, an edict drawn up by Sergius, under the title Exposition of
   the Faith (e[kqesi" th'" pivstew"), which commanded silence on the
   subject in dispute, but pretty clearly decided in favor of
   Monotheletism. It first professes the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity
   and incarnation in the Chalcedonian sense, and then forbids the use of
   the terms "one" or "two energies" (miva or duvo ejnevrgeiai) since both
   are heretically interpreted, and asserts one will (qevlhma) in Christ.
   [613]

   2. Two synods of Constantinople (638 and 639) adopted the Ekthesis. But
   in the remote provinces it met with powerful resistance. Maximus
   Confessor became the champion of Dyotheletism in the Orient and North
   Africa, and Pope Martinus I. in the West. They thoroughly understood
   the controversy, and had the courage of martyrs for their conviction.

   Maximus was born about 580 of a distinguished family in Constantinople,
   and was for some time private secretary of the Emperor Heraclius, but
   left this post of honor and influence in 630, and entered a convent in
   Chrysopolis (now Scutari). He was a profound thinker and able debater.
   When the Monotheletic heresy spread, he concluded to proceed to Rome,
   and passing through Africa be held there, in the presence of the
   imperial governor and many bishops, a remarkable disputation with
   Pyrrhus, who had succeeded Sergius in the see of Constantinople, but
   was deposed and expelled for political reasons. This disputation took
   place in July, 645, but we do not know in what city of Africa. It
   sounded all the depths of the controversy and ended with the temporary
   conversion of Pyrrhus to Dyotheletism. [614]

   About the same time, several North-African synods declared in favor of
   the Dyotheletic doctrine.

   In the year 648 the Emperor Constans II. (642-668) tried in vain to
   restore peace by means of a new edict called Typos or Type, which
   commanded silence on the subject under dispute without giving the
   preference to either view. [615] It set aside the Ekthesis and declared
   in favor of neutrality. The aim of both edicts was to arrest the
   controversy and to prevent a christological development beyond the
   fourth and fifth oecumenical councils. But the Type was more consistent
   in forbidding all controversy not only about one energy (miva
   ejnevrgeia), but also about one will (e{n qevlhma). Transgressors of
   the Type were threatened with deposition; if clergymen, with
   excommunication; if monks, with the loss of dignity and place, of
   military or civil officers.

   3. An irrepressible conflict cannot be silenced by imperial decrees.
   Pope Martin I., formerly Apocrisiarios of the papal see at
   Constantinople, and distinguished for virtue, knowledge and personal
   beauty, soon after his election (July 5th, 649), assembled the first
   Lateran Council (Oct., 649), so called from being held in the Lateran
   basilica in Rome. It was attended by one hundred and five bishops,
   anathematized the one-will doctrine and the two imperial edicts, and
   solemnly sanctioned the two-will doctrine. It anticipated substantially
   the decision of the sixth oecumenical council, and comes next to it in
   authority on this article of faith. [616]

   The acts of this Roman council, together with an encyclical of the pope
   warning against the Ekthesis and the Type, were sent to all parts of
   the Christian world. At the same time, the pope sent a Greek
   translation of the acts to the Emperor Constans II., and politely
   informed him that the Synod had confirmed the true doctrine, and
   condemned the heresy. Theodore of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paulus
   had violated the full humanity of Christ, and deceived the emperors by
   the Ekthesis and the Type.

   But the emperor, through his representative, Theodore Calliopa, the
   exarch of Ravenna, deposed the pope as a rebel and heretic, and removed
   him from Rome (June, 653). He imprisoned him with common criminals in
   Constantinople, exposed him to cold, hunger, and all sorts of injuries,
   and at last sent him by ship to a cavern in Cherson on the Black Sea
   (March, 655). Martin bore this cruel treatment with dignity, and died
   Sept. 16, 655, in exile, a martyr to his faith in the doctrine of two
   wills.

   Maximus was likewise transported to Constantinople (653), and treated
   with even greater cruelty. He was (with two of his disciples) confined
   in prison for several years, scourged, deprived of his tongue and right
   hand, and thus mutilated sent, in his old age, to Lazica in Colchis on
   the Pontus Euxinus, where he died of these injuries, Aug. 13, 662. His
   two companions likewise died in exile.

   The persecution of these martyrs prepared the way for the triumph of
   their doctrine. In the meantime province after province was conquered
   by the Saracens.

   § 112. The Sixth Oecumenical Council. a.d. 680.

   Constans II. was murdered in a bath at Syracuse (668). His son,
   Constantine IV. Pogonatus (Barbatus, 668-685), changed the policy of
   his father, and wished to restore harmony between the East and the
   West. He stood on good or neutral terms with Pope Vitalian (6 57-672),
   who maintained a prudent silence on the disputed question, and with his
   successors, Adeodatus (672-676), Donus or Domnus (676-678), and Agatho
   (678-681).

   After sufficient preparations, he called, in concert with Agatho, a
   General Council. It convened in the imperial palace at Constantinople,
   and held eighteen sessions from Nov. 7, 680, to Sept. 16, 681. it is
   called the Sixth Oecumenical, and also the First Trullan Synod, from
   the name of the hall or chapel in the palace. [617] The highest number
   of members in attendance was one hundred and seventy-four, including
   three papal legates (two priests and one deacon). The emperor presided
   in person, surrounded by civil and ecclesiastical dignitaries. The acts
   are preserved in the Greek original and in two old Latin versions.
   [618]

   After a full discussion of the subject on both sides, the council, in
   the eighteenth and last session, defined and sanctioned the two-will
   doctrine, almost in the very language of the letter of Pope Agatho to
   the emperor. [619] Macarius, the patriarch of Alexandria, who adhered
   to Monotheletism, was deposed.

   The epistle of Agatho is a worthy sequel of Leo's Epistle to the
   Chalcedonian Council, and equally clear and precise in stating the
   orthodox view. It is also remarkable for the confidence with which it
   claims infallibility for the Roman church, in spite of the monotheletic
   heresy of Pope Honorius (who is prudently ignored). Agatho quotes the
   words of Christ to Peter, Luke 22:31, 32, in favor of papal
   infallibility, anticipating, as it were, the Vatican decision of 1870.
   [620]

   But while the council fully endorsed the dyotheletic view of Agatho,
   and clothed it with oecumenical authority, it had no idea of endorsing
   his claim to papal infallibility; on the contrary, it expressly
   condemned Pope Honorius I. as a Monotheletic heretic, together with
   Sergius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Paulus, Petrus, and Theodore of Pharan.

   Immediately after the close of the council, the emperor published the
   decision, with an edict enforcing it and anathematizing all heretics
   from Simon Magus down to Theodore of Pharan, Sergius, Pope Honorius,
   who in all was their follower and associate, and confirmed the heresy.
   [621] The edict forbids any one hereafter to teach the doctrine of one
   will and one energy under penalty of deposition, confiscation, and
   exile.

   Pope Agatho died Jan. 10, 682; but his successor, Leo II., who was
   consecrated Aug. 17 of the same year, confirmed the sixth council, and
   anathematized all heretics, including his predecessor, Honorius, who,
   instead of adorning the apostolic see, dared to prostitute its
   immaculate faith by profane treason, and all who died in the same
   error. [622]

   The connection of Pope Honorius I. (Oct. 27, 625, to Oct. 12, 638) with
   the Monotheletic heresy has a special interest in its bearing upon the
   dogma of papal infallibility, which stands or falls with a single
   official error, according to the principle: Si falsus in uno, falsus in
   omnibus. It was fully discussed by Catholic scholars on both sides
   before and during the Vatican Council of 1870, which proclaimed that
   dogma, but could not alter the facts of history. The following points
   are established by the best documentary evidence:

   1. Honorius taught and favored in several official letters (to Sergius,
   Cyrus, and Sophronius), therefore ex cathedra, the one-will heresy. He
   fully agreed with Sergius, the Monotheletic patriarch of
   Constantinople. In answer to his first letter (634), he says:
   "Therefore we confess one will (qevlhma, voluntas) of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." [623] He viewed the will as an attribute of person, not of
   nature, and reasoned: One willer, therefore only one will. In a second
   letter to Sergius, he rejects both the orthodox phrase: "two energies,"
   and the heterodox phrase: "one energy" (ejnevrgeia, operatio), and
   affirms that the Bible clearly teaches two natures, but that it is
   quite vain to ascribe to the Mediator between God and man one or two
   energies; for Christ by virtue of his one theandric will showed many
   modes of operation and activity. [624] The first letter was decidedly
   heretical, the second was certainly not orthodox, and both occasioned
   and favored the imperial Ekthesis (638) and Type (648), in their vain
   attempt to reconcile the Monophysites by suppressing the Dyotheletic
   doctrine. [625]

   The only thing which may and must be said in his excuse is that the
   question was then new and not yet properly understood. He was, so to
   say, an innocent heretic before the church had pronounced a decision.
   As soon as it appeared that the orthodox dogma of two natures required
   the doctrine of two wills, and that Christ could not be a full man
   without a human will, the popes changed the position, and Honorius
   would probably have done the same had he lived a few years longer.

   Various attempts have been made by papal historians and
   controversialists to save the orthodoxy of Honorius in order to save
   the dogma of papal infallibility. Some pronounce his letters to be a
   later Greek forgery. [626] Others admit their genuineness, but distort
   them into an orthodox sense by a nonnatural exegesis. [627] Still
   others maintain, at the expense of his knowledge and logic, that
   Honorius was orthodox at heart, but heretical, or at least very
   unguarded in his expressions. [628] But we have no means to judge of
   his real sentiment except his own language, which is unmistakably
   Monotheletic. And this is the verdict not only of Protestants, [629]
   but also of Gallican and other liberal Catholic historians. [630]

   2. Honorius was condemned by the sixth oecumenical Council as "the
   former pope of Old Rome," who with the help of the old serpent had
   scattered deadly error. [631] This anathema was repeated by the seventh
   oecumenical Council, 787, and by the eighth, 869. The Greeks, who were
   used to heretical patriarchs of New Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria, felt
   no surprise, and perhaps some secret satisfaction at the heresy of a
   pope of Old Rome.

   Here again ultramontane historians have resorted to the impossible
   denial either of the genuineness of the act of condemnation in the
   sixth oecumenical Council, [632] or of the true meaning of that act.
   [633] The only consistent way for papal infallibilists is to deny the
   infallibility of the oecumenical Council as regards the dogmatic fact.
   [634] In this case it would involve at the same time a charge of gross
   injustice to Honorius.

   3. But this last theory is refuted by the popes themselves, who
   condemned Honorius as a heretic, and thus bore testimony for papal
   fallibility. His first success or, Severinus, had a brief pontificate
   of only three months. His second successor, John IV., apologized for
   him by putting a forced construction on his language. Agatho prudently
   ignored him. [635] But his successor, Leo II., who translated the acts
   of the sixth Council from Greek into Latin, saw that he could not save
   the honor of Honorius without contradicting the verdict of the council
   in which the papal delegates had taken part; and therefore he expressly
   condemned him in the strongest language, both in a letter to the Greek
   emperor and in a letter to the bishops of Spain, as a traitor to the
   Roman church for trying to subvert her immaculate fate. Not only so,
   but the condemnation of the unfortunate Honorius was inserted in the
   confession of faith which every newly-elected pope had to sign down to
   the eleventh century, and which is embodied in the Liber Diurnus, i.e.
   the official book of formulas of the Roman church for the use of the
   papal curia. [636] In the editions of the Roman Breviary down to the
   sixteenth century his name appears, yet without title and without
   explanation, along with the rest who had been condemned by the sixth
   Council. But the precise facts were gradually forgotten, and the
   mediaeval chroniclers and lists of popes ignore them. After the middle
   of the sixteenth century the case of Honorius again attracted
   attention, and was urged as an irrefutable argument against the
   ultramontane theory. At first the letter of Leo II. was boldly,
   rejected as a forgery as well as those of Honorius; [637] but this was
   made impossible when the Liber Diurnus came to light.

   The verdict of history, after the most thorough investigation from all
   sides and by all parties remains unshaken. The whole church, East and
   West, as represented by the official acts of oecumenical Councils and
   Popes, for several hundred years believed that a Roman bishop may err
   ex cathedra in a question of faith, and that one of them at least had
   so erred in fact. The Vatican Council of 1870 decreed papal
   infallibility in the face of this fact, thus overruling history by
   dogmatic authority. The Protestant historian can in conscience only
   follow the opposite principle: If dogma contradicts facts, all the
   worse for the dogma.

   Notes.

   Bishop Hefele, one of the most learned and impartial Roman Catholic
   historians, thus states, after a lengthy discussion, his present view
   on the case of Honorius (Conciliengesch., vol. III. 175, revised ed.
   1877), which differs considerably from the one he had published before
   the Vatican decree of papal infallibility (in the first ed. of his
   Conciliengesch., vol. III. 1858, p. 145 sqq., and in big pamphlet on
   Honorius, 1870). It should be remembered that Bishop Hefele, like all
   his anti-infallibilist colleagues, submitted to the decree of the
   Vatican Council for the sake of unity and peace.

   "Die beiden Briefe des Papstes Honorius, wie wir sie jetzt haben, sind
   unverfälscht und zeigen, dass Honorius von den beiden monotheletischen
   Terminis ejn qevlhma und miva ejnevrgeia den erstern (im ersten Brief)
   selbst gebrauchte, den anderen dagegen, ebenso auch den orthodoxen
   Ausdruck duvo ejnevrgeiai nicht angewendet wissen wollte. Hat er auch
   Letzteres (die, Missbilligung des Ausdruckes duvo ejnevrg.) im zweiten
   Brief wiederholt, so hat er doch in demselben selbst zwei natürliche
   Energien in Christus anerkannt und in beiden Briefen sich so
   ausgedrückt, dass man annehmen muss, er habe nicht den menschlichen
   Willen überhaupt, sondern nur den Verdorbenen menschlichen Willen in
   Chistus geläugnet, aber obgleich orthodoz denkend, die monotheletische
   Tendenz des Sergius nicht gehörig durchschaut und sich missverständlich
   ausgedrückt, so dass seine Briefe, besonders der erste, den
   Monotheletismus zu bestätigen schienen und damit der Häresie Factisch
   Vorschub leisteten. In dieser Weise erledigt sich uns die Frage nach
   der Orthodoxie des Papstes Honorius, und wir halten sonach den
   Mittelweg zwischen denen, welche ihn auf die gleiche Stufe mit Sergius
   von Constantinopel und Cyrus von Alexandrien stellen und den
   Monotheleten beizählen wollten, und denen, welche durchaus keine Makel
   an ihn duldend in das Schicksal der nimium probantes verfallen sind, so
   dass sie lieber die Aechtheit der Acten des sechsten allgemeinen
   Concils und mehrerer anderer Urkunden läugnen, oder auch dem sechsten
   Concil einen error in facto dogmatico zuschreiben wollten." Comp. his
   remarks on p. 152; "Diesen Hauptgedanken muss ich auch jetzt noch
   festhalten, dass Honorius im Herzen richtig dachte, sich aber
   unglücklich ausdrückte, wenn ich auch in Folge wiederholter neuer
   Beschäftigung mit diesem Gegenstand und unter Berücksichtigung dessen,
   was Andere in neuer Zeit zur Vertheidigung des Honorius geschrieben
   haben, manches Einzelne meiner früheren Aufstellungen nunmehr
   modificire oder völlig aufgebe, und insbesondere über den ersten Brief
   des Honorius jetzt milder urtheile als früher."

   Cardinal Hergenröther (Kirchengeschichte, vol. I. 358, second ed.
   Freiburg i. B. 1879) admits the ignorance rather than the heresy of the
   pope. "Honorius," he says, "zeigt wohl Unbekanntschaft mit dem Kern der
   Frage, aber keinerlei häretische oder irrige Auffassung. Er
   unterscheidet die zwei unvermischt qebliebenen Naturen sehr genau und
   verstösst gegen kein einziges Dogma der Kirche."

   übereinstimmend) with the views of Sergius, and wrote also in the same
   terms to Cyrus and Sophronius. He too was afraid of logical
   determinations on such matters. It seemed to him altogether necessary
   to suppose but one will in Christ, as it was impossible to conceive, in
   him, any strife between the human and divine will such as by, reason,
   of sin exists in men." ["It seemed to him, as well as to Sergius, that
   a duplicity of will in one and the same subject could not subsist
   without opposition." From the foot-note.] "He approved, indeed, of the
   accommodation (oikonomia), whereby the patriarch Cyrus had brought
   about the re-union of the Monophysites with the Catholic Church. But as
   hitherto no public decision of the church had spoken of 'one mode of
   working,' or of 'two modes of working' of Christ, it seemed to him the
   safest course, that in future such expressions should be avoided, as
   the one might lead to Eutychianism, the other to Nestorianism. He
   reckoned this whole question among the unprofitable subtilties which
   endanger the interests of piety. Men should be content to hold fast to
   this, in accordance with the hitherto established doctrine of the
   church, that the self-same Christ works that which is divine and human
   in both his natures. Those other questions should be left to the
   grammarians in the schools. If the Holy Spirit operates in the
   faithful, as St. Paul says, in manifold ways how much more must this
   hold good of the Head himself!" Neander adds in a note: "Although the
   theory, of two modes of working" [which is the orthodox doctrine] "lies
   at the foundation of the very thing he here asserts, yet he carefully
   avoided expressing this." In the same sense, Dr. Döllinger, when still
   in communion with Rome, stated the doctrine of Honorius, and said
   (Fables of the Popes, p. 226, Am. ed.): "This doctrine of Honorius, so
   welcome to Sergius and the other favorers and supporters of
   Monotheletism, led to the two imperial edicts, the Ekthesis and the
   Typus."

   [626] Bellarmin, and Bishop Bartholus (Bartoli) of Feltre, who
   questioned also the integrity of the letters of Sergius to Honorius (in
   his Apol. pro Honorio I., 1750, as quoted by, Döllinger, p. 253, and
   Hefele, III. 142). Döllinger declares this to be "a lamentable
   expedient!'

   [627] So Perrone, Pennachi, Manning. These divines presume to know
   better than the infallible Pope Leo II., who ex cathedra denounced
   Honorius as a heretic.

   [628] So Pope John IV. (640-642), who apologized for his predecessor
   that he merely meant to reject the notion of two mutually opposing
   wills, as if Christ had a will tainted with sin (Mansi, X. 683). But
   nobody dreamed of ascribing a sinful will to Christ. Bishop Hefele and
   Cardinal Hergenröther resort substantially to the same apology; see
   notes at the end of this section.

   [629] Walch, Neander, Gieseler, Baur, Dorner, Kurtz, etc. See note on
   p. 502.

   [630] Richer, Dupin, Bossuet, Döllinger.

   [631] Mansi, XI. 622, 635, 655, 666

   [632] Baronius (Ad ann. 633 and 681), and Pighius (Diatribe de Actis
   VI. et VII. concil.).

   [633] As a condemnation, not of the heresy of Honorius, but of his
   negligence in suppressing heresy by his counsel of silence (ob
   imprudentem silentii oeconomiam). So the Jesuit Garnier De Honorii et
   concilii VI. causa, in an appendix to his edition of the Liber diurnus
   Romanorum pontificum, quoted by Hefele (III. 175), who takes the
   trouble of refuting this view by, three arguments.

   [634] An error not in the dogmatic definition, but in facto dogmatico.
   It is argued that an oecumenical council as well as a pope may err in
   matter, de facto, though not de fide and de jure. This view was taken
   by Anastasius, the papal librarian, Cardinal Turrecremata, Bellarmin,
   Pallavicino, Melchior Canus, Jos. Sim. Assemani, and recently by
   Professor Pennachi. See Hefele, III. 174, note 4.

   [635] Or rather he told an untruth when be declared that all popes had
   done their duty with regard to false doctrine.

   [636] In this Confession the popes are required to anathematize
   "Sergium ... una cum Honorio, qui pravis eorum assertionibus fomentum
   impendit." Lib. Diurn. cap. II. tit. 9, professio 2. The oath was
   probably prescribed by Gregory II. at the beginning of the eighth
   century.

   [637] Baronius rejects the letter of Leo II. as spurious, Bellarmin as
   corrupted. Bower (History of the Popes) remarks: "Nothing but the
   utmost despair could have suggested to the annalist (Baronius) so
   desperate a shift."

   comments of Theod. Balsamon, Joh. Zonaras, etc., on the Apostolical
   Canons.

   55-348, and Tom. I. 120 and 408 sqq. An extensive discussion of this
   Synod and its canons.

   The pope of Old Rome had achieved a great dogmatic triumph in the sixth
   oecumenical council, but the Greek church had the satisfaction of
   branding at least one pope as a heretic, and soon found an opportunity
   to remind her rival of the limits of her authority.

   The fifth and sixth oecumenical councils passed doctrinal decrees, but
   no disciplinary canons. This defect was supplied by a new council at
   Constantinople in 692, called the Concilium Quinisextum, [638] also the
   Second Trullan Council, from the banqueting hall with a domed roof in
   the imperial palace where it was held. [639]

   It was convened by the Emperor Justinian II. surnamed Rinotmetos, [640]
   one of the most heartless tyrants that ever disgraced a Christian
   throne. He ruled from 685-695, was deposed by a revolution and sent to
   exile with a mutilated nose, but regained the throne in 705 and was
   assassinated in 711. [641]

   The supplementary council was purely oriental in its composition and
   spirit. It adopted 102 canons, most of them old, but not yet legally or
   oecumenically sanctioned. They cover the whole range of clerical and
   ecclesiastical life and discipline, and are valid to this day in the
   Eastern church. They include eighty-five apostolic canons so called
   (thirty-five more than were acknowledged by the Roman church), the
   canons of the first four oecumenical councils, and of several minor
   councils, as Ancyra, Neo-Caesarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, etc.;
   also the canons of Dionysius the Great of Alexandria, Peter of
   Alexandria, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa
   and Gregory of Nazianzum, Amphilochius of Iconium, Timothy of
   Alexandria, Cyril of Alexandria, Gennadius of Constantinople, and an
   anti-Roman canon of Cyprian of Carthage. The decretals of the Roman
   bishops are ignored.

   The canons were signed first, by the emperor; the second place was left
   blank for the pope, but was never filled; then follow the names of Paul
   of Constantinople, Peter of Alexandria, Anastasius of Jerusalem, George
   of Antioch (strangely after that of the patriarch of Jerusalem), and
   others, in all 211 bishops and episcopal representatives, all Greeks
   and Orientals, of whom 43 had been present at the sixth oecumenical
   council.

   The emperor sent the acts of the Trullan Council to Sergius of Rome,
   and requested him to sign them. The pope refused because they contained
   some chapters contrary to ecclesiastical usage in Rome. The emperor
   dispatched the chief officer of his body guard with orders to bring the
   pope to Constantinople. But the armies of the exarch of Ravenna and of
   the Pentapolis rushed to the protection of the pope, who quieted the
   soldiers; the imperial officer had to hide himself in the pope's bed,
   and then left Rome in disgrace. [642] Soon afterwards Justinian II. was
   dethroned and sent into exile. When he regained the crown with the aid
   of a barbarian army (705), he sent two metropolitans to Pope John VII.
   with the request to call a council of the Roman church, which should
   sanction as many of the canons as were acceptable. The pope, a timid
   man, simply returned the copy. Subsequent negotiations led to no
   decisive result.

   The seventh oecumenical Council (787) readopted the 102 canons, and
   erroneously ascribed them to the sixth oecumenical Council.

   The Roman church never committed herself to these canons except as far
   as they agreed with ancient Latin usage. Some of them were inspired by
   an anti-Roman tendency. The first canon repeats the anathema on Pope
   Honorius. The thirty-sixth canon, in accordance with the second and
   fourth oecumenical Councils, puts the patriarch of Constantinople on an
   equality of rights with the bishop of Rome, and concedes to the latter
   only a primacy of honor, not a supremacy of jurisdiction. Clerical
   marriage of the lower orders is sanctioned in canons 3 and 13, and it
   is clearly hinted that the Roman church, by her law of clerical
   celibacy, dishonors wedlock, which was instituted by God and sanctioned
   by the presence of Christ at Cana. But second marriage is forbidden to
   the clergy, also marriage with a widow (canon 3), and marriage after
   ordination (canon 6). Bishops are required to discontinue their
   marriage relation (canon 12). Justinian had previously forbidden the
   marriage of bishops by a civil law. Fasting on the Sabbath in Lent is
   forbidden (canon 55) in express opposition to the custom in Rome. The
   second canon fixes the number of valid apostolical canons at
   eighty-five against fifty of the Latin church. The decree of the
   Council of Jerusalem against eating blood and things strangled (Acts
   15) is declared to be of perpetual force, while in the West it was
   considered merely as a temporary provision for the apostolic age, and
   for congregations composed of Jewish and Gentile converts. The
   symbolical representation of Christ under the figure of the lamb in
   allusion to the words of John the Baptist is forbidden as belonging to
   the Old Testament, and the representation in human form is commanded
   (canon 82).

   These differences laid the foundation for the great schism between the
   East. and the West. The supplementary council of 692 anticipated the
   action of Photius, and clothed it with a quasi-oecumenical authority.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [638] Sunodos penthekte. The Greeks consider it simply as the
   continuation of the sixth oecumenical council, and call its canons
   kanones tes ektes sunodou. For this reason it was held in the same
   locality. The Latins opposed it from the start as a "Synodus erratica,"
   or "Conciliabulum pseudosextum." But they sometimes erroneously
   ascribed its canons to the sixth council.

   [639] Concilium Trullanum in an emphatic sense. The sixth council was
   held in the same locality.

   [640] Rhinotmetos from rhis, nose, in allusion to his mutilation.

   [641] Gibbon (ch. 48) gives the following description of his character:
   "After the decease of his father the inheritance of the Roman world
   devolved to Justinian II.; and the name of a triumphant law-giver was
   dishonored by the vices of a boy, who imitated his namesake only in the
   expensive luxury of building. His passions were strong; his
   understanding was feeble; and he was intoxicated with a foolish pride
   that his birth had given him the command of millions, of whom the
   smallest community would not have chosen him for their local
   magistrate. His favorite ministers were two beings the least
   susceptible of human sympathy, a eunuch and a monk: to the one he
   abandoned the palace, to the other the finances; the former corrected
   the emperor's mother with a scourge, the latter suspended the insolvent
   tributaries, with their heads downward, over a slow and smoky fire.
   Since the days of Commodus and Caracalla the cruelty of the Roman
   princes had most commonly been the effect of their fear; but Justinian,
   who possessed some vigor of character, enjoyed the sufferings, and
   braved the revenge of his subjects about ten years, till the measure
   was full of his crimes and of their patience."

   [642] This is related by Anastasius, Bede, and Paulus Diaconus. See
   Mansi, XII. 3, Baronius ad a. 692, and Hefele, III. 346.

   § 115. Reaction of Monotheletism. The Maronites.

   The great oecumenical councils, notably that of Chalcedon gave rise to
   schismatic sects which have perpetuated themselves for a long time,
   some of them to the present day.

   For a brief period Monotheletism was restored by Bardanes or
   Philippicus, who wrested the throne from Justinian II. and ruled from
   711 to 713. He annulled the creed of the sixth oecumenical Council,
   caused the names of Sergius and Honorius to be reinserted in the
   diptycha among the orthodox patriarchs, and their images to be again
   set up in public places. He deposed the patriarch of Constantinople and
   elected in his place a Monotheletic deacon, John. He convened a council
   at Constantinople, which set aside the decree of the sixth council and
   adopted a Monotheletic creed in its place. The clergy who refused to
   sign it, were deposed. But in Italy he had no force to introduce it,
   and an attempt to do so provoked an insurrection.

   The Emperor Anastasius II. dethroned the usurper, and made an end to
   this Monotheletic episode. The patriarch John accommodated himself to
   the new situation, and wrote an abject letter to the Pope Constantine,
   in which he even addressed him as the head of the church, and begged
   his pardon for his former advocacy of heresy.

   Since that time Dyotheletism was no more disturbed in the orthodox
   church.

   But outside of the orthodox church and the jurisdiction of the
   Byzantine rulers, Monotheletism propagated itself among the inhabitants
   of Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon under the lead of abbot John Marun
   (Marwvn), their first patriarch (d. 701). The maronites, [643] as they
   were called after him, maintained their independence of the Greek
   empire and the Saracens, and adhered to the Monotheletic doctrine till
   the time of the crusades, when they united themselves with the Roman
   church (1182), retaining, however, the celebration of the communion
   under both kinds, the Syrian liturgy, the marriage of the lower clergy,
   their own fast-days, and their own saints.

   § 117. History of Adoptionism.

   The Adoptionist controversy is a revival of the Nestorian controversy
   in a modified form, and turns on the question whether Christ, as to his
   human nature, was the Son of God in essence, or only by adoption. Those
   who took the latter view were called Adoptionists. [644] They taught
   that Christ as to his divinity is the true Son [645] of God, the
   Only-Begotten of the Father; but as man he is his adopted Son, [646]
   the First-Born of Mary. They accepted the Chalcedonian Christology of
   one person and two natures, but by distinguishing a natural Son of God
   and an adopted Son of God, they seemed to teach two persons or a double
   Christ, and thus to run into the Nestorian heresy.

   The orthodox opponents held that Christ was the one undivided and
   indivisible Son of God; that the Virgin Mary gave birth to the eternal
   Son of God, and is for this reason called "the mother of God;" that
   sonship is founded on the person, not on the nature; and that
   Adoptionism leads to two Christs and to four persons in the Trinity.

   Both parties displayed a degree of patristic learning which one would
   hardly expect in this period of the middle ages.

   The history of this movement is confined to the West (Spain and Gaul);
   while all the older Christological controversies originated and were
   mainly carried on and settled in the East. It arose in the Saracen
   dominion of Spain, where the Catholics had to defend the eternal and
   essential Sonship of Christ against the objections both of the Arians
   and the Mohammedans.

   The Council of Toledo, held in 675, declared in the preface to the
   Confession of Faith, that Christ is the Son of God by, nature, not by
   adoption. [647] But about a century afterwards Elipandus, the aged
   Archbishop of Toledo, and primate of that part of Spain which was under
   Mohammedan rule, endeavored to modify the orthodox doctrine by drawing
   a distinction between a natural and an adopted sonship of Christ, and
   by ascribing the former to his divine, the latter to his human nature.
   He wished to save the full humanity of Christ, without, however,
   denying his eternal divinity. Some historians assert that he was
   influenced by a desire to avoid the Mohammedan objection to the
   divinity of Christ; [648] but the conflict of the two religions was too
   strong to admit of any compromise. He may have read Nestorian writings.
   [649] At all events, he came to similar conclusions.

   Having little confidence in his own opinions, Elipandus consulted
   Felix, bishop of Urgel [650] in Catalonia, in that part of Spain which,
   since 778, was incorporated with the dominion of Charlemagne. Felix was
   more learned and clear-headed than Elipandus, and esteemed, even by his
   antagonist Alcuin, for his ability and piety. Neander regards him as
   the originator of Adoptionism; at all events, he reduced it to a
   formulated statement.

   Confirmed by his friend, Elipandus taught the new doctrine with all the
   zeal of a young convert, although he was already eighty years of age;
   and, taking advantage of his influential position, he attacked the
   orthodox opponents with overbearing violence. Etherius, Bishop of Osma
   or Othma (formerly his pupil), and Beatus, a presbyter, and after
   Alcuin abbot at Libana in Asturia, [651] took the lead in the defence
   of the old and the exposure of the new Christology. Elipandus charged
   them with confounding the natures of Christ, like wine and water, and
   with scandalous immorality, and pronounced the anathema on them.

   Pope Hadrian, being informed of these troubles, issued a letter in 785
   to the orthodox bishops of Spain, warning them against the new doctrine
   as rank Nestorianism. [652] But the letter had no effect; the papal
   authority plays a subordinate role in this whole controversy. The
   Saracen government, indifferent to the theological disputes of its
   Christian subjects, did not interfere.

   But when the Adoptionist heresy, through the influence of Felix, spread
   in the French portion of Spain, and even beyond the Pyrenees into
   Septimania, creating a considerable commotion among the clergy, the
   Emperor Charlemagne called a synod to Regensburg (Ratisbon) in Bavaria,
   in 792, and invited the Bishop of Urgel to appear, that his case might
   be properly investigated. The Synod condemned Adoptionism as a renewal
   of the Nestorian heresy.

   Felix publicly and solemnly recanted before the Synod, and also before
   Pope Hadrian, to whom he was sent. But on his return to Spain he was so
   much reproached for his weakness, that, regardless of his solemn oath,
   he yielded to the entreaties of his friends, and re-affirmed his former
   opinions.

   Charlemagne, who did not wish to alienate the spanish portion of his
   kingdom, and to drive it into the protection of the neighboring
   Saracens, directed Alcuin, who in the mean time had come to France from
   England, to send a mild warning and refutation of Adoptionism to Felix.
   When this proved fruitless, and when the Spanish bishops, under the
   lead of Elipandus, appealed to the justice of the emperor, and demanded
   the restoration of Felix to his bishopric, he called a new council at
   Frankfort on the Main in 794, which was attended by about three hundred
   (?) bishops, and may be called "universal," as far as the West is
   concerned. [653] As neither Felix nor any of the Adoptionist bishops
   appeared in person, the council, under the lead of Alcuin, confirmed
   the decree of condemnation passed at Ratisbon.

   Subsequently Felix wrote an apology, which was answered and refuted by
   Alcuin. Elipandus reproached Alcuin for having twenty thousand slaves
   (probably belonging to the convent of Tours), and for being proud of
   wealth. Charles sent Archbishop Leidrad of Lyons and other bishops to
   the Spanish portion of his kingdom, who succeeded, in two visits, in
   converting the heretics (according to Alcuin, twenty thousand).

   About that time a council at Rome, under Leo III., pronounced, on very
   imperfect information, a fresh anathema, erroneously charging that the
   Adoptionists denied to the Saviour any other than a nuncupative
   Godhead.

   Felix himself appeared, 799, at a Synod in Aix-la-Chapelle, and after a
   debate of six days with Alcuin, he recanted his Adoptionism a second
   time. He confessed to be convinced by some passages, not of the
   Scriptures, but of the fathers (especially Cyril of Alexandria, Leo I.,
   and Gregory I.), which he had not known before, condemned Nestorius,
   and exhorted his clergy and people to follow the true faith. [654] He
   spent the rest of his life under the supervision of the Archbishop of
   Lyons, and died in 818. He left, however, a paper in which the doctrine
   of Adoptionism is clearly stated in the form of question and answer;
   and Agobard, the successor of Leidrad, felt it his duty to refute it.

   Elipandus, under the protection of the government of the Moors,
   continued openly true to his heretical conviction. But Adoptionism lost
   its vitality with its champions, and passed away during the ninth
   century. Slight traces of it are found occasionally during the middle
   ages. Duns Scotus (1300) and Durandus a S. Porciano (1320) admit the
   term Filius adoptivus in a qualified sense. [655] The defeat of
   Adoptionism was a check upon the dyophysitic and dyotheletic feature in
   the Chalcedon Christology, and put off indefinitely the development of
   the human side in Christ's Person. In more recent times the Jesuit
   Vasquez, and the Lutheran divines G. Calixtus and Walch, have defended
   the Adoptionists as essentially orthodox.

   writings of Theodor of Mopsueste. Gams (Kirchengesch. Spaniens, II. 2,
   p. 261 sqq.) conjectures that some Eastern Nestorians settled in Spain
   under Moslem rule, and suggested the Adoptionist theory. Hefele (III.
   646) and Möller (Herzog2I. 159) are inclined to the same view.
   Enhueber, Walch, and Bach hold that Elipandus was led to his view by
   opposition to Migetius, who made no distinction between the Logos and
   Christ, as if the second person of the Trinity had not existed before
   the incarnation.--The reports on Migetius are vague. Elipandus charged
   him with teaching three corporeal persons in the Trinity who became
   incarnate in David (the Father), in Jesus (the Son), and in Paul (the
   Holy Spirit). He probably fell into the error of the Priscillianists,
   which was confounded with Sabellianism (hence his name magister
   Salibanorum, which is a corruption for Sabellianorum). See on this
   mysterious phenomenon Henrique Florez, España sagrada, T. V. 543 sq.,
   and Hefele, l.c. III. 629-635 and 657.

   belonged to the metropolis of Tarracona, but since the middle of the
   eighth century, to the province of Narbonne.

   [651] He is still honored in Spain as San Biego, but Elipandus called
   him a disciple of Antichrist,"heretical, schismatical, ignorant, and
   devoted to carnal lusts, and the very opposite of what his name Beatus
   (Blessed) would suggest.

   [652] Hadrian is also reported to have written to Charlemagne, and
   called the Synod of Narbonne, 788; but the acts of this Synod (first
   published by Cattell, 1633) are rejected as spurious by Pagi, Walch,
   and Hefele (III. 662 sq. ).

   [653] See a full account in Hefele III. 678 sqq. He calls it the most
   splendid of all the synods of Charlemagne. It was held apostolica
   auctoritate, two delegates of Pope Hadrian being present. But
   Charlemagne himself presided. The number of members is not given in the
   sources, but Baronius and many others after him say 300.

   § 118. Doctrine of Adoptionism.

   The doctrine of Adoptionism is closely allied in spirit to the
   Nestorian Christology; but it concerns not so much the constitution of
   Christ's person, as simply the relation of his humanity to the
   Fatherhood of God. The Adoptionists were no doubt sincere in admitting
   at the outset the unity of Christ's person, the communication of
   properties between the two natures, and the term Theotokos (though in a
   qualified sense) as applied to the Virgin Mary. Yet their view implies
   an abstract separation of the eternal Son of God and the man Jesus of
   Nazareth, and results in the assertion of two distinct Sons of God. It
   emphasized the dyophysitism and dyotheletism of the orthodox
   Christology, and ran them out into a personal dualism, inasmuch as
   sonship is an attribute of personality, not of nature. The Adoptionists
   spoke of an adoptatus homo instead of an adoptata natura humana, and
   called the adopted manhood an adopted Son. They appealed to Ambrose,
   Hilary, Jerome, Augustin, and Isidore of Seville, and the Mozarabic
   Liturgy, which was used in Spain. [656] Sometimes the term adoptio is
   indeed applied to the Incarnation by earlier writers, and in the
   Spanish liturgy, but rather in the sense of assumptio or analepsis,
   i.e. the elevation of the human nature, through Christ, to union with
   the Godhead. [657] They might, with better reason, have quoted Theodore
   of Mopsuestia as their predecessor; for his doctrine of the huios
   thetosis pretty much the same as their Filius Dei adoptivus. [658]

   The fundamental point in Adoptionism is the distinction of a double
   Sonship in Christ--one by nature and one by grace, one by generation
   and one by adoption, one by essence and one by title, one which is
   metaphysical and another which is brought about by an act of the divine
   will and choice. The idea of sonship is made to depend on the nature,
   not on the person; and as Christ has two natures, there must be in him
   two corresponding Sonships. According to his divine nature, Christ is
   really and essentially (secundum naturam or genere) the Son of God,
   begotten from eternity; but according to his human nature, he is the
   Son of God only nominally (nuncupative) by adoption, or by divine
   grace. By nature he is the Only-Begotten Son of God; [659] by adoption
   and grace he is the First-Begotten Son of God. [660]

   The Adoptionists quoted in their favor mainly John 14:28 Luke 1:80;
   18:19; Mark 13:32; John 1:14; 10:35; Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 11:3; 1 John
   3:2; Deut. 18:15; Ps. 2: 8; 22:23, and other passages from the Old
   Testament, which they referred to the Filius primogenitus et adoptivus;
   while Ps. 60:4 (ex utero ante Luciferum genui te); 44:2; Is. 45:23;
   Prov. 8:25, were understood to apply to the Filius unigenitus. None of
   these passages, which might as well be quoted in favor of Arianism,
   bear them out in the point of dispute. Christ is nowhere called the
   "adopted" Son of God. Felix inferred from the adoption of the children
   of God, that they must have an adoptive head. He made use of the
   illustration, that as a son cannot have literally two fathers, but may
   have one by birth and the other by adoption, so Christ, according to
   his humanity, cannot be the Son of David and the Son of God in one and
   the same sense; but he may be the one by nature and the other by
   adoption. [661]

   It is not clear whether he dated the adopted Sonship of Christ from his
   exaltation [662] or from his baptism, [663] or already from his birth.
   [664] He speaks of a double birth of Christ, compares the baptism of
   Christ with the baptism or regeneration of believers, and connects both
   with the spiritualis generatio per adoptionem; [665] but, on the other
   hand, he seems to trace the union of the human nature with the divine
   to the womb of the Virgin. [666]

   The Adoptionists, as already remarked, thought themselves in harmony
   with the Christology of Chalcedon, and professed faith in one divine
   person in two full and perfect natures; [667] they only wished to bring
   out their views of a double Sonship, as a legitimate consequence of the
   doctrine of two natures.

   The champions of orthodoxy, among whom Alcuin, the teacher and friend
   of Charlemagne, was the most learned and able, next to him Paulinus of
   Aquileja, and Agobard of Lyons, unanimously viewed Adoptionism as a
   revival or modification of the Nestorian heresy, which was condemned by
   the third Oecumenical Council (431). [668]

   Starting from the fact of a real incarnation, the orthodox party
   insisted that it was the eternal, only begotten Son of God, who assumed
   human nature from the womb of the Virgin, and united it with his divine
   person, remaining the proper Son of God, notwithstanding this change.
   [669] They quoted in their favor such passages as John 3:16; Rom. 8:32;
   Eph. 5:2; Acts 3:13-15.

   The radical fault of this heresy is, that it shifts the whole idea of
   Sonship from the person to the nature. Christ is the Son of God as to
   his person, not as to nature. The two natures do not form two Sons,
   since they are inseparably united in the one Christ. The eternal Son of
   God did not in the act of incarnation assume a human personality, but
   human nature. There is therefore no room at all for an adoptive
   Sonship. The Bible nowhere calls Christ the adopted Son of God. Christ
   is, in his person, from eternity or by nature what Christians become by
   grace and regeneration.

   In condemning Monotheletism, the Church emphasized the duality of
   natures in Christ; in condemning Adoptionism, she emphasized the unity
   of person. Thus she guarded the catholic Christology both against
   Eutychian and Nestorian departures, but left the problem of the full
   and genuine humanity of Christ unsolved. While he is the eternal Son of
   God, he is at the same time truly and fully the Son of man. The
   mediaeval Church dwelt chiefly on the divine majesty of Christ, and
   removed him at an infinite distance from man, so that he could only be
   reached through intervening mediators; but, on the other hand, she kept
   a lively, though grossly realistic, remembrance of his passion in the
   daily sacrifice of the mass, and found in the worship of the tender
   Virgin-Mother with the Infant-Saviour on her protecting arm a
   substitute for the contemplation and comfort of his perfect manhood.
   The triumph of the theory of transubstantiation soon followed the
   defeat of Adoptionism, and strengthened the tendency towards an
   excessive and magical supernaturalism which annihilates the natural,
   instead of transforming it.

   Note.

   The learned Walch defends the orthodoxy of the Adoptionists, since they
   did not say that Christ, in his two-fold Sonship, was alius et alius,
   allos kai allos(which is the Nestorian view), but that he was Son
   aliter et aliter, a[llw" kai; a[llw". Ketzerhistorie, vol. IX., pp.
   881, 904. Baur (II., p. 152) likewise justifies Adoptionism, as a
   legitimate inference from the Chalcedonian dogma, but on the assumption
   that this dogma itself includes a contradiction. Neander, Dorner,
   Niedner, Hefele, and Möller concede the affinity of Adoptionism with
   Nestorianism, but affirm, at the same time, the difference and the new
   features in Adoptionism (see especially Dorner II., p. 309 sq.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [656] A strong passage was quoted in the letter of the Spanish bishops
   to Charlemagne from Isidore of Seville, who says (Etymolog., lib. II.,
   c. 2; see Mignes ed. of Alcuin II. 1324): "Unigenitus vocatur secundum
   Divinitatis excellentiam, quia sine fratribus: Primogenitussecundum
   susceptionem hominis, in qua per adoptionem gratiae fratres habere
   dignatus est, de quibus esset primogenitus." From the Mozarabic liturgy
   they quoted seven passages. See Hefele III. 650 sqq.

   [657] In a passage of Hilary (De Trinit. II. 29), there is a dispute
   between two readings--"carnis humilitas Adoptatur," and "adoratur"
   (Alcuin)--although the former alone is consistent with the context, and
   "adoptatur" is used in a more general sense for assumitur (so Agobard).

   of the Father, "non adoptione, non appellatione seu nuncupased in

   Gottschalk or Godescalcus, [670] an involuntary monk and irregularly
   ordained priest, of noble Saxon parentage, strong convictions, and
   heroic courage, revived the Augustinian theory, on one of the most
   difficult problems of speculative theology, but had to suffer bitter
   persecution for re-asserting what the great African divine had
   elaborated and vindicated four centuries before with more depth, wisdom
   and moderation.

   The Greek church ignored Augustin, and still more Gottschalk, and
   adheres to this day to the anthropology of the Nicene and ante-Nicene
   fathers, who laid as great stress on the freedom of the will as on
   divine grace. John of Damascus teaches an absolute foreknowledge, but
   not an absolute foreordination of God, because God cannot foreordain
   sin, which he wills not, and which, on the contrary, he condemns and
   punishes; and he does not force virtue upon the reluctant will.

   The Latin church retained a traditional reverence for Augustin, as her
   greatest divine, but never committed herself to his scheme of
   predestination. [671] It always found individual advocates, as
   Fulgentius of Ruspe, and Isidore of Seville, who taught a two-fold
   predestination, one of the elect unto life eternal, and one of the
   reprobate unto death eternal. Beda and Alcuin were Augustinians of a
   milder type. But the prevailing sentiment cautiously steered midway
   between Augustinianism and Semi-Pelagianism, giving the chief weight to
   the preceding and enabling grace of God, yet claiming some merit for
   man's consenting and cooperating will. [672] This compromise may be
   called Semi-Augustinianism, as distinct from Semi-Pelagianism. It was
   adopted by the Synod of Orange (Arausio) in 529, which condemned the
   Semi-Pelagian error (without naming its adherents) and approved
   Augustin's views of sin and grace, but not his view of predestination,
   which was left open. It was transmitted to the middle ages through Pope
   Gregory the Great, who, next to Augustin, exerted most influence on the
   theology of our period; and this moderated and weakened Augustinianism
   triumphed in the Gottschalk controversy.

   The relation of the Roman church to Augustin in regard to
   predestination is similar to that which the Lutheran church holds to
   Luther. The Reformer held the most extreme view on divine
   predestination, and in his book on the Slavery of the Human Will,
   against Erasmus, he went further than Augustin before him and Calvin
   after him; [673] yet notwithstanding his commanding genius and
   authority, his view was virtually disowned, and gave way to the
   compromise of the Formula of Concord, which teaches both an absolute
   election of believers and a sincere call of all sinners to repentance.
   The Calvinistic Confessions, with more logical consistency, teach an
   absolute predestination as a necessary sequence of Divine omnipotence
   and omniscience, but confine it, like Augustin, to the limits of the
   infralapsarian scheme, with an express exclusion of God from the
   authorship of sin. Supralapsarianism, however, also had its advocates
   as a theological opinion. In the Roman church, the Augustinian system
   was revived by the Jansenists, but only to be condemned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [670] There axe several persons of that name; the three best known are,
   1) the subject of this chapter; 2) the writer of sequences mentioned in
   this volume, p. 433; 3) the prince of the Slavonic and Wendish tribes
   on the borders of Northern Germany, who died a martyr June 7, 1066. The
   meaning of Gottschalk is God's servant. The German word Schalk, Knecht,
   has undergone the same change as the English word knave. Milman (IV.
   184) calls our Gottschalk a "premature Luther" (who was also a Saxon),
   but gives no account of the controversy on "the dark subject of
   predestination." Schrörs (l.c. 96) likewise compares Gottschalk with
   Luther, but the difference is much greater than the resemblance.

   [671] See vol. III. 866 sqq. Neander says (Church Hist. III. 472): "The
   Augustinian doctrine of grace had finally gained a complete victory
   even over Semi-Pelagianism; but on the doctrine of predestination
   nothing had as yet been publicly determined." Gieseler (II. 84):
   "Strict Augustinianism had never been generally adopted even in the
   West. "

   [672] In the language of Gregory I.: "Bonum, quod agimus, et Dei est,
   et nostrum: Dei per praevenientem gratiam, nostrum per obsequentem
   liberam voluntatem. Si enim Dei non est, unde ei gratias in eteruum
   agimus? Rursum si nostrum non est, unde. nobis retribui praemia
   speramus?" Moral., Lib. XXXI. in Cap. 41 Job, in Migne's ed. of
   Gregory's Opera, II. 699.

   [673] Melanchthon, too, at first was so strongly impressed with the
   divine sovereignty that he traced the adultery of David and the treason
   of Judas to the eternal decree of God; but be afterwards changed his
   view in favor of synergism, which Luther never did.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 120. Gottschalk and Babanus Maurus.

   Gottschalk, the son of Count Berno (or Bern), was sent in his childhood
   by his parents to the famous Hessian convent of Fulda as a pious
   offering (oblatus). When he had attained mature age, he denied the
   validity of his involuntary tonsure, wished to leave the convent, and
   brought his case before a Synod of Mainz in 829. The synod decided in
   his favor, but the new abbot, Rabanus Maurus, appealed to the emperor,
   and wrote a book, De Oblatione Puerorum, in defence of the obligatory
   character of the parental consecration of a child to monastic life. He
   succeeded, but allowed Gottschalk to exchange Fulda for Orbais in the
   diocese of Soissons in the province of Rheims. From this time dates his
   ill feeling towards the reluctant monk, whom he called a vagabond, and
   it cannot be denied that Rabanus appears unfavorably in the whole
   controversy.

   At Orbais Gottschalk devoted himself to the study of Augustin and
   Fulgentius of Ruspe (d. 533), with such ardent enthusiasm that he was
   called Fulgentius. [674] He selected especially the passages in favor
   of the doctrine of predestination, and recited them to his fellow-monks
   for hours, gaining many to his views. But his friend, Servatus Lupus,
   warned him against unprofitable speculations on abstruse topics,
   instead of searching the Scriptures for more practical things. He
   corresponded with several scholars' and made a pilgrimage to Rome. On
   his return in 847 or 848, he spent some time with the hospitable Count
   Eberhard of Friuli, a son-in-law of the Emperor Louis the Pious, met
   there Bishop Noting of Verona, and communicated to him his views on
   predestination. Noting informed Rabanus Maurus, who had in the mean
   time become archbishop of Mainz, and urged him to refute this new
   heresy.

   Rabanus Maurus wrote a letter to Noting on predestination, intended
   against Gottschalk, though without naming him. [675] He put the worst
   construction upon his view of a double predestination, and rejected it
   for seven reasons, chiefly, because it involves a charge of injustice
   against God; it contradicts the Scriptures, which promise eternal
   reward to virtue; it declares that Christ shed his blood in vain for
   those that are lost; and it leads some to carnal security, others to
   despair. His own doctrine is moderately Augustinian. He maintains that
   the whole race, including unbaptized children, lies under just
   condemnation in consequence of Adam's sin; that out of this mass of
   corruption God from pure mercy elects some to eternal life, and leaves
   others, in view of their moral conduct, to their just punishment. God
   would have all men to be saved, yet he actually saves only a part; why
   he makes such a difference, we do not know and must refer to his hidden
   counsel. Foreknowledge and foreordination are distinct, and the latter
   is conditioned by the former. Here is the point where Rabanus departs
   from Augustin and agrees with the Semi-Pelagians. He also distinguishes
   between praesciti and praedestinati. The impenitent sinners were only
   foreknown, not foreordained. He admitted that "the punishment is
   foreordained for the sinner," but denied that "the sinner is
   foreordained for punishment." [676] He supported his view with passages
   from Jerome, Prosper, Gennadius, and Augustin. [677]

   Gottschalk saw in this tract the doctrine of the Semi-Pelagian
   Gennadius and Cassianus rather than of "the most catholic doctor"
   Augustin. He appeared before a Synod at Mainz, which was opened Oct. 1,
   848, in the presence of the German king, and boldly professed his
   belief in a two-fold predestination, to life and to death, God having
   from eternity predestinated his elect by free grace to eternal life,
   and quite similarly all reprobates, by a just judgment for their evil
   deserts, to eternal death. [678] The offensive part in this confession
   lies in the words two-fold (gemina) and quite similarly (similiter
   omnino), by which he seemed to put the two foreordinations, i.e.
   election and reprobation, on the same footing; but he qualified it by a
   reference to the guilt and future judgment of the reprobate. He also
   maintained against Rabanus that the Son of God became man and died only
   for the elect. He measured the extent of the purpose by the extent of
   the effect. God is absolutely unchangeable, and his will must be
   fulfilled. What does not happen, cannot have been intended by him.

   The details of the synodical transaction are unknown, but Rabanus, who
   presided over the Synod, gives as the result, in a letter to Hincmar,
   that Gottschalk was condemned, together with his pernicious doctrine
   (which he misrepresents), and handed over to his metropolitan, Hincmar,
   for punishment and safe-keeping.

   ("Patr. Lat.," Tom. 114, col. 1115-1117). Neander (III. 474, note)
   supposes that Gottschalk probably borrowed from Fulgentius the term
   praedestinatio duplex.

   112, col. 1530-1553). Hefele (IV. 134) complains that this edition has
   many inaccuracies and typographical errors.

   [676] Hefele (IV. 136) declares this to be inconsistent, because both
   sentences amount to the same thing and give a good orthodox sense. "In
   Wahrheit ist ja auch der Sünder praedestinirt ad mortem oder poenam,
   aber seine Praedestination ist keine absolute, wie die des electus,
   sondern sie ist bedingt durch die praevisa demerita."

   [677] Chiefly from the Hypomnesticon (Commonitorium, Memorandum),
   usually called Augustinian work against the called Hypognosticon
   (Subnotationes), a pseudo-Pelagians, which was freely quoted at that
   time as Augustinian by Scotus Erigena and Hincmar; while Remigius
   proved the spuriousness. It is printed in the tenth vol. of the
   Benedict. ed. of Augustin, and in Migne's reprint, X. 1611-1664. See

   Augustana Confessione et alibi recte tribuantur divo Augustino.

   [678] The fragment of this confession is preserved by Hincmar, De
   Praedest., c.5 (Migne, 125, col. 89 sq. ): "Ego Gothescalcus credo et
   confiteor, profiteor et testificor ex Deo Patre, per Deum Filium, in
   Deo Spiritu Sancto, et affirmo atque approbo coram Deo et sanctis .
   ejus, quod gemina est praedestinatio, sive electorum ad requiem, sive
   reproborum ad mortem [so far quoted verbatim from Isidore of Seville,
   Sent. II. 6]: quia sicut Deus incommutabilis ante mundi constitutionem
   omnes electos suos incommutabiliter per gratuitam gratiam suam
   praedestinavit ad vitam aeternam, similter omnino omnes reprobos, quia
   in die judicii damnabuntur propter ipsorum mala merita, idem ipse
   incommutabilis Deus per justum judicium suum incommutabiliter
   praedestinavit ad mortem merito sempiternam."

   § 121. Gottschalk and Hincmar.

   Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, a most influential, proud and intolerant
   prelate, was ill-disposed towards Gottschalk, because he had been
   somewhat irregularly (though not invalidly) ordained to the priesthood
   by a rural bishop (chorepiscopus), Rigbold of Rheims, without the
   knowledge of his own bishop of Soissons, and gone on travels without
   permission of his abbot. [679] He treated the poor monk without mercy.
   Gottschalk was summoned before a synod of Chiersy (in palatio
   Carisiaco) [680] in the spring of 849. He refused to recant, and was
   condemned as an incorrigible heretic, deposed from the priesthood,
   publicly scourged for obstinacy, according to the rule of St. Benedict,
   compelled to burn his books, and shut up in the prison of a convent in
   the province of Rheims. [681] According to the report of
   eye-witnessses, he was scourged "most atrociously" and "nearly to
   death," until half dead he threw his book, which contained the proofs
   of his doctrine from the Scriptures and the fathers, into the fire. It
   is a relief to learn that St. Remigius, archbishop of Lyons, expressed
   his horror at the "unheard of impiety and cruelty" of this treatment of
   the miserabilis monachus, as Gottschalk is often called by his friends.

   In his lonely prison at Hautvilliers, the condemned monk composed two
   confessions, a shorter and a longer one, in which he strongly
   re-asserted his doctrine of a double predestination. He appealed to
   Pope Nicolas, who seems to have had some sympathy with him, and
   demanded a reinvestigation, which, however, never took place. He also
   offered, in reliance on the grace of God, to undergo the fiery ordeal
   before the king, the bishops and monks, to step successively into four
   cauldrons of boiling water, oil, fat and pitch, and then to walk
   through a blazing pile; but nobody could be found to accept the
   challenge. Hincmar refused to grant him in his last sickness the
   communion and Christian burial) except on condition of full
   recantation. [682] Gottschalk scorned the condition, died in his
   unshaken faith, and was buried in unconsecrated soil after an
   imprisonment of twenty years (868 or 869).

   He had the courage of his convictions. His ruling idea of the
   unchangeableness of God reflected itself in his inflexible conduct. His
   enemies charged him with vanity, obstinacy, and strange delusions.
   Jesuits (Sirmond, Peteau, Cellot) condemn him and his doctrine; while
   Calvinists and Jansenists (Ussher, Hottinger, Mauguin) vindicate him as
   a martyr to the truth.

   concluding sentence of the synod, in which Gottschalk is condemned to
   everlasting silence.

   [682] Gottschalk had provoked him by his disregard of episcopal
   authority, and by the charge of Sabellianism for altering "trina
   Deitas," in a church hymn, into "summa Deitas." Hincmar charged him in
   turn with Arianism, but the word to which he had objected, retained its
   place in the Gallican service.

   § 122. The Contending Theories on Predestination, and the Victory of
   Semi-Augustinianism.

   During the imprisonment of Gottschalk a lively controversy, was carried
   on concerning the point in dispute, which is very creditable to the
   learning of that age, but after all did not lead to a clear and
   satisfactory settlement. The main question was whether divine
   predestination or foreordination which all admitted as a necessary
   element of the Divine perfection, was absolute or relative; in other
   words, whether it embraced all men and all acts, good and bad, or only
   those who are saved, and such acts as God approves and rewards. This
   question necessarily involved also the problem of the freedom of the
   human will, and the extent of the plan of redemption. The absolute
   predestinarians denied, the relative predestinarians affirmed, the
   freedom of will and the universal import of Christ's atoning death.

   The doctrine of absolute predestination was defended, in substantial
   agreement with Gottschalk, though with more moderation and caution, by
   Prudentius, Bishop of Troyes, Ratramnus, monk of Corbie, Servatus
   Lupus, Abbot of Ferrières, and Remigius, Archbishop of Lyons, and
   confirmed by the Synod of Valence, 855, and also at Langres in 859.

   The doctrine of free will and a conditional predestination was
   advocated, in opposition to Gottschalk, by Archbishop Rabanus Maurus of
   Mainz, Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, and Bishop Pardulus of Laon, and
   confirmed at a synod of Chiersy, 853, and in part again at Savonnières,
   near Toul, in 859.

   A third theory was set forth by John Scotus Erigena, intended against
   Gottschalk, but was in fact still more against the orthodox view, and
   disowned by both parties.

   I. The doctrine of an Absolute and Two-Fold Predestination.

   Gottschalk professed to follow simply the great Augustin. This is true;
   but he gave undue disproportion to the tenet of predestination, and
   made it a fundamental theological principle, inseparable from the
   immutability of God; while with Augustin it was only a logical
   inference from his anthropological premises. He began where Augustin
   ended. To employ a later (Calvinistic) terminology, he was a
   supralapsarian rather than an infralapsarian. He held a two-fold
   predestination of the elect to salvation, and of the reprobate to
   perdition; not in the sense of two separate predestinations, but one
   predestination with two sides (gemina, i.e. bipartita), a positive side
   (election) and a negative side (reprobation). He could not conceive of
   the one without the other; but he did not teach a predestination of the
   sinner to sin, which would make God the author of sin. In this respect
   he was misrepresented by Rabanus Maurus. [683] In his shorter
   Confession from his prison, he says: "I believe and confess that God
   foreknew and foreordained the holy angels and elect men to unmerited
   eternal life, but that he equally (pariter) foreordained the devil with
   his host and with all reprobate men, on account of their foreseen
   future evil deeds, by a just judgment, to merited eternal death." He
   appeals to passages of the Scriptures, to Augustin, Fulgentius, and
   Isidor, who taught the very same thing except the pariter. In the
   larger Confession, which is in the form of a prayer, he substitutes for
   equally the milder term almost or nearly (propemodum), and denies that
   God predestinated the reprobates to sin. "Those, O God," he says, "of
   whom thou didst foreknow that they would persist by their own misery in
   their damnable sins, thou didst, as a righteous judge, predestinate to
   perdition." He spoke of two redemptions, one common to the elect and
   the reprobate, another proper and special for the elect only. In
   similar manner the Calvinists, in their controversy, with the
   Arminians, maintained that Christ died efficiently only for the elect,
   although sufficiently for all men.

   His predestinarian friends brought out the difference in God's relation
   to the good and the evil more clearly. Thus Ratramnus says that God was
   the author (auctor) as well as the ruler (ordinator) of good thoughts
   and deeds, but only the ruler, not the author, of the bad. He
   foreordained the punishment of sin, not sin itself (poenam, not
   peccatum). He directs the course of sin, and overrules it for good. He
   used the evil counsel of Judas as a means to bring about the
   crucifixion and through it the redemption. Lupus says that God foreknew
   and permitted Adam's fall, and foreordained its consequences, but not
   the fall itself. Magister Florus also speaks of a praedestinatio
   gemina, yet with the emphatic distinction, that God predestinated the
   elect both to good works and to salvation, but the reprobate only to
   punishment, not to sin. He was at first ill-informed of the teaching of
   Gottschalk, as if he had denied the meritum damnationis. Remigius
   censured the "temerity" and "untimely loquacity" of Gottschalk, but
   defended him against the inhuman treatment, and approved of all his
   propositions except the unqualified denial of freedom to do good after
   the fall, unless he meant by it that no one could use his freedom
   without the grace of God. He subjected the four chapters of Hincmar to
   a severe criticism. On the question whether God will have all men to be
   saved without or with restriction, and whether Christ died for all men
   or only for the elect, he himself held the particularistic view, but
   was willing to allow freedom of opinion, since the church had not
   decided that question, and the Bible admitted of different
   interpretations. [684]

   The Synod of Valence, which met at the request of the Emperor Lothaire
   in 855, endorsed, in opposition to Hincmar and the four chapters of the
   Synod of Chiersy, the main positions of the Augustinian system as
   understood by Remigius, who presided. [685] It affirms a two-fold
   predestination ("praedestinationem electorum ad vitam et
   praedestinationem impiorum ad mortem"), but with such qualifications
   and distinctions as seemed to be necessary to save the holiness of God
   and the moral responsibility of man. The Synod of Langres in the
   province of Lyons, convened by Charles the Bald in 859, repeated the
   doctrinal canons of Valence, but omitted the censure of the four
   chapters of Chiersy, which Charles the Bald had subscribed, and thus
   prepared the way for a compromise.

   We may briefly state the system of the Augustinian school in the
   following propositions:

   (1) All men are sinners, and justly condemned in consequence of Adam's
   fall.

   (2) Man in the natural state has no freedom of choice, but is a slave
   of sin. (This, however, was qualified by Remigius and the Synod of
   Valence in the direction of Semi-Pelagianism.)

   (3) God out of free grace elected from eternity and unalterably a part
   of mankind to holiness and salvation, and is the author of all their
   good deeds; while he leaves the rest in his inscrutable counsel to
   their merited damnation.

   (4) God has unalterably predestinated the impenitent and persistent
   sinner to everlasting punishment, but not to sin, which is the guilt of
   man and condemned by God.

   (5) Christ died only for the elect.

   Gottschalk is also charged by his opponents with slighting the church
   and the sacraments, and confining the effect of baptism and the
   eucharist to the elect. This would be consistent with his theory. He is
   said to have agreed with his friend Ratramnus in rejecting the doctrine
   of transubstantiation. Augustin certainly did not teach
   transubstantiation, but he checked the logical tendency of
   Predestinarianism by the Catholic doctrine of baptismal regeneration,
   and of the visible historical church as the mediatrix of salvation.
   [686]

   II. The doctrine of a Conditional and Single Predestination.

   Rabanus and Hincmar, who agreed in theology as well as in unchristian
   conduct towards Gottschalk, claimed to be Augustinians, but were at
   heart Semi-Pelagians, and struck a middle course, retaining the
   Augustinian premises, but avoiding the logical consequences.
   Foreknowledge (praescientia) is a necessary attribute of the omniscient
   mind of God, and differs from foreordination or predestination
   (praedestinatio), which is an attribute of his omnipotent will. The
   former may exist without the latter, but not the latter without the
   former. Foreknowledge is absolute, and embraces all things and all men,
   good and bad; foreordination is conditioned by foreknowledge, and
   refers only to what is good. God foreknew sin from eternity, but did
   not predestinate it; and so he foreknew the sinners, but did not
   predestinate them to sin or death; they are simply praesciti, not
   praedestinati. There is therefore no double predestination, but only
   one predestination which coincides with election to eternal life. The
   fall of Adam with its consequences falls under the idea of divine
   permission. God sincerely intends to save all men without distinction,
   and Christ shed his blood for all; if any are lost, they have to blame
   themselves.

   Hincmar secured the confirmation of his views by the Synod of Chiersy,
   held in presence of the Emperor, Charles the Bald, 853, It adopted four
   propositions: [687]

   (1) God Almighty made man free from sin, endowed him with reason and
   the liberty of choice, and placed him in Paradise. Man, by the abuse of
   this liberty, sinned, and the whole race became a mass of perdition.
   Out of this massa perditionis God elected those whom he by grace
   predestinated unto life eternal; others he left by a just judgment in
   the mass of perdition, foreknowing that they would perish, but not
   foreordaining them to perdition, though he foreordained eternal
   punishment for them. [688] This is Augustinian, but weakened in the
   last clause.

   (2) We lost the freedom of will through the fall of the first man, and
   regained it again through Christ. This chapter, however, is so vaguely
   worded that it may be understood in a Semi-Pelagian as well as in an
   Augustinian sense. [689]

   (3) God Almighty would have all men without exception to be saved,
   although not all are actually saved. Salvation is a free gift of grace;
   perdition is the desert of those who persist in sin.

   (4) Jesus Christ died for all men past, present and future, though not
   all are redeemed by the mystery of his passion, owing to their
   unbelief.

   The last two propositions are not Augustinian, but catholic, and are
   the connecting link between the catholic orthodoxy and the
   Semi-Pelagian heresy.

   Hincmar defended these propositions against the objections of Remigius
   and the Synod of Valence, in two books on Predestination and Free Will
   (between 856 and 863). The first is lost, the second is preserved. It
   is very prolix and repetitious, and marks no real progress. He made
   several historical blunders, and quoted freely from the
   pseudo-Augustinian Hypomnesticon, which he thought presented Augustin's
   later and better views.

   The two parties came to a sort of agreement at the National Synod of
   France held at Toucy, near Toul, in October, 860, in presence of the
   Emperor, Charles the Bald, King Lothaire II., and Charles of Provence,
   and the bishops of fourteen ecclesiastical provinces. [690] Hincmar was
   the leading man, and composed the synodical letter. He still maintained
   his four propositions, but cleared himself of the suspicion of
   Semi-Pelagianism. The first part of the synodical letter, addressed to
   all the faithful, gives a summary of Christian doctrine, and asserts
   that nothing can happen in heaven and earth without the will or
   permission of God; that he would have all men to be saved and none
   lost; that he did not deprive man after the fall of free will, but
   heals and supports it by grace; that Christ died on the cross for all
   men; that in the end all the predestinated who are now scattered in the
   massa perditionis, will be gathered into the fulness of the eternal
   church in heaven.

   Here ended the controversy. It was a defeat of predestinarianism in its
   rigorous form and a substantial victory of Semi-Augustinianism, which
   is almost identical with Semi-Pelagianism except that it gives greater
   prominence to divine grace.

   Practically, even this difference disappeared. The mediaeval church
   needed the doctrine of free will and of universal call, as a basis for
   maintaining the moral responsibility, the guilt and merit of man, and
   as a support to the sacerdotal and sacramental mediation of salvation;
   while the strict predestinarian system, which unalterably determines
   the eternal fate of every soul by a pre-temporal or ante-mundane
   decree, seemed in its logical consequences to neutralize the appeal to
   the conscience of the sinner, to cut off the powerful inducement of
   merit and reward, to limit the efficacy of the sacraments to the elect,
   and to weaken the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.

   But while churchly and sacerdotal Semi-Augustinianism or covert
   Semi-Pelagianism triumphed in France, where Hincmar had the last word
   in the controversy, it was not oecumenically sanctioned. Pope Nicolas,
   who was dissatisfied with Hincmar on hierarchical grounds, had some
   sympathy with Gottschalk, and is reported to have approved the
   Augustinian canons of the Synods of Valence and Langres in regard to a
   "two-fold predestination" and the limitation of the atonement. [691]

   Thus the door was left open within the Catholic church itself for a
   revival of strict Augustinianism, and this took place on a grand scale
   in the sixteenth century.

   Notes.

   The Gottschalk controversy was first made the subject of historical
   investigation and critical discussion in the seventeenth century, but
   was disturbed by the doctrinal antagonism between Jansenists (Jansen,
   Mauguin) and Jesuits (Sirmond, Cellot). The Calvinistic historians
   (Ussher, Hottinger) sided with Gottschalk and the Jansenists. The
   controversy has been more calmly and impartially considered by the
   Protestant historians of the nineteenth century, but with a slight
   difference as to the limits and the result of the controversy; some
   representing it merely as a conflict between a stricter and a milder
   type of Augustinianism (Neander, Kurtz), others as a conflict between
   Augustinianism and a revived and triumphant Semi-Pelagianism (Baur,
   Weizsäcker). The former view is more correct. Semi-Pelagianism was
   condemned by the Synod of Orange (Arausio), 529; again by the Synod of
   Valence in the same year, and by Pope Boniface II., 530, and has ever
   since figured in the Roman catalogue of heresies. The Catholic Church
   cannot sanction what she has once condemned.

   Both parties in the contest of the ninth century (leaving the isolated
   Scotus Erigena out of view) appealed to Augustin as the highest
   patristic authority in the Latin church. Both agreed in the Augustinian
   anthropology and soteriology, i.e. in the doctrine of a universal fall
   in Adam, and a partial redemption through Christ; both maintained that
   some men are saved by free grace, that others are lost by their own
   guilt; and both confined the possibility of salvation to the present
   life and to the limits of the visible church (which leads logically to
   the horrible and incredible conclusion that the overwhelming majority
   of the human race, including all unbaptized infants, are eternally
   lost). But the Augustinian party went back to absolute predestination,
   as the ultima ratio of God's difference of dealing with the saved and
   the lost, or the elect and the reprobate; while the Semi-Augustinian
   party sought the difference rather in the merits or demerits of men,
   and maintained along-side with a conditional predestination the
   universal benevolence of God and the universal offer of saving grace
   (which, however, is merely assumed, and not at all apparent in this
   present life). The Augustinian scheme is more theological and logical,
   the Semi-Augustinian more churchly and practical. Absolute
   predestinarianism starts from the almighty power of God, but is checked
   by the moral sense and kept within the limits of infralapsarianism,
   which exempts the holy God from any agency in the fall of the race, and
   fastens the guilt of sin upon man. Relative predestinarianism
   emphasizes the responsibility and salvability of all men, but
   recognizes also their perfect dependence upon divine grace for actual
   salvation. The solution of the problem must be found in the central
   idea of the holy love of God, which is the key-note of all his
   attributes and works.

   The practical difference between the catholic Semi-Augustinianism and
   the heterodox Semi-Pelagianism is, as already remarked, very small.
   They are twin-sisters; they virtually ignore predestination, and lay
   the main stress on the efficacy of the sacramental system of the
   historical church, as the necessary agency for regeneration and
   salvation.

   The Lutheran system, as developed in the Formula of Concord, is the
   evangelical counterpart of the Catholic Semi-Augustinianism. It retains
   also its sacramental feature (baptismal regeneration and the
   eucharistic presence), but cuts the root of human merit by the doctrine
   of justification by faith alone.

   Calvinism is a revival of Augustinianism, but without its sacramental
   and sacerdotal checks.

   Arminianism, as developed in the Reformed church of Holland and among
   the Wesleyan Methodists, and held extensively in the Church of England,
   is an evangelical counterpart of Semi-Pelagianism, and differs from
   Lutheranism by teaching a conditional election and freedom of the will
   sufficient to accept as well as to reject the universal offer of saving
   grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [683] Rabanus makes Gottschalk teach a "praedestinatio Dei, sicut in
   bono, sic ita et in malo ... quasi Deus eos [reprobos] fecisset ab
   initio incorrigibiles." But even Hincmar concedes (De Praed., c. 15, in
   Migne 125, col. 126) that the predestinarians of his day (moderni
   Praedestinatiani) taught only a predestination of the reprobates ad
   interitum, not ad peccatum. Cardinal Noris and Hefele (IV. 140) admit
   the perversion of Gottschalk's words in malam partem by Rabanus. The
   same charge of making God the author of sin by predestinating and
   creating men for sin and damnation, has again and again been raised
   against supralapsarians and Calvinists generally, in spite of their
   express denial.

   [684] The particularists appealed to the passage Matt. 26:26, pro
   multis (peripollon, without the article), and understood it in the
   restricted sense as distinct from pro omnibus; while they arbitrarily
   restricted the omnes (pan'tes) in 1 Tim. 2:3 and similar passages.

   [685] See the canons of this Synod in Mansi, XV. I sqq., and Hefele,
   IV. 193-195.

   [686] Dr. Bach, a learned Roman Catholic historian, states this point
   thus (l.c., I. 230): "Der historische Christus und die Kirche, der
   sichtbare Leib Christi verflüchtigt sich schon bei Gottschalk zu einem
   leeren Abstraktum, sobald der concrete Boden der Erwählung nicht mehr
   die Kirche und ihre Sakramente, sondern ein lediglich fingirtes
   vorzeitliches Decret Gottes ist. Es taucht dann immer ein Surrogat der
   Phantasie, die s. g. unsichtbare Kirche auf, und diejenigen, welche die
   grossartige realistische Lehre des hl. Augustin von der Kirche und den
   Sakramenten zerstören, nennen sich vorzüglich Augustinianer, indem sie
   nicht wissen, dass die Lehre Augustins von der Praedestination auf dem
   concreten Boden der Christologie und Anthropologie steht und ohne diese
   zur gefährlichsten Häresie wird."

   [687] Capitula IV. Carisiacensia, in Hincmar, De Praed., c. 2; in
   Mansi, XIV. 920; Gieseler, II. 88; and Hefele, IV. 187.

   [688] "perituros praescivit, sed non ut perirent praedestinavit, poenam
   autem illis, quia justus est, praedestinavit aeternam."

   [689] "Libertatem arbitrii in primo homine perdidimus, quam per
   Christum Dominum nostrum recepimus: et habemus liberum arbitrium ad
   bonum, praeventum et adjutum gratia: et habemus liberum arbitrium ad
   malum, desertum gratia. Liberum autem habemus arbitrium, quia gratia
   liberatum, et gratia de corrupto sonatum."

   [690] Mansi, XV. 563; Hefele, IV. 215 sqq.

   [691] The decree of the pope is lost; but the fact rests on the
   authority of the well-informed Prudentius of Troyes in the Annales
   Bertiniani ad ann. 859 (Pertz, Mon. Germ., I. 453 sq.): "Nicolas,
   pontifex Romanus, de qratia Dei et libero arbitrio, de veritate
   Geminaepraedestinationis et sanguine Christi, ut pro credentibusomnibus
   fusus sit, fideliter confirmat et catholice decernit." Hincmar doubted
   such a decision, and charged Prudentius with partiality (Ep. 24
   addressed to Egilo, Bishop of Sens). The Jesuits labored hard to set it
   aside against the Jansenists and Calvinists, but without good reason.
   Weizsäcker (p. 574), Hardwick (p. 165), and Möller (in Herzog2V. 327)
   accept the statement of Prudentius, and Weizsäcker says: "Hatte in
   Gallien die Hoftheologie des Königs den Semipeligianimus (?)
   durchgebracht, so hat doch der Papst für Augustin entschieden ... Die
   Kirchengeschichte darf ganz unbedenklich in ihre Blätter diese
   Entscheidung des römischen Stuhls gegen den Semipelagianismus des
   neunten Jahrhunderts aufnehmen, die man seit Mauguin niemals hätte
   bezweifeln sollen." Neander and Gieseler are silent on this point.

   51-64 (a discussion of Erigena's views on the relation of authority and
   reason).

   At the request of Hincmar, who was very anxious to secure learned aid,
   but mistook his man, John Scotus Erigena wrote a book on Predestination
   (in 850), and dedicated it to Hincmar and his friend Pardulus, Bishop
   of Laon. This most remarkable of Scotch-Irishmen was a profound scholar
   and philosopher, but so far ahead of his age as to be a wonder and an
   enigma. He shone and disappeared like a brilliant meteor. We do not
   know whether he was murdered by his pupils in Malmsbury (if he ever was
   called to England), or died a natural death in France (which is more
   likely). He escaped the usual fate of heretics by the transcendental
   character of his speculations and by the protection of Charles the
   Bald, with whom he was on such familiar terms that he could answer his
   saucy question at the dinner-table: "What is the difference between a
   Scot and a sot?" with the quick-witted reply: "The table, your
   Majesty." His system of thought was an anachronism, and too remote from
   the spirit of his times to be properly understood and appreciated. He
   was a Christian Neo-Platonist, a forerunner of Scholasticism and
   Mysticism and in some respects of Spinoza, Schleiermacher, and Hegel.
   With him church authority resolves itself into reason, theology into
   philosophy, and true philosophy is identical with true religion.
   Philosophy is, so to say, religion unveiled and raised from the cloudy
   region of popular belief to the clear ether of pure thought. [692]

   From this alpine region of speculation he viewed the problem of
   predestination and free will. He paid due attention to the Scriptures
   and the fathers. He often quotes St. Augustin, and calls him,
   notwithstanding his dissent, "the most acute inquirer and asserter of
   truth." [693] But where church authority contradicts reason, its
   language must be understood figuratively, and, if necessary, in the
   opposite sense. [694] He charges Gottschalk with the heresy of denying
   both divine grace and human freedom, since he derived alike the crimes
   which lead to damnation, and the virtues which lead to eternal life,
   from a necessary and compulsory predestination. Strictly speaking,
   there is in God neither before nor after, neither past nor future;
   [695] and hence neither fore-knowledge nor fore-ordination, except in
   an anthropopathic sense. He rejects a double predestination, because it
   would carry a contradiction into God. There is only one predestination,
   the predestination of the righteous, and this is identical with
   foreknowledge. [696] For in God knowledge and will are inseparable, and
   constitute his very being. The distinction arises from the limitation
   of the human mind and from ignorance of Greek; for prooravw means both
   praevideo and praedestino. There is no such thing as predestination to
   sin and punishment; for sin is nothing real at all, but simply a
   negation, an abuse of free will; [697] and punishment is simply the
   inner displeasure of the sinner at the failure of his bad aims. If
   several fathers call sinners praedestinati, they mean the reverse, as
   Christ called Judas amice instead of inimice, and as lucus is called a
   non lucendo. Sin lies outside of God, and does not exist for him at
   all; he does not even foreknow it, much less foreordain it; for knowing
   and being are identical with him. [698] But God has ordered that sin
   punishes itself; he has established immutable laws, which the sinner
   cannot escape. Free will is the very essence of man, and was not lost
   by the fall; only the power and energy of will are impaired. But
   Erigena vindicates to man freedom in the same sense in which he
   vindicates it to God, and identifies it with moral necessity. His
   pantheistic principles lead him logically to universal restoration.
   [699]

   This appears more clearly from his remarkable work, De Divisione
   Naturae, where he develops his system. The leading idea is the initial
   and final harmony of God and the universe, as unfolding itself under
   four aspects: 1) Natura creatrix non creata, i.e. God as the creative
   and uncreated beginning of all that exists; 2) Natura creatrix creata,
   i.e. the ideal world or the divine prototypes of all things; 3) Natura
   creata non creans, i.e. the created, but uncreative world of time and
   sense, as the reflex and actualization of the ideal world; 4) Natura
   nec creata nec creans, i.e. God as the end of all creation, which,
   after the defeat of all opposition, must return to him in an
   apokatastasis ton panton. "The first and the last form," he says, "are
   one, and can be understood only of God, who is the beginning and the
   end of all things."

   The tendency of this speculative and mystical pantheism of Erigena was
   checked by the practical influence of the Christian theism which
   entered into his education and personal experience, so that we may say
   with a historian who is always just and charitable: "We are unwilling
   to doubt, that he poured out many a devout and earnest prayer to a
   redeeming God for his inward illumination, and that he diligently
   sought for it in the sacred Scripture, though his conceptual
   apprehension of the divine Being seems to exclude such a relation of
   man to God, as prayer presupposes." [700]

   Hincmar had reason to disown such a dangerous champion, and complained
   of the Scotch "porridge." [701] John Scotus was violently assailed by
   Archbishop Wenilo of Sens, who denounced nineteen propositions of his
   book (which consists of nineteen chapters) as heretical, and by Bishop
   Prudentius, who increased the number to seventy-seven. He was charged
   with Pelagianism and Origenism, and censured for substituting
   philosophy for theology, and sophistical subtleties for sound arguments
   from Scripture and tradition. Remigius thought him insane. Florus
   Magister likewise wrote against him, and rejected as blasphemous the
   doctrine that sin and evil were nonentities, and therefore could not be
   the subjects of divine foreknowledge and foreordination. The Synod of
   Valence (855) rejected his nineteen syllogisms as absurdities, and his
   whole book as a "commentum diaboli potius quam argumentum fidei." His
   most important work, which gives his whole system, was also condemned
   by a provincial Synod of Sens, and afterwards by Pope Honorius III. in
   1225, who characterized it as a book "teeming with the vermin of
   heretical depravity," and ordered all copies to be burned. But,
   fortunately, a few copies survived for the study of later ages.

   [692] So it was with Hegel. His pious widow told me that her husband
   often politely declined her request to accompany her to church, with
   the remark: "Mein liebes Kind, dos Denken ist auch Gottesdienst."

   [695] De Praed., cap. 9 (in Migne, col. 392): "In Deo sicut nulla
   locorum sunt, ita nulla temporum intervalla." A profound thought, not
   fully considered by either party in the strife.

   [696] He thus sums up his discussion at the close (Migne, col. 438)
   "Cum omnibus orthodoxis fidelibus anathematizo eos, qui dicunt, duas
   praedestinationes esse, aut unum geminam, bipartitam, aut duplam. Si
   enim duae sunt, non est una divina substantia. Si gemina, non est
   individua. Si bipartita, non est simplex, sed partibus composita. Si
   dupla est, complicata est. Quod si prohibemur divinam unitatem dicere
   triplam, qua dementia audet haereticus eam asserere duplam? Tali igitur
   monstroso, venenoso, mortifero dogmate a cordibus nostris radicitus
   exploso, credamus, unam aeternam praedestinationem Dei Domini esse, et
   non nisi in his, quae sunt, ad ea vero, quae non sunt, nullo modo
   pertinere."

   [697] Negatio, privatio, defectus justitiae, absentia boni, corruptio
   boni. On the other hand, Scotus seems to regard sin as a necessary
   limitation of the creature. But this idea is inconsistent with the
   freedom of will, and runs into necessitarianism and pantheism. As sin
   is the defect of justice, so death is simply the defect of life, and
   pain the defect of bliss. See cap. 15 (col. 416).

   [698] God knows only what is, and sin has no real existence. "Sicut Dem
   mali auctor non est ita nec praescius mali, nec praedestinans est."
   Cap. 10 (col. 395). "Ratio pronunciare non dubitat, peccata eorumque
   supplicia nihil esse, ac per hoc nec praesciri nec praedestinari posse;
   quomodo enim vel praesciuntur, vel praedestinantur, quae non sunt?"
   Cap. 15. The same thought occurs in his work, De Divis. Nat. He refers
   to such passages of the Scriptures where it is said of God that he does
   not know the wicked.

   [699] The predestination theory of Scotus has some points of
   resemblance with that of Schleiermacher, who defended the Calvinistic
   particularism, but only as a preparatory stage to universal election
   and restoration.

   [700] Neander, III. 462. The same may be said still more confidently of
   Schleiermacher, who leaned with his head to pantheism, but lovingly
   clung with his heart to Christ as his Lord and Saviour. He keenly felt
   the speculative difficulty of confining the absolute being to the
   limitations of personality ("omnis definitio est negatio"), and yet
   sincerely prayed to a personal God. We cannot pray to an abstraction,
   but only to a personal being that is able to hear and to answer. Nor is
   personality necessarily a limitation. There may be an absolute
   personality as well as an absolute intelligence and an absolute will.

   § 125. The Two Theories of the Lord's Supper.

   The doctrine of the Lord's Supper became the subject of two
   controversies in the Western church, especially in France. The first
   took place in the middle of the ninth century between Paschasius
   Radbertus and Ratramnus, the other in the middle of the eleventh
   century between Berengar and Lanfranc. In the second, Pope Hildebrand
   was implicated, as mediator between Berengar and the orthodox party.

   In both cases the conflict was between a materialistic and a
   spiritualistic conception of the sacrament and its effect. The one was
   based on a literal, the other on a figurative interpretation of the
   words of institution, and of the mysterious discourse in the sixth
   chapter of St. John. The contending parties agreed in the belief that
   Christ is present in the eucharist as the bread of life to believers;
   but they differed widely in their conception of the mode of that
   presence: the one held that Christ was literally and corporeally
   present and communicated to all communicants through the mouth; the
   other, that he was spiritually present and spiritually communicated to
   believers through faith. The transubstantiationists (if we may coin
   this term) believed that the eucharistic body of Christ was identical
   with his historical body, and was miraculously created by the priestly
   consecration of the elements in every sacrifice of the mass; their
   opponents denied this identity, and regarded the eucharistic body as a
   symbolical exhibition of his real body once sacrificed on the cross and
   now glorified in heaven, yet present to the believer with its
   life-giving virtue and saving power.

   We find both these views among the ancient fathers. The realistic and
   mystical view fell in more easily with the excessive supernaturalism
   and superstitious piety of the middle age, and triumphed at last both
   in the Greek and Latin churches; for there is no material difference
   between them on this dogma. [702] The spiritual theory was backed by
   the all-powerful authority of St. Augustin in the West, and ably
   advocated by Ratramnus and Berengar, but had to give way to the
   prevailing belief in transubstantiation until, in the sixteenth
   century, the controversy was revived by the Reformers, and resulted in
   the establishment of three theories: 1) the Roman Catholic dogma of
   transubstantiation, re-asserted by the Council of Trent; 2) the
   Lutheran theory of the real presence in the elements, retaining their
   substance; [703] and 3) the Reformed (Calvinistic) theory of a
   spiritual real or dynamic presence for believers. In the Roman church
   (and herein the Greek church fully agrees with her), the doctrine of
   transubstantiation is closely connected with the doctrine of the
   sacrifice of the mass, which forms the centre of worship.

   It is humiliating to reflect that the, commemorative feast of Christ's
   dying love, which should be the closest bond of union between
   believers, innocently gave rise to the most violent controversies. But
   the same was the case with the still more important doctrine of
   Christ's Person. Fortunately, the spiritual benefit of the sacrament
   does not depend upon any particular human theory of the mode of
   Christ's presence, who is ever ready to bless all who love him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [702] The Greek fathers do not, indeed, define the real presence as
   transubstantiatio or metousiosis, but Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom,
   and John of Damascus use similar terms which imply a miraculous change
   of the elements.

   [703] The Lutheran theory, as formulated by the Formula of Concord, is
   usually and conveniently styled consubstantiation, in distinction from
   transubstantiation; but Lutheran divines disown the term, because they
   confine the real presence to the time and act of the sacramental
   fruition, and hence reject the adoration of the consecrated elements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 126. The Theory of Paschasius Radbertus.

   Paschasius Radbertus (from 800 to about 865), a learned, devout and
   superstitious monk, and afterwards abbot of Corbie or Corvey in France
   [704] is the first who clearly taught the doctrine of
   transubstantiation as then believed by many, and afterwards adopted by
   the Roman Catholic church. He wrote a book "on the Body and Blood of
   the Lord," composed for his disciple Placidus of New Corbie in the year
   831, and afterwards reedited it in a more popular form, and dedicated
   it to the Emperor Charles the Bald, as a Christmas gift (844). He did
   not employ the term transubstantiation, which came not into use till
   two centuries later; but he taught the thing, namely, that "the
   substance of bread and wine is effectually changed (efficaciter
   interius commutatur) into the flesh and blood of Christ," so that after
   the priestly consecration there is "nothing else in the eucharist but
   the flesh and blood of Christ," although "the figure of bread and wine
   remain" to the senses of sight, touch, and taste. The change is brought
   about by a miracle of the Holy Spirit, who created the body of Christ
   in the womb of the Virgin without cohabitation, and who by the same
   almighty power creates from day to day, wherever the mass is
   celebrated, the same body and blood out of the substance of bread and
   wine. He emphasizes the identity of the eucharistic body with the body
   which was born of the Virgin, suffered on the cross, rose from the
   dead, and ascended to heaven; yet on the other hand he represents the
   sacramental eating and drinking as a spiritual process by faith. [705]
   He therefore combines the sensuous and spiritual conceptions. [706] He
   assumes that the soul of the believer communes with Christ, and that
   his body receives an imperishable principle of life which culminates at
   last in the resurrection. He thus understood, like several of the
   ancient fathers, the words of our Saviour: "He that eateth my flesh and
   drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the
   last day" (John 6:54).

   He supports his doctrine by the words of institution in their literal
   sense, and by the sixth chapter of John. He appealed also to marvellous
   stories of the visible appearances of the body and blood of Christ for
   the removal of doubts or the satisfaction of the pious desire of
   saints. The bread on the altar, he reports, was often seen in the shape
   of a lamb or a little child, and when the priest stretched out his hand
   to break the bread, an angel descended from heaven with a knife,
   slaughtered the lamb or the child, and let his blood run into a cup!
   [707]

   Such stories were readily believed by the people, and helped to
   strengthen the doctrine of transubstantiation; as the stories of the
   appearances of departed souls from purgatory confirmed the belief in
   purgatory.

   The book of Radbert created a great sensation in the West, which was
   not yet prepared to accept the doctrine of transubstantiation without a
   vigorous struggle. Radbert himself admits that some of his
   contemporaries believed only in a spiritual communion of the soul with
   Christ, and substituted the mere virtue of his body and blood for the
   real body and blood, i.e., as he thinks, the figure for the verity, the
   shadow for the substance. [708]

   His opponents appealed chiefly to St. Augustin, who made a distinction
   between the historical and the eucharistic body of Christ, and between
   a false material and a true spiritual fruition of his body and blood.
   In a letter to the monk Frudegard, who quoted several passages of
   Augustin, Radbert tried to explain them in his sense. For no divine of
   the Latin church dared openly to contradict the authority of the great
   African teacher.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [704] Corbie, Corvey, Corbeia (also called Corbeia aurea or vetus), was
   a famous Benedictine Convent in the diocese of Amiens, founded by King
   Clotar and his mother Rathilde in 664, in honor of Peter and Paul and
   the Protomartyr Stephen. It boasted of many distinguished men, as St.
   Ansgarius (the Apostle of the Danes), Radbert, Ratramnus, Druthmar. New
   Corbie (Nova Corbeia) was a colony of the former, founded in 822, near
   Höxter on the Weser in Germany, and became the centre for the
   christianization of the Saxons. Gallia Christiana, X., Wiegand, Gesch.
   v. Corvey, Höxter, 1819; Klippel, Corvey, in Herzog2III. 365-370.

   [705] He denies the grossly Capernaitic conception ("Christum vorari
   fas dentibus non est") and the conversion of the body and blood of
   Christ into our flesh and blood. He confines the spiritual fruition to
   believers ("iste eucharistiae cibus non nisi filiorum Dei est"). The
   unworthy communicants, whom he compares to Judas, receive the
   sacramental "mystery" to their judgment, but not the "virtue of the
   mystery" to their benefit. He seems not to have clearly seen that his
   premises lead to the inevitable conclusion that all communicants alike
   receive the same substance of the body and blood of Christ, though with
   opposite effects. But Dr. Ebrard is certainly wrong when he claims
   Radbert rather for the Augustinian view, and denies that he was the
   author of the theory of transubstantiation. See his Dogma v. heil.
   Abendmahl I. 406, and his Christl. Kirchen- und Dogmengesch. II. 27 and
   33.

   [706] See Steitz on Radbert, and also Reuter (I. 43), who says: "Die
   Radbertische Doctrin war das synkretistische Gebilde, in welchem die
   spiritualistische Lehre Augustin's mit der uralten Anschauung von der
   realen Gegenwart des Leibes und dei Blutes Christi, aber in Analogie
   mit dem religiösen Materialismus der Periode combinirt wurde; die
   gegnerische Theorie der Protest gegen das Becht dieser Combination."

   [707] See several such examples in ch. 14 (Opera, ed. Migne, col. 1316
   sqq. ).

   [708] He clearly contrasts the two theories, probably with reference to
   Ratramnus, in his comments on the words of institution, Matt. 26:26
   (Expos. in Matt., ed. Migne, col. 890 sq.): "Neque itaque dixit cum
   fregit et dedit eis panem, 'hoc est, vel in hoc mysterio est virtus vel
   figura corporis mei,' sed ait non ficte, 'Hoc est corpus meum.' Ubi
   Lucas addidit, 'Quod pro vobis tradetur,' vel sicut alii codices
   habent, 'datur.' Sed et Joannes ex persona Domini, 'Panis,' inquit,
   'quem ego dabo caro mea est, non alia quam, pro mundi vita' (Joan. VI.
   52). Ac deinde, 'Qui manducat meam carnem, et bibit sanguinem meum, in
   me manet et ego in illo' (ver. 57). Unde miror quid velint uno quidam
   dicere, non in re esse veritatem carnis Christi vel sanguinis; sed in
   sacramento virtutem carnis et non carnem, virtutem sanguinis et non
   sanquinem; figuram et non veritatem, umbram et non corpus, cum hic
   species accipit veritatem et figuram, veterum hostiarum corpus. Unde
   veritas cum porrigeret discipulis panem, 'Hoc est corpus meum,' et non
   aliud quam, 'quod pro vobis tradetur;' et cum calicem, 'Hic est calix
   Novi Testamenti, qui pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum.'
   Necdum itaque erat fusus, et tamen ipse porrigetur in calice sanguis,
   qui fundendus erat. Erat quidem jam in calice, qui adhuc tamen
   fundendus erat in pretium; et ideo ipse idemque sanguis jam erat in
   calice. qui et in corpore sicut et corpus vel caro in pane. Erat autem
   integer Christus et corpus Christi coram oculis omnium positum; necnon
   et sanguis in corpore, sicut et adhuc hodie integerrimum est et manet,
   qui vere dabatur eis ad comedendum, et ad bidendum, in remissionem
   peccatorum, quam in Christo."

   § 127. The Theory of Ratramnus.

   The chief opponent of transubstantiation was Ratramnus, [709] a
   contemporary monk at Corbie, and a man of considerable literary
   reputation. He was the first to give the symbolical theory a scientific
   expression. At the request of King Charles the Bald he wrote a
   eucharistic tract against Radbert, his superior, but did not name him.
   [710] He answered two questions, whether the consecrated elements are
   called body and blood of Christ after a sacramental manner (in
   mysterio), or in the literal sense; and whether the eucharistic body is
   identical with the historical body which died and rose again. He denied
   this identity which Radbert had strongly asserted; and herein lies the
   gist of the difference. He concluded that the elements remain in
   reality as well as for the sensual perception what they were before the
   consecration, and that they are the body and blood of Christ only in a
   spiritual sense to the faith of believers. [711] He calls the
   consecrated bread and wine figures and pledges of the body and blood of
   Christ. They are visible tokens of the Lord's death, that, remembering
   his passion, we may become partakers of its effect. He appealed to the
   discourse in the sixth chapter of John, as well as Radbert; but, like
   Augustin, his chief authority, he found the key to the whole chapter in
   John 6:63, which points from the letter to the spirit and from the
   carnal to the spiritual understanding. [712] The souls of believers are
   nourished in the communion by the Word of God (the Logos), which dwells
   in the natural body of Christ, and which dwells after an invisible
   manner in the sacrament. Unbelievers cannot receive Christ, as they
   lack the spiritual organ. He refers to the analogy of baptism, which is
   justly called a fount of life. Viewed by the senses, it is simply a
   fluid element; but by the consecration of the priest the regenerating
   power of the Holy Spirit is added to it, so that what properly is
   corruptible water becomes figuratively or in mystery a healing virtue.
   [713]

   It is consistent with this view that Ratramnus regarded the sacrifice
   of the mass not as an actual (though unbloody) repetition, but only as
   a commemorative celebration of Christ's sacrifice whereby Christians
   are assured of their redemption. When we shall behold Christ face to
   face, we shall no longer need such instruments of remembrance.

   John Scotus Erigena is also reported to have written a book against
   Radbert at the request of Charles the Bald. Hincmar of Rheims mentions
   among his errors this, that in the sacrament of the altar the true body
   and blood of Christ were not present, but only a memorial of them.
   [714] The report may have arisen from a confusion, since the tract of
   Ratramnus was at a later period ascribed to Scotus Erigena. [715] But
   he expresses his view incidentally in other writings from which it
   appears that he agreed with Ratramnus and regarded the eucharist only
   as a typical representation of a spiritual communion with Christ. [716]
   In his book De Divisione Naturae, he teaches a mystic ubiquity of
   Christ's glorified humanity or its elevation above the limitations of
   space. Neander infers from this that he held the eucharistic bread and
   wine to be simply symbols of the deified, omnipresent humanity of
   Christ which communicates itself, in a real manner, to believing soul.
   [717] At all events the hypothesis of ubiquity excludes a miraculous
   change of the elements, and gives the real presence a
   christo-pantheistic aspect. The Lutheran divines used this hypothesis
   in a modified form (multipresence, or multivolipresence, dependent on
   the will of Christ) as a dogmatic support for their doctrine of the
   real presence.

   Among the divines of the Carolingian age who held the Augustinian view
   and rejected that of Radbert, as an error, were Rabanus Maurus,
   Walafrid Strabo, Christian Druthmar, and Florus Magister. They
   recognized only a dynamic and spiritual, not a visible and corporeal
   presence, of the body of Christ, in the sacrament. [718]

   On the other hand, the theory of Radbert was accepted by Archbishop
   Hincmar of Rheims, Bishop Haimo of Halberstadt, and other leading
   ecclesiastics. It became more and more popular during the dark
   post-Carolingian period. Bishop Ratherius of Verona (about 950), who,
   however, repelled all curious questions about the mode of the change,
   and even the learned and liberal-minded Gerbert (afterwards Pope
   Sylvester II., from 999 to 1003), defended the miraculous
   transformation of the eucharistic elements by the priestly
   consecration. It is characteristic of the grossly sensuous character of
   the theology of the tenth century that the chief point of dispute was
   the revolting and indecent question whether the consecrated elements
   pass from the communicant in the ordinary way of nature. The opponents
   of transubstantiation affirmed this, the advocates indignantly denied
   it, and fastened upon the former the new heretical name of
   "Stercorianists." Gerbert called stercorianism a diabolical blasphemy,
   and invented the theory that the eucharistic body and blood of Christ
   do not pass in noxios et superfluos humores, but are preserved in the
   flesh for the final resurrection. [719]

   Radbertus was canonized, and his memory, is celebrated since 1073, on
   the 26th of April in the diocese of Soissons. [720] The book of
   Ratramnus, under the supposed authorship of Scotus Erigena, was twice
   condemned in the Berengar controversy (1050 and 1059), and put in the
   Tridentine Index of prohibited books . [721]

   Notes.

   In connection with this subject is the subordinate controversy on the
   delicate question whether Christ, admitting his supernatural
   conception, was born in the natural way like other children, or
   miraculously (clauso utero). This question troubled the pious curiosity
   of some nuns of Vesona (?), and reached the convent of Corbie.
   Paschasius Radbertus, following the lead of St. Ambrose and St. Jerome,
   defended the theory that the holy Virgin remained virgo in partu and
   post partum, and used in proof some poetic passages on the hortus
   conclusus and fons signatus in Cant. 4:12, and the porta clausa Domini
   in Ezek. 44:2. The whole incarnation is supernatural, and as the
   conception so the birth of Christ was miraculous. He was not subject to
   the laws of nature, and entered the world "sine dolore et sine gemitu
   et sine ulla corruptione carnis." See Radbert's tract De Partu Virginis
   in his Opera, ed. Migne, col. 1365-1386.

   Ratramnus, in his book De eo quod Christus ex Virgine natus est (in
   D'Achery, "Spicilegium," I., and in Migne, Tom. 121, col. 82-102),
   likewise taught the perpetual virginity of Mary, but assumed that
   Christ came into the world in the natural way ("naturaliter per aulam
   virgineam" or "per virginalis januam vulvae"). The conception in utero
   implies the birth ex utero. But he does not controvert or name Radbert,
   and uses the same Scripture passages for his view. He refers also to
   the analogy of Christ's passing through the closed doors on the day of
   the resurrection. He quotes from Augustin, Jerome, Pope Gregory, and
   Bede in support of his view. He opposes only the monstrous opinion that
   Christ broke from the womb through some unknown channel ("monstruose de
   secreto ventris incerto tramite luminis in auras exisse, quod non est
   nasci, sed erumpi." Cap. 1, col. 83). Such an opinion, he thinks, leads
   to the docetic heresy, and to the conclusion that "nec vere natus
   Christus, nec vere genuit Maria."

   § 128. The Berengar Controversy.

   While the doctrine of a corporeal presence and participation of Christ
   in the eucharist made steady progress in the public opinion of Western
   Christendom in close connection with the rising power of the
   priesthood, the doctrine of a spiritual presence and participation by
   faith was re-asserted by way of reaction in the middle of the eleventh
   century for a short period, but condemned by ecclesiastical authority.
   This condemnation decided the victory of transubstantiation.

   Let us first review the external history of the controversy, which runs
   into the next period (till 1079).

   Berengar (c. 1000-1088), a pupil of Fulbert of Chartres (d. 1029), was
   canon and director of the cathedral school in Tours, his native city,
   afterwards archdeacon of Angers, and highly esteemed as a man of rare
   learning and piety before his eucharistic views became known. [722] He
   was an able dialectician and a popular teacher. He may be ranked among
   the forerunners of a Christian rationalism, who dared to criticize
   church authority and aimed to reconcile the claims of reason and faith.
   [723] But he had not the courage of a martyr, and twice recanted from
   fear of death. Nor did he carry out his principle. He seems to have
   been in full accord with catholic orthodoxy except on the point of the
   sacrament. He was ascetic in his habits and shared the prevailing
   respect for monastic life, but saw clearly its danger. "The hermit," he
   says with as much beauty as truth, in an Exhortatory Discourse to
   hermits who had asked his advice, "is alone in his cell, but sin
   loiters about the door with enticing words and seeks admittance. I am
   thy beloved--says she--whom thou didst court in the world. I was with
   thee at the table, slept with thee on thy couch; without me, thou didst
   nothing. How darest thou think of forsaking me? I have followed thy
   every step; and dost thou expect to hide away from me in thy cell? I
   was with thee in the world, when thou didst eat flesh and drink wine;
   and shall be with thee in the wilderness, where thou livest only on
   bread and water. Purple and silk are not the only colors seen in
   hell,--the monk's cowl is also to be found there. Thou hermit hast
   something of mine. The nature of the flesh, which thou wearest about
   thee, is my sister, begotten with me, brought up with me. So long as
   the flesh is flesh, so long shall I be in thy flesh. Dost thou subdue
   thy flesh by abstinence?--thou becomest proud; and lo! sin is there.
   Art thou overcome by the flesh, and dost thou yield to lust? sin is
   there. Perhaps thou hast none of the mere human sins, I mean such as
   proceed from sense; beware then of devilish sins. Pride is a sin which
   belongs in common to evil spirits and to hermits." [724]

   By continued biblical and patristic studies Berengar came between the
   years 1040 and 1045 to the conclusion that the eucharistic doctrine of
   Paschasius Radbertus was a vulgar superstition contrary to the
   Scriptures, to the fathers, and to reason. He divulged his view among
   his many pupils in France and Germany, and created a great sensation.
   Eusebius Bruno, bishop of Angers, to whose diocese he belonged, and
   Frollant, bishop of Senlis, took his part, but the majority was against
   him. Adelmann, his former fellow-student, then arch-deacon at Lüttich
   (Liège), afterwards bishop of Bresci, remonstrated with him in two
   letters of warning (1046 and 1048).

   The controversy was fairly opened by Berengar himself in a letter to
   Lanfranc of Bec, his former fellow-student (1049). He respectfully, yet
   in a tone of intellectual superiority, perhaps with some feeling of
   jealousy of the rising fame of Bec, expressed his surprise that
   Lanfranc, as he had been informed by Ingelram of Chartres, should agree
   with Paschasius Radbertus and condemn John Scotus (confounded with
   Ratramnus) as heretical; this showed an ignorance of Scripture and
   involved a condemnation of Ambrose (?), Jerome, and Augustin, not to
   speak of others. The letter was sent to Rome, where Lanfranc then
   sojourned, and caused, with his co-operation, the first condemnation of
   Berengar by a Roman Synod held under Pope Leo IX. in April, 1050, and
   attended mostly by Italian bishops. At the same time he was summoned
   before another Synod which was held at Vercelli in September of the
   same year; and as he did not appear, [725] he was condemned a second
   time without a hearing, and the book of Ratramnus on the eucharist was
   burned. "If we are still in the figure," asked one member indignantly
   (probably Peter Damiani), "when shall we have the thing?" A Synod of
   Paris in October, 1050 or 1051, is said to have confirmed this judgment
   and threatened Berengar and his friends with the severest punishment,
   even death; but it is uncertain whether such a Synod was held. [726]

   After a short interval of silence, he was tried before a Synod of Tours
   in 1054 under Leo IX., [727] but escaped condemnation through the aid
   of Hildebrand who presided as papal representative, listened calmly to
   his arguments and was perfectly satisfied with his admission that the
   consecrated bread and wine are (in a spiritual sense) the body and
   blood of Christ. [728] At the same time he was invited by Hildebrand to
   accompany him to Rome for a final settlement.

   Confiding in this powerful advocate, Berengar appeared before a Lateran
   council held in 1059, under Nicolas II., but was bitterly disappointed.
   The assembled one hundred and thirteen bishops, whom he compares to
   "wild beasts," would not listen to his notion of a spiritual communion,
   and insisted on a sensuous participation of the body and blood of
   Christ. The violent and bigoted Cardinal Humbert, in the name of the
   Synod, forced on him a formula of recantation which cuts off all
   spiritual interpretation and teaches a literal mastication of Christ's
   body. [729] Berengar was weak enough from fear of death to accept this
   confession on his knees, and to throw his books into the fire. [730]
   "Human wickedness," he says, "extorted from human weakness a different
   confession, but a change of conviction can be effected only by the
   agency of Almighty God." He would rather trust to the mercy of God than
   the charity of his enemies, and found comfort in the pardon granted to
   Aaron and to St. Peter.

   As soon as he returned to France, he defended his real conviction more
   boldly than ever. He spoke of Pope Leo IX. and Nicolas II. in language
   as severe as Luther used five centuries later. [731] Lanfranc attacked
   him in his book on the eucharist, and Berengar replied very sharply in
   his chief work on the Lord's Supper (between 1063 and 1069.) [732] His
   friends gradually withdrew, and the wrath of his enemies grew so
   intense that he was nearly killed at a synod in Poitiers (1075 or
   1076).

   Hildebrand who in the mean time had ascended the papal throne as
   Gregory VlI., summoned Berengar once more to Rome in 1078, hoping to
   give him peace, as he had done at Tours in 1054. He made several
   attempts to protect him against the fanaticism of his enemies. But they
   demanded absolute recantation or death. A Lateran Council in February,
   1079, required Berengar to sign a formula which affirmed the conversion
   of substance in terms that cut off all sophistical escape. [733] He
   imprudently appealed to his private interviews with Gregory, but the
   pope could no longer protect him without risking his own reputation for
   orthodoxy, and ordered him to confess his error. Berengar submitted.
   "Confounded by the sudden madness of the pope," he says, "and because
   God in punishment for my sins did not give me a steadfast heart, I
   threw myself on the ground and confessed with impious voice that I had
   erred, fearing the pope would instantly pronounce against me the
   sentence of excommunication, and that, as a necessary consequence, the
   populace would hurry me to the worst of deaths." The pope, however,
   remained so far true to him that he gave him two letters of
   recommendation, one to the bishops of Tours and Angers, and one to all
   the faithful, in which he threatened all with the anathema who should
   do him any harm in person or estate, or call him a heretic. [734]

   Berengar returned to France with a desponding heart and gave up the
   hopeless contest. He was now an old man and spent the rest of his life
   in strict ascetic seclusion on the island of St. Côme (Cosmas) near
   Tours, where he died in peace 1088. Many believed that he did penance
   for his heresy, and his friends held an annual celebration of his
   memory on his grave. But what he really regretted was his cowardly
   treason to the truth as he held it. This is evident from the report of
   his trial at Rome which he drew up after his return. [735] It concludes
   with a prayer to God for forgiveness, and to the Christian reader for
   the exercise of charity. "Pray for me that these tears may procure me
   the compassion of the Almighty."

   His doctrine was misrepresented by Lanfranc and the older historians,
   as denying the real presence. [736] But since the discovery of the
   sources it is admitted also by Roman Catholics that, while he
   emphatically rejected transubstantiation, he held to a spiritual real
   presence and participation of Christ in the eucharist.

   This explains also the conduct of Gregory VII., which is all the more
   remarkable, as he was in every other respect the most strenuous
   champion of the Roman church and the papal power. This great pope was
   more an ecclesiastic than a theologian. He was willing to allow a
   certain freedom on the mysterious mode of the eucharistic presence and
   the precise nature of the change in the elements, which at that time
   had not yet been authoritatively defined as a change of substance. He
   therefore protected Berengar, with diplomatic caution, as long and as
   far as he could without endangering his great reforms and incurring
   himself the suspicion of heresy. [737] The latest known writing of
   Berengar is a letter on the death of Gregory (1085), in which he speaks
   of the pope with regard, expresses a conviction of his salvation, and
   excuses his conduct towards himself.

   Berengar was a strange compound of moral courage and physical
   cowardice. Had he died a martyr, his doctrine would have gained
   strength; but by his repeated recantations he injured his own cause and
   promoted the victory of transubstantiation.

   Notes. Hildebrand and Berengar.

   Sudendorf's Berengarius Turonensis (1850) is, next to the discovery and
   publication of Berengar's De Sacra Coena (1834), the most important
   contribution to the literature on this chapter. [738] Dr. Sudendorf
   does not enter into the eucharistic controversy, and refers to the
   account of Stäudlin and Neander as sufficient; but he gives 1) a
   complete chronological list of the Berengar literature, including all
   the notices by friends and foes (p. 7-68); 2) an account of Gaufried
   Martell, Count of Anjou, stepfather of the then-ruling Empress Agnes of
   Germany, and the most zealous and powerful protector of Berengar (p.
   69-87); and 3) twenty-two letters bearing on Berengar, with notes (p.
   88-233). These letters were here published for the first time from
   manuscripts of the royal library at Hanover, contained in a folio
   volume entitled: "Codex epistolaris Imperatorum, Regum, Pontificum,
   Episcoporum." They throw no new light on the eucharistic doctrine of
   Berengar; but three of them give us interesting information on his
   relation to Hildebrand.

   1. A letter of Count Gaufried of Anjou (d. 1060) to Cardinal
   Hildebrand, written in March, 1059, shortly before the Lateran Synod
   (April, 1059), which condemned Berengar (p. 128 and 215). The Count
   calls here, with surprising boldness and confidence, on the mighty
   Cardinal to protect Berengar at the approaching Synod of Rome, under
   the impression that he thoroughly agreed with him, and had concealed
   his real opinion at Tours. He begins thus: "To the venerable son of the
   church of the Romans, H.[ildebrand]. Count Gauf. Bear thyself not
   unworthy of so great a mother. B.[erengar] has gone to Rome according
   to thy wishes and letters of invitation. Now is the time for thee to
   act with Christian magnanimity (nunc magnanimitate christiana tibi
   agendum est), lest Berengar have the same experience with thee as at
   Tours [1054], when thou camest to us as delegate of apostolic
   authority. He expected thy advent as that of an angel. Thou wast there
   to give life to souls that were dead, and to kill souls that should
   live .... Thou didst behave thyself like that person of whom it is
   written [John 19:38]: 'He was himself a disciple of Jesus, but secretly
   from fear of the Jews.' Thou resemblest him who said [Luke 23:22]: 'I
   find no cause of death in him,' but did not set him free because he
   feared Caesar. Thou hast even done less than Pilate, who called Jesus
   to him and was not ashamed to bear witness: I find no guilt in him .. .
   To thee applies the sentence of the gospel [Luke 9:26]: 'Whosoever
   shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall I be ashamed
   before my heavenly Father.' To thee applies the word of the Lord [Luke
   11:52]: 'Woe unto you, for ye took away the key of knowledge; ye
   entered not in yourselves, and hindered those that were entering.'...
   Now the opportune time has come. Thou hast Berengar present with the
   pope. If thou again keepest silence on the error of those fools, it is
   clear that thou formerly didst not from good reasons wait for the
   proper time, but from weakness and fear didst not dare to defend the
   cause of the innocent. Should it come to this, which God forbid, we
   would be wholly disappointed in our great hope placed on thee; but thou
   wouldst commit a monstrous injustice to thyself, yea even to God. By
   thee the Orient with all its perverseness would be introduced into the
   Occident; instead of illuminating our darkness, thou wouldest turn our
   light into darkness according to the best of thy ability. All those who
   excel in erudition and judge the case according to the Scriptures, bore
   testimony that Berengar has the right view according to the Scriptures
   .... That popular delusion [of transubstantiation] leads to pernicious
   heresy. The resurrection of the body, of which Paul says that the
   corruptible must put on the incorruptible, cannot stand, if we contend
   that the body of Christ is in a sensuous manner broken by the priest
   and torn with the teeth (sensualiter sacerdotum manibus frangi,
   dentibus atteri). Thou boastest of thy Rome that she was never
   conquered in faith and military glory. Thou wilt put to shame that
   glory, if, at this time when God has elevated thee above all others at
   the papal see, that false doctrine, that nursery of the most certain
   heresy, by thy dissimulation and silence should raise its head. Leave
   not thine honor to others, by retiring to the corner of disgraceful
   silence."

   2. A letter of Berengar to Pope Gregory VII. from the year 1077, in
   which he addresses him as "pater optime," and assures him of his
   profound reverence and love (p. 182 and 230). He thanks him for a
   letter of protection he had written to his legate, Bishop Hugo of Die
   (afterwards Archbishop of Lyons), but begs him to excuse him for not
   attending a French council of his enemies, to which he had been
   summoned. He expresses the hope of a personal conference with the pope
   (opportunitatem vivendi praesentiam tuam et audiendi), and concludes
   with the request to continue his patronage. "Vel [i.e. Valeat]
   Christianitas tua, pater optime, longo parvitati meae tempore dignum
   sede apostolica patrocinium impensura." The result of this
   correspondence is unknown. Berengar's hope of seeing and hearing the
   pope was fulfilled in 1078, when he was summoned to the Council in
   Rome; but the result, as we have seen, was his condemnation by the
   Council with the pope's consent.

   3. A letter of Berengar to Archbishop Joscelin of Bordeaux, written in
   a charitable Christian spirit after May 25, 1085, when Gregory VII.
   died (p. 196 and 231). It begins thus: "The unexpected death of our G.
   [regory] causes me no little disturbance (G. nostri me non parum mors
   inopinato [a] perturbat)." The nostri sounds rather too familiar in
   view of Gregory's conduct in 1079, but must be understood of the
   personal sympathy shown him before and after in the last commendatory
   letters. B. then goes on to express confidence in the pope's salvation,
   and forgives him his defection, which he strangely compares with the
   separation of Barnabas from Paul. "Sed, quantum mihi videor novisse
   hominem, de salute hominis certum constat, quicquid illi prejudicent,
   qui, secundum dominicam sententiam [Matt. 23:24], culicem culantes,
   camelum sorbent. In Christo lesu, inquit Apostolus [Gal. 6:15], neque
   circumcisio est aliquid, neque preputium, sed nova creatura. Quod illum
   fuisse, quantum illum noveram, de misericordia presumo divina.
   Discessit a Paulo Barnabas [Acts 15:39, 40], ut non cum illo secundum
   exteriorem commaneret hominem, nec minus tamen secundum interiorem
   hominem Barnabas in libro vitae permansit." In remembrance of Gregory's
   conduct in forcing him at the Roman Council in 1079 to swear to a
   formula against his conviction, he asserts that the power of the keys
   which Christ gave to Peter (Matt. 16:19) is limited. The binding must
   not be arbitrary and unjust. The Lord speaks through the prophet to the
   priests (per prophetam ad prelatos): "I will curse your blessings (Mal.
   2:2: maledicam benedictionibus vestris)." From this it follows
   necessarily that He also blesses their curses (Ex quo necessarium
   constat, quod etiam benedicat maledictionibus talium). Hence the
   Psalmist says (Ps. 109:28): "Let them curse, but bless thou." The
   blessed Augustin, in his book on the Words of the Lord, says: "Justice
   solves the bonds of injustice;" and the blessed Gregory [I.] says
   [Homil. XXVI.]: "He forfeits the power to bind and to loose, who uses
   it not for the benefit of his subjects, but according to his arbitrary
   will (ipsa hac ligandi atque solvendi potestate se privat, qui hanc non
   pro subditorum moribus, sed pro suae voluntatis motibus exercet)."
   Berengar thus turns the first Gregory against the seventh Gregory.

   Hildebrand's real opinion on the eucharistic presence can only be
   inferred from his conduct during the controversy. He sincerely
   protected Berengar against violence and persecution even after his
   final condemnation; but the public opinion of the church in 1059 and
   again in 1079 expressed itself so strongly in favor of a substantial or
   essential change of the eucharistic elements, that he was forced to
   yield. Personally, he favored a certain freedom of opinion on the mode
   of the change, provided only the change itself was admitted, as was
   expressly done by Berengar. Only a few days before the Council of 1078
   the pope sought the opinion of the Virgin Mary through an esteemed
   monk, and received as an answer that nothing more should be held or
   required on the reaI presence than what was found in the Holy
   Scriptures, namely, that the bread after consecration was the true body
   of Christ. So Berengar reports; see Mansi, XIX. 766; Gieseler, II. 172;
   Neander, III. 519. (The charge of Ebrard that the pope acted
   hypocritically and treacherously towards B., is contradicted by facts).

   The same view of a change of the elements in a manner inexplicable and
   therefore indefinable, is expressed in a fragment of a commentary on
   Matthew by a certain "Magister Hildebrand," published by Peter Allix
   (in Determinatio Ioannis praedicatoris de, modo existendi Corp. Christi
   in sacramento altaris. Lond., 1686)." In this fragment," says Neander,
   III. 511, "after an investigation of the different ways in which the
   conversio of the bread into the body of Christ may be conceived, the
   conclusion is arrived at, that nothing can be decided with certainty on
   this point; that the conversio therefore is the only essential part of
   the doctrine, namely, that bread and wine become body and blood of
   Christ, and that with regard to the way in which that conversion takes
   place, men should not seek to inquire. This coincides with the view
   which evidently lies at the basis of the cardinal's proceedings. But
   whether the author was this Hildebrand, must ever remain a very
   doubtful question, since it is not probable, that if a man whose life
   constitutes an epoch in history wrote a commentary on the Gospel of
   Matthew, it should have been so entirely forgotten." Sudendorf, however
   (p. 186), ascribes the fragment to Pope Hildebrand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [722] During and after the eucharistic controversy he was charged with
   vanity, ambition, and using improper means, such as money and
   patronage, for the spread of his opinions. See Hefele, IV. 742. Card.
   Hergenröther (I. 707) calls Berengar oberflächlich, eitel, ehrgeizig,
   verwegen and neuerungsüchtig. Archbishop Trench (Lectures on Medieval
   Church History, p. 189 sq. ), dissenting from Coleridge's charitable
   judgment, finds fault with Berengar's "insolent tone of superiority" in
   addressing Lanfranc, and with a "passionate feebleness" and "want of
   personal dignity" in his whole conduct. He thinks his success would
   have been a calamity, since it would have involved the loss of the
   truth which was concealed under the doctrine of transubstantiation.
   "Superstition sometimes guards the truth which it distorts,
   caricatures, and in part conceals." Coleridge wrote a touching poem on
   Berengar's recantation.

   [723] As an "Aufklärer," Berengar is one-sidedly represented by Reuter,
   l.c. Comp. also Baur, in his Kirchengesch. des Mittelalters, p. 66 sqq.

   [724] Neander III. 504. The Discourse is published in Martène and
   Durand, Thes. nov. Anecdotorum, Tom. I.

   [725] He was prevented by a violent act of King Henry I. of France, who
   committed him to prison and seized his property.

   [726] Berengar makes no mention of this Synod. Lessing, Gieseler and
   Baur (II. 178) doubt whether it was held. Neander, Sudendorf, Robertson
   and Hefele (IV. 753 sqq.) credit the report of Durandus, but correct
   his dates.

   [727] This seems to be the correct date, instead of 1055 under Victor
   II., according to Lanfranc's account. The difference involves the
   veracity of Berengar, who assigns the Synod to the pontificate of Leo
   IX.; but it is safer to assume, with Leasing, Sudendorf (p. 45), and
   Hefele (IV. 778), that Lanfranc, after a lapse of ten or more years had
   forgotten the correct date.

   [728] "Panis atque vinum altaris post consecrationem sunt corpus
   Christi et sanguis." De S. Coena, p. 52. Berengar meant a real, though
   uncorporeal presence. He admitted a conversion of the elements in the
   sense of consecration, but without change of substance. Hildebrand was
   willing to leave this an open question. See below.

   [729] "Ego Berengarius, indignus diaconus ... anathematizo omnem
   haeresim, praecipue eam de qua hactenus infamatus sum, quae astruere
   conatur, panem et vinum, quae in altari ponuntur, post consecrationem
   solummodo sacramentum, et non verum et sanguinem Domini nostri I. Ch.
   esse nec posse sensualiterin solo sacramento [non solum sacramento,
   sed, in veritate] manibus sacerdotum tractari, vel frangi, aut fidelium
   dentibus atteri," etc. So Lanfranc reports the creed in De Corp. et
   Sang. Dom., c.2 (Migne, vol. 150, p. 410); comp. Berengar, De S. Coena,
   p. 68. Gieseler calls this creed "truly Capernaitic." Hergenröther (I.
   703) admits that it sounds very hard, but may be defended by similar
   language of Chrysostom. Luther expressed his faith in the real presence
   almost as strongly when be instructed Melanchthon to insist, in his
   conference with Bucer, 1534, that Christ's body was literally eaten and
   torn with the teeth ("gegessen und mit den Zähnen zerbissen"). See his
   letters to Jonas and Melanchthon in Briefe, ed. De Wette, Bd. IV. 569
   and 572. But I doubt whether any Lutheran divine would endorse such
   language now.

   [730] Lanfranc charges him with downright perjury. But according to his
   own report, Berengar did not sign the formula, nor was he required to
   do so. De S. Coena, p. 25 sq.; comp. p. 59 sq.

   [731] Leo is "minime leo de tribu Iuda;" the pope is not a pontifex,
   but a pompifex and pulpifex, and the see of Rome not a sedes
   apostolica, but a sedes Satanae. De S. Coena, p. 34, 40, 42, 71.

   in Bibl. P. Lugd. XVIII. 836.

   This book, after having been long lost, was discovered by Lessing in
   the Library of Wolfenbüttel (1770), who gave large extracts from it,
   and was published in full by A. F. and F. Th. Vischer, Berlin, 1834,
   with a short preface by Neander. Berengar gives here a very different
   version of the previous history, and charges Lanfranc with falsehood.
   He fortifies his view by quotations from Ambrose and Augustin, and
   abounds in passion, vituperation and repetition. The style is obscure
   and barbarous. The MS. is defective at the beginning and the close.
   Lessing traced it to the eleventh or twelfth century, Stäudlin to
   Berengar himself, the editors (p. 23), more correctly to a negligent
   copyist who had the original before him. Comp. Sudendorf, p. 47.

   [733] "Corde credo et ore confiteor, panem et vinum, quae ponuntur in
   altari, per mysterium sacrae orationis et verba nostri Remptoris
   substantialiter converti in veram et propriam et vivifratricem carnem
   et sanguinem Jesu Christi Domini nostri, et post consecrationem esse
   verum Christi corpus, quod natum est de Virgine, et quod pro salute
   mundi oblatum in cruce pependit, et quod sedet ad dexteram Patris, et
   verum sanguinem Christi, qui de latere ejus effusus est, non tantum per
   signum et virtutem sacramenti, sed in proprietate naturae et veritate
   substantiae." Berengar was willing to admit a conversio panis, but
   salva sua substantia,i.e. non amittens quod erat, sed assumens quod non
   erat; in other words, conversion without annihilation. A mere
   sophistry. Substantialiter can mean nothing else but secundum
   substantiam. See the Acts of the Council in Mansi, XIX. 762.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 129. Berengar's Theory of the Lord's Supper.

   The chief source is Berengar's second book against Lanfranc, already
   quoted. His first book is lost with the exception of a few fragments in
   Lanfranc's reply.

   Berengar attacked the doctrine of transubstantiation, and used against
   it nearly every argument: it is not only above reason, but against
   reason and against the testimony of the senses; it involves a
   contradiction between subject and predicate, and between substance and
   its qualities, which are inseparable; it is inconsistent with the fact
   of Christ's ascension and presence in heaven; it virtually assumes
   either a multiplication or an omnipresence of his body, which
   contradicts the necessary limitations of corporeality. [739] There can
   be only one body of Christ, and only one sacrifice of Christ. The
   stories of the appearances of blood on the altar, be treated with
   scorn, from which some of his enemies inferred that he denied all
   miracles. He called the doctrine of transubstantiation an absurdity
   (ineptio) and an insane folly of the populace (vecordia vulgi).

   To this notion of a corporeal or material presence on the altar, he
   opposed the idea of a spiritual or dynamic presence and participation.
   His positive view agrees essentially with that of Ratramnus; but he
   went beyond him, as Calvin went beyond Zwingli. He endeavors to save
   the spiritual reality without the carnal form. He distinguishes, with
   St. Augustin and Ratramnus, between the historical and the eucharistic
   body of Christ, and between the visible symbol or sacramentum and the
   thing symbolized or the res sacramenti. He maintains that we cannot
   literally eat and drink Christ's body and blood, but that nevertheless
   we may have real spiritual Communion by faith with the flesh, that is,
   with the glorified humanity of Christ in heaven. His theory is
   substantially the same as that of Calvin. [740] The salient points are
   these:

   1) The elements remain in substance as well as in appearance, after the
   consecration, although they acquire a new significance. Hence the
   predicate in the words of institution must be taken figuratively, as in
   many other passages, where Christ is called the lion, the lamb, the
   door, the vine, the corner-stone, the rock, etc. [741] The discourse in
   the sixth chapter of John is likewise figurative, and does not refer to
   the sacrament at all, but to the believing reception of Christ's death.
   [742]

   2) Nevertheless bread and wine are not empty, symbols, but in some
   sense the body and blood of Christ which they represent. They are
   converted by being consecrated; for whatever is consecrated is lifted
   to a higher sphere and transformed. They do not lose their substance
   after consecration; but they lose their emptiness, and become
   efficacious to the believer. So water in baptism remains water, but
   becomes the vehicle of regeneration. Wherever the sacramentum is, there
   is also the res sacramenti.

   3) Christ is spiritually present and is spiritually received by faith.
   Without faith we can have no real communion with him, nor share in his
   benefits. "The true body of Christ," he says in a letter to Adelmann,"
   is placed on the altar, but spiritually to the inner man and to those
   only who are members of Christ, for spiritual manducation. This the
   fathers teach openly, and distinguish between the body and blood of
   Christ and the sacramental signs of the body and blood. The pious
   receive both, the sacramental sign (sacramentum) visibly, the
   sacramental substance (rem sacramenti) invisibly; while the ungodly
   receive only the sacramental sign to their own judgment."

   4) The communion in the Lord's Supper is a communion with the whole
   undivided person of Christ, and not with flesh and blood as separate
   elements. As the whole body of Christ was sacrificed in death, so we
   receive the whole body in a spiritual manner; and as Christ's body is
   now glorified in heaven, we must spiritually ascend to heaven." [743]

   Here again is a strong point of contact with Calvin, who likewise
   taught such an elevation of the soul to heaven as a necessary condition
   of true communion with the life-giving power of Christ's humanity. He
   meant, of course, no locomotion, but the sursum corda, which is
   necessary in every act of prayer. It is the Holy, Spirit who lifts us
   up to Christ on the wings of faith, and brings him down to us, and thus
   unites heaven and earth.

   A view quite similar to that of Berengar seems to have obtained about
   that time in the Anglo-Saxon Church, if we are to judge from the
   Homilies of Aelfric, which enjoyed great authority and popularity.
   [744]

   [739] "Quod diversis in locis eodem momento sensualiter adsit corpus,
   corpus non esse constabit." De S. Coena, p. 199.

   [740] Baur very clearly puts the case (II. 190): "Die Lehre Berengar's
   schliesst sich ganz an die des Ratramnus an, ist aber zugleich eine
   Fortbildung derselben. Wie Ratramnus sich eigentlich nur in der Sphäre
   des Verhältnisses von Bild und Sache bewegt, so sucht dagegen Berengar
   zu zeigen, dass ungeachtet keine andere Ansicht vom Abendmahl möglich
   sei, als die symbolische, dem Abendmahldoch seine volle Realität
   bleibe, dass, wenn man auch im Abendmahl den Leib und das Blut Christi
   nicht wirklich geniesse, doch auch so eine reelle Verbindung mit den
   Fleisch oder der in den Himmel erhöchten Menschheit Christi stattfinde.
   Es ist im Allgemeinen zwischen Ratramnus und Berengar ein analoges
   Verhältniss wie später zwischen Zwingli und Calvin." Comp. also the
   exposition of Neander, III. 521-526, and of Herzog, in his
   Kirchengesch. II. 112-114.

   [741] De S. Coena, p. 83. B. lays down the hermeneutic principle:
   "Ubicunque praedicatur non praedicabile, quia tropica locutio est, de
   non susceptibili, alter propositionis terminus tropice, alter proprie
   accipiatur." Zwingli used the same and other examples of figurative
   speech in his controversy with Luther. He found the figure in the verb
   (esti=significat), OEcolampadius in the predicate (corpus=figura
   corporis).

   [742] L.c., p. 165 and 236. He quotes Augustin in his favor, and refers
   to John 4:14 where Christ speaks of drinking the water of life and
   eating meat (4:32-34), in a spiritual sense.

   [743] P. 157. The believer receives "totam et integram Domini Dei sui
   carnem, non autem coelo devocatam, sed in coelo manentem," and he
   ascends to heaven "cordis ad videndum Deum mundati devotione
   spatiosissima."

   [744] Thus he says in the Homily on Easter day: "Great is the
   difference between the invisible might of the holy housel [sacrament]
   and the visible appearance of its own nature. By nature it is
   corruptible bread and corruptible wine, and is, by the power of the
   Divine word, truly Christ's body and blood: not, however, bodily, but
   spiritually. Great is the difference between the body in which Christ
   suffered and the body which is hallowed for housel. ... In his ghostly
   body, which we call housel, there is nothing to be understood bodily,
   but all is to be understood spiritually." The passage is quoted by J.
   C. Robertson from Thorpe's edition of Aelfric, II. 271. Thorpe
   identifies the author of these Anglo-Saxon Homilies with Aelfric,
   Archbishop of York, who lived till the beginning of the Berengar
   controversy (d. 1051), but the identity is disputed. See Hardwick, p.
   174, and L. Stephen's "Dict. of Nat. Biogr." I. 164 sqq.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 130. Lanfranc and the Triumph of Transubstantiation.

   The chief opponent of Berengar was his former friend, Lanfranc, a
   native of Pavia (b. 1005), prior of the Convent of Bet in Normandy
   (1045), afterwards archbishop of Canterbury (1070-1089), and in both
   positions the predecessor of the more distinguished Anselm. [745] He
   was, next to Berengar, the greatest dialectician of his age, but used
   dialectics only in support of church authority and tradition, and thus
   prepared the way for orthodox scholasticism. He assailed Berengar in a
   treatise of twenty-three chapters on the eucharist, written after 1063,
   in epistolary form, and advocated the doctrine of transubstantiation
   (without using the term) with its consequences. [746] He describes the
   change as a miraculous and incomprehensible change of the substance of
   bread and wine into the very body and blood of Christ. [747] He also
   teaches (what Radbert had not done expressly) that even unworthy
   communicants (indigne sumentes) receive the same sacramental substance
   as believers, though with opposite effect. [748]

   Among the less distinguished writers on the Eucharist must be mentioned
   Adelmann, Durandus, and Guitmund, who defended the catholic doctrine
   against Berengar. Guitmund (a pupil of Lanfranc, and archbishop of
   Aversa in Apulia) reports that the Berengarians differed, some holding
   only a symbolical presence, others (with Berengar) a real, but latent
   presence, or a sort of impanation, but all denied a change of
   substance. This change he regards as the main thing which nourishes
   piety. "What can be more salutary," he asks," than such a faith? Purely
   receiving into itself the pure and simple Christ alone, in the
   consciousness of possessing so glorious a gift, it guards with the
   greater vigilance against sin; it glows with a more earnest longing
   after all righteousness; it strives every day to escape from the world
   ... and to embrace in unclouded vision the fountain of life itself."
   [749]

   From this time on, transubstantiation may be regarded as a dogma of the
   Latin church. It was defended by the orthodox schoolmen, and
   oecumenically sanctioned under Pope Innocent III. in 1215.

   With the triumph of transubstantiation is closely connected the
   withdrawal of the communion cup from the laity, which gradually spread
   in the twelfth century, [750] and the adoration of the presence of
   Christ in the consecrated elements, which dates from the eleventh
   century, was enjoined by Honorius III. in 1217, and gave rise to the
   Corpus Christi festival appointed by Urban IV., in 1264. The withdrawal
   of the cup had its origin partly in considerations of expediency, but
   chiefly in the superstitious solicitude to guard against profanation by
   spilling the blood of Christ. The schoolmen defended the practice by
   the doctrine that the whole Christ is present in either kind. [751] It
   strengthened the power of the priesthood at the expense of the rights
   of the laity and in plain violation of the command of Christ: "Drink ye
   all of it" (Matt. 26:27).

   The doctrine of transubstantiation is the most characteristic tenet of
   the Catholic Church of the middle age, and its modern successor, the
   Roman Church. It reflects a magical supernaturalism which puts the
   severest tax upon the intellect, and requires it to contradict the
   unanimous testimony of our senses of sight, touch and taste. It
   furnishes the doctrinal basis for the daily sacrifice of the mass and
   the power of the priesthood with its awful claim to create and to offer
   the very body and blood of the Saviour of the world. For if the
   self-same body of Christ which suffered on the cross, is truly present
   and eaten in the eucharist, it must also be the self-same sacrifice of
   Calvary which is repeated in the mass; and a true sacrifice requires a
   true priest, who offers it on the altar. Priest, sacrifice, and altar
   form an inseparable trio; a literal conception of one requires a
   literal conception of the other two, and a spiritual conception of one
   necessarily leads to a spiritual conception of all.

   Notes.

   A few additional remarks must conclude this subject, so that we need
   not return to it in the next volume.

   1. The scholastic terms transsubstantiatio, transsubstantiare (in Greek
   metousivwsi", Engl. transubstantiation, Germ. Wesensverwand-lung),
   signify a change of one substance into another, and were introduced in
   the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The phrase substantialiter converti
   was used by the Roman Synod of 1079 (see p. 559). Transsubstantiatio
   occurs first in Peter Damiani (d. 1072) in his Expos. can. Missae
   (published by Angelo Mai in "Script. Vet. Nova Coll." VI. 215), and
   then in the sermons of Hildebert, archbishop of Tours (d. 1134); the
   verb transsubstantiare first in Stephanus, Bishop of Autun (1113-1129),
   Tract. de Sacr. Altaris, c. 14 ("panem, quem accepi, in corpus meum
   transsubstantiavi"), and then officially in the fourth Lateran Council,
   1215. See Gieseler, II. ii. 434 sq. (fourth Germ. ed.). Similar terms,
   as mutatio, transmutatio, transformatio, conversio, transitio, had been
   in use before. The corresponding Greek noun metousivwsi" was formally
   accepted by the Oriental Church in the Orthodox Confession of Peter
   Mogilas, 1643, and later documents, yet with the remark that the word
   is not to be taken as a definition of the manner in which the bread and
   wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. See Schaff's Creeds
   of Christendom, II. 382, 427, 431, 495, 497 sq. Similar expressions,
   such as metabolhv, metabavllein, metapoiei'n, had been employed by the
   Greek fathers, especially by Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, and John
   of Damascus. The last is the chief authority quoted in the Russian
   Catechism (see Schaff, l.c. II. 498).

   All these terms attempt to explain the inexplicable and to rationalize
   the irrational--the contradiction between substance and accidents,
   between reality and appearance. Transubstantiation is devotion turned
   into rhetoric, and rhetoric turned into irrational logic.

   2. The doctrine of transubstantiation was first strongly expressed in
   the confessions of two Roman Synods of 1059 and 1079, which Berengar
   was forced to accept against his conscience; see p. 557 and 559. It was
   oecumenically sanctioned for the whole Latin church by the fourth
   Lateran Council under Pope Innocent III., a.d. 1215, in the creed of
   the Synod, cap. 1: "Corpus et sanguis [Christi] in sacramento altaris
   sub speciebus panis et vini veraciter continentur, TRANSSUBSTAN-TIATIS
   PANE IN CORPUS ET VINO IN SANGUINEM, POTESTATE DIVINA, ut ad
   perficiendum mysterium unitatis accipiamus ipsi de suo, quod accepit
   ipse de nostro. Et hoc utique sacramentum nemo potest conficere, nisi
   sacerdos, qui fuerit rite ordinatus secundum claves Ecclesiae, quas
   ipse concessit Apostolis et eorum successoribus lesus Christus."

   The Council of Trent, in the thirteenth session, 1551, reaffirmed the
   doctrine against the Protestants in these words: "that, by the
   consecration of the bread and of the wine, a conversion is made of the
   whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ
   our Lord (conversionem fieri totius substantiae panis in substantiam
   corporis Christi Domini), and of the whole substance of the wine into
   the substance of his blood; which conversion is by the holy Catholic
   Church suitably and properly called Transubstantiation." The same synod
   sanctioned the adoration of the sacrament (i.e. Christ on the altar
   under the figure of the elements), and anathematizes those who deny
   this doctrine and practice. See Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, II.
   130-139.

   3. Thomas Aquinas, the prince of scholastic divines, has given the
   clearest poetic expression to the dogma of transubstantiation in the
   following stanzas of his famous hymn, "Lauda Sion Salvatorem," for the
   Corpus Christi Festival:


   "Dogma datur Christianis,

   Quod in carnem transit panis,

   Et vinum in sanguinem.

   Quod non capis, quod non

   Animosa firmat fides

   Praeter rerum ordinem.

   "Hear what holy Church maintaineth,

   That the bread its substance changeth

   Into Flesh, the wine to Blood.

   Doth it pass thy comprehending?

   Faith, the law of sight transcending,

   Leaps to things not understood.


   "Sub diversis speciebus,

   Signis tantum et non rebus,

   Latent res eximiae.

   Caro cibus, sanguis potus,

   Manet tamen Christus totus,

   Sub utraque specie.

   Here, in outward signs, are hidden

   Priceless things, to sense forbidden;

   Signs, not things, are all we see:

   Flesh from bread, and Blood from wine:

   Yet is Christ, in either sign,

   All entire, confess'd to be.


   "A sumente non concisus,

   Non confractus, non divisus,

   Integer accipitur.

   Sumit unus, sumunt mille,

   Quantum isti, tantum ille,

   Nec sumitus consumitur.

   They, too, who of Him partake,

   Sever not, nor rend, nor break,

   But entire, their Lord receive.

   Whether one or thousands eat,

   All receive the self-same meat,

   Nor the less for others leave.


   "Sumunt boni, sumunt mali,

   Sorte tamen inaequali

   Vitae vel interitus.

   Mors est malis, vita bonis:

   Vide, paris sumptionis

   Quam sit dispar exitus."


   Both the wicked and the good

   Eat of this celestial Food;

   But with ends how opposite!

   Here 'tis life, and there tis death;

   The same yet issuing to each

   In a difference infinite."

   See the Thes. Hymnol. of Daniel, II. 97-100, who calls St. Thomas
   "summus laudator venerabilis sacramenti," and quotes the interesting,
   but opposite judgments of Möhler and Luther. The translation is by
   Edward Caswall (Hymns and Poems, 2nd ed., 1873, and previously in Lyra
   Catholica, Lond., 1849, p. 238). The translation of the last two
   stanzas is not as felicitous as that of the other two. The following
   version preserves the double rhyme of the original:


   "Eaten, but without incision,"

   "Here alike the good and evil,


   Broken, but without division,

   High and low in social level,


   Each the whole of Christ receives:

   Take the Feast for woe or weal:


   Thousands take what each is taking,

   Wonder! from the self-same eating,


   Each one breaks what all are breaking,

   Good and bad their bliss are meeting


   None a lessened body leaves.

   Or their doom herein they seal."

   4. The doctrine of transubstantiation has always been regarded by
   Protestants as one of the fundamental errors and grossest superstitions
   of Romanism. But we must not forget the underlying truth which gives
   tenacity to error. A doctrine cannot be wholly false, which has been
   believed for centuries not only by the Greek and Latin churches alike,
   but as regards the chief point, namely, the real presence of the very
   body and blood of Christ--also by the Lutheran and a considerable
   portion of the Anglican communions, and which still nourishes the piety
   of innumerable guests at the Lord's table. The mysterious discourse of
   our Saviour in the synagogue of Capernaum after the miraculous feeding
   of the multitude, expresses the great truth which is materialized and
   carnalized in transubstantiation. Christ is in the deepest spiritual
   sense the bread of life from heaven which gives nourishment to
   believers, and in the holy communion we receive the actual benefit of
   his broken body and shed blood, which are truly present in their power;
   for his sacrifice, though offered but once, is of perpetual force to
   all who accept it in faith. The literal miracle of the feeding of the
   five thousand is spiritually carried on in the vital union of Christ
   and the believer, and culminates in the sacramental feast. Our Lord
   thus explains the symbolic significance of that miracle in the
   strongest language; but he expressly excludes the carnal, Capernaitic
   conception, and furnishes the key for the true understanding, in the
   sentence: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
   nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are
   life" (John 6:63).

   The Monothelites, the Adoptionists, the Predestinarians, and the
   Berengarians moved within the limits of the Catholic church, dissented
   from it only in one doctrine, and are interwoven with the development
   of' catholic orthodoxy which has been described in the preceding
   chapter. But there were also radical heretical sects which mixed
   Christianity with heathen notions, disowned all connection with the
   historic church, and set themselves up against it as rival communities.
   They were essentially dualistic, like the ancient Gnostics and
   Manichaeans, and hence their Catholic opponents called them by the
   convenient and hated name of New Manichaeans; though the system of the
   Paulicians has more affinity with that of Marcion. They appeared first
   in the East, and spread afterwards by unknown tracks in the West. They
   reached their height in the thirteenth century, when they were crushed,
   but not annihilated, by a crusade under Pope Innocent III.

   These sects have often been falsely represented [752] as forerunners of
   Protestantism; they are so only in a purely negative sense, while in
   their positive opinions they differ as widely from the evangelical as
   from the Greek and Roman creed. The Reformation came out of the bosom
   of Mediaeval Catholicism, retained its oecumenical doctrines, and kept
   up the historic continuity.

   The Paulicians [753] are the most important sect in our period. They
   were confined to the territory of the Eastern church. They flourished
   in Armenia, where Christianity came in conflict with Parsism and was
   mixed with dualistic ideas. They probably inherited some traditions of
   the Manichaeans and Marcionites.

   I. Their name is derived by their Greek opponents [754] from two
   brothers, Paul and John sons of a Manichaean a woman Kallinike, in
   Samosata; but, more probably, by modern historians [755] from their
   preference for St. Paul whom they placed highest among the Apostles.
   They borrowed the names of their leading teachers from his disciples
   (Sylvanus, Titus, Timothy, Tychicus, Epaphroditus), and called their
   congregations after his (Corinth, Philippi, Achaia, etc.). They
   themselves preferred simply the name "Christians" (Cristianoiv,
   Cristopoli'tai), in opposition to the professors of the Roman
   state-religion ( JRwmaivou").

   II. The founder of the sect is Constantine a Syrian from a Gnostic
   (Marcionite) congregation in Mananalis near Samosata. Inspired by the
   epistles of St. Paul and pretending to be his genuine disciple, he
   propagated under the name of Sylvanus dualistic doctrines in Kibossa in
   Armenia and in the regions of Pontus and Cappadocia, with great success
   for twenty-seven years, until the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus
   (668-685) sent an officer, Symeon, for his arrest and execution. He was
   stoned to death in 684, and his congregation scattered. But Symeon was
   struck and converted by the serene courage of Constantine-Sylvanus,
   revived the congregation, and ruled it under the name of Titus. When
   Justinian II. heard of it, he condemned him and the other leaders to
   death by fire (690), according to the laws against the Manichaeans.

   But in spite of repeated persecution and inner dissensions, the sect
   spread throughout Asia Minor. When it decayed, a zealous reformer rose
   in the person of Sergius, called Tychieus, the second founder of the
   sect (801-835). He had been converted by a woman, visited the old
   congregations and founded new ones, preached and wrote epistles,
   opposed the antinomian practices of Baanes, called "the Filthy" (oJ
   rJuparov"), and introduced strict discipline. His followers were called
   Sergiotes in distinction from the Baanites.

   The fate of the sect varied with the policy of the Greek emperors. The
   iconoclastic Leo the Isaurian did not disturb them, and gave the leader
   of the sect, Gegnaesius, after a satisfactory examination by the
   patriarch, a letter of protection against persecution; but the wily
   heretic had answered the questions in a way that deceived the
   patriarch. Leo the Armenian (813-820) organized an expedition for their
   conversion, pardoning the apostates and executing the constant.
   Theodora, who restored the worship of images, cruelly persecuted them,
   and under her short reign one hundred thousand Paulicians were put to
   death by the sword, the gibbet, or the flames (844). Perhaps this large
   number included many iconoclasts.

   Provoked by these cruelties, the Paulicians raised the standard of
   revolt under the lead of Karbeas. He fled with five thousand to the
   Saracens, built a strong fort, Tephrica, [756] on the Arab frontier,
   and in alliance with the Moslems made successful military invasions
   into the Byzantine territory. His son-in-law, Chrysocheres, proceeded
   as far as Ephesus, and turned the cathedral into a stable (867), but
   was killed by the Greeks in 871, and the sect had to submit to the
   Emperor Basil the Macedonian. He sent among them the monk Petrus
   Siculus, who thus became acquainted with their doctrines and collected
   the materials for his work.

   After this the sect lost its political significance, and gradually
   disappeared from history. Many were transferred to Philippopolis in
   Thrace about 970, as guards of the frontier, and enjoyed toleration.
   Alexius Comnenus (1081-1118) disputed with their leaders, rewarded the
   converts, and punished the obstinate. The Crusaders found some remains
   in 1204, when they captured Constantinople.

   III. The doctrines and practices of the Paulicians are known to us only
   from the reports of the orthodox opponents and a few fragments of the
   epistles of Sergius. They were a strange mixture of dualism,
   demiurgism, docetism, mysticism and pseudo-Paulinism, and resemble in
   many respects the Gnostic system of Marcion.

   (1) Dualism was their fundamental principle. [757] The good God created
   the spiritual world; the bad God or demiurge created the sensual world.
   The former is worshipped by the Paulicians, i.e. the true Christians,
   the latter by the "Romans" or Catholics.

   (2) Contempt of matter. The body is the seat of evil desire, and is
   itself impure. It holds the divine soul as in a prison.

   (3) Docetism. Christ descended from heaven in an ethereal body, passed
   through the womb of Mary as through a channel, suffered in appearance,
   but not in reality, and began the process of redemption of the spirit
   from the chains of matter.

   (4) The Virgin Mary was not "the mother of God," and has a purely
   external connection with Jesus. Peter the Sicilian says, that they did
   not even allow her a place among the good and virtuous women. The true
   theotokos is the heavenly Jerusalem, from which Christ came out and to
   which he returned.

   (5) They rejected the Old Testament as the work of the Demiurge, and
   the Epistles of Peter. They regarded Peter as a false apostle, because
   he denied his master, preached Judaism rather than Christianity, was
   the enemy of Paul (Gal. 2:11) and the pillar of the Catholic hierarchy.
   They accepted the four Gospels, the Acts, fourteen Epistles of Paul,
   and the Epistles of James, John and Jude. At a later period, however,
   they seem to have confined themselves, like Marcion, to the writings of
   Paul and Luke, adding to them probably the Gospel of John. They claimed
   also to possess an Epistle to the Laodiceans; but this was probably
   identical with the Epistle to the Ephesians. Their method of exposition
   was allegorical.

   (6) They rejected the priesthood, the sacraments, the worship of saints
   and relics, the sign of the cross (except in cases of serious illness),
   and all externals in religion. Baptism means only the baptism of the
   Spirit; the communion with the body and blood of Christ is only a
   communion with his word and doctrine.

   In the place of priests (hiereisand presbuteroi) the Paulicians had
   teachers and pastors (didaskaloiand poimenes), companions or itinerant
   missionaries (sunekdemoi), and scribes (notarioi). In the place of
   churches they had meeting-houses called "oratories" (proseuchai); but
   the founders and leaders were esteemed as "apostles" and "prophets."
   There is no trace of the Manichaean distinction between two classes of
   the electi and credentes.

   (7) Their morals were ascetic. They aimed to emancipate the spirit from
   the power of the material body, without, however, condemning marriage
   and the eating of flesh; but the Baanites ran into the opposite extreme
   of an antinomian abuse of the flesh, and reveled in licentiousness,
   even incest. In both extremes they resembled the Gnostic sects.
   According to Photius, the Paulicians were also utterly deficient in
   veracity, and denied their faith without scruple on the principle that
   falsehood is justifiable for a good end.

   The Euchites were mystic monks with dualistic principles derived from
   Parsism. They held that a demon dwells in every man from his birth, and
   can be expelled only by unceasing silent prayer, which they exalted
   above every spiritual exercise. Hence their name. [758] They were also
   called Enthusiasts by the people on account of their boasted ecstasies,
   in which they fancied that they received special revelations. Psellus
   calls them "devil-worshippers." They despised all outward forms of
   worship. Rumor charged them with lewdness and infanticide in their
   secret assemblies; but the same stories were told of the early
   Christians, and deserve no credit.

   They appear in the eleventh century in Mesopotamia and Armenia, in some
   connection with the Paulicians. They were probably the successors of
   the older Syrian Euchites or Messalians of the fourth and fifth
   centuries, who in their conceit had reached the height of ascetic
   perfection, despised manual labor and all common occupations, and lived
   on alms--the first specimens of mendicant friars.

   From the Euchites sprang towards the close of the eleventh century the
   Bogomiles (the Slavonic name for Euchites), [759] and Catharists (i.e.
   the Purists, Puritans), and spread from Bulgaria into the West. They
   will occupy our attention in the next period.

   Another Eastern sect, called Thondracians (from the village Thondrac),
   was organized by Sembat, a Paulician, in the province of Ararat,
   between 833 and 854. They sprang from the Paulicians, and in spite of
   persecution made numerous converts in Armenia, among them a bishop,
   Jacob, in 1002, who preached against the corruptions in the Armenian
   church, but was branded, exposed to public scorn, imprisoned, and at
   last killed by his enemies. [760]

   Little is known of the sect of the Athingians who appeared in Upper
   Phrygia. [761] They seem to have been strongly Judaistic. They observed
   all the rites of the law except circumcision, for which they
   substituted baptism. Neander conjectures, that they were the successors
   of the Colossian errorists opposed by St. Paul.

   § 133. The New Manichaeans in the West.

   I. The chief sources for the sects of the Middle Age belong to the next
   period, namely, the letters of Pope Innocent III., Honorius III.,
   Bernhard of Clairvaux, Peter the Venerable; the acts of Councils; the
   chronicles; and the special writings against them, chiefly those of the
   Dominican monk Reinerius Sacchoni of Lombardy (d. 1259), who was
   himself a heretic for seventeen years. The sources are collected in the
   "Maxima Biblioth. Patr." (Lugd., 1677, Tom. XXII., XXIV.); in Martene
   and Durand's "Thesaurus novus anecdotorum" (Par., 1682); in Muratori's
   "Rerum Italic. Scriptores" (Mediol., 1723 sqq.); in Bouquet's "Recueil
   des historiens des Gaules et de la France" (Par., 1738 sqq.), etc. See

   The heretical sects in the West are chiefly of three distinct classes:
   1) the dualistic or Manichaean; 2) the pantheistic and mystic; 3) the
   biblical (the Waldenses). Widely differing among themselves, they were
   united in hatred of the papal church and the sacerdotal system. They
   arose from various causes: the remains of heathen notions and older
   heresies; opposition to the corruptions of the church and the clergy;
   the revolt of reason against tyrannical authority; and popular thirst
   for the word of God. They spread with astonishing rapidity during the
   twelfth and thirteenth centuries from Bulgaria to Spain, especially
   through Italy and Southern France, and called forth all the energies of
   the papacy at the zenith of its power (under Innocent III.) for their
   forcible suppression. One only survived the crusade, the Waldenses,
   owing to their faithful adherence to the positive truths of the
   Scriptures.

   In the West the heretical tendency in organized form made its first
   appearance during the eleventh century, when the corruption of the
   church and the papacy had reached its height. It appeared to that age
   as a continuation or revival of the Manichaean heresy. [762] The
   connecting link is the dualistic principle. The old Manichaeans were
   never quite extirpated with fire and sword, but continued secretly in
   Italy and France, waiting for a favorable opportunity to emerge from
   obscurity. Nor must we overlook the influence from the East. Paulicians
   were often transported under Byzantine standards from Thrace and
   Bulgaria to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily, and spread the
   seed of their dualism and docetism and hatred of the ruling church.
   [763]

   New Manichaeans were first discovered in Aquitania and Orleans, in
   1022, in Arras, 1025, in Monteforte near Turin, 1030, in Goslar, 1025.
   They taught a dualistic antagonism between God and matter, a docetic
   view of the humanity of Christ, opposed the worship of saints and
   images, and rejected the whole Catholic church with all the material
   means of grace, for which they substituted a spiritual baptism, a
   spiritual eucharist, and a symbol of initiation by the imposition of
   hands. Some resolved the life of Christ into a myth or symbol of the
   divine life in every man. They generally observed an austere code of
   morals, abstained from marriage, animal food, and intoxicating drinks.
   A pallid, emaciated face was regarded by the people as a sign of
   heresy. The adherents of the sect were common people, but among their
   leaders were priests, sometimes in disguise. One of them, Dieudonné,
   precentor of the church in Orleans, died a Catholic; but when three
   years after his death his connection with the heretics was discovered,
   his bones were dug up and removed from consecrated ground.

   The Oriental fashion of persecuting dissenters by the faggot and the
   sword was imitated in the West. The fanatical fury of the people
   supported the priests in their intolerance. Thirteen New Manichaeans
   were condemned to the stake at Orleans in 1022. Similar executions
   occurred in other places. At Milan the heretics were left the choice
   either to bow before the cross, or to die; but the majority plunged
   into the flames.

   A few men rose above the persecuting spirit of the age, following the
   example of St. Martin of Tours, who had vigorously protested against
   the execution of the Priscillianists at Treves. Wazo, bishop of Liège,
   about 1047, raised his voice for toleration when he was asked for his
   opinion concerning the treatment of the heretics in the diocese of
   Châlons-sur-Marne. Such doctrines, he said, must be condemned as
   unchristian; but we are bound to bear with the teachers after the
   example of our Saviour, who was meek and humble and came not to strive,
   but rather to endure shame and the death of the cross. The parable of
   the wheat and the tares teaches us to wait patiently for the repentance
   of erring neighbors. "We bishops," he tells his fellow-bishops, "should
   remember that we did not receive, at our ordination, the sword of
   secular power, the vocation to slay, but only the vocation to make
   alive." All they had to do was to exclude obstinate heretics from the
   communion of the church and to guard others against their dangerous
   doctrines. [764]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [762] Other names, however, were invented to distinguish the different
   branches which were compared to foxes with tails tied together. In the
   time of Innocent III., more than forty heretical names were used, about
   twelve of them for the Manichaean branch, chiefly "Manichaeans,"
   "Catharists," and "Patareni." See Hahn, I. 49 sqq.

   § 135. Literary Character of the Early Middle Ages.

   The prevailing character of this period in sacred learning is a
   faithful traditionalism which saved the remains of the ancient
   classical and Christian literature, and transferred them to a new soil.
   The six centuries which intervene between the downfall of the West
   Roman Empire (476) and the age of Hildebrand (1049-1085), are a period
   of transition from an effete heathen to a new Christian civilization,
   and from patristic to scholastic theology. It was a period of darkness
   with the signs of approaching daylight. The fathers were dead, and the
   schoolmen were not yet born. The best that could be done was to
   preserve the inheritance of the past for the benefit of the future. The
   productive power was exhausted, and gave way to imitation and
   compilation. Literary industry took the place of independent
   investigation.

   The Greek church kept up the connection with classical and patristic
   learning, and adhered closely to the teaching of the Nicene fathers and
   the seven oecumenical councils. The Latin church bowed before the
   authority of St. Augustin and St. Jerome. The East had more learning;
   the West had more practical energy, which showed itself chiefly in the
   missionary field. The Greek church, with her head turned towards the
   past, tenaciously maintains to this day the doctrinal position of the
   eighth century; the Latin church, looking to the future, passed through
   a deep night of ignorance, but gathered new strength from new blood.
   The Greek church presents ancient Christianity at rest; while the Latin
   church of the middle ages is Christianity in motion towards the modern
   era.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 136. Learning in the Eastern Church.

   The Eastern church had the advantage over the Western in the knowledge
   of the Greek language, which gave her direct access to the Greek
   Testament, the Greek classics, and the Greek fathers; but, on the other
   hand, she had to suffer from the Mohammedan invasions, and from the
   intrigues and intermeddling of a despotic court.

   The most flourishing seats of patristic learning, Alexandria and
   Antioch, were lost by the conquests of Islam. The immense library at
   Alexandria was burned by order of Omar (638), who reasoned: "If these
   writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God (the Koran), they are
   useless and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are
   pernicious and ought to be destroyed." [765] In the eighth century,
   however, the Saracens themselves began to cultivate learning, to
   translate Greek authors, to collect large libraries in Bagdad, Cairo,
   and Cordova. The age of Arabic learning continued about five hundred
   years, till the irruption of the Moguls. It had a stimulating effect
   upon the scholarship of the church, especially upon the development of
   scholastic philosophy, through the writings of Averroës of Cordova (d.
   1198), the translator and commentator of Aristotle.

   Constantinople was the centre of the literary, activity of the Greek
   church during the middle ages. Here or in the immediate vicinity
   (Chalcedon, Nicaea) the oecumenical councils were held; here were the
   scholars, the libraries, the imperial patronage, and all the facilities
   for the prosecution of studies. Many a library was destroyed, but
   always replaced again. [766] Thessalonica and Mount Athos were also
   important seats of learning, especially in the twelfth century.

   The Latin was the official language of the Byzantine court, and
   Justinian, who regained, after a divorce of sixty years, the dominion
   of ancient Rome through the valor of Belisarius (536), asserted the
   proud title of Emperor of the Romans, and published his code of laws in
   Latin. But the Greek always was and remained the language of the
   people, of literature, philosophy, and theology.

   Classical learning revived in the ninth century under the patronage of
   the court. The reigns of Caesar Bardas (860-866), Basilius I. the
   Macedonian (867-886), Leo VI. the Philosopher (886-911), who was
   himself an author, Constantine VII. Porphyrogenitus (911-959), likewise
   an author, mark the most prosperous period of Byzantine literature. The
   family of the Comneni, who upheld the power of the sinking empire from
   1057 to 1185, continued the literary patronage, and the Empress Eudocia
   and the Princess Anna Comnena cultivated the art of rhetoric and the
   study of philosophy.

   Even during the confusion of the crusades and the disasters which
   overtook the empire, the love for learning continued; and when
   Constantinople at last fell into the hands of the Turks, Greek
   scholarship took refuge in the West, kindled the renaissance, and
   became an important factor in the preparation for the Reformation.

   The Byzantine literature presents a vast mass of learning without an
   animating, controlling and organizing genius. "The Greeks of
   Constantinople," says Gibbon, [767] with some rhetorical exaggeration,
   "held in their lifeless hands the riches of the fathers, without
   inheriting the spirit which had created and improved that sacred
   patrimony: they read, they praised, they compiled; but their languid
   souls seemed alike incapable of thought and action. In the revolution
   of ten centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity
   or promote the happiness of mankind. Not a single idea has been added
   to the speculative systems of antiquity; and a succession of patient
   disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers of the next
   servile generation. Not a single composition of history, philosophy or
   literature has been saved from oblivion by the intrinsic beauties of
   style or sentiment, of original fancy, and even of successful imitation
   .... The leaders of the Greek church were humbly content to admire and
   copy the oracles of antiquity, nor did the schools or pulpit produce
   any rivals of the fame of Athanasius and Chrysostom."

   The theological controversies developed dialectical skill, a love for
   metaphysical subtleties, and an over-estimate of theoretical orthodoxy
   at the expense of practical piety. The Monotheletic controversy
   resulted in an addition to the christological creed; the iconoclastic
   controversy determined the character of public worship and the relation
   of religion to art.

   The most gifted Eastern divines were Maximus Confessor in the seventh,
   John of Damascus in the eighth, and Photius in the ninth century.
   Maximus, the hero of Monotheletism, was an acute and profound thinker,
   and the first to utilize the pseudo-Dyonysian philosophy in support of
   a mystic orthodoxy. John of Damascus, the champion of image-worship,
   systematized the doctrines of the orthodox fathers, especially the
   three great Cappadocians, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzum, and Gregory of
   Nyssa, and produced a monumental work on theology which enjoys to this
   day the same authority in the Greek church as the "Summa" of Thomas
   Aquinas in the Latin. Photius, the antagonist of Pope Nicolas, was the
   greatest scholar of his age, who read and digested with independent
   judgment all ancient heathen and Christian books on philology,
   philosophy, theology, canon law, history, medicine, and general
   literature. In extent of information and fertility of pen he had a
   successor in Michael Psellus (d. 1106).

   Exegesis was cultivated by Oecumenius in the tenth, Theophylact in the
   eleventh, and Euthymius Zygabenus in the twelfth century. They compiled
   the valuable exegetical collections called "Catenae." [768] Simeon
   Metaphrastes (about 900) wrote legendary biographies and eulogies of
   one hundred and twenty-two saints. Suidas, in the eleventh century,
   prepared a Lexicon, which contains much valuable philological and
   historical information [769] The Byzantine historians, Theophanes,
   Syncellus, Cedrenus, Leo Grammaticus, and others, describe the
   political and ecclesiastical events of the slowly declining empire. The
   most eminent scholar of the twelfth century, was Eustathius, Archbishop
   of Thessalonica, best known as the commentator of Homer, but deserving
   a high place also as a theologian, ecclesiastical ruler, and reformer
   of monasticism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [765] Gibbon (ch. 50) doubts this fact, related by Abulpharagius and
   other Mohammedan authorities; but Von Hammer, Silv. de Sacy, and other
   Oriental scholars accept it as well authenticated. See the note of
   Smith in his edition of Gibbon (vol. V. 358 sq.). The library was
   variously estimated as containing from four to seven hundred thousand
   volumes.

   [766] A library of 120,000 volumes, begun by Constantius and Julian the
   Apostate, was burned by accident under Basiliscus (478). Another
   Constantinopolitan library of 33,000 volumes perished in the reign of
   the iconoclastic Leo the Isaurian, who is made responsible for the
   calamity by Cedrenus and other orthodox historians.

   The Real and the Ficitious Doinysius.

   The tendency to mystic speculation was kept up and nourished chiefly
   through the writings which exhibit a fusion of Neo-Platonism and
   Christianity, and which go under the name of Dionysius Areopagita, the
   distinguished Athenian convert of St. Paul (Acts 17:34). He was,
   according to a tradition of the second century, the first bishop of
   Athens. [770] In the ninth century, when the French became acquainted
   with his supposed writings, he was confounded with St. Denis, the first
   bishop of Paris and patron saint of France, who lived and died about
   two hundred years after the Areopagite. [771] He thus became, by a
   glaring anachronism, the connecting link between Athens and Paris,
   between Greek philosophy and Christian theology, and acquired an almost
   apostolic authority. He furnishes one of the most remarkable examples
   of the posthumous influence of unknown authorship and of the power of
   the dead over the living. For centuries he was regarded as the prince
   of theologians. He represented to the Greek and Latin church the
   esoteric wisdom of the gospel, and the mysterious harmony between faith
   and reason and between the celestial and terrestrial hierarchy.

   Pseudo-Dionysius is a philosophical counterpart of Pseudo-Isidor: both
   are pious frauds in the interest of the catholic system, the one with
   regard to theology, the other with regard to church polity; both
   reflect the uncritical character of mediaeval Christianity; both
   derived from the belief in their antiquity a fictitious importance far
   beyond their intrinsic merits. Doubts were entertained of the
   genuineness of the Areopagitica by Laurentius Valla, Erasmus, and
   Cardinal Cajetan; but it was only in the seventeenth century that the
   illusion of the identity of Pseudo-Dionysius with the apostolic convert
   and the patron-saint of France was finally dispelled by the torch of
   historical criticism. Since that time his writings have lost their
   authority and attraction; but they will always occupy a prominent place
   among the curiosities of literature, and among the most remarkable
   systems of mystic philosophy.

   Authorship.

   Who is the real author of those productions? The writer is called
   simply Dionysius, and only once. [772] He repeatedly mentions an
   unknown Hierotheos, as his teacher; but he praises also "the divine
   Paul," as the spiritual guide of both, and addresses persons who bear
   apostolic names, as Timothy, Titus, Caius, Polycarp, and St. John. He
   refers to a visit he made with Hierotheos, and with James, the brother
   of the Lord (ajdelfovqeo"), and Peter, "the chief and noblest head of
   the inspired apostles," to gaze upon the (dead) body of her (Mary) who
   was "the beginning of life and the recipient of God;" on which occasion
   Hierotheos gave utterance to their feelings in ecstatic hymns. It is
   evident then that he either lived in the apostolic age and its
   surroundings, or that he transferred himself back in imagination to
   that age. [773] The former alternative is impossible. The inflated
   style, the reference to later persons (as Ignatius of Antioch and
   Clement of Alexandria), the acquaintance with Neo-Platonic ideas, the
   appeal to the "old tradition" (ajrcai'a paravdosi") of the church as
   well as the Scriptures, and the elaborate system of church polity and
   ritual which he presupposes, clearly prove his post-apostolic origin.
   He was not known to Eusebius or Jerome or any ecclesiastical author
   before 533. In that year his writings were first mentioned in a
   conference between orthodox bishops and heretical Severians at
   Constantinople under Justinian I. [774] The Severians quoted them as an
   authority for their Monophysitic Christology and against the Council of
   Chalcedon; and in reply to the objection that they were unknown, they
   asserted that Cyril of Alexandria had used them against the Nestorians.
   If this be so, they must have existed before 444, when Cyril died; but
   no trace can be found in Cyril's writings. On the other hand, Dionysius
   presupposes the christological controversies of the fifth century, and
   shows a leaning to Monophysitic views, and a familiarity with the last
   and best representatives of Neo-Platonism, especially with Proclus, who
   died in Athens, a.d. 485. The resemblance is so strong that the
   admirers of Dionysius charged Proclus with plagiarism. [775] The writer
   then was a Christian Neo-Platonist who wrote towards the close of the
   fifth or the beginning of the sixth century in Greece or in Egypt, and
   who by a literary fiction clothed his religious speculations with the
   name and authority of the first Christian bishop of Athens. [776]

   In the same way the pseudo-Clementine writings were assigned to the
   first bishop of Rome.

   The Fortunes of Pseudo-Dionysius.

   Pseudo-Dionysius appears first in the interest of the heretical
   doctrine of one nature and one will in the person of Christ. [777] But
   he soon commended himself even more to orthodox theologians. He was
   commented on by Johannes Scythopolitanus in the sixth century, and by
   St. Maximus Confessor in the seventh. John of Damascus often quotes him
   as high authority. Even Photius, who as a critic doubted the
   genuineness, numbers him among the great church teachers and praises
   his depth of thought. [778]

   In the West the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius were first noticed about
   590 by Pope Gregory I., who probably became acquainted with them while
   ambassador at Constantinople. Pope Hadrian I. mentions them in a letter
   to Charlemagne. The Emperor Michael II. the Stammerer, sent a copy to
   Louis the Pious, 827. Their arrival at St. Denis on the eve of the
   feast of the saint who reposed there, was followed by no less than
   nineteen miraculous cures in the neighborhood. They naturally recalled
   the memory of the patron-saint of France, and were traced to his
   authorship. The emperor instructed Hilduin, the abbot of St. Denis, to
   translate them into Latin; but his scholarship was not equal to the
   task. John Scotus Erigena, the best Greek scholar in the West, at the
   request of Charles the Bald, prepared a literal translation with
   comments, about 850, and praised the author as "venerable alike for his
   antiquity and for the sublimity of the heavenly mysteries" with which
   he dealt. [779] Pope Nicolas I. complained that the work had not been
   sent to him for approval," according to the custom of the church"
   (861); but a few years later Anastasius, the papal librarian, highly
   commended it (c. 865).

   The Areopagitica stimulated an intuitive and speculative bent of mind,
   and became an important factor in the development of scholastic and
   mystic theology. Hugo of St. Victor, Peter the Lombard, Albertus
   Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Robert Grosseteste, and Dionysius Carthusianus
   wrote commentaries on them, and drew from them inspiration for their
   own writings. [780] The Platonists of the Italian renaissance likewise
   were influenced by them.

   Dante places Dionysius among the theologians in the heaven of the sun:


   "Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,

   Which in the flesh below looked most within

   The angelic nature and its ministry." [781]

   Luther called him a dreamer, and this was one of his heretical views
   which the Sorbonne of Paris condemned.

   The Several Writings.

   The Dionysian writings, as far as preserved, are four treatises
   addressed to Timothy, his "fellow-presbyter," namely: 1) On the
   Celestial Hierarchy (peri tes ouranias hierarchias). 2) On the
   Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (peri tes ekklesiastikes hierarchias). 3) On
   the Divine Names (peri theion onomaton). 4) On Mystic Theology (peri
   mustikes theologias). To these are added ten letters addressed to
   various persons of the apostolic age. [782]

   The System of Dionysius.

   These books reveal the same authorship and the same system of mystic
   symbolism, in which Neo-Platonism and Christianity are interwoven. The
   last phase of Hellenic philosophy which heretofore had been hostile to
   the church, is here made subservient to it. The connecting ideas are
   the progressive revelation of the infinite, the hierarchic triads, the
   negative conception of evil, and the striving of man after mystic union
   with the transcendent God. The system is a counterpart of the
   Graeco-Jewish theology, of Philo of Alexandria, who in similar manner
   mingled the Platonic philosophy with the Mosaic religion. The
   Areopagite and Philo teach theology in the garb of philosophy; both
   appeal to Scripture, tradition, and reason; both go behind the letter
   of the Bible and the facts of history to a deeper symbolic and
   allegoric meaning; both adulterate the revealed truths by foreign
   elements. But Philo is confined to the Old Testament, and ignores the
   New, which was then not yet written; while the system of the Areopagite
   is a sort of philosophy of Christianity.

   The Areopagite reverently ascends the heights and sounds the depths of
   metaphysical and religious speculation, and makes the impression of
   profound insight and sublime spirituality; and hence he exerted such a
   charm upon the great schoolmen and mystics of the middle ages. But he
   abounds in repetitions; he covers the poverty of thought with
   high-sounding phrases; he uses the terminology of the Hellenic
   mysteries; [783] and his style is artificial, turgid, involved, and
   monotonous.

   The unity of the Godhead and the hierarchical order of the universe are
   the two leading ideas of the Areopagite. He descends from the divine
   unity through a succession of manifestations to variety, and ascends
   back again to mystic union with God. His text, we may say, is the
   sentence of St. Paul: "From God, and through God, and unto God, are all
   things" (Rom. 11:36).

   He starts from the Neo-Platonic conception of the Godhead, as a being
   which transcends all being and existence [784] and yet is the beginning
   and the end of all existence, as unknowable and yet the source of all
   reason and knowledge, as nameless and inexpressible and yet giving
   names to all things, as a simple unity and yet causing all variety. He
   describes God as "a unity of three persons, who with his loving
   providence penetrates to all things, from super-celestial essences to
   the last things of earth, as being the beginning and cause of all
   beings, beyond all beginning, and enfolding all things transcendentally
   in his infinite embrace." If we would know God, we must go out of
   ourselves and become absorbed in Him. All being proceeds from God by a
   sort of emanation, and tends upward to him.

   The world forms a double hierarchy, that is, as he defines it, "a holy
   order, and science, and activity or energy, assimilated as far as
   possible to the godlike and elevated to the imitation of God in
   proportion to the divine illuminations conceded to it." There are two
   hierarchies, one in heaven, and one on earth, each with three triadic
   degrees.

   The celestial or supermundane hierarchy consists of angelic beings in
   three orders: 1) thrones, cherubim, and seraphim, in the immediate
   presence of God; 2) powers, mights, and dominions; 3) angels (in the
   narrower sense), archangels, and principalities. [785] The first order
   is illuminated, purified and perfected by God, the second order by the
   first, the third by the second.

   The earthly or ecclesiastical hierarchy is a reflex of the heavenly,
   and a school to train us up to the closest possible communion with God.
   Its orders form the lower steps of the heavenly ladder which reaches in
   its summit to the throne of God. It requires sensible symbols or
   sacraments, which, like the parables of our Lord, serve the double
   purpose of revealing the truth to the holy and hiding it from the
   profane. The first and highest triad of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
   are the sacraments of baptism which is called illumination (fwvtisma),
   the eucharist (suvnaxi", gathering, communion), which is the most
   sacred of consecrations, and the holy unction or chrism which
   represents our perfecting. Three other sacraments are mentioned: the
   ordination of priests, the consecration of monks, and the rites of
   burial, especially the anointing of the dead. The three orders of the
   ministry form the second triad. [786] The third triad consists of
   monks, the holy laity, and the catechumens.

   These two hierarchies with their nine-fold orders of heavenly and
   earthly ministrations are, so to speak, the machinery of God's
   government and of his self-communication to man. They express the
   divine law of subordination and mutual dependence of the different
   ranks of beings.

   The Divine Names or attributes, which are the subject of a long
   treatise, disclose to us through veils and shadows the fountain-head of
   all life and light, thought and desire. The goodness, the beauty, and
   the loveliness of God shine forth upon all created things, like the
   rays of the sun, and attract all to Himself. How then can evil exist?
   Evil is nothing real and positive, but only a negation, a defect. Cold
   is the absence of heat, darkness is the absence of light; so is evil
   the absence, of goodness. But how then can God punish evil? For the
   answer to this question the author refers to another treatise which is
   lost. [787]

   The Mystic Theology briefly shows the way by which the human soul
   ascends to mystic union with God as previously set forth under the
   Divine Names. The soul now rises above signs and symbols, above earthly
   conceptions and definitions to the pure knowledge and intuition of God.

   Dionysius distinguishes between cataphatic or affirmative theology)
   [788] and apophatic or negative theology. [789] The former descends
   from the infinite God, as the unity of all names, to the finite and
   manifold; the latter ascends from the finite and manifold to God, until
   it reaches that height of sublimity where it becomes completely
   passive, its voice is stilled, and man is united with the nameless,
   unspeakable, super-essential Being of Beings.

   The ten Letters treat of separate theological or moral topics, and are
   addressed, four to Caius, a monk (therapeutes), one to Dorotheus, a
   deacon (leitourgos), one to Sosipater, a priest (hiereus), one to
   Demophilus, a monk, one to Polycarp (called hierarches, no doubt the
   well-known bishop of Smyrna), one to Titus (hierarches, bishop of
   Crete), and the tenth to John, "the theologian," i.e. the Apostle John
   at Patmos, foretelling his future release from exile.

   Dionysian Legends.

   Two legends of the Pseudo-Dionysian writings have passed in exaggerated
   forms into Latin Breviaries and other books of devotion. One is his
   gathering with the apostles around the death-bed of the Virgin Mary.
   [790] The other is the exclamation of Dionysius when he witnessed at
   Heliopolis in Egypt the miraculous solar eclipse at the time of the
   crucifixion: [791] "Either the God of nature is suffering, or He
   sympathizes with a suffering God." [792] No such sentence occurs in the
   writings of Dionysius as his own utterance; but a similar one is
   attributed by him to the sophist Apollophanes, his fellow-student at
   Heliopolis. [793]

   The Roman Breviary has given solemn sanction, for devotional purposes,
   to several historical errors connected with Dionysius the Areopagite:
   1) his identity with the French St. Denis of the third century; 2) his
   authorship of the books upon "The Names of God," upon "The Orders in
   Heaven and in the Church," upon "The Mystic Theology," and "divers
   others," which cannot have been written before the end of the fifth
   century; 3) his witness of the supernatural eclipse at the time of the
   crucifixion, and his exclamation just referred to, which he himself
   ascribes to Apollophanes. The Breviary also relates that Dionysius was
   sent by Pope Clement of Rome to Gaul with Rusticus, a priest, and
   Eleutherius, a deacon; that he was tortured with fire upon a grating,
   and beheaded with an axe on the 9th day of October in Domitian's reign,
   being over a hundred years old, but that "after his head was cut off,
   he took it in his hands and walked two hundred paces, carrying it all
   the while!" [794]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [770] Dionysius of Corinth (d. 170) in Euseb., Hist. Eccl. III. 4; IV.
   23. So also in Const. Apost. VII. 46. Nothing is said in these passages
   of his martyrdom, which is an uncertain tradition of later date.
   Quadratus, the oldest Christian writer of Athens, makes no mention of
   him. Suidas (eleventh century), in his Lexicon, sub
   DionusioshoAreopagites(Kuster's ed, Cambridge, 1705, vol. I. 598-600),
   says that Dionysius visited Egypt in the reign of Tiberius, witnessed
   with a friend at Heliopolis the extraordinary eclipse of the sun which
   occurred at the time of the crucifixion (comp. the 7th Ep. of Dion.);
   that he was converted by Paul and elected bishop of the Athenians; that
   he excelled in all secular and sacred learning, and was so profound
   that his works seem to be the productions of a celestial and divine
   faculty rather than of a human genius. He knows nothing of the French
   Dionysius.

   [771] According to the oldest authorities (Sulpicius Severus, d. 410,
   and Gregory of Tours, d. 595, see his Hist. Franc. I. 28), the French
   Dionysius belongs to the middle of the third century, and died a martyr
   either under Decius (249-251) or under Aurelian (270-273). Afterwards
   he was put back to the first century. The confusion of the French
   martyr with the Areopagite of the same name is traced to Hilduin, abbot
   of St. Denis, A.D. 835, who at the request of the Emperor Louis the
   Pious compiled an uncritical collection of the traditions concerning
   Dionysius (Areopagitica). Gieseler (II. 103) traces it further back to
   the age of Charlemagne and the Acta Dionys., which were first printed
   in the Acta Sanct. mens. Oct. IV. 792. After that time it was currently
   believed that Dionysius was sent by Pope Clement of Rome to Gaul with
   twelve companions, or (according to another tradition) with a presbyter
   Rusticus, and a deacon Eleutherius, and that he suffered martyrdom with
   them under Domitian. His identity with the Areopagite became almost an
   article of faith; and when Abélard dared to call it in question, he was
   expelled from St. Denis as a dangerous heretic. It has been
   conclusively disproved by Launoy, Sirmond, Morinus, Le Nourry, Daillé;
   and yet it still finds defenders among French Catholics, e.g. the
   Archbishop Darboy of Paris, who was shot by the Commune in May, 1871.
   The Abbé Dulac thus epigrammatically expresses this exploded tradition
   (Oeuvres de Saint Denis, 1865, p. 13): "Né dans Athènes, Lutèce
   d'Orient, il meurt à Lutèce, Athènes d'Occident; successivement epoux
   de deux églises, dont l'une possédera son borceau, et l'autre sa tombe.
   Montmartre vaudra la colline de Mars."

   [772] In Ep. VII. 3, where Agollophanes addresses him: "O Dionysius."

   [773] Hipler and Boehmer assume that those names do not refer to the
   well-known apostolic characters, but this is untenable.

   [774] See the Collatio Catholicorum cum Severianis in Mansi, VIII. 817
   sqq., and an account of the conference in Walch's Ketzergeschichte, VII
   134 sqq.

   [775] Westcott asserts (p. 6) that the coincidences with Damascius, the
   second in succession from Proclus, and the last Platonic teacher at
   Athens, are even more remarkable. He was of Syrian origin.

   [776] Different conjectures as to the author, time and place of
   composition: 1) A pseudonymous Dionysius (of Egypt) at the end of the
   fifth century. Gieseler, Engelhardt, Dorner, and others. 2) Dionysius
   of Alexandria, d. 265. Baratier. 3) Another Dionysius of the fourth
   century. 4) During the Eutychian and Nestorian controversies. Le
   Nourry. 5) A Pseudo-Dionysius of the third century, who wished to
   introduce the Eleusynian mysteries into the church. Baumgarten Crusius.
   6) Apollinaris the elder, d. 360. 7) Apollinaris the younger, d. 370.
   Laurentius Valla. 8) Synesius of Ptolemais, c. 410. La Croze. 9) Peter
   Gnapheus or Fullo, patriarch of Constantinople. Le Quien. 10) A writer
   in Edessa, or under the influence of the Edessene school, between 480
   and 520. Westcott.--See the Prolegomena of Le Nourry, De Rubeis,
   Corderius, in the first vol. of Migne's ed., and Lupton, l.c.

   [777] The Monothelites appealed to a passage in Ep. IV. ad Caium. See
   Hefele, III. 127 sq. Dorner (II. 196 sqq.) correctly represents the
   mystic Christology of Pseudo-Dionysius as a connecting link between
   Monophysitism and the orthodox dogma.

   [778] The first book which he notices in his "Bibliotheca" (about 845)
   is a defense of the genuineness of the Dionysian writings by a
   presbyter Theodorus, who mentions four objections: 1) they were unknown
   to the earlier fathers; 2) they are not mentioned in the catalogues of
   writing by Eusebius; 3) they are filled with comments on church
   traditions which grew by degrees long after the apostolic age; 4) they
   quote an epistle of Ignatius, written on his way to martyrdom under
   Trojan. Photius seems to think that the objections are stronger than
   the answers of Theodorus. See Neander, III. 170; Westcott, l.c. p. 4,
   and Hergenroether, Photius, III. 29 and 331.

   [779] Other Latin versions were made afterwards by Johannes Sarracinus
   in the twelfth century, by Ambrosius Camaldulensis in the fifteenth, by
   Corderius in the seventeenth.

   [780] St. Thomas, the "Angelic Doctor," is so full of quotations from
   Dionysius that Corderius says, he drew from him "totam fere doctrinam
   theologicam." Migne I. 96.

   [781] Paradiso, X. 115.

   [782] An eleventh letter which exists only in Latin (said to have been
   written by Scotus Erigena), and a Latin Liturgy of Dionysius (published
   by Renaudot and in Migne's ed. I. 1123-1132), are spurious.

   [783] As for the three stages of spiritual ascent, katharsis, muesis,
   teleiosis, and the verb epopteuesthai,i.e. to be admitted to the
   highest grade at mysteries, to become an epoptesor mustes. For other
   rare words see the vocabulary of Dion. in Migne, I. 1134 sqq., and II.
   23 sqq.

   [784] to `hon huperousion, das ueberseiende Sein.

   [785] Or, in the descending order, they are: (a) seraphim, cheroubim,
   thronoi. (b) kuriotetes, dunameis , exousiai. (c) archai, archangeloi,
   angeloi. Five of these orders are derived from St. Paul, Eph. 1:21
   (arche, exousia, dunamis, kuriotes), and Col. 1:16 (thronoi,
   kuriotetes. archai, exousiai); the other four (seraphim, cheroubim,
   archangeloi, angeloi) are likewise biblical designations of angelic
   beings, but nowhere mentioned in this order. Thomas Aquinas, in his
   doctrine of angels, closely follows Dionysius, quoting him literally,
   or more frequently interpreting his meaning. Dante introduced the three
   celestial triads into his Divina Commedia (Paradiso, Canto XXVIII. 97
   sqq.): "These orders upward all of them are gazing, And downward so
   prevail, that unto God They all attracted are and all attract. And
   Dionysius with so great desire To contemplate these orders set himself,
   He named them and distinguished them as I do." (Longfellow's
   translation .)

   [786] They are not called bishop, priest, and deacon, but hierarches,
   hiereus, and leitourgos. Yet Dionysius writes to Timothy as presbuteros
   to sumpresbutero.

   [787] Peri dikaiou kai `theiou dikaioteriou.

   [788] kataphatikos, affirmative from kataphasko(kataphemi), to affirm

   [789] apophatikos, negative, from apophasko(apophemi), to deny.

   [790] See above p. 592, and Peritheiononomat. cap. III. 2. (ed. of
   Migne, I. 682 sq.) Comp. the lengthy discussion of Baronius, Annal. ad
   ann. 48. In this connection St. Peter is called by Dionysius
   koruphaiakaipresbutatetontheologonakrotes(suprema ista atque
   antiquissima summitas theologorum). Corderius (see Migne I, 686)
   regards this as "firmissimum argumentum pro primatu Petri d
   consequeenter (?) Pontificum Romanorumm ejusdem successorum."

   [791] Matt. 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44. See the notes in Lange, on
   Matthew, p. 525 (Am. ed.).

   [792] The exclamation is variously given:
   hoagnostosensarkipascheitheosby Syngelus); or e totheionpaschei, e to
   paschontisumpaschei ("Aut Deus patitur, aut patienti compatitur"), or,
   as the Roman Breviary has it: "Aut Deus naturae patitur, aut mundi
   machina dissolvitur," "Either the God of nature is suffering, or the
   fabric of the world is breaking up." See Corderius in his annotations
   to Ep. VII., in Migne, I. 1083, and Halloix, in Vita S. Dion., ibid.
   II. 698. The exclamation of Dionysius is sometimes (even by so accurate
   a scholar as Dr. Westcott, l.c., p. 8) erroneously traced to the 7th
   Ep. of Dion., as a response to the exclamation of Apollophanes.

   [793] In Ep. VII. 2, where Dionysius asks Polycarp to silence the
   objections of Apollophanes to Christianity and to remind him of that
   incident when be exclaimed: tauta, o kale Dionusie, theion amoibai
   pragmaton, "Istae O praeclare Dionysi, divinarum sunt vicissitudines
   rerum." The same incident is alluded to in the spurious eleventh letter
   addressed to Apollophanes himself. So Suidas also gives the exclamation
   of Apollophanes, sub verbo Dion.

   [794] Brev. Rom. for Oct. 9, in the English ed. of the Marquess of
   Bute, vol. II. 1311. Even Alban Butler, in his Lives of the Saints
   (Oct. 9), rejects the fable of the identity of the two Dionysii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 138. Prevailing Ignorance in the Western Church.

   The ancient Roman civilization began to decline soon after the reign of
   the Antonines, and was overthrown at last by the Northern barbarians.
   The treasures of literature and art were buried, and a dark night
   settled over Europe. The few scholars felt isolated and sad. Gregory,
   of Tours (540-594) complains, in the Preface to his Church History of
   the Franks, that the study of letters had nearly perished from Gaul,
   and that no man could be found who was able to commit to writing the
   events of the times. [795]

   "Middle Ages" and "Dark Ages" have become synonymous terms. The tenth
   century is emphatically called the iron age, or the saeculum obscurum.
   [796] The seventh and eighth were no better. [797] Corruption of morals
   went hand in hand with ignorance. It is re-ported that when the papacy
   had sunk to the lowest depth of degradation, there was scarcely a
   person in Rome who knew the first elements of letters. We hear
   complaints of priests who did not know even the Lord's Prayer and the
   Creed. If we judge by the number of works, the seventh, eighth and
   tenth centuries were the least productive; the ninth was the most
   productive; there was a slight increase of productiveness in the
   eleventh over the tenth, a much greater one in the twelfth, but again a
   decline in the thirteenth century. [798]

   But we must not be misled by isolated facts into sweeping generalities.
   For England and Germany the tenth century was in advance of the ninth.
   In France the eighth and ninth centuries produced the seeds of a new
   culture which were indeed covered by winter frosts, but not destroyed,
   and which bore abundant fruit in the eleventh and twelfth.

   Secular and sacred learning was confined to the clergy and the monks.
   The great mass of the laity, including the nobility, could neither read
   nor write, and most contracts were signed with the mark of the cross.
   Even the Emperor Charlemagne wrote only with difficulty. The people
   depended for their limited knowledge on the teaching of a poorly
   educated priesthood. But several emperors and kings, especially
   Charlemagne and Alfred, were liberal patrons of learning and even
   contributors to literature.

   Scarcity of Libraries.

   One of the chief causes of the prevailing ignorance was the scarcity of
   books. The old libraries were destroyed by ruthless barbarians and the
   ravages of war. After the conquest of Alexandria by the Saracens, the
   cultivation and exportation of Egyptian papyrus ceased, and parchment
   or vellum, which took its place, was so expensive that complete copies
   of the Bible cost as much as a palace or a farm. King Alfred paid eight
   acres of land for one volume of a cosmography. Hence the custom of
   chaining valuable books, which continued even to the sixteenth century.
   Hence also the custom of erasing the original text of manuscripts of
   classical works, to give place to worthless monkish legends and ascetic
   homilies. Even the Bible was sometimes submitted to this process, and
   thus "the word of God was made void by the traditions of men." [799]

   The libraries of conventual and cathedral schools were often limited to
   half a dozen or a dozen volumes, such as a Latin Bible or portions of
   it, the liturgical books, some works of St. Augustin and St. Gregory,
   Cassiodorus and Boëthius, the grammars of Donatus and Priscianus, the
   poems of Virgil and Horace. Most of the books had to be imported from
   Italy, especially from Rome.

   The introduction of cotton paper in the tenth or eleventh century, and
   of linen paper in the twelfth, facilitated the multiplication of books.
   [800]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [795] In Migne's ed., Tom. LXXIX. 159.

   [796] According to the terminology of Cave and others, the 7th century
   is called Saeculum Monotheleticum; the eighth, S. Eiconoclasticum; the
   ninth, S. Photianum; the eleventh, S. Hildebrandinum; the twelfth, S.
   Waldenses; the thirteenth, S. Scholasticum; the fourteenth, S.
   Wicklevianum; the fifteenth, S. Synodale; the sixteenth, S.
   Reformationis. All one-sided or wrong except the last. Historical
   periods do not run parallel with centuries.

   [797] Hallam (Lit. of Europe, etc., ch. 1, § 10) puts the seventh and
   eighth centuries far beneath the tenth as to illumination in France,
   and quotes Meiners who makes the same assertion in regard to Germany.
   Guizot dates French civilization from the tenth century; but it began
   rather with Charlemagne in the eighth.

   [798] In Migne's Patrologia Latina the number of volumes which contain
   the works of Latin writers, is as follows: Writers of the seventh
   century, Tom. 80--88           8 vols.      "     "  "  eighth
   "         "    89--96           7  "      "     "  "  ninth
   "         "    97--130         33 "      "     "  "  tenth
   "         "    131-138         7  "      "     "  "  eleventh
   "         "    139-151        12 "      "     "  "  twelfth
   "         "    152-191         39 "      "     "  "  thirteenth
   "         "    192-217         25 " None of these centuries comes up to
   the Nicene and post-Nicene ages. Migne gives to Augustine alone 12, and
   to Jerome 11 volumes, and both of these were no compilers, but original
   writers. The contrast between the literary poverty of the middle ages
   and the exuberant riches of the sixteenth or nineteenth century is
   still greater; but of course the invention of the art of printing and
   all the modern facilities of education must be taken into account.

   [799] One of the most important uncial manuscripts of the Scriptures,
   the Codex Ephraem (C), is a palimpsest (codex rescriptus), but the
   original text can with difficulty be deciphered, and has been published
   by Tischendorf (Lipsiae, 1843). See Schaff's Companion to the Greek
   Testament, p. 120 sq., and Gregory's Prolegomena to Tischendorf's
   eighth critical ed. of the Gr. Test. (Leipzig, 1884), I. 366 sq.

   [800] The oldest manuscript on cotton paper in the British Museum is
   dated 1049; the oldest in the National Library of Paris, 1050. The
   oldest dated specimen of linen paper is said to be a treaty of peace
   between the kings of Aragon and Castile of 1177.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 139. Educational Efforts of the Church.

   The mediaeval church is often unjustly charged with hostility to
   secular learning. Pope Gregory I. is made responsible for the
   destruction of the Bibliotheca Palatina and the classical statues in
   Rome. But this rests on an unreliable tradition of very late date.
   [801] Gregory was himself, next to Isidore of Seville (on whom he
   conferred the pall, in 599), the best scholar and most popular writer
   of his age, and is lauded by his biographers and Gregory of Tours as a
   patron of learning. If he made some disparaging remarks about Latin
   grammar and syntax, in two letters addressed to bishops, they must be
   understood as a protest against an overestimate of these lower studies
   and of heathen writers, as compared with higher episcopal duties, and
   with that allegorical interpretation of the Bible which he carried to
   arbitrary excess in his own exposition of Job. [802] In the Commentary
   on Kings ascribed to him, he commends the study of the liberal arts as
   a useful and necessary means for the proper understanding of the
   Scriptures, and refers in support to the examples of Moses, Isaiah, and
   St. Paul. [803] We may say then that he was an advocate of learning and
   art, but in subordination and subserviency to the interests of the
   Catholic church. This has been the attitude of the papal chair ever
   since. [804]

   The preservation and study of ancient literature during the entire
   mediaeval period are due chiefly to the clergy and monks, and a few
   secular rulers. The convents were the nurseries of manuscripts.

   The connection with classical antiquity was never entirely broken.
   Boëthius (beheaded at Pavia, c. 525), and Cassiodorus (who retired to
   the monastery, of Viviers, and died there about 570), both statesmen
   under Theodoric, the Ostrogothic king of Italy, form the connecting
   links between ancient and mediaeval learning. They were the last of the
   old Romans; they dipped the pen of Cicero and Seneca in barbaric ink,
   [805] and stimulated the rising energies of the Romanic and Germanic
   nations: Boëthius by his "Consolation of Philosophy" (written in
   prison), [806] Cassiodorus by his encyclopedic "Institutes of Divine
   Letters," a brief introduction to the profitable study of the Holy
   Scriptures. [807] The former looked back to Greek philosophy; the
   latter looked forward to Christian theology. The influence of their
   writings was enhanced by the scarcity of books beyond their intrinsic
   merits.

   Boëthius has had the singular fortune of enjoying the reputation of a
   saint and martyr who was put to death, not for alleged political
   treason, but for defending orthodoxy against the Arianism of Theodoric.
   He is assigned by Dante to the fourth heaven in company with Albertus
   Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Gratian, Peter the Lombard, Dionysius the
   Areopagite, and other great teachers of the church:


   "The saintly soul that maketh manifest

   The world's deceitfulness to all who hear well,

   Is feasting on the sight of every good.

   The body, whence it was expelled, is lying

   Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom

   And exile rose the soul to such a peace." [808]

   And yet it is doubtful whether Boëthius was a Christian at all. He was
   indeed intimate with Cassiodorus and lived in a Christian atmosphere,
   which accounts for the moral elevation of his philosophy. But, if we
   except a few Christian phrases, [809] his "Consolation" might almost
   have been written by a noble heathen of the school of Plato or Seneca.
   It is an echo of Greek philosophy; it takes an optimistic view of life;
   it breathes a beautiful spirit of resignation and hope, and derives
   comfort from a firm belief in God; in an all-ruling providence, and in
   prayer, but is totally silent about Christ and his gospel. [810] It is
   a dialogue partly in prose and partly in verse between the author and
   philosophy in the garb of a dignified woman (who sets as his celestial
   guide, like Dante's Beatrice). The work enjoyed an extraordinary
   popularity throughout the middle ages, and was translated into several
   languages, Greek, Old High German (by Notker of St. Gall), Anglo-Saxon
   (by King Alfred), Norman English (by Chaucer), French (by Meun), and
   Hebrew (by Ben Banshet). Gibbon admires it all the more for its
   ignoring Christianity, and calls it "a golden volume not unworthy of
   the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from
   the barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The
   celestial guide whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now
   condescended to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to
   pour into his wounds her salutary balm .... From the earth Boëthius
   ascended to heaven in search of the Supreme Good; explored the
   metaphysical labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and
   freewill, of time and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile
   the perfect attributes of Deity with the apparent disorders of his
   moral and physical government." [811]

   Greek And Hebrew Learning.

   The original languages of the Scriptures were little understood in the
   West. The Latin took the place of the Greek as a literary and sacred
   language, and formed a bond of union among scholars of different
   nationalities. As a spoken language it rapidly degenerated under the
   influx of barbaric dialects, but gave birth in the course of time to
   the musical Romanic languages of Southern Europe.

   The Hebrew, which very few of the fathers (Origen and Jerome) had
   understood, continued to live in the Synagogue, and among eminent
   Jewish grammarians and commentators of the Old Testament; but it was
   not revived in the Christian Church till shortly before the
   Reformation. Very few of the divines of our period (Isidore, and,
   perhaps, Scotus Erigena), show any trace of Hebrew learning.

   The Greek, which had been used almost exclusively, even by writers of
   the Western church, till the time of Tertullian and Cyprian, gave way
   to the Latin. Hence the great majority of Western divines could not
   read even the New Testament in the original. Pope Gregory did not know
   Greek, although he lived several years as papal ambassador in
   Constantinople. The same is true of most of the schoolmen down to the
   sixteenth century.

   But there were not a few honorable exceptions. [812] The Monotheletic
   and Iconoclastic controversies brought the Greek and the Latin churches
   into lively contact. The conflict between Photius and Nicolas
   stimulated Latin divines to self-defence.

   As to Italy, the Greek continued to be spoken in the Greek colonies in
   Calabria and Sicily down to the eleventh century. Boëthius was familiar
   with the Greek philosophers. Cassiodorus often gives the Greek
   equivalents for Latin technical terms. [813]

   Several popes of this period were Greeks by birth, as Theodore I.
   (642), John VI. (701), John VII. (705), Zachary (741); while others
   were Syrians, as John V. (685), Sergius I. (687), Sisinnius (708),
   Constantine I. (708), Gregory III. (731). Zachary translated Gregory's
   "Dialogues" from Latin into Greek. Pope Paul I. (757-768) took pains to
   spread a knowledge of Greek and sent several Greek books, including a
   grammar, some works of Aristotle, and Dionysius the Areopagite, to King
   Pepin of France. He provided Greek service for several monks who had
   been banished from the East by the iconoclastic emperor Copronymus.
   Anastasius, librarian of the Vatican, translated the canons of the
   eighth general Council of Constantinople (869) into Latin by order of
   Pope Hadrian II. [814]

   Isidore of Seville (d. 636) mentions a learned Spanish bishop, John of
   Gerona, who in his youth had studied seven years in Constantinople. He
   himself quotes in his "Etymologies" from many Greek authors, and is
   described as "learned in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew."

   Ireland was for a long time in advance of England, and sent learned
   missionaries to the sister island as well as to the Continent. That
   Greek was not unknown there, is evident from Scotus Erigena.

   England derived her knowledge of Greek from Archbishop Theodore, who
   was a native of Tarsus, educated in Athens and appointed by the pope to
   the see of Canterbury (a.d. 668). [815] He and his companion Hadrian,
   [816] an Italian abbot of African descent, spread Greek learning among
   the clergy. Bede says that some of their disciples were living in his
   day who were as well versed in Greek and Latin as in their native
   Saxon. Among these must be mentioned Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne, and
   Tobias, bishop of Rochester (d. 726). [817] The Venerable Bede (d. 735)
   gives evidence of Greek knowledge in his commentaries, [818] his
   references to a Greek Codex of the Acts of the Apostles, and especially
   in his book on the Art of Poetry. [819] In France, Greek began to be
   studied under Charles the Great. Alcuin (d. 804) brought some knowledge
   of it from his native England, but his references may all have been
   derived from Jerome and Cassiodorus. [820] Paulus Diaconus frequently
   uses Greek words. Charlemagne himself learned Greek, and the Libri
   Carolini show a familiarity with the details of the image-controversy
   of the Greek Church. His sister Giesela, who was abbess of Challes near
   Paris, uses a few Greek words in Latin letters, [821] in her
   correspondence with Alcuin, though these may have been derived from the
   Latin.

   The greatest Greek scholar of the ninth century, and of the whole
   period in the West was John Scotus Erigena (850), who was of Irish
   birth and education, but lived in France at the court of Charles the
   Bald. He displays his knowledge in his Latin books, translated the
   pseudo-Dionysian writings, and attempted original Greek composition.

   In Germany, Rabanus Maurus, Haymo of Halberstadt, and Walafrid Strabo
   had some knowledge of Greek, but not sufficient to be of any material
   use in the interpretation of the Scriptures.

   The Course of Study. [822]

   Education was carried on in the cathedral and conventual schools, and
   these prepared the way for the Universities which began to be founded
   in the twelfth century.

   The course of secular learning embraced the so-called seven liberal
   arts, namely, grammar, dialectics (logic), rhetoric, music, arithmetic,
   geometry, and astronomy. The first three constituted the Trivium, the
   other four the Quadrivium. [823] Seven, three, and four were all
   regarded as sacred numbers. The division is derived from St. Augustin,
   [824] and was adopted by Boëthius and Cassiodorus. The first and most
   popular compend of the middle ages was the book of Cassiodorus, De
   Septem Disciplinis. [825]

   These studies were preparatory to sacred learning, which was based upon
   the Latin Bible and the Latin fathers.

   The Chief Theologians.

   A few divines embraced all the secular and religious knowledge of their
   age. In Spain, Isidore of Seville (d. 636) was the most learned man at
   the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh century. His
   twenty books of "Origins" or "Etymologies" embrace the entire contents
   of the seven liberal arts, together with theology, jurisprudence,
   medicine, natural history, etc., and show familiarity with Plato,
   Aristotle, Boëthius, Demosthenes, Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Anacreon,
   Herodotus, Cicero, Horace, Virgil, Ovid, Terence, Juvenal, Caesar,
   Livy, Sallust. [826] The Venerable Bede occupied the same height of
   encyclopaedic knowledge a century later. Alcuin was the leading divine
   of the Carolingian age. From his school proceeded RABANUS MAURUS, the
   founder of learning and higher education in Germany. [827] Scotus
   Erigena (d. about 877) was a marvel not only of learning, but also of
   independent thought, in the reign of Charles the Bald, and showed, by
   prophetic anticipation, the latent capacity of the Western church for
   speculative theology. [828] With Berengar and Lanfranc, in the middle
   of the eleventh century, dialectical skill was applied in opposing and
   defending the dogma of transubstantiation. [829] The doctrinal
   controversies about adoptionism, predestination, and the real presence
   stimulated the study of the Scriptures and of the fathers, and kept
   alive the intellectual activity.

   Biblical Studies.

   The literature of the Latin church embraced penitential books,
   homilies, annals, translations, compilations, polemic discussions, and
   commentaries. The last are the most important, but fall far below the
   achievements of the fathers and reformers.

   Exegesis was cultivated in an exclusively practical and homiletical
   spirit and aim by Gregory the Great, Isidore, Bede, Alcuin, Claudius of
   Turin, Paschasius Radbertus, Rabanus Maurus, Haymo, Walafrid Strabo,
   and others. The Latin Vulgate was the text, and the Greek or Hebrew
   seldom referred to. Augustin and Jerome were the chief sources.
   Charlemagne felt the need of a revision of the corrupt text of the
   Vulgate, and entrusted Alcuin with the task. The theory of a verbal
   inspiration was generally accepted, and opposed only by Agobard of
   Lyons who confined inspiration to the sense and the arguments, but not
   to the "ipsa corporalia verba."

   The favorite mode of interpretation was the spiritual, that is,
   allegorical and mystical. The literal, that is, grammatico-historical
   exegesis was neglected. The spiritual interpretation was again divided
   into three ramifications: the allegorical proper, the moral, and the
   anagogical [830] corresponding to the three cardinal virtues of the
   Christian: the first refers to faith (credenda), the second to practice
   or charity (agenda), the third to hope (speranda, desideranda). Thus
   Jerusalem means literally or historically, the city in Palestine;
   allegorically, the church; morally, the believing soul; anagogically,
   the heavenly Jerusalem. The fourfold sense was expressed in the
   memorial verse:


   "Litera Gesta docet; quid Credas, Allegoria;

   Moralis, quid Agas; quo Tendas, Anagogia."

   Notes.

   St. Eucherius, bishop of Lyons, who was first (like Cyprian, and
   Ambrose) a distinguished layman, and father of four children, before he
   became a monk, and then a bishop, wrote in the middle of the fifth
   century (he died c. 450) a brief manual of mediaeval hermeneutics under
   the title Liber Formularum Spiritalis Intelligentiae (Rom., 1564, etc.,
   in Migne's "Patrol." Tom. 50, col. 727-772). This work is often quoted
   by Bede and is sometimes erroneously ascribed to him. Eucherius shows
   an extensive knowledge of the Bible and a devout spirit. He anticipates
   many favorite interpretations of mediaeval commentators and mystics. He
   vindicates the allegorical method from the Scripture itself, and from
   its use of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic expressions which can not
   be understood literally. Yet he allows the literal sense its proper
   place in history as well as the moral and mystical. He identifies the
   Finger of God (Digitus Dei) with the Spirit of God (cap. 2; comp. Luke
   11:20 with Matt. 12:28), and explains the several meanings of Jerusalem
   (ecclesia, vel anima, cap. 10), ark (caro Dominica, corda sanctorum Deo
   plena, ecclesia intra quam salvanda clauduntur), Babylon (mundus, Roma,
   inimici), fures (haeretici et pseudoprophetae, gentes, vitia),
   chirographum, pactum, praeputium, circumcisio, etc. In the last chapter
   he treats of the symbolical significance of numbers, as 1=Divine Unity;
   2=the two covenants, the two chief commandments; 3=the trinity in
   heaven and on earth (he quotes the spurious passage 1 John 5:7);
   4="the" four Gospels, the four rivers of Paradise; 5=the five books of
   Moses, five loaves, five wounds of Christ (John 20:25); 6="the" days of
   creation, the ages of the world; 7=the day of rest, of perfection;
   8=the day of resurrection; 10=the Decalogue; 12=the Apostles, the
   universal multitude of believers, etc.

   The theory of the fourfold interpretation was more fully developed by
   Rabanus Maurus (776-856), in his curious book, Allegoriae in Universam
   Sacram Scripturam (Opera, ed. Migne, Tom. VI. col. 849-1088). He calls
   the four senses the four daughters of wisdom, by whom she nourishes her
   children, giving to beginners drink in lacte historiae, to the
   believers food in pane allegoriae, to those engaged in good works
   encouragement in refectione tropologiae, to those longing for heavenly
   rest delight in vino anagogiae. He also gives the following definition
   at the beginning of the treatise: "Historia ad aptam rerum gestarum
   narrationem pertinet, quae et in superficie litterae continetur, et sic
   intelligitur sicut legitur. Allegoria vero aliquid in se plus continet,
   quod per hoc quod locus [loquens] de rei veritate ad quiddam dat
   intelligendum de fidei puritate, et sanctae Ecclesiae mysteria, sive
   praesentia, sive futura, aliud dicens, aliud significans, semper autem
   figmentis et velatis ostendit. Tropologia quoque et ipsa, sicut
   allegoria, in figuratis, sive dictis, sive factis, constat: sed in hoc
   ab allegoria distat quod Allegoria quidem fidem, Tropologia vero
   aedificat moralitem. Anagogia autem, sive velatis, sive apertis dictis,
   de aeternis supernae patriae gaudiis constat, et quae merces vel fidem
   rectam, vel vitam maneat sanctam, verbis vel opertis, vel apertis
   demonstrat. Historia namque perfectorum exempla quo narrat, legentem ad
   imitationem sanctitatis excitat; Allegoria in fidei revelatione ad
   cognitionem veritatis; Tropologia in instructione morum ad amorem
   virtutis; Anagogia in manifestatione sempiternorum gaudiorum ad
   desiderium aeternae felicitatis. In nostrae ergo animae domo Historia
   fundamentum ponit; Allegoria parietes erigit; Anagogia tectum supponit;
   Tropologia vero tam interius per affectum quam exterius per effectum
   boni operis, variis ornatibus depingit."

   [801] The testimony of John of Salisbury in the twelfth century (c.

   and is justly rejected by Bayle (Diction.), Heeren (I. 66),
   Gregorovius, Neander (III. 150 sq. , Baur (Dogmengesch. II. 4), and
   Ebert (I. 525). Gieseler (I. 490 sq.) speaks of "the monkish contempt

   § 140. Patronage of Letters by Charles the Great, and Charles the Bald.

   Comp. §§ 56, 90, 134 (pp. 236, 390, 584).

   Charlemagne stands out like a far-shining beacon-light in the darkness
   of his age. He is the founder of a new era of learning, as well as of a
   new empire. He is the pioneer of French and German civilization. Great
   in war, he was greater still as a legislator and promoter of the arts
   of peace. He clearly saw that religion and education are the only solid
   and permanent basis of a state. In this respect he rose far above
   Alexander the Great and Caesar, and is unsurpassed by Christian rulers.

   He invited the best scholars from Italy and England to his
   court,--Peter of Pisa, Paul Warnefrid, Paulinus of Aquileia, Theodulph
   of Orleans, Alcuin of York. [831] They formed a sort of royal academy
   of sciences and arts, and held literary symposiacs. Each member bore a
   nom de plume borrowed from the Bible or classic lore: the king presided
   as "David" or "Solomon"; Alcuin, a great admirer of Horace and Virgil,
   was "Flaccus" Angilbert (his son-in-law) was "Homerus"; Einhard (his
   biographer), "Bezaleel," after the skilful artificer of the Tabernacle
   (Ex. 31:2); Wizo, "Candidus"; Arno, "Aquila"; Fredegisus, "Nathanael";
   Richbod, "Macarius," etc. Even ladies were not excluded: the emperor's
   sister, Gisela, under the name "Lucia"; his learned cousin, Gundrad, as
   "Eulalia;" his daughter, Rotrude, as "Columba." He called Alcuin, whom
   he first met in Italy (781), his own "beloved teacher," and he was
   himself his most docile pupil. He had an insatiable thirst for
   knowledge, and put all sorts of questions to him in his letters, even
   on the most difficult problems of theology. He learned in the years of
   his manhood the art of writing, the Latin grammar, a little Greek (that
   he might compare the Latin Testament with the original), and acquired
   some knowledge of rhetoric, dialectics, mathematics and astronomy. He
   delighted in reading the poets and historians of ancient Rome, and
   Augustin's "City of God." He longed for a dozen Jeromes and Augustins,
   but Alcuin told him to be content since the Creator of heaven and earth
   had been pleased to give to the world only two such giants. He had some
   share in the composition of the Libri Carolini, which raised an
   enlightened protest against the superstition of image-worship. Poems
   are also attributed to him or to his inspiration. He ordered Paul
   Warnefrid (Paulus Diaconus) to prepare a collection of the best
   homilies of the Latin fathers for the use of the churches, and
   published it with a preface in which he admonished the clergy to a
   diligent study of the Scriptures. Several Synods held during his reign
   (813) at Rheims, Tours, Chalons, Mainz, ordered the clergy to keep a
   Homiliarium and to translate the Latin sermons clearly into rusticam
   Romanam linguam aut Theotiscam, so that all might understand them.

   Charles aimed at the higher education not only of the clergy, but also
   of the higher nobility, and state officials. His sons and daughters
   were well informed. He issued a circular letter to all the bishops and
   abbots of his empire (787), urging them to establish schools in
   connection with cathedrals and convents. At a later period he rose even
   to the grand but premature scheme of popular education, and required in
   a capitulary (802) that every parent should send his sons to school
   that they might learn to read. Theodulph of Orleans (who died 821)
   directed the priests of his diocese to hold school in every town and
   village, [832] to receive the pupils with kindness, and not to ask pay,
   but to receive only voluntary gifts.

   The emperor founded the Court or Palace School (Schola Palatina) for
   higher education and placed it under the direction of Alcuin. [833] It
   was an imitation of the Paedagogium ingenuorum of the Roman emperors.
   It followed him in his changing residence to Aix-la-Chapelle, Worms,
   Frankfurt, Mainz, Regensburg, Ingelheim, Paris. It was not the
   beginning of the Paris University, which is of much later date, but the
   chief nursery of educated clergymen, noblemen and statesmen of that
   age. It embraced in its course of study all the branches of secular and
   sacred learning. [834] It became the model of similar schools, old and
   new, at Tours, Lyons, Orleans, Rheims, Chartres, Troyes, Old Corbey and
   New Corbey, Metz, St. Gall, Utrecht, Lüttich. [835] The rich literature
   of the Carolingian age shows the fruits of this imperial patronage and
   example. It was, however, a foreign rather than a native product. It
   was neither French nor German, but essentially Latin, and so far
   artificial. Nor could it be otherwise; for the Latin classics, the
   Latin Bible, and the Latin fathers were the only accessible sources of
   learning, and the French and German languages were not yet organs of
   literature. This fact explains the speedy decay, as well as the
   subsequent revival in close connection with the Roman church.

   The creations of Charlemagne were threatened with utter destruction
   during the civil wars of his weak successors. But Charles the Bald, a
   son of Louis the Pious, and king of France (843-877), followed his
   grandfather in zeal for learning, and gave new lustre to the Palace
   School at Paris under the direction of John Scotus Erigena, whom he was
   liberal enough to protect, notwithstanding his eccentricities. The
   predestinarian controversy, and the first eucharistic controversy took
   place during his reign, and called forth a great deal of intellectual
   activity and learning, as shown in the writings of Rabanus Maurus,
   Hincmar, Remigius, Prudentius, Servatus Lupus, John Scotus Erigena,
   Paschasius Radbertus, and Ratramnus. We find among these writers the
   three tendencies, conservative, liberal, and speculative or mystic,
   which usually characterize periods of intellectual energy and literary
   productivity.

   After the death of Charles the Bald a darker night of ignorance and
   barbarism settled on Europe than ever before. It lasted till towards
   the middle of the eleventh century when the Berengar controversy on the
   eucharist roused the slumbering intellectual energies of the church,
   and prepared the way for the scholastic philosophy and theology of the
   twelfth century.

   The Carolingian male line lasted in Italy till 875, in Germany till
   911, in France till 987.

   § 141. Alfred the Great, and Education in England.

   Comp. the Jubilee edition of the Whole Works of Alfred the Great, with
   Preliminary Essays illustrative of the History, Arts and Manners of the
   Ninth Century. London, 1858, 2 vols. The biographies of Alfred, quoted
   on p. 395, and Freemann's Old English History 1859.

   In England the beginning of culture was imported with Christianity by
   Augustin, the first archbishop of Canterbury, who brought with him the
   Bible, the church books, the writings of Pope Gregory and the doctrines
   and practices of Roman Christianity; but little progress was made for a
   century. Among his successors the Greek monk, Theodore of Tarsus
   (668-690), was most active in promoting education and discipline among
   the clergy. The most distinguished scholar of the Saxon period is the
   Venerable Bede (d. 735), who, as already stated, represented all
   historical, exegetical and general knowledge of his age. Egbert,
   archbishop of York, founded a flourishing school in York (732), from
   which proceeded Alcuin, the teacher and friend of Charlemagne.

   During the invasion of the heathen Danes and Normans many churches,
   convents and libraries were destroyed, and the clergy itself relapsed
   into barbarism so that they did not know the meaning of the Latin
   formulas which they used in public worship.

   In this period of wild confusion King Alfred the Great (871-901), in
   his twenty-second year, ascended the throne. He is first in war and
   first in peace of all the Anglo-Saxon rulers. What Charlemagne was for
   Germany and France, Alfred was for England. He conquered the forces of
   the Danes by land and by sea, delivered his country from foreign rule,
   and introduced a new era of Christian education. He invited scholars
   from the old British churches in Wales, from Ireland, and the Continent
   to influential positions. He made collections of choice sentences from
   the Bible and the fathers. In his thirty-sixth year he learned Latin
   from Asser, a monk of Wales, who afterwards wrote his biography. He
   himself, no doubt with the aid of scholars, translated several standard
   works from Latin into the Anglo-Saxon, and accompanied them with notes,
   namely a part of the Psalter, Boëthius on the Consolation of
   Philosophy, Bede's English Church History, Pope Gregory's Pastoral
   Theology, Augustin's Meditations, the Universal History of Orosius, and
   Aesop's Fables. He sent a copy of Gregory's Pastoral Theology to every
   diocese for the benefit of the clergy. It is due to his influence
   chiefly that the Scriptures and service-books at this period were
   illustrated by so many vernacular glosses.

   He stood in close connection with the Roman see, as the centre of
   ecclesiastical unity and civilization. He devoted half of his income to
   church and school. He founded a school in Oxford similar to the Schola
   Palatina; but the University of Oxford, like those of Cambridge and
   Paris, is of much later date (twelfth or thirteenth century). He seems
   to have conceived even the plan of a general education of the people.
   [836] Amid great physical infirmity (he had the epilepsy), he developed
   an extraordinary activity during a reign of twenty-nine years, and left
   an enduring fame for purity, and piety of character and unselfish
   devotion to the best interests of his people. [837]

   His example of promoting learning in the vernacular language was
   followed by Aelfric, a grammarian, homilist and hagiographer. He has
   been identified with the archbishop Aelfric of Canterbury (996-1009),
   and with the archbishop Aelfric of York (1023-1051), but there are
   insuperable difficulties in either view. He calls himself simply "monk
   and priest." He left behind him a series of eighty Anglo-Saxon Homilies
   for Sundays and great festivals, and another series for Anglo-Saxon
   Saints' days, which were used as an authority in the Anglo-Saxon
   Church. [838]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [836] In the preface to Gregory's Pastoral, he expresses his desire
   that every freeborn English youth might learn to read English. The work
   has also great philological importance, and was edited by H. Sweet in

   Cf. Weser: Maximi Confesoris de incarnatione et deificatione doctrina.
   Berlin, 1869.

   As a sketch of St. Maximus Confessor (c. 580-Aug. 13, 662) has been
   elsewhere given, [853] it is only necessary in this place to pass in
   review his literary activity, and state briefly his theological
   position.

   Notwithstanding his frequent changes of residence, Maximus is one of
   the most prolific writers of the Greek Church, and by reason of his
   ability, stands in the front rank. Forty-eight of his treatises have
   been printed, others exist in MS., and some are lost. By reason of his
   pregnant and spiritual thoughts he has always been popular with his
   readers, notwithstanding his prolixity and frequent obscurity of which
   even Photius and Scotus Erigena complain.

   His Works may be divided into five classes.
   I. Exegetical. A follower of the Alexandrian school, he does not so
   much analyze and expound as allegorize, and make the text a starting
   point for theological digressions. He wrote (1) Questions [and Answers]
   upon difficult Scripture passages, [854] sixty-five in number addressed
   to Thalassius, a friend who had originally asked him the questions. The
   answers are sometimes very short, sometimes rich speculative essays.
   Thus he begins with a disquisition upon evil. Unless one is expert in
   allegorical and mystical writings, the answers of Maximus will be hard
   reading. He seems to have felt this himself, for he added explanatory
   notes in different places. [855] (2) Questions, seventy-five in number,
   similar to the preceding, but briefer and less obscure. (3) Exposition
   of Psalm LIX. [856] (4) The Lord's Prayer. [857] Both are very
   mystical.

   II. Scholia upon Dionysius Areopagita and Gregory Nazianzen, which were
   translated by Scotus Erigena (864). [858]

   III. Dogmatical and polemical. (1) Treatises. [859] The first
   twenty-five are in defense of the Orthodox dyotheletic doctrine (i.e.
   that there are in Christ two perfect natures, two wills and two
   operations) against the Severians. One treatise is on the Holy Trinity;
   another is on the procession of the Holy Spirit; the rest are upon
   cognate topics. (2) Debate with Pyrrhus (held July, 645) upon the
   Person of Christ, in favor of two wills. [860] It resulted in Pyrrhus'
   retraction of his Monotheletic error. This work is easier to read than
   most of the others. (3) Five Dialogues on the Trinity. [861] (4) On the
   Soul. [862]

   IV. Ethical and ascetic. (1) On asceticism [863] a dialogue between an
   abbot and a young monk, upon the duties of the monastic life. A famous
   treatise, very simple, clear and edifying for all Christians. It
   insists upon love to God, our neighbors and our enemies, and the
   renunciation of the world. (2) Chapters upon Charity, [864] four in
   number, of one hundred aphorisms, each, ascetic, dogmatic and mystical,
   added to the preceding, but not all are upon charity. There are Greek
   scholia upon this book. (3) Two Chapters, theological and oeconomical,
   [865] each of one hundred aphorisms, upon the principles of theology.
   (4) Catena, [866] five chapters of one hundred aphorisms each, upon
   theology.

   V. Miscellaneous. (1) Initiation into the mysteries, [867] an
   allegorical exposition of the Church and her worship. Incidentally it
   proves that the Greek liturgy has not changed since the seventh
   century. (2) Commonplaces, [868] seventy-one sections, containing texts
   of Scripture and quotations from the Fathers, arranged under heads. (3)
   Letters [869] forty-five in number, on theological and moral matters;
   several are on the Severian heresy, others supply biographical details.
   Many of his letters exist in MS. only. (4) Hymns, [870] three in
   number.

   Maximus was the pupil of Dionysius Areopagita, and the teacher of John
   of Damascus and John Scotus Erigena, in the sense that he elucidated
   and developed the ideas of Dionysius, and in turn was an inspiration
   and guide to the latter. John of Damascus has perpetuated his influence
   in the Greek Church to the present day. Scotus Erigena introduced some
   of his works to Western Europe. The prominent points of the theology of
   Maximus are these: [871] Sin is not a positive quality, but an inborn
   defect in the creature. In Christ this defect is supplied, new life is
   imparted, and the power to obey the will of God is given. The
   Incarnation is thus the Divine remedy for sin's awful consequences: the
   loss of free inclination to good, and the loss of immortality. Grace
   comes to man in consequence of Christ's work. It is not the divine
   nature in itself but in union with the human nature which is the
   principle of atoning and saving grace. God is the fountain of all being
   and life, the alpha and omega of creation. By means of the Incarnation
   he is the Head of the kingdom of grace. Christ is fully Man, and not
   only fully God. This is the mystery of the Incarnation. Opposed to the
   Monophysites and Monothelites, Maximus exerts all his ingenuity to
   prove that the difference of natures in Christ requires two wills, a
   human and a divine will, not separated or mixed, but in harmony. Christ
   was born from eternity from the Father, and in time from the Virgin,
   who was the veritable Mother of God. Christ's will was a natural, human
   will, one of the energies of his human nature. The parallel to this
   union of the divine and human in Christ is the human soul wrought upon
   by the Holy Spirit. The divine life begins in faith, rules in love, and
   comes to its highest development in the contemplative life. The
   Christian fulfils the command to pray without ceasing, by constantly
   directing his mind to God in true piety and sincere aspiration. All
   rational essences shall ultimately be re-united with God, and the final
   glorification of God will be by the complete destruction of all evil.

   An interesting point of a humane interest is his declaration that
   slavery is a dissolution, introduced by sin, of the original unity of
   human nature, and a denial of the original dignity of man, created
   after the image of God.

   "Revue Belge et etrangère," July and August, 1861.

   I. Life. John of Damascus, Saint and Doctor of the Eastern Church, last
   of the Greek Fathers, [872] was born in the city of Damascus in the
   fourth quarter of the seventh century. [873] His common epithet of
   Chrysorrhoas (streaming with gold) was given to him because of his
   eloquence, but also probably in allusion to the river of that name, the
   Abana of Scripture, the Barada of the present day, which flows through
   his native city, and makes it a blooming garden in the desert. Our
   knowledge of his life is mainly derived from the semi-legendary account
   of John of Jerusalem, who used an earlier Arabic biography of unknown
   authorship and date. [874]

   The facts seem to be these. He sprang from a distinguished Christian
   family with the Arabic name of Mansur (ransomed). His father, Sergius,
   was treasurer to the Saracenic caliph, Abdulmeled (685-705), an office
   frequently held by Christians under the caliphs. His education was
   derived from Cosmas, a learned Italian monk, whom Sergius had ransomed
   from slavery. He made rapid progress, and early gave promise of his
   brilliant career. On the death of his father he was taken by the caliph
   into his service and given an even higher office than his father had
   held. [875] When the emperor Leo the Isaurian issued his first edict
   against images (726) [876] , he prepared a circular letter upon the
   subject which showed great controversial ability and at once raised him
   to the position of leader of the image worshippers. This letter and the
   two which followed made a profound impression. They are classical, and
   no one has put the case better. [877] John was perfectly safe from the
   emperor's rage, and could tranquilly learn that the letters everywhere
   stirred up the monks and the clergy to fanatical opposition to Leo's
   decrees. Yet he may well have found his position at court
   uncomfortable, owing to the emperor's feelings towards him and his
   attempts at punishment. However this may be, shortly after 730 John is
   found as a monk in the Convent of St. Sabas, near the shore of the Dead
   Sea, ten miles southeast from Jerusalem. A few years later he was
   ordained priest. [878] His last days were spent in study and literary
   labor. In the closing decade of his life he is said to have made a
   journey through Palestine, Syria, and even as far as Constantinople,
   for the purpose of exciting opposition to the iconoclastic efforts of
   the Emperor Copronymus. He died at St. Sabas; the exact date is not
   known, probably 754. [879] The Greek Church commemorates him upon Dec.
   4th (or Nov. 29 in some Menologies); the Latin upon May 6.

   Many legends are told of him. The most famous is that Leo the Isaurian,
   enraged at his opposition to the iconoclastic edicts, sent to the
   caliph a letter addressed to himself which purported to have come from
   John, and was written in imitation of his hand and style, in which the
   latter proposed to the emperor to capture Damascus--a feat easily
   accomplished., the writer said, because of the insufficient guard of
   the city. Moreover, in the business he could count upon his support.
   The letter was of course a forgery, but so clever that when the caliph
   showed John the letter he acknowledged the similarity of the writing,
   while he denied the authorship. But the caliph in punishment of his
   (supposed) treachery had his right hand cut off, and, as was the
   custom, hung up in a public place. In answer to John's request it was,
   however, given to him in the evening, ostensibly for burial. He then
   put the hand to the stump of his arm, prostrated himself before an
   image of the Virgin Mary in his private chapel, and prayed the Virgin
   to cause the parts to adhere. He fell asleep: in a vision the Virgin
   told him that his prayer had been granted, and he awoke to find it
   true. Only a scar remained to tell the story of his mutilation. The
   miracle of course convinced the caliph of the innocence of his servant,
   and he would fain have retained him in office, but John requested his
   absolute dismission. [880] This story was manifestly invented to make
   out that the great defender of image-worship deserved a martyr's crown.
   [881]

   Other legends which have more of a basis of fact relate to his
   residence in the convent of St. Sabas. Here, it is said., he was
   enthusiastically received, but no one would at first undertake the
   instruction of so famous a scholar. At length an old monk undertook it,
   and subjected him to the most humiliating tests and vexatious
   restrictions, which he bore in a very saintly way. Thus he sent him
   once to Damascus to sell a load of convent-made baskets at double their
   real value, in order that his pride might be broken by the jeers and
   the violence of the rabble. He was at first insulted; but at last a man
   who had been formerly his servant, bought out of compassion the baskets
   at the exorbitant price, and the saint returned victorious over vanity
   and pride. He was also put to the most menial services. And, what must
   have been equally trying, he was forbidden to write prose or poetry.
   But these trials ended on a hint from the Virgin Mary who appeared one
   night to the old monk and told him that John was destined to play a
   great part in the church. He was accordingly allowed to follow the bent
   of his genius and put his immense learning at the service of religion.

   II. Writings. The order of his numerous writings [882] is a mere matter
   of conjecture. It seems natural to begin with those which first brought
   their author into notice, and upon which his fame popularly rests.
   These were his three Orations, [883] properly circular letters, upon
   image worship, universally considered as the ablest presentation of the
   subject from the side of the image-worshippers. The first [884]
   appeared probably in 727, shortly after the Emperor Leo the Isaurian
   had issued his edict forbidding the worship of "images," by which term
   was meant not sculptures, but in the Greek Church pictures exclusively;
   the second [885] after Leo's edict of 730 ordering the destruction of
   the images; and the third [886] at some later time.

   In the first of these three letters John advanced these arguments: the
   Mosaic prohibitions of idolatry were directed against representations
   of God, not of men, and against the service of images, not their honor.
   Cherubim made by human hands were above the mercy-seat. Since the
   Incarnation it is allowable to represent God himself. The picture is to
   the ignorant what the book is to the learned. In the Old Testament
   there are signs to quicken the memory and promote devotion (the ark,
   the rod of Aaron, the brazen serpent). Why should the sufferings and
   miracles of Christ not be portrayed for the same purposes? And if
   Christ and the Virgin have their images, why should not the saints have
   theirs? Since the Old Testament Temple contained cherubim and other
   images, churches may be adorned with images of the saints. If one must
   not worship an image, then one must not worship Christ, for he is the
   image of the Father. If the shadows and handkerchiefs of apostles had
   healing properties, why can one not honor the representations of the
   saints? It is true there is nothing about such worship in the Holy
   Scriptures, but Church ordinances depend for authority on tradition no
   less than on Scripture. The passages against images refer to idols.
   "The heathens dedicate their images to demons, whom they call gods; we
   dedicate ours to the incarnate God and his friends, through whom we
   exorcise demons." He ends his letter with a number of patristic
   quotations of greater or less relevancy, to each of which he appends a
   comment. The second letter, which is substantially a repetition of the
   first, is characterized by, a violent attack upon the Emperor, because
   of his deposition and banishment of Germanus, the patriarch of
   Constantinople. It closes with the same patristic quotations, and a few
   new ones. The third letter is almost necessarily a repetition of the
   preceding, since it goes over the same ground. It likewise looks upon
   the iconoclasts as the servants of the devil. But it bears marks of
   more care in preparation, and its proofs are more systematically
   arranged and its quotations more numerous. [887]

   For his writings in favor of images he was enthusiastically lauded by
   the second Nicene Council (787). [888]

   But the fame of John of Damascus as one of the greatest theologians of
   history rests chiefly on his work entitled the Fount of Knowledge.
   [889] It is made up of three separate and complete books, which yet
   were designed to go together and constitute in outline a cyclopaedia of
   Christian theology and of all other kinds of knowledge. [890] It is
   dedicated to Cosmas, bishop of Maiuma, his foster-brother and
   fellow-student under the old monk. Its date is after 743, the year of
   Cosmas's consecration. In it the author avows that he has introduced
   nothing which had not been previously said, and herein is its value: it
   epitomizes Greek theology.

   The first part of the trilogy, "Heads of Philosophy," [891] commonly
   called, by the Latin title, Dialectica, is a series of short chapters
   upon the Categories of Aristotle and the Universals of Porphyry,
   applied to Christian doctrines. The Dialectica is found in two forms,
   one with sixty-eight, and the other with only fifteen chapters. The
   explanation is probably the well-known fact that the author carefully
   revised his works before his death. [892] The longer form is therefore
   probably the later. Its principal value is the light it throws upon the
   Church terminology of the period, and its proof that Christians
   preceded the Arabs in their study of Aristotle, by one hundred years.
   The second part of the trilogy, the "Compendium of Heresies," [893] is
   a description of one hundred and three heresies, compiled mostly from
   Epiphanius, but with two sections, on the Mohammedans and Iconoclasts,
   which are probably original. A confession of faith closes the book. The
   third, the longest, and by far the most important member of the trilogy
   is "An accurate Summary of the Orthodox Faith." [894] The authors drawn
   upon are almost exclusively Greek. Gregory Nazianzen is the chief
   source. This part was apparently divided by John into one hundred
   chapters, but when it reached Western Europe in the Latin translation
   of John Burgundio of Pisa, made by order of Pope Eugenius III. (1150),
   [895] it was divided into four books to make it correspond in outward
   form to Peter Lombard's Sentences. Accepting the division into four
   books, their contents may be thus stated: bk. I., Theology proper. In
   this he maintains the Greek Church doctrine of the single procession of
   the Holy Spirit. bk. II. Doctrines of Creation (severally of angels,
   demons, external nature, paradise, man and all his attributes and
   capacities); and of Providence, foreknowledge and predestination. In
   this part he shows his wide acquaintance with natural science. bk. III.
   Doctrine of the Incarnation. bk. IV. Miscellaneous subjects. Christ's
   passion, death, burial, resurrection, ascension, session; the two-fold
   nature of Christ; faith; baptism; praying towards the East; the
   Eucharist; images; the Scriptures; Manichaeism; Judaism; virginity;
   circumcision; Antichrist; resurrection.

   The entire work is a noteworthy application of Aristotelian categories
   to Christian theology. In regard to Christology he repudiates both
   Nestorianism and Monophysitism, and teaches that each nature in Christ
   possessed its peculiar attributes and was not mixed with the other. But
   the divine in Christ strongly predominated over the human. The Logos
   was bound to the flesh through the Spirit, which stands between the
   purely divine and the materiality of the flesh. The human nature of
   Jesus was incorporated in the one divine personality of the Logos
   (Enhypostasia). John recognizes only two sacraments, properly so
   called, i.e. mysteries instituted by Christ--Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper. In the latter the elements are at the moment when the Holy
   Ghost is called upon, changed into the Body and Blood of Christ, but
   how is not known. He does not therefore teach transubstantiation
   exactly, yet his doctrine is very near to it. About the remaining five
   so-called sacraments he is either silent or vague. He holds to the
   perpetual virginity of Mary, the Mother of our Lord, and that her
   conception of Christ took place through the ear. He recognizes the
   Hebrew canon of twenty-two books, corresponding to the twenty-two
   Hebrew letters, or rather twenty-seven, since five of these letters
   have double forms. Of the Apocrypha he mentions only Ecclesiasticus and
   Wisdom, and these as uncanonical. To the New Testament canon he adds
   the Apostolical Canons of Clement. The Sabbath was made for the fleshly
   Jews--Christians dedicate their whole time to God. The true Sabbath is
   the rest from sin. He extols virginity, for as high as angels are above
   men so high is virginity above marriage. Yet marriage is a good as
   preventive of unchastity and for the sake of propagation. At the end of
   the world comes Antichrist, who is a man in whom the devil lives. He
   persecutes the Church, kills Enoch and Elijah, who are supposed to
   appear again upon the earth, but is destroyed by Christ at his second
   coming. [896] The resurrection body is like Christ's, in that it is
   immutable, passionless, spiritual, not held in by material limitation,
   nor dependent upon food. Otherwise it is the same as the former. The
   fire of hell is not material, but in what it consists God alone knows.

   His remaining works are minor theological treatises, including a brief
   catechism on the Holy Trinity; controversial writings against
   Mohammedanism (particularly interesting because of the nearness of
   their author to the beginnings of that religion), and against
   Jacobites, Manichaeans, Nestorians and Iconoclasts; homilies, [897]
   among them an eulogy upon Chrysostom; a commentary on Paul's Epistles,
   taken almost entirely from Chrysostom's homilies; the sacred Parallels,
   Bible sentences with patristic illustrations on doctrinal and moral
   subjects, arranged in alphabetical order, for which a leading word in
   the sentence serves as guide. He also wrote a number of hymns which
   have been noticed in a previous section. [898]

   Besides these there is a writing attributed to him, The Life of Barlaam
   and Joasaph [899] the story of the conversion of the only son of an
   Indian King by a monk (Barlaam). It is a monastic romance of much
   interest and not a little beauty. It has been translated into many
   languages, frequently reprinted, and widely circulated. [900] Whether
   John of Damascus wrote it is a question. Many things about it seem to
   demand an affirmative answer. [901] His materials were very old, indeed
   pre-Christian, for the story is really a repetition of the Lalita
   Vistara, the legendary life of Buddha. [902]

   Another writing of dubious authorship is the Panegyric on St. Barbara,
   [903] a marvellous tale of a suffering saint. Competent judges assign
   it to him. [904] These two are characteristic specimens of monastic
   legends in which so much pious superstition was handed down from
   generation to generation.

   III. Position. John of Damascus considered either as a Christian
   office-holder under a Mohammedan Saracenic Caliph, as the great
   defender of image-worship, as a learned though credulous monk, or as a
   sweet and holy poet, is in every way an interesting and important
   character. But it is as the summarizer of the theology of the Greek
   fathers that he is most worthy of attentive study; for although he
   seldom ventures upon an original remark, he is no blind, servile
   copyist. His great work, the "Fount of Knowledge," was not only the
   summary of the theological discussions of the ancient Eastern Church,
   which was then and is to-day accepted as authoritative in that
   communion, but by means of the Latin translation a powerful stimulus to
   theological study in the West. Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas and other
   schoolmen are greatly indebted to it. The epithets, "Father of
   Scholasticism" and "Lombard of the Greeks" have been given to its
   author. He was not a scholastic in the proper meaning of that term, but
   merely applied Aristotelian dialects to the treatment of traditional
   theology. Yet by so doing he became in truth the forerunner of
   scholasticism.

   An important but incidental service rendered by this great Father was
   as conserver of Greek learning. "The numerous quotations, not only from
   Gregory Nazianzen, but from a multitude of Greek authors besides would
   provide a field of Hellenic literature sufficient for the wants of that
   generation. In having so provided it, and having thus become the
   initiator of a warlike but ill-taught race into the mysteries of an
   earlier civilization, Damascenus is entitled to the praise that the
   elder Lenormant awarded him of being in the front rank of the master
   spirits from whom the genius of the Arabs drew its inspiration." [905]

   One other interesting fact deserves mention. It was to John of Damascus
   that the Old Catholics and Oriental and Anglo-Catholics turned for a
   definition of the relation of the Holy Spirit to the Father and Son
   which should afford a solid basis of union. [906] "He restored unity to
   the Triad, by following the ancient theory of the Greek church,
   representing God the Father as the arche, and in this view, the being
   of the Holy Spirit no less than the being of the Son as grounded in and
   derived from the Father. The Holy Spirit is from the Father, and the
   Spirit of the Father; not from the Son, but still the Spirit of the
   Son. He proceeds from the Father the one ajrchv of all being, and he is
   communicated through the Son; through the Son the whole creation shares
   in the Spirit's work; by himself he creates, moulds, sanctifies all and
   binds all together." [907]

   Photius was born in Constantinople in the first decade of the ninth
   century. He belonged to a rich and distinguished family. He had an
   insatiable thirst for learning, and included theology among his
   studies, but he was not originally a theologian. Rather he was a
   courtier and a diplomate. When Bardas chose him to succeed Ignatius as
   Patriarch of Constantinople he was captain of the Emperor's body-guard.
   Gregory of Syracuse, a bitter enemy of Ignatius, in five days hurried
   him through the five orders of monk, lector, sub-deacon, deacon, and
   presbyter, and on the sixth consecrated him patriarch. He died an exile
   in an Armenian monastery, 891.

   As the history of Photius after his elevation to the patriarchate has
   been already treated, [908] this section will be confined to a brief
   recital of his services to literature, sacred and secular. [909]

   The greatest of these was his so-called Library, [910] which is a
   unique work, being nothing less than notices, critiques and extracts of
   two hundred and eighty works of the most diverse kinds, which he had
   read. Of the authors quoted about eighty are known to us only through
   this work. The Library was the response to the wish of his brother
   Tarasius, and was composed while Photius was a layman. The majority of
   the works mentioned are theological, the rest are grammatical, lexical,
   rhetorical, imaginative, historical, philosophical, scientific and
   medical. No poets are mentioned or quoted, except the authors of three
   or four metrical paraphrases of portions of Scripture. The works are
   all in Greek, either as originals or, as in the case of a few, in Greek
   translations. Gregory the Great and Cassian are the only Latin
   ecclesiastical writers with whom Photius betrays any intimate
   acquaintance. As far as profane literature is concerned, the Library
   makes the best exhibit in history, and the poorest in grammar. Romances
   are mentioned, also miscellanies. In the religious part of his work
   Chrysostom and Athanasius are most prominent. Of the now lost works
   mentioned by Photius the most important is by an anonymous
   Constantinopolitan author of the first half of the seventh century, who
   in fifteen books presented testimonies in favor of Christianity by
   different Greek, Persian, Thracian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Chaldean and
   Jewish scholars.

   Unique and invaluable as the Library is, it has been criticized because
   more attention is given to some minor works than to other important
   ones; the criticisms are not always fair or worthy; the works spoken of
   are really few, while a much larger anthology might have been made; and
   again there is no order or method in the selection. It is, however, to
   be borne in mind that the object of the work was to mention only those
   books which had been read in the circle to which he and his brother
   belonged, during the absence of the latter; that it was hastily
   prepared, and was to have been followed by a second. [911] Taking these
   facts into consideration there is nothing but praise to be given to the
   great scholar who in a wholly undesigned fashion has laid posterity
   under heavy obligation by jotting down his criticisms upon or making
   excerpts of the more important works which came under his observation
   during a comparatively short space of time.

   Among the Greek fathers, he esteems most highly Athanasius, Chrysostom,
   Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Epiphanius, Ephraem, Cyril of Alexandria, the
   fictitious Dionysius the Areopagite, and Maximus; among the Latin
   fathers, Leo. I. and Gregory I. He recognizes also Ambrose, Augustin,
   and Jerome as fathers, but often disputes their views. Of the
   ante-Nicene writers he has a rather low opinion, because they did not
   come up to his standard of orthodoxy; he charges Origen with
   blasphemous errors, and Eusebius with Arianism.

   One of the earlier works of Photius, perhaps his earliest, was his
   Greek Lexicon, [912] which he began in his youth and completed before
   the Library, although he revised it from time to time. He made use of
   the glossaries and lexica of former workers, whose names he has
   preserved in his Library, and has been in turn used by later
   lexicographers, e.g. Suidas (ninth century). Photius designed to remove
   the difficulties in the reading of the earlier and classic Greek
   profane and sacred literature. To this end he paid particular attention
   to the explanation of the old Attic expressions and figures of speech.

   The most important of the theological works of Photius is the
   Amphilochian Questions [913] -- so called because these questions had
   been asked by his friend, Amphilochius, metropolitan of Lyzikus. The
   work consists of three hundred and twenty-four discussions, mostly in
   biblical exegesis, but also dogmatical, philosophical, mythological,
   grammatical, historical, medical, and scientific. Like the other works
   of Photius it displays rare learning and ability. It was composed
   during his first exile, and contains many complaints of lack of books
   and excerpts. It has no plan, is very disjointed, unequal, and
   evidently was written at different times. Many of the answers are taken
   literally from the works of others. The same question is sometimes
   repeatedly discussed in different ways. [914]

   Although it is doubtful whether Photius composed a complete commentary
   on any book of the Old Testament, it is very likely that he wrote on
   the Gospels and on Romans, Corinthians and Hebrews, since in the
   printed and unprinted catenae upon these books there are found many
   citations of Photius. [915] No such commentary as a unit, however, now
   exists.

   Two canonical works are attributed to Photius, "A Collection of Canons"
   and "A Collection of Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws." [916] To these
   some add a third. The second of these works, the Nomocanon, is
   authoritative on canonical law in the Greek Church. [917] The word
   "Nomocanon" itself is the Greek name for a combination of
   ecclesiastical laws (kanovne") and secular, especially imperial, law
   (novmoi). Photius made such a collection in 883, on the basis of
   earlier collections. It contains (1) the canons of the seven
   universally accepted oecumenical councils (325-787), of the Trullan
   council of 692 (Quinisexta), the synods of 861 and 879; and (2) the
   laws of Justinian relative to the Greek Church. Photius was not only a
   collector of canonical laws, but also a legislator and commentator. The
   canons of the councils held by him in 861 and 879, and his canonical
   letters or decretals had a great and permanent influence upon Greek
   canonical law. The Nomocanon was enlarged and commented on by Balsamon
   in the twelfth century, and is usually published in connection with
   these commentaries. It is used in the orthodox church of Russia under
   the name Kormczia Kniga, i.e., "The Book for the Pilot." As in his
   other works, he builded upon the foundations of his predecessors.

   The historical and dogmatico-polemical writings of Photius may be
   divided into two classes, those against the Paulicians or Manichaeans,
   and those against the Roman Church. In the first class are four books
   which bear in the editions the general title "Against the new
   Manichaeans." [918] The first is a history of the old and new
   Manichaeans, written during Photius' first patriarchate, and apparently
   largely borrowed from a contemporary author; the remaining three are
   polemical treatises upon the new Manichaeans, in which biblical rather
   than philosophical arguments are relied upon, and mostly those which
   had already been used against the Manichaeans.

   The works against the Latin Church embrace (1) The Mystagogia, or
   doctrine of the Holy Spirit; his most important writing against the
   Latins. [919] It is a discussion of the procession alone, not of the
   personality and divinity, of the Holy Spirit, for upon these latter
   points there was no difference between the Latin and Greek Churches. It
   appears to be entirely original with Photius. [920] It is characterized
   by acuteness and great dialectical skill. There exists an epitome of
   this book, [921] but it is doubtful whether Photius himself made it.
   (2) A collection [922] of ten questions and answers upon such matters
   as, "In what respects have the Romans acted unjustly?" "How many and
   what true patriarchs are not recognized by the Romans, except
   compromisingly?" "Which emperor contends for the peace of the Church?"
   The collection has great historical interest, since it embraces
   materials which otherwise would be entirely lost. (3) Treatise against
   the Roman primacy. (4) Tractate against the Franks, from which there
   are extracts in the Kormczaia Kniga of the Oriental Slavs, which was
   extensively circulated in the thirteenth century, and enjoys among the
   Russians great authority as a book of canonical law. It has been
   attributed to Photius, but in its present shape is not his. [923] (5)
   His famous Encyclical Letter to the Eastern Patriarchs, written in 867.
   [924]

   The genuine works of Photius include besides those already mentioned
   three books of letters [925] of different contents, private and public,
   written generally in verbose style; homilies, [926] two printed entire
   and two in fragments and twenty unprinted; several poems [927] and
   moral sentences, probably a compilation. Several other works attributed
   to Photius are only of doubtful genuineness.

   § 146. Simeon Metaphrastes.

   I. Simeon Metaphrastes: Opera omnia, in Migne, Patrol. Gr. Tom.
   cxiv.-cxvi.

   II. Panegyric by Psellus, in Migne, CXIV. col. 200-208; Leo Allatius:
   De Symeonum scriptis, in Migne, CXIV. col. 19-148; and the Preface to
   Migne's ed. Cf. Du Pin, VIII. 3; Ceillier, XII. 814-819.

   This voluminous author probably lived in Constantinople during the
   reigns of Leo the Philosopher (886-911) and Constantine Porphyrogenitus
   (911-959). [928] He was the Imperial Secretary, High Chancellor and
   Master of the Palace. When somewhat advanced in years he was sent by
   the Emperor Leo on a mission to the Cretan Arabs for the purpose, which
   was accomplished, of turning them from their proposed campaign against
   the Thessalonians. It was on this journey that he met on the island of
   Pharos, an anchorite, who suggested to him the writing of the lives of
   the saints and martyrs.

   To this collection Simeon owes his fame. [929] He apparently never
   carried out his original plan, which was to cover the year, for the
   genuine Lives of his now extant are nearly all of September (the first
   month of the Greek Church year), October, November and December. The
   remaining months have very few. But how many he wrote cannot be
   determined. Allatius credits him with only one hundred and twenty-two.
   MSS. attributed to him are found in the libraries of Munich, Venice,
   Florence, Madrid, Paris, London and elsewhere. The character of his
   work is sufficiently indicated by his epithet Simeon the Paraphraser,
   given to him because he turned "the ancient lives of the saints into
   another sort of a style than that wherein they were formerly written."
   [930] He used old material in most cases, and sometimes he did no more
   than edit it, at other times he re-wrote it, with a view to make it
   more accurate or attractive. Some of the lives are, however, original
   compositions. His work is of very unequal value, and as his credulity
   led him to admit very doubtful matter, it must be used with caution.
   However, he deserves thanks for his diligence in rescuing from
   obscurity many now illustrious names.

   Besides the Lives, nine Epistles, several sermons, orations, hymns, and
   a canonical epitome bear his name. [931] The Simeonis Chronicon is
   probably the work of a Simeon of the twelfth century.

   twenty-three Fathers and writers of the Greek Church, [932] with an
   occasional original comment. The work displays taste and judgment.

   § 148. Theophylact.

   I. Theophylact: Opera omnia, in Migne, Patrol. Gr. Tom. CXXIII.-CXXVI.,
   reprint of ed. Of de Rubeis. Venice, 1754-63, 4 vols. fol. Du Pin, IX.
   108, 109; Neander, III. 584-586; Ceillier, XIII. 554-558.

   Theophylact, the most learned exegete of the Greek Church in his day,
   was probably born at Euripus, [933] on the Island of Euboea, in the
   Aegean Sea. Very little is known about him. He lived under the Greek
   Emperors Romanus IV. Diogenes (1067-1071), Michael VII. Ducas
   Parapinaces (1071-1078), Nicephorus III. Botoniates (1078-1081),
   Alexius I. Comnenus (1081-1118). The early part of his life he spent in
   Constantinople; and on account of his learning and virtues was chosen
   tutor to Prince Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the son of Michael Ducas.
   From 1078 until after 1107 he was archbishop of Achrida and
   metropolitan of Bulgaria. He ruled his diocese in an independent
   manner, but his letters show the difficulties he had to contend with.
   It is not known when he died.

   His fame rests upon his commentary [934] on the Gospels, Acts, Pauline,
   and Catholic Epistles; and on Hosea, Jonah, Nahum and Habakkuk, which
   has recently received the special commendation of such exegetes as De
   Wette and Meyer. It is drawn from the older writers, especially from
   Chrysostom, but Theophylact shows true exegetical insight, explaining
   the text clearly and making many original remarks of great value.

   Besides his commentary, his works embrace orations on the Adoration of
   the Cross, [935] the Presentation of the Virgin [936] and on the
   Emperor Alexius Comnenus; [937] a treatise on the Education Of Princes;
   [938] a History of Fifteen Martyrdoms [939] and an Address on the
   Errors of the Latin Church. [940] Two of these call for further
   mention. The Education of Princes is addressed to Constantine
   Porphyrogenitus. It is in two books, of which the first is historical
   and discourses upon the parents of the prince, the second discusses his
   duties and trials. It was formerly a very popular work. It is
   instructive to compare it with the similar works by Paulinus, Alcuin,
   and Smaragdus. [941] The Address is the most interesting work of
   Theophylact. It is written in a singularly conservative and moderate
   strain, although it discusses the two great matters in dispute between
   the Greek and Latin Churches,--the procession of the Holy Spirit, and
   the bread of the Eucharist. Of these matters Theophylact considered the
   first only important, and upon it took unhesitatingly the full Greek
   position of hostility to the Latins. Yet his fairness comes out in the
   remark that the error of the Latins may be due to the poverty of their
   language which compelled them to "employ the same term to denote the
   causality of the communication of the Holy Spirit and the causality of
   his being. The Latins, he observed, moreover, might retain the less
   accurate forms of expression in their homiletic discourses, if they
   only guarded against misconception, by carefully explaining their
   meaning. It was only in the confession of faith in the symbol, that
   perfect clearness was requisite." [942] In regard to the bread of the
   Eucharist the Latins held that it should be unleavened, the Greeks that
   it should be leavened. Each church claimed to follow the usage of
   Christ. Theophylact admitted that Christ used unleavened bread, but
   maintained that His example in this respect is not binding, for if it
   were in this then it would be in everything connected with the Supper,
   and it would be necessary to use barley bread and the wine of
   Palestine, to recline at table and to hold the Supper in a ball or
   upper room. But there is such a thing as Christian liberty, and the
   kind of bread to be used is one of the things which this liberty
   allows. Upon both these points of fierce and long controversy he
   counseled continual remembrance of the common Christian faith and the
   common Christian fellowship.

   § 149. Michael Psellus.

   I. Michael Psellus: Opera, in Migne, Patrol. Gr., Tom. CXXII., col.
   477-1358. His Hist. Byzant. et alia opuscula, ed. by Constantin Sathas.
   Paris, 1874.

   II. Leo Allatius: Diatriba de Psellis, in Migne, l.c., col. 477-536.
   Ceillier, XIII. 335-337.

   Michael Psellus, the third of the five of that name mentioned by
   Allatius, was born of a consular and patrician family in Constantinople
   about 1020. He took naturally to study, and denied himself the
   amusements and recreations of youth in order that he might make all the
   more rapid progress. Having completed his studies at Athens, he
   returned to Constantinople, and was appointed chief professor of
   philosophy. Constantine Monomachus invited him to his court, and
   entrusted him with secular business. He then turned his attention from
   philosophy and rhetoric to theology, physics, medicine, mathematics,
   astronomy and military science. In short, he explored the entire domain
   of knowledge, and as his memory was tenacious, he was able to retain
   everything he studied. "It has been said that in him human nature
   yielded up its inmost powers in order that he might ward off the
   downfall of Greek learning." [943] He was made the tutor of Michael
   Ducas, the future emperor, who when he came to the throne retained him
   in his councils. Psellus, of course, took the Greek position upon the
   Filioque question, and thwarted the movement of Peter, bishop of
   Anagni, to establish peace between the Greek and Latin churches. When
   Michael Ducas was deposed (1078), he was deprived of his professorship,
   and so he retired to a monastery, where he died. The last mention of
   him is made in 1105.

   Psellus was a prolific author, but many of his writings are unprinted,
   and many are lost. [944] Of the theological works which have been
   printed the most important are:

   (1) Exposition of the Song of Songs, [945] a paraphrase in verse with a
   commentary and excerpts from Gregory of Nyssa, Nilus, and Maximus.

   (2) A Learned Miscellany, [946] in 157 paragraphs, in which nearly
   everything is treated of, from the relations of the persons of the
   Trinity to the rise of the Nile and the changes of the weather. It is
   one of those prodigies of learning which really indicate the
   comparative ignorance of the past, and are now mere curiosities.

   (3) The Operations of Demons, [947] an attack, in the form of a
   dialogue, upon the Euchites, whom he charges with revolting and
   disgusting crimes, under the prompting of demons. But he passes on to
   discuss the subject more broadly and resting on the testimony of a
   certain monk who had actually seen demons he teaches their perpetual
   activity in human affairs; that they can propagate their species; and
   go anywhere at will under either a male or female form. From them come
   diseases and innumerable woes. The book is very curious, and has
   permanent value as a contribution to the demonology of the Middle Ages.

   Twelve letters of Psellus have been printed. [948] His panegyric upon
   Simeon Metaphrastes has already been mentioned. [949] He wrote a
   criticism of the eloquence of Gregory the Theologian, Basil, and
   Chrysostom, [950] and celebrated these Fathers also in verse. [951]

   Besides certain legal and philosophical treatises he wrote a poem on
   Doctrine, [952] and a metrical Synopsis of Law. [953]

   CXXVIII.-CXXXI.

   II. See the Prolegomena in Migne. Ceillier, XIV. 150-155.

   Euthymius Zigabenus (or Zigadenus) was a learned and able Greek monk of
   the order of St. Basil in the convent of the Virgin Mary near
   Constantinople, and enjoyed the marked favor of the emperor Alexius
   Comnenus (1081-1118) and his wife Anna. [954] Being requested by
   Alexius to refute the Bogomiles, who had become alarmingly numerous, he
   was led to prepare an extensive work upon heresy, entitled The Panoply.
   [955] Among the heretics he included the Pantheists, Jews, the Pope and
   the Latins. His materials were the decisions of councils and the Greek
   Fathers and other writers, including some otherwise unknown. [956] In
   this important work and in separate treatises [957] he imparts much
   valuable historical information respecting the Bogomiles, Massalians,
   Armenians, Paulicians, and even about the Jews and Mohammedans,
   although it is evident that he was not well informed about the last,
   and was much prejudiced against them. Like other Greeks, he finds the
   latter heretical upon the procession of the Holy Spirit and upon the
   bread of the Eucharist. Besides the Panoply, Euthymius wrote
   commentaries upon the Psalms, [958] much dependent upon Chrysostom, and
   on the Gospels, [959] more independent and exhibiting exegetical tact
   which in the judgment of some puts him next to Theophylact.

   his "Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen," Berlin, 1851, pp. 6-21, trans. in
   Kitto's "Journal of Sacred Literature," vol. IV., pp. 101 sqq.

   Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica and metropolitan, the most
   learned man of his day, was born in Constantinople, and lived under the
   Greek emperors from John Comnenus to Isaac II. Angelus, i.e., between
   1118 and 1195. His proper name is unknown, that of Eustathius having
   been assumed on taking monastic vows. His education was carried on in
   the convent of St. Euphemia, but he became a monk in the convent of St.
   Florus. He early distinguished himself for learning, piety and
   eloquence, and thus attracted the notice of the Emperor Manuel, who
   made him successively tutor to his son John, deacon of St. Sophia and
   master of petitions, a court position. In the last capacity he
   presented at least one petition to the Emperor, that from the
   Constantinopolitans during a severe drought. [960]

   To this period of his life probably belong those famous commentaries
   upon the classic authors, [961] by which alone he was known until Tafel
   published his theological and historical works. But Providence designed
   Eustathius to play a prominent part in practical affairs, and so the
   Emperor Manuel appointed him bishop of Myra, [962] the capital of Lycia
   in Asia Minor, and ere he had entered on this office transferred him to
   the archbishopric of Thessalonica (1175). He was a model bishop, pious,
   faithful, unselfish, unsparing in rebuke and wise in counsel, "one of
   those pure characters so rarely met among the Greeks--a man who well
   knew the failings [superstition, mock-holiness and indecorous
   frivolity] of his nation and his times, which he was more exempt from
   than any of his contemporaries. [963] His courage was conspicuous on
   several occasions. The Emperor Manuel in a Synod at Constantinople in
   1180 attempted to have abrogated the formula of adjuration, "Anathema
   to Mohammed's God, of whom he says that he neither begat nor was
   begotten," which all who came over from Mohammedanism to Christianity
   had to repeat. Manuel argued that this formula was both blasphemous and
   prejudicial to the spread of Christianity in Islam. But Eustathius
   dared to brave the emperor's rage and deny the truth of this argument.
   The result was a modification of the formula. [964] Although Manuel
   threatened to impeach Eustathius, he really did not withdraw his favor,
   and the archbishop was summoned to preach the sermon at the emperor's
   funeral. [965] When in 1185 Thessalonica was sacked by Count Alduin
   acting under William II. of Sicily, Eustathius remained in the city and
   by direct personal effort procured some alleviation of the people's
   sufferings, and defended their worship against the fanatical Latins.
   [966] Again, he interposed his influence to keep the Thessalonians from
   the rapacity of the imperial tax-gatherers. But notwithstanding his
   high character and unsparing exertions on behalf of Thessalonica there
   were enough persons there who were incensed against him by his plain
   speaking to effect his banishment. This probably happened during the
   reign of the infamous Andronicus (1180-1183), who was unfriendly to
   Eustathius. A brief experience of the result of his absence led to his
   recall, and he ended his days in increased esteem. It is strange indeed
   to find Eustathius and Calvin alike in their expulsion and recall to
   the city they had done so much to save.

   His writings upon practical religious topics have great interest and
   value. Besides sermons upon Psalm xlviii., [967] on an auspicious year,
   [968] four during Lent, [969] in which he specially inveighs against
   the lax marital customs, and five on different martyrs, [970] he wrote
   an enthusiastic treatise in praise of monasticism [971] if properly
   used, while at the same time he faithfully rebuked the common faults of
   the monks, their sloth, their hypocrisy and their ignorance, which had
   made the very name of monk a reproach. To the Stylites, [972] he was
   particularly plain in setting forth their duty. By reason of their
   supposed sanctity they were sought by all classes as oracles. He seeks
   therefore to impress them with their responsibility, and tells them
   always to speak fearlessly, irrespective of person; not flattering the
   strong nor domineering the weak. He addressed also the laity, not only
   in the sermons already mentioned, but in separate treatises, [973] and
   with great earnestness and tenderness exhorted them to obedience to
   their lawful rulers, and rebuked them for their hypocrisy, which was
   the crying sin of the day, and for their vindictiveness. He laid down
   the true gospel principle: love is the central point of the Christian
   life. His letters [974] of which 75 have been published, give us a
   vivid picture of the time, and bear unconscious testimony to his
   virtue. To his Interpretation of the Pentecostal hymn of John of
   Damascus Cardinal Mai accords the highest praise. [975]

   Nicetas Acominatos, also called Choniates, to denote his birth at
   Chonae the old Colossae in Phrygia, was one of the great scholars and
   authors of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. He was educated at
   Constantinople, studied law and early rose to prominence at the
   imperial court. He married a descendant of Belisarius; and at the time
   when Constantinople was taken by the crusaders (1204) he was governor
   of Philippopolis. He fled to Nicaea, and there died about 1216. It was
   during this last period of his life that he composed his Treasury of
   Orthodoxy, [976] for the consolation and instruction of his suffering
   fellow-religionists. This work was in twenty-seven books, but only five
   have been published complete, and that only in the Latin translation of
   Peter Morel, made from the original MS. brought to Paris from Mt.
   Athos. [977] Cardinal Mai has, however, given fragments of Books vi.
   viii. ix. x. xii. xv. xvii. xx. xxiii. xxiv. xxv., and these Migne has
   reprinted with a Latin translation. The work is, like the Panoply of
   Euthymius, a learned text-book of theology and a refutation of heresy,
   but it has more original matter in it, and being written by a layman
   and a statesman is more popular.

   Book 1st is a statement of Gentile philosophy and of the errors of the
   Jews. Book 2d treats of the Holy Trinity, and of angels and men. Book
   3d of the Incarnate Word. From Book 4th to the end the several heresies
   are described and combated. Nicetas begins with Simon Magus and goes
   down to his own day.

   But his fame really rests upon his History, [978] which tells the story
   of Byzantine affairs from 1117 to 1205; and is an able and reliable
   book. The closing portions interestingly describe the destruction or
   mutilation of the monuments in Constantinople by the Latins.

   Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator [979] , whose services to classical
   literature can not be over-estimated, was descended from an old Roman
   family, famous for its efficiency in state affairs. He was born about
   477, at Scyllacium in Bruttium, the present Squillace in Calabria, the
   extreme southwest division of Italy. His father, whose name was
   Cassiodorus also, was pretorian prefect to Theodoric, and senator. The
   son, in recognition of his extraordinary abilities, was made quaestor
   when about twenty years of age, and continued in the service of
   Theodoric, as private secretary and indeed prime minister, being also
   with him on terms of friendship, until the latter's death, Aug. 30,
   526. He directed the administration of Amalasontha, the daughter of
   Theodoric, during the minority of her son Athalaric, and witnessed her
   downfall (535), but retained his position near the throne under
   Theodatus and Vitiges. He was also consul and three times pretorian
   prefect. He labored earnestly to reconcile the Romans to their
   conquerors.

   But about 540 he withdrew from the cares and dangers of office, and
   found in the seclusion of his charming paternal domains in Bruttium
   abundant scope for his activities in the pursuit of knowledge and the
   preservation of learning. He voluntarily closed one chapter of his
   life, one, too, full of honor and fame, and opened another which,
   little as he expected it, was destined to be of world-wide importance.
   Cassiodorus the statesman became Cassiodorus the monk, and unwittingly
   exchanged the service of the Goths for the service of humanity. The
   place of his retirement was the monastery of Viviers (Monasterium
   Vivariense), at the foot of Mt. Moseius, [980] in southwestern Italy,
   which he had himself founded and richly endowed. Upon the mountain he
   built another monastery (Castellense) in which the less accomplished
   monks seem to have lived, while the society of Viviers was highly
   cultivated and devoted to literature. Those monks who could do it were
   employed in copying and correcting classical and Christian MSS., while
   the others bound books, prepared medicine and cultivated the garden.
   [981] He moved his own large library to the monastery and increased it
   at great expense. Thus Viviers in that sadly confused and degenerate
   time became an asylum of culture and a fountain of learning. The
   example he set was happily followed by other monasteries, particularly
   by the Benedictine, and copying of MSS. was added to the list of
   monastic duties. By this means the literature of the old classical
   world has come down to us. And since the initiation of the movement was
   given by Cassiodorus he deserves to be honored as the link between the
   old thought and the new. His life thus usefully spent was unusually
   prolonged. The year of his death is uncertain, but it was between 570
   and 580.

   The Works of Cassiodorus are quite numerous. They are characterized by
   great erudition, ingenuity and labor, but disfigured by an incorrect
   and artificial style. Some were written while a statesman, more while a
   monk. [982]

   1. The most important is the Miscellany, [983] in twelve books, a
   collection of about four hundred rescripts and edicts issued by
   Cassiodorus in the King's name while Quaestor and Magister officiorum,
   and in his own name while Pretorian prefect. He gives also in the sixth
   and seventh books a collection of formulas for the different offices,
   an idea which found imitation in the Middle Age. From the Miscellany a
   true insight into the state of Italy in the period can be obtained. One
   noticeable feature of these rescripts is the amount of animation and
   variety which Cassiodorus manages to give their naturally stiff and
   formal contents. This he does by ingeniously changing the style to suit
   the occasion and often by interweaving a disquisition upon some
   relevant theme. The work was prepared at the request of friends and as
   a guide to his successors, and published between 534 and 538.

   2. His Ecclesiastical History, called Tripartita, [984] is a
   compilation. His own part in it is confined to a revision of the Latin
   condensation of Sozomen, Socrates and Theodoret, made by Epiphanius
   Scholasticus. It was designed by Cassiodorus to supply the omissions of
   Rufinus' translation of Eusebius, and was indeed with Rufinus the
   monastic text-book on church history in the Middle Age. But it is by no
   means a model work, being obscure, inaccurate and confused.

   3. The Chronicle, [985] the earliest of his productions, dating from
   519, is a consular list drawn from different sources, with occasional
   notes of historical events. Prefaced to the list proper, which goes
   from Junius Brutus to Theodoric, is a very defective list of Assyrian
   (!), Latin and Roman Kings.

   4. The Computation of Easter, written in 562. [986]

   5. Origin and History of the Goths, originally in twelve books, but now
   extant only in the excerpt of Jordanis. [987] In it Cassiodorus reveals
   his great desire to cultivate friendship between the Goths and the
   Romans. It dates from about 534.

   6. Exposition of the Psalter. [988] This is by far the longest, as it
   was in the Middle Age the most influential, of his works. It was
   prepared in Viviers, and was begun before but finished after the
   Institutes [989] (see below). Its chief source is Augustin. The
   exposition is thorough in its way. Its peculiarities are in its mystic
   use of numbers, and its drafts upon profane science, particularly
   rhetoric. [990]

   7. Institutions of Sacred and Secular Letters, [991] from 644, in two
   books, [992] which are commonly regarded as independent works. The
   first book is a sort of theological encyclopaedia, intended by
   Cassiodorus primarily for his own monks. It therefore refers to
   different authors which were to be found in their library. It is in
   thirty-three chapters--a division pointing to the thirty-three years of
   our Lord's life--which treat successively of the books of the Bible,
   what authors to read upon them, the arrangement of the books, church
   history and its chief writers, and the scheme he had devised for
   usefully employing the monks in copying MSS., or, if not sufficiently
   educated, in manual labor of various kinds. In the second book he
   treats in an elementary way of the seven liberal arts (grammar,
   rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy).

   8. On Orthography, [993] a work of his ninety-third year, [994] and a
   mere collection of extracts from the pertinent literature in his
   library.

   9. The Soul, [995] written at the request of friends shortly after the
   publication of his Miscellany. It is rather the product of learning
   than of thought. It treats of the soul, its nature, capacities and
   final destiny.

   10. Notes upon some verses in the Epistles, Acts of the Apostles, and
   Apocalypse [996] This was a product of his monastic period, strangely
   forgotten in the Middle Age. It was unknown to Garet, but found at
   Verona and published by Maffei in 1702. Besides these a Commentarium de
   oratione et de octo partibus orationis is attributed to him and so
   published. [997] But its authorship is doubtful.

   § 154. St. Gregory of Tours.

   I. St. Georgius Florentius Gregorius: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. LXXI.
   (reprint of Ruinart's ed. Paris, 1699). The best critical edition of
   Gregory's great work, Historiae Francorum libri decem, is by W. Arndt
   and Br. Krusch. Hannover, 1884 (Gregorii Turonensis opera pars I. in
   "Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum," T. I., pars I. in the great
   "Monumenta Germaniae historica" series), and of his other works that by
   H. L. Bordier, Libri miraculorum aliaque opera minora, or with the
   French title, Les livres des miracles et autres opuscules de Georges
   Florent Grégoire, evêque de Tours. Paris, 1857- 64, 4 vols., of which
   the first three have the Latin text and a French translation on
   opposite pages, and the last, containing the De cursu stellarum and the
   doubtful works, the Latin only. There are several translations of the
   Historia Francorum into French (e.g., by Guizot. Paris, 1823, new ed.
   1861, 2 vols.; by H. L. Bordier, 1859-61, 2 vols. ), and into German
   (e.g., by Giesebrecht, Berlin, 1851, 2 vols., 2d ed., 1878, as part of
   Pertz, "Geschichtsschreiber der deutschen Vorzeit"). The De cursu
   stellarum was discovered and first edited by F. Hasse, Breslau, 1853.

   II. The Lives of Gregory, by Odo of Cluny (d. 943, valuable, ) Migne,
   l.c., and by Joannes Egidius (Jean Gilles of Tours, 16th cent., of
   small account) are given by Bordier, l.c. IV. 212-237. Modern

   Epitomata and to the Gesta regum Francorum. He maintains that they are
   independent. Cf. W. Arndt's preface (30pp.) to edition mentioned above.

   Georgius Florentius, or as he called himself on his consecration
   Gregorius, after his mother's grand-father, the sainted bishop of
   Langres, was born in Arverna (now Clermont), [998] the principal city
   of Auvergne, Nov. 30., 538. His family was of senatorial rank on both
   sides, and its position and influence are attested by the number of
   bishops that belonged to it. His father (Florentius) apparently died
   early, and his mother (Armentaria) removed to Burgundy, her native
   country, but his uncle Gallus, bishop of Auvergne, who died in 554, and
   Avitus the successor of Gallus, cared for his education. He entered the
   church in discharge of a vow made at the shrine of St. Illidius, the
   patron saint of Arverna, during a severe and supposed fatal illness. In
   563 he was ordained deacon by Avitus, and served in some ecclesiastical
   capacity at the court of Sigebert king of Austrasia, until in 573, at
   the unanimous request of the clergy and people of that city, the king
   appointed him bishop of Tours. Although loath to take so prominent and
   responsible a position, he at last consented, was consecrated by
   Egidius, archbishop of Rheims, and welcomed by Fortunatus in an
   official, which yet had more real feeling in it than such productions
   usually have, and was a true prophecy of Gregory's career.

   Tours was the religious centre of Gaul. The shrine of St. Martin was
   the most famous in the land and so frequented by pilgrims that it was
   the source of an immense revenue. In Alcuin's day (eighth century) the
   monastery of Tours owned 20,000 serfs, and was the richest in the
   kingdom. Tours was also important as the frontier city of Austrasia,
   particularly liable to attack. The influences which secured the
   position to Gregory were probably personal. Several facts operated to
   bring it about. First, that all but five of the bishops of Tours had
   been members of his family (Euphronius whom he succeeded was his
   mother's cousin), and further, that he was in Tours on a pilgrimage to
   the shrine of St. Martin to recover his health about the time of
   Euphronius' death, and by his life there secured the love of the
   people. Add to this his travels, his austerities, his predominant love
   for religion, and his election is explained. [999] Gregory found the
   position no sinecure. War broke out between Sigebert and the savage
   Chilperic, and Tours was taken by the latter in 575. Confusion and
   anarchy prevailed. Churches were destroyed, ecclesiastics killed. Might
   made right, and the weak went to the wall. But in that dark and
   tempestuous time Gregory of Tours shines like a beacon light. The
   persecuted found in him a refuge; the perplexed a guide; the wicked
   king a determined opponent. Vigilant, sleepless, untiring in his care
   for Tours he averted an attempt to tax it unjustly; he maintained the
   sanctuary rights of St. Martin against all avengers; and he put an end
   to partisan strifes. His influence was exerted in the neighboring
   country. Such was his well earned repute for holiness founded upon
   innumerable services that the lying accusation of Leudastes at the
   council of Braine (580) excited popular indignation and was refuted by
   his solemn declaration of innocence. [1000]

   In 584 Chilperic died. Tours then fell to Guntram, king of Orleans,
   until in 587 it was restored to Childebert, the son of Sigebert. The
   last nine years of Gregory's life were comparatively quiet. He enjoyed
   the favor of Guntram and Childebert, did much to beautify the city of
   Tours, built many churches, and particularly the church of St. Martin
   (590). But at length the time of his release came, and on Nov. 17, 594,
   he went to his reward. His saintship was immediately recognized by the
   people he had served, and the Latin Church formally beatified and
   canonized him. His day in the calendar is November l7.

   The Works of Gregory were all produced while bishop. Their number
   attests his diligence, but their style proves the correctness of his
   own judgment that he was not able to write good Latin. Only one is of
   real importance, but that is simply inestimable, as it is the only
   abundant source for French history of the fifth and sixth centuries. It
   is the Ecclesiastical History of the Franks, in ten books, [1001] begun
   in 576, and not finished until 592. By reason of it Gregory has been
   styled the Herodotus of France. It was his object to tell the history
   of his own times for the benefit of posterity, although he was aware of
   his own unfitness for the task. But like the chroniclers of the period
   he must needs begin with Adam, and it is not till the close of the
   first book that the history of Gaul properly begins. The last five
   books tell the story of the events in Gregory's own life-time, and have
   therefore most value. Gregory is not a model historian, but when
   speaking of facts within his experience he is reliable in his
   statements, and impartial in his narrative, although partial in his
   judgments.

   Gregory gives at the close of his Ecclesiastical History a catalogue of
   his writings, all of which have been preserved, with the exception of
   the commentary on the Psalms, of which only the preface and the titles
   of the chapters are now extant. [1002] The complete list is as follows:
   [1003] The Miracles of St. Martin, in four books, begun in 574,
   finished 594; the miracles were recorded by direction of Gregory's
   mother, who appeared to him in a vision; The Passion of St. Julian the
   Martyr, written between 582 and 586; The Martyr's Glory, written about
   586; The Confessor's Glory, about 588; The Lives of the Fathers,
   written at different times and finished in 594. The last is the most
   interesting and important of these hagiographical works, which do not
   call for further mention. [1004] The Course of the Stars, or as Gregory
   calls it, The Ecclsiastical Circuit, is a liturgical work, giving the
   proper offices at the appearance of the most important stars.

   Isidore of Seville, saint and doctor of the Latin Church, was born
   about 560 either at Carthagena or Seville. He was the youngest child of
   an honored Roman family of the orthodox Christian faith. His father's
   name was Severianus. His eldest brother, Leander, the well-known friend
   of Gregory the Great, and the successful upholder of the Catholic faith
   against Arianism, was archbishop of Seville, the most prominent see in
   Spain, from about 579 to 600; another brother, Fulgentius, was bishop
   of Astigi (Ecija) in that diocese, where his sister, Florentina, was a
   nun. [1005] Isidore is called Senior to distinguish him from Isidore of
   Pax Julia, now Beja (Isidorus Pacensis), and Junior to distinguish him
   from Isidore of Cordova. His parents died apparently while he was quite
   young. At all events he was educated by his brother Leander. In the
   year 600 he succeeded his brother in the archiepiscopate of Seville. In
   this position he became the great leader of the Spanish Church, and is
   known to have presided at two, councils, the second council of Seville,
   opened November 13, 619, and the fourth council of Toledo, opened
   December 5, 633. [1006] The first of these was of local interest, but
   the other was much more important. It was the largest ever held in
   Spain, being attended by all the six metropolitans, fifty-six bishops
   and seven bishops' deputies. It has political significance because it
   was called by King Sisenand, who had just deposed Suintila, the former
   king. Sisenand was received by the council with great respect. He threw
   himself before the bishops and with tears asked their prayers. He then
   exhorted them to do their duty in correcting abuses. Of the
   seventy-five canons passed by the council several are of curious
   interest. Thus it was forbidden to plunge the recipient of baptism more
   than once under the water, because the Arians did it three times to
   indicate that the Trinity was divided (c. 6). It was not right to
   reject all the hymns written by Hilary and Ambrose and employ only
   Scriptural language in public worship (c. 13). If a clergyman is ever
   made a judge by the king he must exact an oath from the king that no
   blood is to be shed in his court (c. 31). By order of King Sisenand the
   clergy were freed from all state taxes and services (c. 47). Once a
   monk always a monk, although one was made so by his parents (c. 49)
   [1007] While compulsory conversion of the Jews was forbidden, yet no
   Jew converted by force was allowed to return to Judaism (c. 57). Very
   strenuous laws were passed relative to both the baptized and the
   unbaptized Jews (c. 58-66). The king was upheld in his government and
   the deposed king and his family perpetually excluded from power. When
   Isidore's position is considered it is a probable conjecture that these
   canons express his opinions and convictions upon the different matters.

   Warned by disease of death's approach, Isidore began the distribution
   of his property. For the last six months of his life he dispensed alms
   from morn till night. His end was highly edifying. Accompanied by his
   assembled bishops he had himself carried to the church of St. Vincent
   the Martyr, and there, having publicly confessed his sins, prayed God
   for forgiveness. He then asked the pardon and prayers of those present,
   gave away the last thing he owned, received the Holy Communion, and was
   carried to his cell, in which he died four days later, Thursday, April
   4, 636. [1008] He was immediately enrolled among the popular saints and
   in the 15th council of Toledo (688) is styled "excellent doctor," and
   by Benedict XIV. (April 25, 1722) made a Doctor of the Church.

   Isidore of Seville was the greatest scholar of his day. He was well
   read in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, in profane as well as in sacred and
   patristic literature. He was also a vigorous and dignified prelate,
   admired for his wondrous eloquence and beloved for his private virtues.
   He did much for education, especially of the clergy, and established at
   Seville a highly successful school, in which he himself taught. But his
   universal fame rests upon his literary works, which embrace every
   branch of knowledge then cultivated, and which though almost entirely
   compilations can not be too highly praised for their ability and
   usefulness. He performed the inestimable service of perpetuating
   learning, both sacred and secular. It is a striking testimony to his
   greatness that works have been attributed to him with which he had
   nothing to do, as the revision of the Mozarabic Liturgy and of Spanish
   ecclesiastical, and secular laws, and especially the famous
   Pseudo-Isidorian decretals.

   His Works may be divided loosely into six classes. We have two lists of
   them, one by his friend and colleague Braulio, bishop of Saragossa, and
   the other by his pupil, Ildefonsus of Toledo. No strict division of
   these works is possible, because as will be seen several of them belong
   in parts to different classes.

   I. Biblical. This class embraces, 1. Scripture Allegorics, [1009]
   allegorical explanations, each in a single sentence, of 129 names and
   passages in the Old Testament, and of 211 in the New Testament; a
   curious and, in its way, valuable treatise, compiled from the older
   commentaries. 2. Lives and Deaths of Biblical Saints. [1010] Very brief
   biographies of sixty-four Old Testament and twenty-one New Testament
   worthies. 3. Introductions in the Old and New Testaments, [1011] a very
   general introduction to the entire Bible, followed by brief accounts of
   the several books, including Esdras and Maccabees. The four Gospels,
   the epistles, of Paul, Peter and John are treated together in
   respective sections. Acts comes between Jude and Revelation. It was
   compiled from different authors. 4. Scripture Numbers [1012] (1-16,
   18-20, 24, 30, 40, 46, 50, 60), mystically interpreted. Thus under one,
   the church is one, the Mediator is one. Under two, there are two
   Testaments, two Seraphim, two Cherubim. 5. Questions on the Old and New
   Testaments, [1013] a Biblical catechism of forty-one questions and
   answers. Some are very trivial. 6. Expositions of Holy Mysteries, or
   Questions on the Old Testament, [1014] a paraphrase of Genesis, and
   notes upon Joshua, Judges, the four books of Kings, Ezra and Maccabees.
   The work is compiled from Origen, Victorinus, Ambrose, Jerome,
   Augustin, Fulgentius, Cassianus and Gregory the Great. A summary of
   each chapter of the books mentioned is given. The exposition is
   allegorical.

   II. Dogmatic. 1. The Catholic Faith defended against the Jews. [1015] A
   treatise in two books, dedicated to his sister Florentina, the nun. In
   the first book he marshals the Scripture prophecies and statements
   relative to Christ, and shows how they have been verified. In the
   second book in like manner he treats of the call of the Gentiles, the
   unbelief of the Jews and their consequent rejection, the destruction of
   Jerusalem, the abolition of the ceremonial law, and closes with a brief
   statement of Christian doctrine. The work was doubtless an honest
   attempt to win the Jews over to Christianity, and Spain in the 7th
   century was full of Jews. Whatever may have been its success as an
   apology, it was very popular in the Middle Age among Christians, and
   was translated into several languages. [1016] 2. Three books of
   Sentences, [1017] compiled from Augustin and Gregory the Great's
   Moralia. This work is a compend of theology, and is Isidore's most
   important production in this class. Its influence has been
   incalculable. Innumerable copies were made of it during the Middle Age,
   and it led to the preparation of similar works, e.g., Peter Lombard's
   Sentences. [1018] 3. Synonyms, in two books; [1019] the first is a
   dialogue between sinful and despairing Man and Reason (or the Logos),
   who consoles him, rescues him from despair, shows him that sin is the
   cause of his misery, and sets him on the heavenly way. The second is a
   discourse by Reason upon vices and their opposite virtues. [1020]

   4. The Order of Creation. [1021] It treats of the Trinity, the
   creation, the devil and demons, paradise, fallen man, purgatory, and
   the future life.

   III. Ecclesiastic and monastic. 1. The Ecclesiastical Offices, i.e.,
   the old Spanish liturgy. [1022] It is dedicated to his brother
   Fulgentius, and is in two books, for the most part original. The first
   is called "the origin of the offices," and treats of choirs, psalms,
   hymns and other topics in ecclesiastical archaeology. Under the head
   "sacrifice" [1023] Isidore expresses his view of the Lord's Supper,
   which is substantially that "Body and Blood" denote the consecrated
   elements, but not that these are identical with the Body and Blood of
   our Lord. The second book, "the origin of the ministry," treats of the
   different clerical grades; also of monks, penitents, virgins, widows,
   the married, catechumens, the rule of faith, baptism, chrism, laying on
   of hands and confirmation. 2. A Monastic Rule. [1024] It was designed
   for Spanish monasteries, drawn from old sources, and resembles the
   Benedictine, with which, however, it is not identical. It throws much
   light upon the contemporary Spanish monasticism, as it discusses the
   situation of the monastery, the choice of the abbot, the monks, their
   duties, meals, festivals, fasts, dress, punishment, sickness and death.
   It recalls the somewhat similar Institutes of Cassiodorus already
   mentioned. [1025]

   IV. Educational and philosophical. 1. Twenty books of Etymologies.
   [1026] This is his greatest work, and considering its date truly an
   astonishing work. Caspar Barth's list of the one hundred and fifty-four
   authors quoted in it shows Isidore's wide reading. Along with many
   Christian writers are the following classic authors: Aesop, Anacreon,
   Apuleius, Aristotle, Boëthius, Caesar, Cato, Catullus, Celsus, Cicero,
   Demosthenes, Ennius, Herodotus, Hesiod, Homer, Horace, Juvenal, Livy,
   Lucan, Lucretius, Martial, Ovid, Persius, Pindar, Plato, Plautus,
   Pliny, Quintilian, Sallust, Suetonius, Terence, Varro, Virgil. [1027]
   It is a concise encyclopedia of universal learning, embracing the seven
   liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry,
   music, and astronomy), and medicine, law, chronology, angelology,
   mineralogy, architecture, agriculture and many other topics. Although
   much of his information is erroneous, and the tenth book, that of
   Etymology proper, is full of absurdities, the work as a whole is worthy
   of high praise. It was authoritative throughout Europe for centuries
   and repeatedly copied and printed. Rabanus Maurus drew largely upon it
   for his De Universo. 2. The Differences, or the proper signification of
   terms, [1028] in two books. The first treats of the differences of
   words. It is a dictionary of synonyms and of words which sound somewhat
   alike, arranged alphabetically. The second book treats of the
   differences of things, and is a dictionary of theology, brief yet
   comprehensive. 3. On the Nature of Things, [1029] in forty-eight
   chapters, dedicated to King Sisebut (612-620), who had given him the
   subject. It is a sort of natural philosophy, treating of the divisions
   of time, the heavens and the earth and the waters under the earth. It
   also has illustrative diagrams. Like Isidore's other works it is a
   skilful compilation from patristic and profane authors, [1030] and was
   extremely popular in the Middle Age.

   V. Historical. 1. A Chronicle, [1031] containing the principal events
   in the world from the creation to 616. It is divided into six periods
   or ages, corresponding to the six days of creation, a division plainly
   borrowed from Augustin. [1032] Its sources are Julius Africanus,
   Eusebius, Jerome, and Victor of Tunnena. [1033] 2. History of the
   Goths, Vandals and Suevi, [1034] brought down to 61. A work which, like
   Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks, is the only source for certain
   periods. It has been remarked [1035] that Isidore, like Cassiodorus, in
   spite of his Roman origin, had a high regard for the Goths. 3. Famous
   Men [1036] a continuation of Gennadius' appendix to Jerome's work with
   the same title. It sketches forty-six authors, beginning with Bishop
   Hosius of Cordova, and extending to the beginning of the seventh
   century.

   VI. Miscellaneous. Under this head come thirteen brief Letters [1037]
   and minor works of doubtful genuineness. There are also numerous
   spurious works which bear his name, among which are hymns.

   § 156. The Venerable Bede (Baeda).

   I. Venerabilis Baeda: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. XC.-XCV.,
   substantially a reprint of Dr. J. A. Giles' edition. London, 1843-1844,
   12 vols. His Ecclesiastical History (Historica ecclesiastica) has been
   often edited, e.g. by John Smith, Cambridge, 1722; Joseph Stevenson,
   London, 1838, and in the Monumenta historica Britannica I. 1848; George
   H. Moberley, Oxford, 1869; Alfred Holder, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1882.
   Books III.-V. 24 were separately ed. by John E. B. Mayor and John R.
   Lumby, Cambridge, 1878. The best known English translation of the
   History is Dr. Giles' in his edition, and since 1844 in Bohn's
   Antiquarian Library. His scientific writings are contained in Thomas
   Wright: Popular Treatises on Science written during the Middle Ages.
   London, 1841. Marshall translated his Explanation of the Apocalypse,
   London, 1878. For further bibliographical information regarding the
   editions of Bede's History, see Giles' ed. ii. 5-8.

   II. Biographies are contained in the above-mentioned editions. Hist. V.
   24, and the letter on his death by Cuthbert (Giles' trans. in Bohn, pp.
   xviii.-xxi.) are the best original sources. The old Vitae given in the
   complete editions are almost worthless. Modern works are Henrik Gehle:
   Disputatio historico-theologica de Bedae venerabilis presbyteri
   Anglo-Saxonis vita et scriptis. Leyden, 1838. Carl Schoell: De
   ecclesiasticae Britonum Scotorumque historiae fontibus. Berlin, 1851.
   Karl Werner: Beda der Ehrwürdige und seine Zeit. Wien, 1875. 2d ed.
   (unchanged), 1881. Geo. F. Browne: The Venerable Bede. London, 1879.

   The Venerable Bede (properly Baeda) is never spoken of without
   affectionate interest, and yet so uneventful was his useful life that
   very little can be said about him personally. He was born in 673,
   probably in the village of Jarrow, on the south bank of the Tyne,
   Northumbria, near the Scottish border. At the age of seven, being
   probably an orphan, he was placed in the monastery of St. Peter, at
   Wearmouth, on the north bank of the Wear, which had been founded by
   Benedict Biscop in 674. In 682 he was transferred to the newly-founded
   sister monastery of St. Paul, five miles off, at Jarrow. [1038] He is
   not known ever to have gone away from it farther than to the sister
   monastery and to visit friends in contiguous places, such as York. The
   stories of his visit to Rome and professorship at Cambridge scarcely
   deserve mention. His first teacher was Benedict Biscop, a nobleman who
   at twenty-five became a monk and freely put his property and his
   learning at the public service. Biscop traveled five times to Rome and
   each time returned, like Ethelbert and Alcuin subsequently, laden with
   rich literary spoils and also with pictures and relics. Thus the
   library at Wearmouth became the largest and best appointed in England
   at the time. [1039] It was Biscop's enterprise and liberality which
   rendered it possible that Bede's natural taste for learning should
   receive such careful culture. So amid the wealth of books he acquired
   Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and laid up a rich store of multifarious
   knowledge. Such was his character and attainments that at nineteen, six
   years before the then canonical age, he was ordained deacon, and at
   thirty a priest. He thus describes his mode of life: "All the remaining
   time of my life [i.e., after leaving Wearmouth] I spent in that,
   monastery [of Jarrow], wholly applying myself to the study of
   Scripture, and amidst observance of regular discipline and the daily
   care of singing in the church. I always took delight in learning,
   teaching and writing. [1040] He declined to be abbot because the
   office, as he said, demands close attention, and therefore cares come
   which impede the pursuit of learning. As it was, the "pursuit of
   learning" took up only a portion of his time, for the necessary duties
   of a monk were many, [1041] and such a man as Bede would be frequently
   required to preach. It appears that he published nothing before he was
   thirty years old, for he says himself: "From which time [i.e., of his
   taking priest's orders] till the fifty-ninth year of my age, I have
   made it my business, for the use of me and mine, to compile out of the
   works of the venerable Fathers, and to interpret and explain according
   to their meaning these following pieces." [1042] Then follows his list
   of his works. The result of such study and writing was that Bede became
   the most learned man of his time, and also the greatest of its authors.
   Yet he was also one of the humblest and simplest of men.

   He died on Wednesday, May 26, 735, of a complaint accompanied with
   asthma, from which he had long suffered. The circumstances of his death
   are related by his pupil Cuthbert. [1043] During Lent of the year 735
   Bede carried on the translation of the Gospel of John and "some
   collections out of the Book of Notes" of Archbishop Isidore of Seville.
   The day before he died he spent in dictating his translations, saying
   now and then, "Go on quickly, I know not how long I shall hold out, and
   whether my Maker will not soon take me away." He progressed so far with
   his rendering of John's Gospel that at the third hour on Wednesday
   morning only one chapter remained to be done. On being told this he
   said, "Take your pen, and make ready, and write fast." The scribe did
   so, but at the ninth hour Bede said to Cuthbert, ' "I have some little
   articles of value in my chest, such as pepper, napkins and incense: run
   quickly, and bring the priests of our monastery to me, that I may
   distribute among them the gifts which God has bestowed on me. The rich
   in this world are bent on giving gold and silver and other precious
   things. But I, in charity, will joyfully give my brothers what God has
   given unto me." He spoke to every one of them, admonishing and
   entreating them that they would carefully say masses and prayers for
   him, which they readily promised; but they all mourned and wept,
   especially because he said, "they should no more see his face in this
   world." They rejoiced for that he said, "It is time that I return to
   Him who formed me out of nothing: I have lived long; my merciful Judge
   well foresaw my life for me; the time of my dissolution draws nigh; for
   I desire to die and to be with Christ." Having said much more, he
   passed the day joyfully till the evening, and the boy [i.e., his
   scribe] said, "Dear master, there is yet one sentence not written." He
   answered, "Write quickly." Soon after the boy said, "It is ended." He
   replied, "It is well, you have said the truth. It is ended. Receive my
   head into your hands, for it is a great satisfaction to me to sit
   facing my holy place, where I was wont to pray, that I may also sitting
   call upon my Father." And thus on the pavement of his little cell,
   singing, "Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
   Ghost," when he had named the Holy Ghost, he breathed his last, and so
   departed to the heavenly kingdom."

   Bede's body was buried in the church at Jarrow, but between 1021 and
   1042 it was stolen and removed to Durham by Elfred, a priest of its
   cathedral, who put it in the same chest with the body of St. Cuthbert.
   In 1104 the bodies were separated, and in 1154 the relics of Bede were
   placed in a shrine of gold and silver, adorned with jewels. This shrine
   was destroyed by an ignorant mob in Henry VIII's time (1541), and only
   a monkish inscription remains to chronicle the fact that Bede was ever
   buried there.

   The epithet, "Venerable," now so commonly applied to Bede, is used by
   him to denote a holy man who had not been canonized, and had no more
   reference to age than the same name applied to-day to an archdeacon in
   the Church of England. By his contemporaries he was called either
   Presbyter or Dominus. He is first called the Venerable in the middle of
   the tenth century.

   Bede's Writings are very numerous, and attest the width and profundity
   of his learning, and also the independence and soundness of his
   judgment. "Having centred in himself and his writings nearly all the
   knowledge of his day, he was enabled before his death, by promoting the
   foundation of the school of York, to kindle the flame of learning in
   the West at the moment that it seemed both in Ireland and in France to
   be expiring. The school of York transmitted to Alcuin the learning of
   Bede, and opened the way for culture on the continent, when England
   under the terrors of the Danes was relapsing into barbarism." His fame,
   if we may judge from the demand for his works immediately after his
   death, extended wherever the English missionaries or negotiators found
   their way." [1044]

   Bede himself, perhaps in imitation of Gregory of Tours, [1045] gives a
   list of his works at the conclusion of his History. [1046] There are
   few data to tell when any one of them was composed. The probable dates
   are given in the following general account and enumeration of his
   genuine writings. Very many other, writings have been attributed to
   him. [1047]

   I. Educational treatises. (a) On orthography [1048] (about 700). The
   words are divided alphabetically. (b) On prosody [1049] (702). (c) On
   the Biblical figures and tropes. [1050] (d) On the nature of things
   [1051] (702), a treatise upon natural philosophy. (e) On the times
   [1052] (702). (f) On the order of times [1053] (702). (g) On the
   computation of time [1054] (726). (h) On the celebration of Easter.
   [1055] (i) On thunder. [1056]

   II. Expository works. These are compilations from the Fathers, which
   originally were carefully assigned by marginal notes to their proper
   source, but the notes have been obliterated in the course of frequent
   copying. He wrote either on the whole or a part of the Pentateuch,
   Samuel, Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, the Twelve Minor Prophets, Tobit, Matthew,
   Mark, Luke, John, Catholic Epistles and the Apocalypse. [1057] His
   comments are of course made upon the Latin Bible, but his scholarship
   comes out in the frequent correction and emendation of the Latin text
   by reference to the original. The most frequent subject of remark is
   the want of an article in the Latin, which gave rise to frequent
   ambiguity. [1058] Throughout he shows himself a careful textual
   student. [1059]

   III. Homilies. [1060] These are mostly doctrinal and objective. The
   fact that they were delivered to a monastic audience explains their
   infrequent allusion to current events or to daily life. They are calm
   and careful expositions of passages of Scripture rather than compact or
   stirring sermons.

   IV. Poetry. [1061] Most of the poetry attributed to him is spurious.
   But a few pieces are genuine, such as the hymn in his History upon
   Virginity, in honor of Etheldrida, the virgin wife of King Egfrid;
   [1062] the metrical version of the life of Saint Cuthbert and of the
   Passion of Justin Martyr, and some other pieces. The Book of Hymns, of
   which he speaks in his own list of his writings, is apparently lost.

   V. Epistles. [1063] These are sixteen in number. The second, addressed
   to the Archbishop Egbert of York, is the most interesting. It dates
   from 734, and gives a word-picture of the time which shows how bad it
   was. [1064] Even the archbishop himself comes in for faithful rebuke.
   Bede had already made him one visit and expected to make him another,
   but being prevented wrote to him what he desired to tell him by word of
   mouth. The chief topics of the letter are the avarice of the bishops
   and the disorders of the religious houses. After dwelling upon these
   and kindred topics at considerable length, Bede concludes by saying
   that if he had treated drunkenness, gluttony, luxury and other
   contagious diseases of the body politic his letter would have been
   immoderately long. The third letter, addressed to the abbot of Plegwin,
   is upon the Six Ages of the World. Most of the remainder are
   dedicatory.

   VI. Hagiographies. [1065] (a) Lives of the five holy abbots of
   Wearmouth and Jarrow, Benedict, Ceolfrid, Easterwine, Sigfrid and
   Huetberct. The work is divided into two books, of which the first
   relates to Benedict. (b) The prose version of the Life of St. Cuthbert
   of Lindisfarne. The poetical version already spoken of, is earlier in
   time and different in character in as much as it dwells more upon
   Cuthbert's miracles. The prose version has for its principal source an
   older life of Cuthbert still extant, and relates many facts along with
   evident fictions. Great pains were bestowed upon it and it was even
   submitted for criticism, prior to publication, to the monks of
   Lindisfarne. (c) The life of Felix of Nola, Confessor, a prose version
   of the life already written by Paulinus of Nola. (d) Martyrology. It is
   drawn from old Roman sources, and shows at once the learning and the
   simplicity of its author.

   VII. Ecclesiastical History of England. [1066] This is Bede's great
   work. Begun at the request of King Ceolwulf, it was his occupation for
   many years, and was only finished a short time before his death. It
   consists of five books and tells in a simple, clear style the history
   of England from the earliest times down to 731. The first twenty-two
   chapters of the first book are compiled from Orosius and Gildas, but
   from the mission of Augustin in the 23d chapter (a.d. 596) it rests
   upon original investigation. Bede took great pains to ensure accuracy,
   and he gives the names of all persons who were helpful to him. The
   History is thus the chief and in many respects the only source for the
   church history of England down to the eighth century. In it as in his
   other books Bede relates a great many strange things; but he is careful
   to give his authorities for each statement. It is quite evident,
   however, that he believed in these "miracles," many of which are
   susceptible of rational explanation. It is from this modest, simple,
   conscientious History that multitudes have learned to love the
   Venerable Bede.

   Paul the Deacon (Paulus Diaconus), the historian of the Lombards, was
   the son of Warnefrid and Theudelinda. Hence he is frequently called
   Paul Warnefrid. He was descended from a noble Lombard family and was
   born in Forum Julii (Friuli, Northern Italy), probably between 720 and
   725. His education was completed at the court of King Liutprand in
   Pavia. His attainments included a knowledge of Greek, rare in that age.
   Under the influence of Ratchis, Liutprand's successor (744-749), he
   entered the church and became a deacon. King Desiderius (756-774) made
   him his chancellor, [1067] and entrusted to his instruction his
   daughter Adelperga, the wife of Arichis, duke of Benevento. In 774 the
   Lombard kingdom fell, and Paul after residing for a time at the duke's
   court entered the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino. There he
   contentedly lived until fraternal love led him to leave his beloved
   abode. In 776 his brother, Arichis, having probably participated in
   Hruodgaud's rebellion, was taken prisoner by Charlemagne, carried into
   France, and the family estates were confiscated. This brought the
   entire family to beggary. [1068]

   Paul sought Charlemagne; in a touching little poem of twenty-eight
   lines, probably written in Gaul in 782, he set the pitiful case before
   him [1069] and implored the great king's clemency.

   He did not plead in vain. He would then at once have returned to Monte
   Cassino, but Charlemagne, always anxious to retain in his immediate
   service learned and brilliant men., did not allow him to go. He was
   employed as court poet, teacher of Greek, and scribe, and thus exerted
   great influence. His heart was, however, in his monastery, and in 787
   he is found there. The remainder of his life was busily employed in
   literary labors. He died, April 13, probably in the year 800, with an
   unfinished work, the history of the Lombards, upon his hands.

   Paul was a Christian scholar, gentle, loving, and beloved; ever
   learning and disseminating learning. Although not a great man, he was a
   most useful one, and his homilies and histories of the Lombards are
   deservedly held in high esteem.

   His Works embrace histories, homilies, letters, and poems.

   I. Histories. (1) Chief in importance is the History of the Lombards.
   [1070] It is divided into six books, and carries the history of the
   Lombards from their rise in Scandinavia down to the death of Liutprand
   in 744. It was evidently Paul's intention to continue and revise the
   work, for it has no preface or proper conclusion; moreover, it has
   manifest slips in writing, which would have been corrected by a final
   reading. It is therefore likely that he died before its completion. It
   is not a model of historical composition, being discursive, indefinite
   as to chronology, largely a compilation from known and unknown sources,
   full of legendary and irrelevant matter. Nevertheless it is on the
   whole well arranged and exhibits a love of truth, independence and
   impartiality. Though a patriot, Paul was not a partisan. He can see
   some good even in his hereditary foes. The popularity of the History in
   the Middle Age is attested by the appearance of more than fifteen
   editions of it and of ten continuations.

   (2) Some scholars [1071] consider the History of the Lombards the
   continuation of Paul's Roman History, [1072] which he compiled (c. 770)
   for Adelperga from Eutropius (Breviarum historiae Romanae); [1073]
   Jerome, Orosius (Historia adversus Paganos), [1074] Aurelius Victor (De
   Caesaribus historia), Jordanis (De breviatione chronicorum), [1075]
   Prosper (Chronicon), [1076] Bede and others. The Historia is in sixteen
   books, of which the first ten are mere excerpts of Eutropius, with
   insertions from other sources. The last six carry the history from
   Valens, where Eutropius ends, down to Justinian. The plan of these
   latter books is the same as that of the former: some author is
   excerpted, and in the excerpts are inserted extracts from other
   writers. The History is worthless to us, but in the Middle Age it was
   extremely popular. To the sixteen books of Paul's were added eight from
   the Church History of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, and the whole called
   Historia Miscella, and to it Landulph Sagax wrote an appendix, which
   brings the work down to 813.

   Besides these histories several other briefer works in the same line
   have come down to us.

   (3) Life of St. Gregory the Great, [1077] a compilation from Bede's
   Church History of England, and Gregory's own works.

   (4) A short History of the bishopric of Metz. [1078] It was written
   about 784, at the request of Angilram, bishop of Metz. It is in good
   part only a list of names. In order to please Charlemagne, Paul
   inserted irrelevantly a section upon that monarch's ancestry.

   II. Homilies. [1079] A collection made by request of Charlemagne, and
   which for ten centuries was in use in the Roman Church. It is in three
   series. 1. Homilies upon festivals, two hundred and two in number, all
   from the Fathers. 2. Homilies upon saints' days, ninety-six in number.
   3. Homilies, five in number. Many of the second series and all of the
   last appear to be original.

   III. Letters, [1080] four in number, two to Charlemagne, one each to
   Adalhard, abbot of Corbie, in France, and to the abbot Theudemar.

   IV. Poems, including epitaphs. [1081] From the first stanza of De
   Sancto Joanne Baptista, Guido of Arezzo took the names of the musical
   notes.

   § 158. St. Paulinus of Aquileia.

   I. Sanctus Paulinus, patriarcha Aquileiensis: Opera omnia, in Migne,
   Tom. XCIX. col. 9-684, reprint of Madrisius' ed., Venice, 1737, folio,
   2d ed. 1782. His poems are given by Dümmler: Poet. Lat. aevi Carolini
   I. (Berlin, 1880), pp. 123-148.

   II. Vita Paulini, by Madrisius in Migne's ed. col. 17-130. Cf. Du Pin,
   VI. 124. Ceillier, XII. 157-164. Hist. litt. de la France, IV. 284-295;
   Bähr: Geschichte der römischen Literatur im Karolingischen Zeitalter,
   Carlsruhe, 1840 (pp. 88, 356-359); Ebert, II., 89-91.

   Paulinus, patriarch of Aquileia, was born about 726 [1082] in Forum
   Julii, now Friuli, near Venice. He entered the priesthood, was employed
   in teaching and arrived at eminence as a scholar. He played a prominent
   part in the affairs of his country, and his services in suppressing a
   Lombard insurrection met, in the year 776, with recognition and reward
   by Charlemagne, who gave him an estate and in 787 elevated him to the
   patriarchal see of Aquileia. [1083] He carried on a successful mission
   among the Carinthians, a tribe which lived near Aquileia, and also
   another among their neighbors, the Avari (the Huns). [1084] He opposed
   with vigor the Adoptionists, and his writings contributed much to the
   extinction of the sect. He lived entirely for God and his church, and
   won the hearts of his spiritual children. Perhaps the most striking
   proof of his virtue is the warm friendship which existed between
   himself and Alcuin. The latter is very, enthusiastic in his praise of
   the learning and accomplishments of Paulinus. Charlemagne seems to have
   valued him no less. [1085] With such encouragement Paulinus led a busy
   and fruitful life, participating in synods and managing wisely his see
   until his death on January 11, 804. [1086] Very, soon thereafter he was
   popularly numbered among the saints, [1087] and stories began to be
   told of his miraculous powers. [1088] His bones were deposited in the
   high altar of the collegiate church of Friuli, or as the place was
   called Civitas Austriae. The church underwent repairs, and his bones
   were for a time laid by those of the martyr Donatus, but at length on
   January 26, 1734, they were separated and with much pomp placed in the
   chapel under the choir of the great basilica of Friuli. [1089]

   The writings of Paulinus comprise (1) Brief treatise against Elipandus,
   [1090] archbishop of Toledo and primate of Spain, who is generally
   regarded as the father of Adoptionism. It was issued in the name of the
   council of Frankfort-on-the-Main (794), and sent into Spain. It was
   first published by Jean de Tillet, in 1549. (2) Three books against
   Felix of Urgel, [1091] also against the Adoptionists. It was prepared
   in 796 by order of Charlemagne, and probably submitted to Alcuin,
   agreeably to the author's request. [1092] It is the most important work
   of Paulinus, though by no means the best in point of style. The Felix
   addressed was bishop of Urgel and the leader of the Adoptionists.
   Paulinus refutes the heretics by quotations of Scripture and the
   Fathers. The work is elaborately annotated by Madrisius, and thus
   rendered much more intelligible. [1093] (3) A deliverance by the
   council of Friuli, held in 796, upon the Trinity and the Incarnation.
   [1094] (4) An exhortation to virtue, [1095] addressed to Henry, count
   or duke of Friuli. It was written about 795, and consists of sixty-six
   chapters upon the virtues to be practiced and the vices to be shunned
   by the duke. The style is excellent. The work was once claimed for
   Augustin, but this is now conceded to be an error. Nine of the chapters
   (x.-xv. xvii.-xix. ) are copied from The contemplative life, a work by
   Pomerius, a Gallican churchman of the fifth century. On the other hand,
   chapters xx.-xlv. have been plagiarized in an Admonitio ad filium
   spiritualem which was long supposed to be by Basil the Great. [1096]

   (5) Epistles. (a) To Heistulfus, [1097] who had murdered his wife on a
   charge of adultery preferred against her by a man of bad character. It
   was written from Frankfort, in 794, during the council mentioned above.
   Paulinus sternly rebukes Heistulfus for his crime, and tells him that
   if he would be saved he must either enter a monastery or lead a life of
   perpetual penitence, of which he gives an interesting description. The
   letter passed into the Canon Law about 866. [1098] It has been falsely
   attributed to Stephen V. [1099] (b) To Charlemagne, [1100] an account
   of the council of Altinum [1101] in 803. (c) Fragments of three other
   letters to Charlemagne, and of one (probably) to Leo III. [1102]

   (6) Verses. (a) The rule of faith, [1103] a poem of one hundred and
   fifty-one hexameters, devoid of poetical merit, in which along with a
   statement of his belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation Paulinus
   gives a curious description of Paradise and of Gehenna, and to the
   latter sends the heretics, several of whom he names. (b) Hymns and
   verses, [1104] upon different subjects. (c) A poem on duke Eric. [1105]

   (7) A Mass. [1106]

   (8) The preface to a tract upon repentance [1107] which enjoins
   confession to God in tender words.

   (9) A treatise upon baptism. [1108]

   Bishop Stubbs in Smith and Wace, Dict. Chr. Biog. (i. 73-76), deserves
   particular mention.

   Flaccus Albinus, or, as he is commonly called in the Old English form,
   Alcuin [1109] ("friend of the temple"), the ecclesiastical prime
   minister of Charlemagne, was born in Yorkshire about 735. He sprang
   from a noble Northumbrian family, the one to which Willibrord, apostle
   of the Frisians, belonged, and inherited considerable property,
   including the income of a monastic society on the Yorkshire coast.
   [1110] At tender age he was taken to the famous cathedral school at
   York, and there was educated by his loving and admiring friends,
   Egbert, archbishop of York (732-766) and founder of the school, and
   Ethelbert, its master. With the latter he made several literary
   journeys on the continent, once as far as Rome, and each time returned
   laden with MS. treasures, secured, by a liberal expenditure of money,
   from different monasteries. Thus they greatly enlarged the library
   which Egbert had founded. [1111] In 766 Ethelbert succeeded Egbert in
   the archbishopric of York, and appointed Alcuin, who had previously
   been a teacher, master of the cathedral school, ordained him a deacon,
   Feb. 2, 767, and made him one of the secular canons of York minster. In
   767 he had Liudger for a pupil. Some time between the latter year and
   780, [1112] Ethelbert sent him to Italy on a commission to Charlemagne,
   whom he met, probably at Pavia. In 780 Ethelbert retired from his see
   and gave over to Alcuin the care of the library, which now was without
   a rival in England. Alcuin gives a catalogue of it, [1113] thus
   throwing welcome light upon the state of learning at the time. In 780
   Alcuin again visited Rome to fetch the pallium for Eanbald, Ethelbert's
   successor.

   On his return he met Charlemagne at Parma (Easter, 781), and was
   invited by him to become master of the School of the Palace. This
   school was designed for noble youth, was attached to the court, and
   held whenever the court was. Charlemagne and his family and courtiers
   frequently attended its sessions, although they could not be said to be
   regular scholars. The invitation to teach this school was a striking
   recognition of the learning and ability of Alcuin, and as he perceived
   the possibilities of the future thus unexpectedly opened to him he
   accepted it, although the step involved a virtual abnegation of his
   just claim upon the archiepiscopate of York. In the next year (782),
   having received the necessary permission to go from his king and
   archbishop, he began his work. The providential design in this event is
   unmistakable. Just at the time when the dissensions of the English
   kings practically put a stop to educational advance in England, Alcuin,
   the greatest teacher of the day, was transferred to the continent in
   order that under the fostering and stimulating care of Charlemagne he
   might rescue it from the bondage of ignorance. But the effort taxed his
   strength. Charlemagne, although he attended his instruction and styles
   him "his dear teacher," at the same time abused his industry and
   patience, and laid many very heavy burdens upon him. [1114] Alcuin had
   not only to teach the Palatine school, which necessitated his moving
   about with the migratory court to the serious interruption of his
   studies, but to prepare and revise books for educational and
   ecclesiastical uses, and in general to superintend the grand
   reformatory schemes of Charlemagne. How admirably he fulfilled his
   multifarious duties, history attests. The famous capitulary of 787
   [1115] which Charlemagne issued and which did so much to advance
   learning, was of his composition. The Caroline books, [1116] which were
   quite as remarkable in the sphere of church life, were his work, at
   least in large measure. For his pecuniary support and as a mark of
   esteem Charlemagne gave him the monasteries of St. Lupus at Troyes and
   Bethlehem at Ferrières, and the cell of St. Judecus on the coast of
   Picardy (St. Josse sur mer). But the care of these only added to his
   burdens. In 789 he went to England on commission from Charlemagne to
   King Offa of Mercia, and apparently desired to remain there. Thence in
   792 he sent in the name of the English bishops a refutation of
   image-worship. But in 793 Charlemagne summoned him to his side to
   defend the church against the heresy of Adoptionism and image-worship,
   and he came. In 794 he took a prominent part, although simply a deacon,
   in the council of Frankfort, which spoke out so strongly against both,
   and in 799, at the council of Aachen, he had a six days' debate with
   Felix, the leader of the Adoptionists, which resulted in the latter's
   recantation. In his negotiations with the Adoptionists he had the
   invaluable aid of the indefatigable monk, Benedict, of Nursia. In 796,
   Charlemagne gave him in addition to the monasteries already mentioned
   that of St. Martin at Tours and in 800 those of Cormery and Flavigny.
   The monastery of Tours [1117] owned twenty thousand serfs and its
   revenue was regal. To it Alcuin retired, although he would have
   preferred to go to Fulda. [1118] There he did good work in reforming
   the monks, regulating the school and enlarging the library. His most
   famous pupil during this period of his life was Rabanus Maurus. In the
   year of his death he established a hospice at Duodecim Pontes near
   Troyes; and just prior to this event he gave over the monastery of
   Tours to his pupil Fredegis, and that of Ferrières to another pupil,
   Sigulf It is remarkable that he died upon the anniversary on which he
   had desired to die, the Festival of Pentecost, May 19, 804. He was
   buried in the church of St. Martin, although in his humility he had
   requested to be buried outside of it.

   One of his important services to religion was his revision of the
   Vulgate (about 802) by order of Charlemagne, on the basis of old and
   correct MSS., for he probably knew little Greek and no Hebrew. This
   preserved a good Vulgate text for some time.

   Alcuin was of a gentle disposition, willing, patient and humble, and an
   unwearied student. He had amassed all the treasures of learning then
   accessible. He led his age, yet did not transcend it, as Scotus Erigena
   did his. He was not a deep thinker, rather he brought out from his
   memory the thoughts of others. He was also mechanical in his methods.
   Yet he was more than a great scholar and teacher, he was a leader in
   church affairs, not only on the continent, but, as his letters show,
   also in England. Charlemagne consulted him continually, and would have
   done better had he more frequently followed his advice. Particularly is
   this true respecting missions. Alcuin saw with regret that force had
   been applied to induce the Saxons to submit to baptism. He warned
   Charlemagne that the result would be disastrous. True Christians can
   not be made by violence, but by plain preaching of the gospel in the
   spirit of love. He would have the gospel precepts gradually unfolded to
   the pagan Saxons, and then as they grew in knowledge would require from
   them stricter compliance. Alcuin gave similar council in regard to the
   Huns. [1119] His opinions upon other practical points [1120] are worthy
   of mention. Thus, he objected to the employment of bishops in military
   affairs, to capital punishment, to the giving up of persons who had
   taken refuge in a church, and to priests following a secular calling.
   He was zealous for the revival of preaching and for the study of the
   Bible. On the other hand he placed a low estimate upon pilgrimages, and
   preferred that the money so spent should be given to the poor. [1121]

   Writings.--The works of Alcuin are divided into nine classes.

   I. Letters. [1122] A striking peculiarity of these letters is their
   address. Alcuin and his familiar correspondents, following an
   affectation of scholars in the middle age, write under assumed names.
   [1123] Among his correspondents are kings, patriarchs, bishops and
   abbots. The value of these letters is very great. They throw light upon
   contemporary history, and such as are private, and these are numerous,
   allow us to look into Alcuin's heart. Many of them, unfortunately, are
   lost, and some are known to exist unprinted, as in the Cotton
   collection. Those now printed mostly date from Tours, and so belong to
   his closing years. They may be roughly divided into three groups:
   [1124] (1) those to English correspondents. These show how dear his
   native land was to Alcuin, and how deeply interested he was in her
   affairs. (2) Those to Charlemagne, a large and the most important
   group. [1125] Alcuin speaks with freedom, yet always with profound
   respect. (3) Those to his bosom friend, Arno of Salzburg.

   II. Exegetical Miscellany. [1126] (a) Questions and answers respecting
   the interpretation of Genesis. (b) Edifying and brief exposition of the
   Penitential Psalms, Psalm CXVIII and the Psalm of Degrees. (c) Short
   commentary on Canticles. (d) Commentary on Ecclesiastes. (e) A literal,
   allegorical and moral Interpretation of the Hebrew names of our Lord's
   ancestors (in which he makes much out of the symbolism of the numbers).
   (f) Commentary on portions of John's Gospel. (g) On Titus, Philemon,
   Hebrews. [1127] These comments, are chiefly derived from the Fathers,
   and develop the allegorical and moral sense of Scripture. That on
   John's Gospel is the most important. The plan of making a commentary
   out of extracts was quickly followed and was indeed the only plan in
   general use in the Middle Age.

   III. Dogmatic Miscellany. [1128] (a) The Trinity, written in 802,
   dedicated to Charlemagne, a condensed statement of Augustin's teaching
   on the subject. It was the model for the "Sentences" of the twelfth
   century. It is followed by twenty-eight questions and answers on the
   Trinity. (b) The Procession of the Holy Spirit, similarly dedicated and
   made up of patristic quotations. (c) Brief treatise against the heresy
   of Felix (Adoptionism). (d) Another against it in seven books. (e) A
   treatise against Elipandus in four books. (f) Letter against
   Adoptionism, addressed to some woman. These writings on Adoptionism are
   very able and reveal learning and some independence.

   IV. Liturgical and Ethical Works. [1129] (a) The Sacraments, a
   collection of mass-formulae, from the use of Tours. (b) The use of the
   Psalms, a distribution of the Psalms under appropriate headings so that
   they can be used as prayers, together with explanations and original
   prayers: a useful piece of work. (c) Offices for festivals, the Psalms
   sang upon the feast days, with prayers, hymns, confessions and
   litanies: a sort of lay-breviary, made for Charlemagne. (d) A letter to
   Oduin, a presbyter, upon the ceremony of baptism. (e) Virtues and
   vices, dedicated to Count Wido, compiled from Augustin. (f) The human
   soul, addressed in epistolary form to Eulalia (Gundrada), the sister of
   Adalhard, abbot of Corbie, in France. (g) Confession of sins, addressed
   to his pupils at St. Martin's of Tours.

   V. Hagiographical Works. [1130] (a) Life of St. Martin of Tours,
   rewritten from Sulpicius Severus. (b) Life of St. Vedast, bishop of
   Atrebates (Arras), and (c) Life of the most blessed presbyter Requier,
   both rewritten from old accounts. (d) Life of St. Willibrord, bishop of
   Utrecht, his own ancestor, in two books, one prose, the other verse.
   This is an original work, and valuable as history.

   VI. Poems. [1131] The poetical works of Alcuin are very numerous, and
   of very varied character, including prayers, inscriptions for books,
   churches, altars, monasteries, etc., epigrams, moral exhortations,
   epistles, epitaphs, enigmas, a fable, [1132] and a long historical poem
   in sixteen hundred and fifty-seven lines upon the bishops and saints of
   the church of York from its foundation to the accession of Eanbald.
   [1133] It is very valuable. In its earlier part it rests upon Bede, but
   from the ten hundred and seventh line to the close upon original
   information. It seems to have been written by Alcuin in his youth at
   York. Its style is evidently influenced by Virgil and Prudentius.

   VII. Pedagogical Works. [1134] (a) Grammar. (b) Orthography. (c)
   Rhetoric. (d) Dialectics. (e) Dialogue between Pippin and Alcuin [1135]
   (f) On the courses and changes of the moon and the intercalary day
   (Feb. 24th). These works admit us into Alcuin's school-room, and are
   therefore of great importance for the study of the learning of his day.

   VIII. Dubious Works. [1136] (a) A confession of faith, in four parts,
   probably his. (b) Dialogue between teacher and pupils upon religion.
   (c) Propositions. (d) Poems.

   IX. Pretended Works [1137] (a) The holy days. (b) Four homilies. (c)
   Poems.

   § 160. St. Liudger.

   I. S. Liudgerus, Minigardefordensis Episcopus: Opera, in Migne, Tom.
   XCIX. col. 745-820.

   II. The old Lives of S. Liudger are four in number. They are found in
   Migne, but best in Die Vitae Sancti Liudgeri ed. Dr. Wilhelm Diekamp.
   Münster, 1881 (Bd. IV. of the series: Die Geschichtsquellen des
   Bisthums Münster). Dr. Diekamp presents revised texts and ample
   prolegomena and notes. (1) The oldest Vita (pp. 3-53) is by Altfrid, a
   near relative of Liudger and his second successor in the see of
   Münster. It was written by request of the monks of Werden about thirty
   years after Liudger's death, rests directly upon family and other
   contemporary testimony, and is the source of all later Lives. He
   probably divided his work into two books, but as the first book is in
   two parts, Leibnitz, Pertz and Migne divide the work into three books,
   of which the first contains the life proper, the second the miracles
   wrought by the saint himself, and the third those wrought by his
   relics. (2) Vita Secunda (pp. 54-83) was written by a monk of Werden
   about 850. The so-called second book of this Life really belongs to (3)
   Vita tertia (pp. 85-134.) (2) Follows Altfrid, but adds legendary and
   erroneous matter. (3) Written also by a Werden monk about 890, builds
   upon (1) and (2) and adds new matter of a legendary kind. (4) Vita
   rythmica (pp. 135-220), written by a Werden monk about 1140.
   Biographies of Liudger have been recently written in German by Luise
   von Bornstedt (Münster, 1842); P. W. Behrends (Neuhaldensleben u.
   Gardelegen, 1843); A. Istvann (Coesfeld, 1860); A. Hüsing (Münster,
   1878); L. Th. W. Pingsmann (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1879). Cf. Diekamp's
   full bibliography, pp. CXVIII.-CXMI. For literary criticism see

   338, 339.

   Liudger, or Ludger, first bishop of Münster, was born about 744 at
   Suecsnon (now Zuilen) on the Vecht, in Frisia. His parents, Thiadgrim
   and Liafburg, were earnest Christians. His paternal grandfather,
   Wursing, had been one of Willibrord's most zealous supporters (c. 5).
   [1138] He early showed a pious and studious disposition (c. 7). He
   entered the cloister school of Utrecht, taught by the abbot Gregory,
   whose biographer he became, laid aside his secular habit and devoted
   himself to the cause of religion. His proficiency in study was such
   that Gregory made him a teacher (c. 8). During the year 767 he received
   further instruction from Alcuin at York, and was ordained a deacon (c.
   9). In 768 he was in Utrecht; but for the next three years and a half
   with Alcuin, although Gregory had been very loath to allow him to go
   the second time. He would have staid longer if a Frisian trader had not
   murdered in a quarrel a son of a count of York. The ill feeling which
   this event caused, made it unsafe for any Frisian to remain in York,
   and so taking with him "many books" (copiam librorum), he returned to
   Utrecht (c. 10). Gregory had died during his absence (probably in 771),
   and his successor was his nephew, Albric, a man of zeal and piety.
   Liudger was immediately on his return to York pressed into active
   service. He was sent to Deventer on the Yssel in Holland, where the,
   saintly English missionary Liafwin had just died. A horde of pagan
   Saxons had devastated the place, burnt the church and apparently undone
   Liafwin's work (c. 13). Liudger was commissioned to rebuild the church
   and to bury the body of Liafwin, which was lost. Arrived at the spot he
   was at first unsuccessful in finding the body, and was about to rebuild
   the church without further search when Liafwin appeared to him in a
   vision and told him that his body was in the south wall of the church,
   and there it was found (c. 14). Albric next sent him to Frisia to
   destroy the idols and temples there. Of the enormous treasure taken
   from the temples Charlemagne gave one-third to Albric. In 777 Albric
   was consecrated bishop at Cologne, and Liudger at the same time
   ordained a presbyter.

   For the next seven years Liudger was priest at Doccum in the Ostergau,
   where Boniface had died, but during the three autumn months of each
   year he taught in the cloister school at Utrecht (c. 15). At the end of
   this period Liudger was fleeing for his life, for the pagan Wutukint,
   duke of the Saxons, invaded Frisia, drove out the clergy, and set up
   the pagan altars. Albric died of a broken heart, unable to stand the
   cruel blow. Liudger with two companions, Hildigrim and Gerbert, retired
   to Rome, where for two and a half years he lived in the great
   Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino (c. 18). There he not only had a
   pleasant retreat but also opportunity to study the working of the
   Benedictine rule. He did not, however, take monastic vows.

   His fame for piety and learning had meanwhile reached the ears of
   Charlemagne,--probably through Alcuin,--and so on his return the
   emperor assigned to his care five Frisian districts (Hugmerchi,
   Hunusga, Fuulga, Emisga, Fedirga) upon the eastern side of the river
   Labekus (Lauwers), and also the island of Bant. His success as
   missionary induced him to undertake an enterprise in which even
   Willibrord had failed. He sailed over the German Ocean to Heligoland,
   then called Fosetelant (the land of the god Fosete). His confidence was
   justified by events. He made many converts, among them the son of the
   chief of the island who became a priest and a missionary. Shortly after
   on the mainland there was another irruption of pagans from East Frisia,
   and the usual disheartening scenes of burnt churches, scattered
   congregations, and martyred brethren were enacted. But once more the
   Christian faith conquered (c. 19). Charlemagne's continued regard for
   Liudger was proved by his gift to him of the abbey Lothusa (probably
   Zele, near Ghent in Belgium), in order that its revenues might
   contribute to his support, or that being far from Frisia he might
   retreat thither in times of danger; and further by his appointment of
   him to the bishopric of Mimigernaford (later form Mimigardevord, now
   Münster, so called from the monasterium which he built there), in
   Westphalia, which was now sufficiently christianized to be ruled
   ecclesiastically. He still had under his care the five districts
   already named, although so far off. At first these charges were held by
   him as a simple presbyter, and in that capacity he carried out one of
   his darling purposes and built the famous monastery of Werden [1139] on
   the Ruhr, formerly called Diapanbeci. But persuaded by Hildebald he
   became the first bishop of Münster (c. 20). The year of this event is
   unknown, but it was between 802 and 805. [1140] Tireless in his
   activity he died in the harness. On Sunday, March 26, 809, he preached
   and performed mass at Coesfeld and at Billerbeck. In the evening he
   died (Acta II. c. 7). He was buried at Werden, which thus became a
   shrine of pilgrims.

   The only extant writing of Liudger is his Life of St. Gregory, [1141]
   which gives a pleasing picture of the saint, in whose school at Utrecht
   many famous men, including bishops, were trained. Twelve of its
   twenty-two chapters are taken up with Boniface. Much of the matter is
   legendary. He also wrote a life of Albric, [1142] which is lost. His
   connection with Helmstedt is purely imaginary. The Liudger Monastery
   there was not founded by him, for it dates from the tenth century. The
   colony of monks may, however, have well come from Werden, and have
   therefore given the name Liudger to the monastery.

   Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, one of the most useful churchmen of the
   Carolingian period, was probably born in Spain, [1143] past the middle
   of the eighth century. In 788 he attracted the notice of Charlemagne,
   who called him into France and made him abbot of Fleury and of Aignan,
   both Benedictine monasteries in the diocese of Orleans, and later
   bishop of Orleans. He stood in high favor with his king and was
   entrusted with important commissions. He participated in the council of
   Frankfort (794); was made missus dominicus [1144] in 798; accompanied
   Charlemagne to Rome, sat as one of the judges in the investigation of
   the charges against Leo III. (800) and received from the supreme
   pontiff the pallium (801). [1145] He succeeded Alcuin (804) as first
   theological imperial counsellor. In 809 he sat in the council of Aix la
   Chapelle and by request of the emperor collected the patristic
   quotations in defence of the Filioque clause. In 811 he was witness to
   the emperor's will. Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's son and successor,
   for a time showed him equal honor and confidence, for instance in
   appointing him to meet Pope Stephen V. when he came to the coronation
   at Rheims (816). But two years afterwards he was suspected, it would
   seem without good reason, of complicity in king Bernard's rebellion,
   and on Easter 818 was deposed and imprisoned at Angers, in the convent
   either of St. Aubin or of St. Serge. He stoutly persisted in his
   declaration of innocence, and in 821 he was released and reinstated,
   but died [1146] on his way back or shortly after his arrival in
   Orleans, and was buried in Orleans Sept. 19, 821.

   Theodulph was an excellent prelate; faithful, discreet and wise. He
   greatly deplored the ignorance of his clergy and earnestly labored to
   elevate them. To this end he established many schools, and also wrote
   the Capitula ad presbyteros parochicae suae mentioned below. In this
   work he was particularly successful. The episcopal school of Orleans
   was famous for the number, beauty and accuracy of the MSS. it produced.
   In his educational work he enjoyed the assistance of the accomplished
   poet Wulfin. Theodulph was himself a scholar, well read both in secular
   and religious literature. [1147] He had also a taste for architecture,
   and restored many convents and churches and built the splendid basilica
   at Germigny, which was modelled after that at Aix la Chapelle. His love
   for the Bible comes out not only in the revision of the Vulgate he had
   made, and practically in his exhortation to his clergy to expound it,
   but also in those costly copies of the Bible which are such
   masterpieces of calligraphy. [1148] He was moreover the first poet of
   his day, which however is not equivalent to saying that he had much
   genius. His productions, especially his didactic poems, are highly
   praised and prized for their pictures of the times, rather than for
   their poetical power. From one of his minor poems the interesting fact
   comes out that he had been married and had a daughter called Gisla, who
   was the wife of a certain Suavaric. [1149]

   The extant prose works of Theodulph are: 1. Directions to the priests
   of his diocese, [1150] written in 797. They are forty-six in number and
   relate to the general and special duties of priests. The following are
   some of the more instructive directions: Women must not approach the
   altar during the celebration of mass (c. 6). Nothing may be kept in the
   churches except holy things (c. 8). No one save priests and unusually
   holy laity may be buried in churches (c. 9). No woman is allowed to
   live in the house with a priest (c. 12). Priests must not get drunk or
   frequent taverns (c. 13). Priests may send their relatives to monastic
   schools (c. 19). They may keep schools themselves in which free
   instruction is given (c. 20). They must teach everybody the Lord's
   Prayer and the Apostles' Creed (c. 22). No work must be done on the
   Lord's Day (c. 24). Priests are exhorted to prepare themselves to
   preach (c. 28). Daily, honest confession of sins to God ensures pardon;
   but confession to a priest is also enjoined in order that through his
   counsels and prayers the stain of sin may be removed (c. 30). True
   charity consists in the union of good deeds and a virtuous life (c.
   34). Merchants should not sell their souls for filthy lucre (c. 35).
   Regulations respecting fasting (c. 36-43). All should come to church to
   celebrate mass and hear the preaching, and no one should eat before
   communicating (c. 46). 2. To the same, a treatise upon sins and their
   ecclesiastical punishment; and upon the administration of extreme
   unction. [1151] 3. The Holy Spirit. [1152] The collection of patristic
   passages in defense of the Filioque, made by order of Charlemagne
   (809), as mentioned above. It has a metrical dedication to the emperor.
   4. The ceremony of baptism, [1153] written in 812 in response to
   Charlemagne's circular letter on baptism which Magnus, archbishop of
   Sens (801-818), had forwarded to him. It consists of eighteen chapters,
   which minutely describe all the steps in the ceremony of baptism. 5.
   Fragments of two sermons. [1154]

   The Poetical works of Theodulph are divided into six books. [1155] The
   first is entirely devoted to one poem; The exhortation to judges,
   [1156] in which besides describing a model judge and exhorting all
   judges to the discharge of their duties he relates his own experiences
   while missus and thus gives a most interesting picture of the time.
   [1157] The second book contains sixteen pieces, including epitaphs, and
   the verses which he wrote in the front of one of his illuminated Bibles
   giving a summary in a line of each book, and thus revealing his
   Biblical scholarship. The verses are prefaced in prose with a list of
   the books. The third book contains twelve pieces, including the verses
   to Gisla already mentioned. The fourth book contains nine pieces, the
   most interesting of which are c.1 on his favorite authors, and c.2 on
   the seven liberal arts,--grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic,
   music, geometry and astrology. The fifth book contains four pieces:
   Consolation for the death of a certain brother, a fragment On the seven
   deadly sins, An exhortation to bishops, and four lines which express
   the evangelical sentiment that only by a holy life is heaven gained;
   without it pilgrimages avail nothing. The sixth book contains thirty
   pieces. Ten other poems appear in an appendix in Migne. [1158]

   [1143] Curiously enough the word used in his epitaph to express his
   native land is ambiguous. The line reads: "Protulit hunc Speria, Gallia
   sed nutriit" (Migne, l.c. col. 192); but Speria (Hesperia) is a
   poetical term for either Italy or Spain. Cf. Ebert l.c. p. 70.

   Ebert, II. Cf. Carl Schwartz: Uebersetzung und Bemerkungen zu Eigil's
   Nachrichten über die Gründung und Urgeschichte des Klosters Fulda.
   Fulda, 1858.

   Eigil was a native of Noricum, the name then given to the country south
   of the Danube, around the rivers Inn and Drave, and extending on the
   south to the banks of the Save. In early childhood, probably about 760,
   he was placed in the famous Benedictine monastery of Fulda in Hesse,
   whose abbot, its founder Sturm (Sturmi, Sturmin), was his relative.
   There Eigil lived for many years as a simple monk, beloved and
   respected for piety and learning. Sturm was succeeded on his death
   (779) by Baugolf, and on Baugolf's resignation Ratgar became abbot
   (802). Ratgar proved to be a tyrant, [1159] and expelled Eigil because
   he was too feeble to work. In 817, Ratgar was deposed, and the next
   year (818) Eigil was elected abbot. A few months afterwards, Ratgar
   appeared as a suppliant for readmission to the monastery. "It was not
   in Eigil's power to grant this request, but his influence was used to
   gain for it a favorable response at court [i.e. with Louis the Pious],
   and Ratgar for thirteen years longer lived a submissive and penitent
   member of the community which had suffered so much at his hands. [1160]
   This single incident in the life of Eigil goes far to prove his right
   to the title of saint.

   Loath as he had been to accept the responsible position of abbot in a
   monastery which was in trouble, he discharged its duties with great
   assuiduity. He continued Ratgar's building operations, but without
   exciting the hatred and rebellion of his monks. On the contrary, Fulda
   once more prospered, and when he died, June 15, 822, he was able to
   give over to his successor and intimate friend, Rabanus Maurus, a well
   ordered community.

   The only prose writing of Eigil extant is his valuable life of Sturm.
   [1161] It was written by request of Angildruth, abbess of Bischofheim,
   and gives an authentic account of the founding of Fulda. Every year on
   Sturm's day (Dec. 17) it was read aloud to the monks while at dinner.
   Eigil's own biography was written by Candidus, properly Brunn, whom
   Ratgar had sent for instruction to Einhard at Seligenstadt, and who was
   principal of the convent school under Rabanus Maurus. The biography is
   in two parts, the second being substantially only a repetition in verse
   of the first. [1162]

   § 163. Amalarius.

   I. Symphosius Amalarius: Opera omnia in Migne, Tom. CV. col. 815-1340.
   His Carmina are in Dümmler, Poetae Latini aevi Carolini, I.

   France, IV. 531-546. Clarke, II. 471-473. Bähr, 380-383. Hefele, IV.
   10, 45, 87, 88. Ebert, II. 221, 222.

   Amalarius was a deacon and priest in Metz, and died in 837, as abbot of
   Hornbach in the same diocese. It is not known when or where he was
   born. During the deposition of Agobard (833-837), Amalarius was head of
   the church at Lyons. He was one of the ecclesiastics who enjoyed the
   friendship of Louis the Pious, and took part in the predestination
   controversy, but his work against Gottschalk, undertaken at Hincmar's
   request, is lost. He was prominent in councils. Thus he made the
   patristic compilation from the Fathers (particularly from Isidore of
   Seville) and councils upon the canonical life, which was presented at
   the Diet at Aix-la-Chapelle in 817, [1163] and partly that upon
   image-worship in the theological congress of Paris, presented Dec. 6,
   825. In 834, as representative of Agobard, he held a council at Lyons
   and discoursed to the members for three days upon the ecclesiastical
   offices, as explained in his work mentioned below. The majority
   approved, but Florus of Lyons did not, and sent two letters to the
   council at Diedenhofen, calling attention to Amalarius insistence upon
   the use of the Roman order and his dangerous teaching: that there was a
   threefold body of Christ, (1) the body which he had assumed, (2) the
   body which he has in us so long as we live, (3) the body which is in
   the dead. Hence the host must be divided into three parts, one of which
   is put in the cup, one on the paten and one on the altar, corresponding
   to these three forms respectively. Farther he was charged with teaching
   that the bread of the Eucharist stood for the body, the wine for the
   soul of Christ, the chalice for his sepulchre, the celebrant for Joseph
   of Arimathea, the archdeacon for Nicodemus, the deacons for the
   apostles, the sub-deacons for the women at the sepulchre. But the
   council had business in hand of too pressing a character to admit of
   their investigating these charges. Not discouraged, Florus sent a
   similar letter to the council of Quiercy (838), and by this council the
   work of Amalarius was censured. [1164]

   His writings embrace (1) Rules for the canonical life, [1165] already
   referred to. It treats of the duties of ecclesiastics of all grades.

   (2) Four books upon The ecclesiastical offices. [1166] It was written
   by request of Louis the Pious, to whom it is dedicated, and was
   completed about 820. In order to make it better, Amalarius pursued
   special investigations in Tours, at the monastery of Corbie, and even
   went to Rome. In 827 he brought out a second and greatly improved
   edition. In its present shape the work is important for the study of
   liturgics, since it describes minutely the exact order of service as it
   was observed in the Roman church in the ninth century. If Amalarius had
   been content to have given merely information it would have been better
   for his reputation. As it was he attempted to give the reasons and the
   meanings of each part of the service, and of each article in any way
   connected with the service, and hence was led into wild and often
   ridiculous theorizing and allegorizing. Thus the priest's alb signifies
   the subduing of the passions, his shoes, upright walking; his cope,
   good works; his surplice, readiness to serve his neighbors; his
   handkerchief, good thoughts, etc.

   (3) On the order of the anthems, [1167] i.e. in the Roman service. It
   is a compilation of the antiphones of the Roman and French. churches.

   (4) Eclogues on the office of the Mass, [1168] meaning again the Roman
   mass. This insistence upon the Roman order was directed against
   Archbishop Agobard of Lyons, who had not only not adopted the Roman
   order, but had expurgated the liturgy of his church of everything which
   in his judgment savored of false doctrine or which was undignified in
   liturgical expression.

   (5) Epistles. [1169] The first letter, addressed to Jeremiah,
   archbishop of Sens, on the question whether one should write Jhesus or
   Jesus. The second is Jeremiah's reply, deciding in favor of Jhesus. In
   the third, Amalarius asks Jonas of Orleans whether one should use I H C
   or I H S as a contraction of Jesus. Jonas favored I H S. The fourth is
   on the Eucharist. Rantgarius is his correspondent. Amalarius maintains
   the Real Presence. He says the first cup at supper signified the Old
   Testament sacrifices, the figure of the true blood, which was in the
   second cup. The fifth letter is to Hetto, a monk, who had asked whether
   "seraphin" or "seraphim" is the correct form. Amalarius replies with
   learned ignorance that both are correct, for "seraphin" is neuter and
   "seraphim," masculine! The sixth is the most important of the series.
   It is addressed to a certain Guntrad, who had been greatly troubled
   because Amalarius had spit shortly after having partaken of the
   Eucharist, and therefore had voided a particle of the body of Christ.
   Amalarius, in his reply, says that he had so much phlegm in his throat
   that he was obliged to spit very frequently. He did not believe,
   however, that God would make that which helped his bodily injure his
   spiritual health. He then goes on to say that the true honor of the
   body of Christ is by the inner man, into which it enters as life. Hence
   if one who inwardly revered the host should accidentally or unavoidably
   spit out a fragment of the host he must not be judged as thereby
   dishonoring the body of Christ. He thus touches, without passing
   judgment upon, the position of the Stercoranists. The last letter is
   only a fragment and is so different in style from the former that it
   probably is not by Amalaritius of Metz.

   Einhard (or Eginhard), [1170] the biographer of Charlemagne and the
   best of the historians of the Carolingian age, was the son of Einhard
   and Engilfrita, and was born about 770, in that part of the Valley of
   the Main which belongs to Hesse-Darmstadt. His family was noble and his
   education was conducted in the famous Benedictine monastic school of
   St. Boniface at Fulda, to which his parents sent gifts. [1171] About
   792 the abbot Baugolf sent him to the court of Charlemagne, in order
   that his already remarkable attainments might be increased and his
   ability find ample scope. The favorable judgment and prophecy of
   Baugolf were justified by events. He soon won all hearts by his amiable
   disposition and applause by his versatile learning. He married Imma, a
   maiden of noble family, sister of Bernharius, bishop of Worms, and with
   her lived very happily for many years. [1172] She bore him a son named
   Wussin who became a monk at Fulda. He enjoyed the Emperor's favor to a
   marked degree, [1173] and figured in important and delicate matters.
   Thus he was sent in 806 to Rome to obtain the papal signature to
   Charlemagne's will dividing the empire among his sons. [1174] Again in
   813 it was he who first suggested the admission of Louis to the
   co-regency. He superintended the building operations of Charlemagne,
   e.g. at Aix la Chapelle (Aachen), according to the ideas of Vitruvius,
   whom he studied diligently. [1175] His skill as a craftsman won him the
   academic title of Bezaleel. [1176] He pursued his studies and gathered
   a fine library of classic authors. He edited the court annals. [1177]
   Charlemagne's death (814) did not alter his position. Louis the Pious
   retained him as councillor and appointed him in 817 instructor to his
   son Lothair. When trouble broke out (830) between father and son he did
   his best to reconcile them.

   Although a layman he had received at different times since 815 a number
   of church preferments. Louis made him abbot of Fontenelle in the
   diocese of Rouen, of St. Peter's of Blandigny and St. Bavon's at Ghent,
   of St. Servais' at Maestricht, and head of the church of St. John the
   Baptist at Pavia. On Jan. 11, 815, Louis gave Einhard and Imma the
   domains of Michelstadt and Mulinheim in the Odenwald on the Main; and
   on June 2 of that year he is first addressed as abbot. [1178] As the
   political affairs of the empire became more complicated he withdrew
   more and more from public life, and turned his attention to literature.
   He resigned the care of the abbey of Fontenelle in 823, and after
   administrating other abbeys sought rest at Michelstadt. There he built
   a church in which he put (827) the relics of the saints Marcellinus and
   Petrus which had been stolen from the church of St. Tiburtius near
   Rome. [1179] A year later, however, he removed to Mulinheim, which name
   he changed to Seligenstadt; there he built a splendid church and
   founded a monastery. After his unsuccessful attempt to end the strife
   between Louis and Lothair he retired altogether to Seligenstadt. About
   836 he wrote his now lost work upon the Worship of the Cross, which he
   dedicated to Servatus Lupus. [1180] In 836 his wife died. His grief was
   inconsolable, and aroused the commiseration of his friends; [1181] and
   even the emperor Louis made him a visit of condolence. [1182] But he
   carried his burden till his death on March 14, 840. He is honored as a
   saint in the abbey of Fontenelle on February 20. His epitaph was
   written by Rabanus Maurus.

   He and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir
   of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was
   presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims
   descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of
   Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at
   Erbach in the Odenwald.

   Einhard was in stature almost a dwarf, but in mind he was in the esteem
   of his contemporaries a giant. His classical training fitted him to
   write an immortal work, the Life of Charlemagne. His position at court
   brought him into contact on terms of equality with all the famous men
   of the day. In youth he sat under Alcuin, in old age he was himself the
   friend and inspirer of such a man as Servatus Lupus. His life seems to
   have been on the whole favored, and although a courtier, he preserved
   his simplicity and purity of character.

   His Writings embrace:

   1. The Life of the Emperor Charlemagne. [1183] This is one of the
   imperishable works in literature. It is a tribute of sincere admiration
   to one who was in many respects the greatest statesman that ever lived.
   It was Einhard's ambition to do for Charlemagne what Suetonius had done
   for Augustus. Accordingly he attempted an imitation of Suetonius in
   style and as far as possible in contents, [1184] and it is high praise
   to say that Einhard has not failed. The Life is the chief source of
   knowledge about Charlemagne personally, and it is so written as to
   carry the stamp of candor and truth, so that his private life stands
   revealed and his public life sufficiently outlined. Einhard began it
   soon after Charlemagne's death (814) and finished it about 820. It
   quickly attained a wide-spread and enthusiastic reception. [1185] It
   was looked upon as a model production. Later writers drew freely upon
   it and portions were rendered into verse. [1186] It is not, however,
   entirely free from inaccuracies, as the critical editions show.

   2. The Annals of Lorsch. [1187] Einhard edited and partly rewrote them
   from 741 to 801, [1188] and wrote entirely those from 802 to 829. These
   annals give a brief record of the events of each year from the
   beginning of Pepin's reign till the withdrawal of Einhard from court.

   3. Account of the removal of the relics of the blessed martyrs
   Marcellinus and Petrus. [1189] This is a very extraordinary narrative
   of fraud and cunning and "miracles." In brief it very candidly states
   that the relics were stolen by Deusdona, a Roman deacon, Ratleik,
   Einhard's representative and Hun, a servant of the abbey of Soissons.
   But after they had been safely conveyed from Rome they were openly
   exhibited, and very many "miracles" were wrought by them, and it was to
   relate these that the book was written.

   4. The Passion of Marcellinus and Petrus [1190] is a poem of three
   hundred and fifty-four trochaic tetrameters. It has been attributed to
   Einhard, but the absence of all allusion to the removal of the relics
   of these saints renders the authorship very doubtful. [1191]

   5. Letters. [1192] There are seventy-one in all; many of them
   defective. They are mostly very brief and on matters of business.
   Several are addressed to Louis and Lothair, and one to Servatus Lupus
   on the death of his (Einhard's) wife, which deserves particular
   attention.

   Ceillier, XII. 254-257. Bähr, 362-364. Ebert, II. 108-12.

   Of the early life of Smaragdus nothing is known. He joined the
   Benedictine order of monks, and after serving as principal of the
   convent school was elected about 805 abbot of the monastery on Mt.
   Castellion. Sometime later he moved his monks a few miles away and
   founded the monastery of St. Mihiel on the banks of the Meuse, in the
   diocese of Verdun. He was a man of learning and of practical activity.
   In consequence he was highly esteemed by the two monarchs under whom he
   lived, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. The former employed him to
   write the letter to Pope Leo III. in which was communicated the
   decision of the council of Aix la Chapelle (809) respecting the
   adoption of the Filioque, and sent him to Rome with the commissioners
   to lay the matter before the pope. He acted as secretary, and drew up
   the protocol. Louis the Pious showed him equal consideration, richly
   endowed his monastery, and in 824 appointed him to act with Frotharius,
   bishop of Toul (813837) as arbitrator between Ismund, abbot of Milan,
   and his monks. Smaragdus died about 840.

   His writings show diligence and piety, but no originality. His
   published works in prose are: (1) Collections of Comments on the
   Epistle and Gospel for each holy day in the year, [1193] an uncritical
   but comprehensive compilation from numerous ecclesiastical writers,
   prepared for the use of preachers, and described by the author as a
   liber comitis. (2) The monk's diadem, [1194] a collection in one
   hundred chapters of ascetic rules and reflections concerning the
   principal duties and virtues of the monastic life. It is for the most
   part a compilation. The sources are the Collectiones patrum of Cassian
   and the writings of Gregory the Great. Smaragdus made it after his
   elevation to the abbotship and enjoined its daily evening reading upon
   his monks. [1195] It proved to be a very popular work, was widely
   circulated during the Middle Age, and has been repeatedly published .
   [1196] (3) Commentary upon the rule of St. Benedict [1197] undertaken
   in aid of the monastic reforms instituted by the council of Aix la
   Chapelle (817). It is characterized by great strictness. (4) The Royal
   way [1198] dedicated to Louis the Pious while king of Aquitania. [1199]
   it consists of thirty-two chapters of moral and spiritual counsels,
   which if faithfully followed will conduct an earthly king into the
   heavenly kingdom. The work is really only an adaptation of the Diadem
   to the wants of the secular life. (5) Acts of the Roman conference,
   [1200] the protocol already alluded to. (6) Epistle of Charles the
   Great to Leo the Pope upon the procession of the Holy Spirit, [1201]
   the letter mentioned above. (7) Epistle of Frotharius and Smaragdus to
   the Emperor Louis, [1202] the report of the arbitrators. (8) A larger
   grammar or a commentary upon Donatus. [1203] His earliest work, written
   at the request of his scholars, probably between 800 and 805. It is
   still unprinted, except a small portion. [1204] There yet remain in MS.
   a Commentary on the Prophets, and a History of the Monastery of St.
   Michael [1205] Smaragdus also wrote poetry. Besides a hymn to Christ,
   [1206] there have been preserved his metrical introductions to his
   Collections and Commentary on the rule of St. Benedict, of which the
   first has twenty-nine lines in hexameter, and the second thirty-seven
   distichs.

   § 166. Jonas of Orleans.

   I. Jonas, Aurelianensis episcopus: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. CVI.
   col. 117-394.

   II. Du Pin, VII. 3, 4. Ceillier, XII. 389-394. Hist. Lit. de la France,
   V. 20-31. Bähr, 394-398. Ebert, II. 225-230.

   Jonas was a native of Aquitania, and in 821 succeeded Theodulph as
   archbishop of Orleans. In the first year of his episcopate he reformed
   the convent at Mici, near Orleans, and thereby greatly extended its
   usefulness. His learning in classical and theological literature joined
   to his administrative ability made him a leader in important councils,
   and also led to his frequent employment by Louis the Pious on delicate
   and difficult commissions. Thus the emperor sent him to examine the
   administration of the law in certain districts of his empire, and in
   835 to the monasteries of Fleury and St. Calez in Le Mains. His most
   conspicuous service was, however, in connection with the gathering of
   bishops and theologians held at Paris in Nov. 825 to consider the
   question of image-worship. The emperor sent him and Jeremiah,
   archbishop of Sens, to Rome to lay before the pope that part of the
   collection of patristic quotations on the subject made by Halitgar and
   Amalarius, which was most appropriate. [1207] The issue of this
   transaction is unknown. He was the leading spirit in the reform council
   of Paris (829), and probably drew up its acts; [1208] and again at
   Diedenhofen, where, on March 4, 835, he dictated the protocol of Ebo's
   deposition. [1209] He died at Orleans in 843 or 844.

   His Writings are interesting and important, although few.

   1. The layman's rule of life, [1210] in three books, composed in 828
   for Mathfred, count of Orleans, who had requested instruction how to
   lead a godly life while in the bonds of matrimony. The first and last
   books are general in their contents, but the second is for the most
   part specially addressed to married people. As might be expected Jonas
   takes strong ground against vice in all its forms and so his work has
   great value in the history of ethics. It is very likely that the second
   book was composed first. [1211]

   2. The Kings rule of life, [1212] written about 829 and dedicated to
   Pepin. Both the above-mentioned works are little more than compilations
   from the Bible and the fathers, especially from Augustin, but the
   author's own remarks throw a flood of light upon the sins and follies
   of his time. [1213]

   3. The Worship of Images. [1214] This is his chief work, and a very
   important one. It is in three books, and was written against Claudius
   of Turin. It was nearly finished at the time of the latter's death
   (839), and then laid aside since Jonas fancied that the bold position
   of Claudius would scarcely be assumed by any one else. But when he
   found that the pupils and followers of Claudius were propagating the
   same opinions he took up his book again and finished it about 842. It
   had been begun at the request of Louis the Pious; but he having died in
   840, Jonas dedicated the work to his son, Charles the Bald, in a letter
   in which the above-mentioned facts about its origin are stated. Jonas
   opposes Claudius with his own weapons of irony and satire, gives his
   portrait in no flattering colors and even ridicules his latinity. The
   first book defends the use of images (pictures), the invocation and
   worship of the saints, the doctrine of their intercession, and the
   veneration due to their relics, but asserts that the French do not
   worship images. The second book defends the veneration of the cross,
   and the third pilgrimages to Rome.

   4. History of the translation of the relics of Saint Hubert. [1215]
   Hubert, patron saint of hunters, died in 727 as first bishop of Liége,
   and was buried there in St. Peter's church. In 744 he was moved to
   another portion of the church, but in 825 bishop Walcand of Liége
   removed his relics to the monastery of Andvin which he had
   reestablished, and it is this second translation which Jonas describes.

   His Life.

   Magnentius Hrabanus Maurus is the full name, as written by himself,
   [1216] of one of the greatest scholars and teachers of the Carolingian
   age. He was born in Mainz [1217] about 776. At the age of nine he was
   placed by his parents in the famous Benedictine monastery of Fulda, in
   the Grand-duchy of Hesse, which was then in a very flourishing
   condition under Baugolf (780-802). There he received a careful
   education both in sacred and secular learning, for Baugolf was himself
   a classical scholar. Raban took the monastic vows, and in 801 was
   ordained deacon. In 802 Baugolf died and was succeeded by Ratgar. The
   new abbot at first followed the example of his predecessor, and in
   order to keep up the reputation of the monastery for learning he sent
   the brightest of the inmates to Tours to receive the instruction of
   Alcuin, not only in theology but particularly in the liberal arts.
   Among them was Raban, who indeed had a great desire to go. The meeting
   of the able and experienced, though old, wearied and somewhat
   mechanical teacher, and the fresh, vigorous, insatiable student, was
   fraught with momentous consequences for Europe. Alcuin taught Raban far
   more than book knowledge; he fitted him to teach others, and so put him
   in the line of the great teachers--Isidore, Bede, Alcuin. Between
   Alcuin and Raban there sprang up a very warm friendship, but death
   removed the former in the same year in which Raban returned to Fulda
   (804), and so what would doubtless have been a most interesting
   correspondence was limited to a single interchange of letters. [1218]

   Raban was appointed principal of the monastery's school. In his work he
   was at first assisted by Samuel, his fellow-pupil at Tours, but when
   the latter was elected bishop of Worms Raban carried on the school
   alone. The new abbot, Ratgar, quickly degenerated into a tyrant with an
   architectural mania. He begrudged the time spent in study and
   instruction. Accordingly he chose very effective measures to break up
   the school. He took the books away from the scholars and even from
   their principal, Raban Maur. [1219] In 807 the monastery was visited
   with a malignant fever, and a large proportion of the monks, especially
   of the younger ones, died, and many left. Thus by death and defection
   the number was reduced from 400 to 150, but those who remained had to
   work all the harder. It was probably during this period of misrule and
   misery that Raban made his journey to Palestine, to which, however, he
   only once alludes. [1220] On December 23, 814, he was ordained priest.
   [1221]

   In 817 Ratgar was deposed and Raban's friend Eigil elected in his
   place. [1222] With Eigil a better day dawned for the monastery. Raban
   was now unhampered in teaching and able once more to write. The school
   grew so large that it had to be divided. Those scholars who were
   designed for the secular life were taught in a separate place outside
   the monastery. The library was also much increased.

   In 822 Eigil died and Raban was elected his successor. He proved a good
   leader in spiritual affairs. He took personal interest in the monks,
   and frequently preached to them. He paid particular attention to the
   education of the priests. He compiled books for their especial benefit,
   and as far as possible taught in the school, particularly on Biblical
   topics. The principal of the school under him was Canadidus, already
   mentioned as the biographer of Eigil. [1223] His most famous pupils
   belong to this period: Servatus Lupus, Walahfrid Strabo (826-829) and
   Otfrid. He showed his passion for collecting relics, which he enshrined
   in a very costly way. He also built churches and extended the influence
   of Fulda by colonizing his monks in different places, adding six
   affiliated monasteries to the sixteen already existing.

   In the spring of 842 Raban laid down his office and retired to the
   "cell" on the Petersberg, in the neighborhood of Fulda. There he
   thought he should be able to end his days in literary activity
   undisturbed by the cares of office. To this end he called in the aid of
   several assistants and so worked rapidly. But he was too valuable a man
   to be allowed to retire from active life. Accordingly on the death of
   Otgar, archbishop of Mainz (April 21, 847), he was unanimously elected
   by the chapter, the nobility and the people of Mainz his successor. He
   reluctantly consented, and was consecrated June 26, 847. In October of
   that year he held his first synod in the monastery of St. Alban's,
   Mainz. It was a provincial council by command of Louis the German.
   Among the notables present were his suffragans, Samuel of Worms, his
   former fellow-teacher, Ebo of Hildesheim, Haymo of Halberstadt, his
   fellow-student under Alcuin, and also Ansgar of Hamburg, who had come
   to plead for the Northern mission. This synod renewed the command to
   the priests to preach. In this act Raban is recognized. On October 1,
   848, a second synod was held at Mainz, which is memorable as the first
   in which the Gottschalk matter was discussed. Gottschalk had been a
   pupil at Fulda and his course had incurred the anger of Raban, who
   accordingly opposed him in the council. The result was that the synod
   decided adversely to Gottschalk and sent him for judgment to Hincmar.
   In the Annals of Fulda begun by Enhard (not to be confounded with
   Einhard), and continued by Rudolf, it is gratefully recorded that
   during the great famine in Germany in 850 Raban fed more than 300
   persons daily in the village of Winzel. [1224] In October, 851 or 852,
   Raban presided over a third synod at Mainz, which passed a number of
   reform canons; such as one forbidding the clergy to hunt, and another
   anathematizing a layman who withdrew from a priest who had been
   married, thinking it wrong to receive the eucharist from such a one.
   [1225]

   Raban died at Mainz Feb. 4, 456, and was buried in the monastery of St.
   Alban's. He wrote his own epitaph which is modest yet just. In 1515
   Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg removed his bones to Halle.

   His Position And Influence.

   Raban was one of the most eminent men in the ninth century for virtue,
   piety and scholarship. As pupil he was unremitting in his pursuit of
   learning; as teacher he was painstaking, inspiring and instructive; as
   abbot he strove to do his whole duty; as archbishop he zealously
   contended for the faith regardless of adversaries; according to his own
   motto, "When the cause is Christ's, the opposition of the bad counts
   for naught." He bore his honors modestly, and was free from pride or
   envy. While willing to yield to proper demands and patient of
   criticism, he was inflexible and rigorous in maintaining a principle.
   He had the courage to oppose alone the decision of the council of 829
   that a monk might leave his order. He denied the virtues of astrology
   and opposed trial by ordeal. He early declared himself a friend of
   Louis the Pious and plainly and earnestly rebuked the unfilial conduct
   of his sons. After the death of Louis he threw in his fortune with
   Lothair and the defeat of the latter at Fontenai, June 25, 841, was a
   personal affliction and may have hastened his resignation of the
   abbotship, which took place in the spring of the following year. The
   relations, however, between him and his new king, Louis the German,
   were friendly. Louis called him to his court and appointed him
   archbishop of Mainz.

   Raban's permanent fame rests upon his labors as teacher and educational
   writer. From these he has won the proud epithet, Primus Germaniae
   Praeceptor. The school at Fulda became famous for piety and erudition
   throughout the length and breadth of the Frankish kingdom. Many noble
   youth, as well as those of the lower classes, were educated there and
   afterwards became the bishops and pastors of the Church of Germany. No
   one was refused on the score of poverty. Fulda started the example,
   quickly followed in other monasteries, of diligent Bible study. And
   what is much more remarkable, Raban was the first one in Germany to
   conduct a monastic school in which many boys were trained for the
   secular life. [1226] It is this latter action which entitles him to be
   called the founder of the German school system. The pupils of Raban
   were in demand elsewhere as teachers; and princes could not find a
   better school than his for their sons. One of the strongest proofs of
   its excellence is the fact that Einhard, himself a former pupil at
   Fulda, and now a great scholar and teacher, sent his son Wussin there,
   and in a letter still extant exhorts his son to make diligent use of
   his rare advantages, and above all to attend to what is said by that
   "great orator," Raban Maur. [1227] Raban's encyclopaedia, The Universe,
   attests his possession of universal learning and of the power to impart
   it to others. So, while Alcuin was his model, he enlarged upon his
   master's conception of education, and in himself and his works set an
   example whose influence has never been lost.

   His Writings.

   Raban was a voluminous author. But like the other writers of his time,
   he made mostly compilations from the Fathers and the later
   ecclesiastics. He was quick to respond to the needs of his day, and to
   answer questions of enquiring students. He betrays a profound
   acquaintance with the Holy Scripture. His works may be divided into
   seven classes.

   I. Biblical. (1) Commentaries upon the whole Bible, except Ezra,
   Nehemiah, Job, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, the Minor Prophets,
   Catholic Epistles and Revelation. He commented also on the Apocryphal
   books, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus and Maccabees. [1228] These
   commentaries were probably in part compiled by his pupils, under his
   direction. They preserved a knowledge both of the Bible and of the
   Fathers in an age when books were very scarce and libraries still
   rarer. A single fact very strikingly brings out this state of things.
   Frechulf, bishop of Lisieux, in urging Raban to comment on the
   Pentateuch, states that in his diocese there were very few books of any
   kind, not even a whole Bible, much less any complete exposition of it.
   [1229] Raban thus gives his views of biblical interpretation: [1230]
   "If any one would master the Scriptures he must first of all diligently
   find out the amount of history, allegory, anagoge and trope there may
   be in the part under consideration. For there are four senses to the
   Scriptures, the historical, the allegorical, the tropological and the
   anagogical, which we call the daughters of wisdom. Through these Wisdom
   feeds her children. To those who are young and beginning to learn she
   gives the milk of history; to those advancing in the faith the bread of
   allegory; those who are truly and constantly doing good so that they
   abound therein she satisfies with the savory repast of tropology;
   while, finally, those who despise earthly things and ardently desire
   the heavenly she fills to the full with the wine of anagoge."

   In accordance with these principles his commentaries' except that of
   Matthew, the earliest issued (819), contain very little proper
   exegesis, but a great deal of mystical and spiritual interpretation.
   The labor in their composition must have been considerable, but he
   carried it on for twenty years. He did not always copy the exact
   language of his sources, but reproduced it in his own words. He was
   particular to state the place of his excerpts. Each successive
   commentary had a separate dedication. Thus, those on Judith and Esther
   were dedicated to the empress Judith, because, he says, she resembled
   the Hebrew heroines; that on Chronicles to Louis the Pious, her
   husband, as a guide in government; that on Maccabees to Louis the
   German; that on Jeremiah to Lothair.

   (2) He also prepared a commentary in the same style upon the Biblical
   hymns sung in morning worship. [1231]

   (3) Scripture Allegories [1232] a conveniently arranged dictionary, in
   alphabetical order of terms which were defined allegorically. Thus,
   "Annus is the time of grace, as in Isaiah [lxi. 2], 'the acceptable
   year of the Lord.' Also, the multitude of the redeemed, as in Job iii.
   6, 'let it not be joined unto the days of the year' among the elect who
   are saved. Also the eternity of Christ, as in Psalm cii. 24, 'thy years
   are throughout all generations,' because the eternity of God lasts
   forever. It also signifies our life, as in Psalm xc. 9, 'our years are
   thought upon as if a cobweb' (Vulg.) i.e., our life rushes along in
   emptiness and corruption." [1233]

   (4) The life of Mary Magdalene and her sister Martha. [1234] It
   includes the related sections of our Lord's life and the legendary
   history of the sisters, and is in its way an interesting work. But he
   confounds Mary the sister of Lazarus with Mary of Magdala, and the
   latter again with the woman that was a sinner. Hence after declaring
   that Mary was a miracle of beauty he is obliged to touch upon her
   unchastity prior to her meeting with Christ.

   II. Educational. (1) The Institutes of the clergy. [1235] This
   important work was written in 819 in answer to numerous requests. It is
   in three books, prefaced by a poetical epigram. The prose preface gives
   an outline of the work, and states its sources. The work is very
   largely directly compiled from Augustin's De doctrina Christiana,
   Cassiodorus' Institutiones, and Gregory's Cura pastoralis. The first
   book of Raban's Institutes relates to ecclesiastical orders, clerical
   vestments, the sacraments, [1236] and the office of the mass. The
   second book relates to the canonical hours, the litany, fasting, alms,
   penance, the feasts, prayers for the dead, singing of psalms and hymns,
   reading of the Scriptures, the creed and gives a list of the heresies.
   The third book treats of the education requisite to make an efficient
   servant of the church. It is noteworthy that he lays primary stress
   upon a knowledge of the Scriptures, [1237] and gives directions for
   their study and explanation. He then passes on to discuss the
   components of education as then conducted, i.e. the seven liberal arts,
   and closes with directions how to speak and teach with the best
   results. He properly remarks that the preacher should have regard to
   the age, sex, and failings of his audience. He is to come forth as
   God's spokesman, and if he is truly a man of God he will be upheld by
   divine power. This is the proper spirit. Man is nothing. God is
   everything. "Let him who glorieth glory in Him in whose hand both we
   and our sermons are." [1238]

   (2) On Computation. [1239] It was written in 820, and is in the form of
   a dialogue between a master and his disciple. Much of it was copied
   verbatim from Bede's De temporum ratione, Isidore's Etymologies, and
   Boëthius' Arithmetic. But the resulting work marked an advance in
   instruction in the important matter of computing numbers, times and
   seasons.

   (3) The Universe. [1240] Isidore of Seville had already set the example
   of preparing an encyclopedia of universal knowledge, and Raban in his
   Universe merely reproduces Isidore's Etymologies, with some difference
   in the arrangement of the material, and with the addition of
   allegorical and spiritual matter, interpretations of the names and
   words, together with many quotations of Scripture. The work was one of
   the early fruits of his learned leisure, being written about 844. It is
   in twenty-two books, the number in the Hieronymian canon of the Old
   Testament, and is dedicated to Haymo of Halberstadt, and to King Louis.
   It begins with the doctrine of God, and the first five books relate to
   religion and worship. The remaining books relate to secular things,
   ranging from man himself, considered as an animal, through the beasts
   to the starry heavens, time and the divisions of time, the waters on
   and under the earth, the clouds above it, and the earth itself. He then
   speaks of mountains and valleys and divers places; of public buildings
   and their parts; of philosophy and linguistics, stones and metals,
   weights and measures, diseases and remedies, trees and plants, wars and
   triumphs, shows and games, pictures and colors, dress and ornaments,
   food and drink, vehicles and harness.

   (4) Excerpt from Priscian's Grammar, [1241] an abridged edition of a
   standard grammar. It is almost entirely confined to prosody, but it
   served to introduce Priscian into schools. [1242]

   (5) The holy orders, divine sacraments and priestly garments. [1243]

   (6) Ecclesiastical discipline. [1244] The last two treatises, made
   during the author's archiepiscopate, are merely extracts from the
   Institutes, with slight alterations.

   (7) The parts of the human body, in Latin and German. [1245] This
   glossary, was drawn up by Walahfrid Strabo from Raban's lectures. At
   the end are the months and the winds in Latin and German. [1246]

   (8) The invention of languages [1247] [letters], a curious collection
   of alphabets--Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Scythian and Runic, with the names
   of the supposed inventors. The little tract also includes the commonest
   abbreviations and monograms.

   III. Occasional writings, i.e., upon current questions and in answer to
   questions. (1) The oblation of boys, [1248] the famous treatise in
   which Raban argued against the position the Mainz Council of 829 had
   taken in allowing Gottschalk to leave his order. Gottschalk produced
   two arguments, the first that it was not right to compel a person to
   remain a monk just because his parents had in his infancy, or immature
   youth put him in a monastery. The second was that the oblation of a
   minor must be established by a properly qualified witness, and that in
   his case only Saxons could give such testimony, since, according to
   Saxon law, it was illegal to deprive a Saxon of his liberty on the
   testimony of a non-Saxon. Raban tries to refute him upon both points.
   He shows that both the Scriptures and the Fathers by precept and
   example allow of the consecration of children, and in relation to the
   second point he rejoins: As if the service of Christ deprived a man of
   his liberty and nobility!" [1249] But the real objection to
   Gottschalk's second argument was the latter's assertion that Frankish
   testimony could not be received. This roused Raban's patriotism and
   incited his eloquence. "Who does not know," he says, "that the Franks
   were Christians long before the Saxons? Yet the latter, contrary to all
   human and divine law, arrogate to themselves the right to reject
   Frankish testimony." [1250] Having thus answered Gottschalk, he proves
   by the Bible his third argument, that a vow to God must not be broken.
   His final point is that monasticism is a divine institution. In this
   treatise he does not name Gottschalk, but the reference is
   unmistakeable. His whole conduct towards the unfortunate Gottschalk was
   intolerant.

   (2) The reverence of children to their parents, and of subjects to
   their king. [1251] This was addressed to Louis the Pious after his
   deposition and imprisonment in the year 833. By Biblical quotations he
   shows that God has commanded children to honor their parents and
   subjects their kings, and has put his curse upon those who do not. Then
   coming directly to the point he makes the application to the existing
   circumstances, and calls the sons of Louis to obedience. He defends
   Louis against the charge of homicide in executing Bernard; and finally
   addressing the emperor he comforts him in his sorrow and counsels him
   to exercise clemency when he is restored to power. The whole treatise
   does great credit to Raban's head and heart.

   (3) On the degrees of relationship within which marriage is
   permissible. [1252]

   (4) Magic arts. [1253] Raban was singularly free from the superstitions
   of his time, for in the second part of this tract, written in 842, he
   takes strong ground against necromancy in all its forms, of which he
   gives an interesting catalogue, and while explaining the appearance of
   ghosts, evil spirits and similar supposed existences on the ground of
   demoniac influence, he yet admits the possibility that the senses may
   be deceived. Curiously enough, he cites in point the appearance of
   Samuel to Saul. He denies the reality of Samuel's appearance and holds
   that Saul was deceived by the devil; for two reasons, (1) the real
   Samuel, the man of God, would not have permitted the worship which Saul
   paid to the supposed Samuel; (2) the real Samuel was in Abraham's
   bosom; he would, therefore, not say to the impious king, "To-morrow
   thou shalt be with me." [1254]

   (4) A Response to certain Canonical Questions of the Suffragan Bishop
   Reginald. [1255]

   (5) Whether it is permissible for a suffragan bishop to ordain priests
   and deacons with the consent of his bishop. [1256] He replies in the
   affirmative.

   IV. Writings upon Penance. (1) Two Penitentials. [1257] They give the
   decisions of councils respecting penance. (2) Canonical questions
   relating to penance. [1258] (3) The virtues and vices and the
   satisfaction for sin. [1259]

   V. Miscellaneous. (1) Homilies. [1260] There are two collections, the
   first seventy in number upon the principal feasts and on the virtues;
   the second, one hundred and sixty-three upon the Gospels and Epistles.
   The first collection must have been made earlier than 826, for it is
   dedicated to bishop Haistulf, who died in that year. The most of these
   homilies were doubtless actually delivered by Raban. The sermons of Leo
   the Great, Augustin, Alcuin and others have been liberally drawn on,
   and so the homilies are compilations in great measure, like the rest of
   his works. Yet a few are apparently original and have the greatest
   interest, inasmuch as they treat of the vices then current and so
   furnish a picture of the times. [1261]

   (2) Treatise on the Soul. [1262] It is an extract with slight additions
   from Cassiodorus' De Anima, as he acknowledges in his preface to king
   Lothair. To it are appended extracts from the De disciplina Romanae
   militiae of Flavius Vegetius Renatus. The reason given for this strange
   appendix is "the frequent incursions of the Barbarians." The treatise
   was perhaps the last product of Rabanus. [1263]

   (3) A martyrology. [1264] The saints for the different days are noted,
   in most cases merely the name is given, in others there are short
   sketches. Its principal source is Jerome. It was prepared at the
   request of Ratleik, who stole the relics of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus
   for Einhard; and is prefaced by a short poem addressed to the abbot
   Grimold.

   (4) The vision of God, purity of heart and mode of penance. [1265]
   Three books dedicated to the abbot Bonosus (Hatto). The first is mostly
   extracted from Augustin's De vivendo Deo; the second and the third from
   other old sources.

   (5) The Passion of our Lord, [1266] a brief and pious meditation upon
   our Lord's sufferings.

   VI. Letters. (1) A letter to Bishop Humbert upon lawful degrees of
   relationship between married persons. [1267] (2) Seven miscellaneous
   letters. [1268] Epist. i. to suffragan bishop Regimbald on discipline.
   Epist. iii. to Eigil against Radbertus's view of the Lord's Supper.
   Epist. iv. v. vi. to Hincmar, Notingus and Count Eberhard upon
   predestination. Epist. vii. to Louis the German; the acts of the Mainz
   council of 848. Epist. viii. on Gottschalk, a synodical letter to
   Hincmar.

   VII. Poems. Raban was no poetic genius; yet he had carefully studied
   prosody and he was able to write verses to his friends and for
   different occasions. [1269] He also wrote some epitaphs, including his
   own. His most extraordinary production is a long poem, "The praise of
   the Cross." This was begun at the suggestion of Alcuin in Tours, but
   not completed until 815. It is a monument of misdirected skill and
   patience. He presents twenty-eight drawings by his friend Hatto. Some
   are geometrical, others are of persons or objects. The page on which is
   the drawing is filled in by a stanza of the poem, the letters of which
   are regularly spaced and some are purposely arranged in prominent and
   peculiar positions so that they catch the eye and form other words.
   Each stanza is followed by an explanatory section in prose, and the
   second book is a prose treatise upon the subject. The whole is prefaced
   by three poems; the first pleads for the intercession of Alcuin, the
   second is the dedication to the Pope, and the third, "The figure Of
   Caesar" is the dedication to Louis the Pious. Alcuin had written a
   poem, "On the Holy Cross," upon a somewhat similar plan. So that the
   suggestion may have come from him, but the idea may be traced to
   Fortunatus. This poem of Raban Maur was very popular in the Middle Age
   and was considered a marvel of ingenuity.

   The hymns of Raban are few in number, for although many have been
   attributed to him his right to most of them is very doubtful.

   [1216] Praefatio to his De laudibus sanctae crucis Migne, CVII. col.
   147, 148. Magnentius indicates his birth at Mainz. which was called in
   the Old High German Magenze (see Ebert II. 121 n.). Hrabanus is the
   Latinized form of Hraban (i e."raven "). Rabanus is the ordinary
   spelling. Maurus was the epithet given to him by Alcuin (Migne, CIX.
   col. 10) to indicate that in Rabanus were found the virtues which had

   Haymo (Haimo, Aymo, Aimo) was a Saxon, and was probably born about 778.
   He took monastic vows at Fulda, was sent by, his abbot (Ratgar) with
   his intimate friend Rabanus Maurus in 803 to Tours to study under
   Alcuin; on his return he taught at Fulda until in 839 he was chosen
   abbot of Hirschfeld. In 841 he was consecrated bishop of Halberstadt.
   In 848 he sat in the Council of Mayence which condemned Gottschalk. He
   founded at considerable expense the cathedral library of Halberstadt,
   which unfortunately was burnt in 1179. He died March 27, 853. He was an
   excellent scholar. As an exegete he was simple and clear, but rather
   too verbal.

   His writings are voluminous, and were first published by the Roman
   Catholics in the Reformation period (1519-36). They teach a freer and
   less prejudiced Catholic theology than the Tridentine. Thus he denies
   that Peter founded the Roman church, that the pope has universal
   supremacy, and rejects the Paschasian doctrine of transubstantiation.
   His works consist principally of (1) Commentaries. [1270] He wrote or
   compiled upon the Psalms, certain songs in the Old Testament, Isaiah,
   the Minor Prophets, Canticles, Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse.

   Besides these commentaries, (2) Homilies, [1271] upon the festivals of
   the church year and (3) Miscellanies, "The Body and Blood of the Lord,"
   [1272] which is an extract from his commentary on 1st Cor., "Epitome of
   sacred history," [1273] substantially though not entirely an extract
   from Rufinus' Latin translation of Eusebius' "Ecclesiastical history,"
   and an ascetic piece in three books, "The love for the heavenly
   country." [1274]

   § 169. Walahfrid Strabo.

   I. Walafridus Strabus, Fuldensis monachus: Opera, in Migne, Tom.
   CXIII.-CXIV. His Carmina have been edited in a very thorough manner by
   Ernst Dümmler: Poetae Latini aevi Carolini. Tom. II. (Berlin, 1884),
   pp. 259-473.

   II. For his life see the Preface of Dümmler and Ebert, II. 145-166. Cf.
   also for his works besides Ebert, Ceillier, XII. 410-417; Hist. Lit. de
   la France, V. 59-76; Bähr, pp. 100-105, 398-401.

   Walahfrid, poet and commentator, theologian and teacher, was born of
   obscure parentage in Alemannia about 809, and educated in the
   Benedictine abbey school of Reichenau on the island in Lake Constance.
   His cognomen Strabus or, generally, Strabo was given to him because he
   squinted, but was by himself assumed as his name. [1275] From 826 to
   829 he studied at Fulda under Rabanus Maurus. There he formed a
   friendship with Gottschalk, and there he appears to have lived all
   alone in a cell, the better perhaps to study. [1276] On leaving Fulda
   he went to Aix la Chapelle, and was befriended by Hilduin, the lord
   chancellor, who introduced him to the emperor Louis the Pious. The
   latter was much pleased with him and appreciating his scholarship made
   him tutor to his son Charles. The empress Judith was also particularly
   friendly to him. In 838 Louis the Pious appointed him abbot of
   Reichenau, but two years later Louis the German drove him from his post
   and he went to Spires, where he lived until 842, when the same Louis
   restored him to his abbotship, probably at the solicitation of Grimald,
   his chancellor. [1277] In 849 he went over to France on a diplomatic
   mission from Louis the German to Charles the Bald, but died on August
   18th of that year while crossing the Loire, and was buried at
   Reichenau. [1278]

   Walahfrid was a very amiable, genial and witty man, possessed
   remarkable attainments in both ecclesiastical and classical literature,
   and was moreover a poet with a dash of genius, and in this latter
   respect is a contrast to the merely mechanical versifiers of the
   period. He began writing poetry while a mere boy, and in the course of
   his comparatively brief life produced many poems, several of them of
   considerable length.

   His Writings embrace

   1. Expository Works. 1. Glosses, [1279] i.e., brief notes upon the
   entire Latin Bible, including the Apocrypha; a very meritorious
   compilation, made especially from Augustin, Gregory the Great, Isidore
   of Seville, and Bede, with very many original remarks. This work was
   for five hundred years honored by the widest use in the West. Peter
   Lombard quotes it as "the authority" without further designation; and
   by many its notes have been given equal weight with the Bible text they
   accompany. It was one of the earliest printed works, notwithstanding
   its extent. [1280] 2. Exposition of the first twenty Psalms, [1281]
   rather allegorical than really explanatory. 3. Epitome of Rabanus
   Maurus' Commentary on Leviticus. [1282] This work is an indication of
   Walahfrid's reverence for his great teacher. 4. Exposition of the Four
   Evangelists. [1283] It was formerly printed among the works of Jerome.
   The notes are brief and designed to bring out the "inner sense." 5. The
   beginnings and growth of the divine offices. [1284] This valuable and
   original work upon the archeology of the liturgy was written about 840
   at the request of Reginbert, the learned librarian of the abbey of
   Reichenau, who desired more accurate information upon the origin of the
   different parts of the liturgy. The supplementary character of the work
   explains its lack of system. Walahfrid treats in disconnected chapters
   of temples and altars; bells; the derivation of several words for holy
   places; the use of "pictures," as ornaments and aids to devotion, but
   not as objects of worship; the things fitting divine worship; "the
   sacrifices of the New Testament" (in this chap., No. XVI., he dissents
   from the transubstantiation theory of Radbertus, saying, Christ "after
   the Paschal supper gave to his disciples the sacrament of his body and
   blood in the substance of the bread and wine and taught them to
   celebrate [the sacrament] in memory of his passion" [1285] ); then
   follow a number of chapters upon the Eucharist; sacred vestments;
   canonical hours and hymns; baptisms; titles, &c. The work closes with a
   comparison of ecclesiastical and secular dignities.

   II. A Homily on the Fall of Jerusalem. [1286] Walahfrid gives Josephus'
   account of the fall of the city and then proceeds to the spiritual
   application of our Lord's prophetic discourse (Matt. xxiv.).

   III. Biographies. 1. Life of the Abbot St. Gall, [1287] the apostle of
   Switzerland (d. 645 or 646). It is not original, but a rewriting of the
   life by Wettin, Walahfrid's honored teacher at Reichenau. Walahfrid
   reproduced the same in verse. [1288] 2. Life of St. Othmar, abbot of
   St. Gall, [1289] similarly reproduced. 3. The prologue to his edition
   of Einhard's Life of Charlemagne, which gives valuable information
   about Einhard. [1290]

   IV. Poetry. 1. The Vision of Wettin. [1291] This is the oldest of his
   poems, dating according to his own assertion from his eighteenth year
   [1292] (i.e., c. 826). It is not original, but a versification, with
   additions, of the prose work of Heito. The ultimate source is Wettin
   himself, who relates what he saw (October 824) on his journey, under
   angelic guidance, to Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. The fact that
   Wettin was very sick at the time explains the occasion of the vision
   and his reading its contents, but the poem is interesting not only in
   itself, but as a precursor of Dante's Divine Comedy. [1293] 2. The Life
   and Death of St. Mammes, [1294] an ascetic from childhood, who preached
   to the wild sheep gathered by a strange impulse in a little chapel.
   This extraordinary performance attracted adverse notice from the
   authorities. Mammes was accused of witchcraft and, on refusing to
   sacrifice to the gods, also of atheism. His enemies vainly attempted to
   kill him by fire, by wild beasts, and by stoning. Finally he was
   peacefully called from life by the voice of God. 3. The Life and Death
   of St. Blaithmaic, abbot of Hy and martyr. [1295] It relates how an
   Irish crown prince embraced an ascetic life in childhood and attained a
   martyr's crown on the island of Hy. 4. Garden-culture, [1296] a curious
   poem upon the plants in the convent garden. 5. On the Image of Tetricus
   [1297] (Dietrich), an ingenious poem in laudation of Louis the Pious
   and his family. [1298] 6. Miscellaneous Poems, [1299] including
   epistles, epigrams, inscriptions and hymns.

   § 170. Florus Magister, of Lyons.

   I. Florus, diaconus Lugdunensis: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. CXIX. ol.
   9-424. His poems are given by Dümmler: Poet. Lat. aev. Carolini, II.
   (Berlin, 1884), pp. 507-566.

   Bähr, 108, 109; 447-453. Ebert, II. 268-272.

   Florus was probably born in the closing year of the eighth century and
   lived in Lyons during the reigns of Louis the Pious, Charles the Bald
   and Louis II. He was head of the cathedral school, on which account he
   is commonly called Florus Magister. He was also a deacon or sub-deacon.
   He enjoyed a wide reputation for learning, virtue and ability. He stood
   in confidential relations with his bishop, Agobard, and with some of
   the most distinguished men of his time. His library was a subject of
   remark and wonder for its large size. [1300]

   Like every other scholar under Charles the Bald, he made his
   contribution to the Eucharistic and Predestination controversies. In
   the former he took the side of Rabanus Maurus and Ratramnus against the
   transubstantiation theory of Paschasius Radbertus; in the latter he
   opposed Johannes Scotus Erigena, without, however, going entirely over
   to the side of Gottschalk. He sat in the council of Quiercy (849), the
   first one called by Hincmar in the case of Gottschalk. He died about
   860.

   His complete works are:

   1. A patristic cento on the election of Bishops, [1301] written in 834,
   to show that in primitive Christian times the bishops were always
   chosen by the free vote of the congregation and the clergy. Therefore
   the interference of the king in such elections, which was one of the
   growing evils of the time, was unwarranted by tradition and only
   defensible on the plea of necessity to preserve the union between
   Church and State.

   2. An Exposition of the Mass, [1302] compiled, according to his own
   express statement, for the most part, from Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustin,
   and other Fathers.

   3. A Treatise against Amalarius, [1303] in which he supports Agobard
   against Amalarius, who had explained the liturgy in a mystical and
   allegorical manner. [1304]

   4. A Martyrology, [1305] a continuation of Bede's.

   5. Sermon on Predestination. [1306]

   6. A treatise against Scotus Erigena's errors, [1307] written in 852 in
   the name of the church of Lyons. He calls attention to Erigena's
   rationalistic treatment of the Scriptures and the Fathers; rejects the
   definition of evil as negation; insists that faith in Christ and an
   inner revelation are necessary to a right understanding of the
   Scriptures. It is noticeable that while he censures Erigena for his
   abuse of secular science, he claims that it has its proper use. [1308]

   7. St. Augustin's Exposition of the Pauline Epistles, [1309] long
   attributed to Bede.

   8. Capitulary collected from the Law and the Canons. [1310]

   9. Miscellaneous Poems, [1311] which prove him to have had a spark of
   true poetic genius. [1312]

   10. There is also extant a letter which he wrote to the empress Judith.

   Lupus, surnamed Servatus, [1314] was descended from a prominent family.
   He was born in Sens (70 miles S. E. of Paris) in the year 805 and
   educated in the neighboring Benedictine monastery of SS. Mary and Peter
   anciently called Bethlehem, at Ferrières, then under abbot Aldrich, who
   in 829 became archbishop of Sens, and died early in 836. He took
   monastic vows, was ordained a deacon and then taught in the
   convent-school until in 830 on advice of Aldrich he went to Fulda.
   Einhard, whose life of Charlemagne had already deeply impressed him,
   [1315] was then abbot of Seligenstadt, only a few miles away, but his
   son Wussin was being educated at Fulda, and it was on a visit that he
   made to see his son that Lupus first met him. With him and with the
   abbot of Fulda, the famous Rabanus Maurus, he entered into friendship.
   It was he who incited Rabanus to make his great compilation upon the
   Epistles of Paul; [1316] and to him Einhard dedicated his now lost
   treatise De adoranda cruce. [1317] He pursued his studies at Fulda and
   also gave instruction until the spring of 836, when he returned to
   Ferrières. [1318] He then took priest's orders and taught grammar and
   rhetoric in the abbey school. In 837 he was presented at the court of
   Louis the Pious, and by special request of the empress Judith appeared
   the next year (Sept. 22, 838). [1319] The favor showed him led him
   naturally to expect speedy preferment, but he was doomed to
   disappointment. In the winter of 838 and 839 he accompanied Odo, who
   had succeeded Aldrich, to Frankfort, [1320] where the emperor Louis
   spent January and February, 839. Louis died in 840 and was succeeded by
   Charles the Bald. In 842 Charles deposed Odo because of his connection
   with Lothair, and by request of the emperor the monks elected Lupus
   their abbot, Nov. 22, 842, [1321] and the emperor confirmed the
   election. It was with difficulty that Odo was removed. The year 844 was
   an eventful one with Lupus. The monks of Ferrières were bound yearly to
   supply money and military service to Charles, and Lupus had to take the
   field in person. [1322] In this year he went against the rebellious
   Aquitanians. On June 14th he was taken prisoner by them in the battle
   of Angoulême, but released after a few days by intervention of Turpio,
   count of Angoulême, and on July 3d he was back again in Ferrières.
   Later on he was sent by Charles, with Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, to
   visit the monasteries of Burgundy, and at the close of the year he sat
   in the council of Verneuil, and drew up the canons. [1323] Can. XII. is
   directed against the king's seizure on ecclesiastical property. His own
   special grievance was that Charles had rewarded the fidelity of a
   certain Count Odulf by allowing him the revenues of the cell or
   monastery of St. Judocus on the coast of Picardy (St. Josse sur mer),
   which had belonged to Alcuin, but was given to Ferrières by Louis the
   Pious, and the loss of which greatly crippled his already expensive
   monastery. [1324] It was not, however, until 849 that the cell was
   restored. This is the more strange because Charles had a high regard
   for his learning and diplomatic skill, as is shown by his employment of
   Lupus in delicate public business. Thus in 847 Lupus sat in the peace
   congress at Utrecht between Lothair, Louis and Charles the Bald. In
   midsummer 849 Charles sent him to Leo IV. at Rome concerning the
   ecclesiastical encroachments of the Breton Duke Nominoi. In the spring
   of 853 he sat in the council of Soissons and took Hincmar's side
   regarding the deposition of those priests whom Ebo had ordained, after
   his own deposition in 835. In the same year he attended the convocation
   of the diocese of Sens and there sided with Prudentius against
   Hincmar's deliverances in the Gottschalk controversy. It is supposed
   that he was also at the council of Quiercy, 857, because his Admonitio
   [1325] is written in the spirit of the deliberations of that council
   respecting the troubles of the times. In 858 he was sent on diplomatic
   business to Louis the German. But in the same year he was forced by the
   exigencies of the times to deposit the abbey's valuables with the monks
   of St. Germain Auxerrois for safe keeping. In 861 Foleric of Troyes
   offered protection to his monastery. In 862 he was at Pistes, and drew
   up the sentence of the Council against Robert, archbishop of Mans. As
   after this date all trace of Lupus is lost, his death during that year
   is probable,

   Servatus Lupus was one of the great scholars of the ninth century. But
   he gained knowledge under great difficulties, for the stress of
   circumstances drove him out of the seclusion he loved, and forced him
   to appear as a soldier, although he knew not how to fight, to write
   begging letters instead of pursuing his studies, and even to suffer
   imprisonment. Yet the love of learning which manifested itself in his
   childhood and increased with his years, notwithstanding the poor
   educational arrangements at Ferrières, [1326] became at length a master
   passion and dominated his thoughts. [1327] It mattered not how pressing
   was the business in hand, he would not let business drive study out of
   his mind. He set before him the costly and laborious project of
   collecting a library of the Latin classics, and applied to all who
   could assist him, even to the pope (Benedict III.). He was thankful for
   the loan of codices, so that by comparison he might make a good text.
   He was constantly at work upon the classics and gives abundant evidence
   of the culture which such study produces, in his "uncommon skill in the
   lucid exposition of a subject." [1328]

   His Works are very few. Perhaps the horrible confusion of the period
   hindered authorship, or like many another scholar he may have shrunk
   from the labor and the after criticism. In his collected works the
   first place is occupied by his

   1. Letters, [1329] one hundred and thirty in number. They prove the
   high position he occupied, for his correspondents are the greatest
   ecclesiastics of his day, such as Raban Maur, Hincmar of Rheims,
   Einhard, Radbert, Ratramn and Gottschalk. His letters are interesting
   and instructive. [1330]

   2. The Canons of Verneuil, 844. [1331] See above.

   3. The Three Questions, in 852. [1332] They relate to free will, the
   two-fold predestination, and whether Christ died for all men or only
   for the elect. It was his contribution to the Gottschalk controversy in
   answer to Charles the Bald's request. In general he sides with
   Gottschalk, or rather follows Augustin. In tone and style the book is
   excellent.

   4. Life of St. Maximinus, bishop of Treves. [1333] It is in fifteen
   chapters and was written in 839. It is only a working over of an older
   Vita, and the connection of Lupus with it is questionable. [1334]

   5. Life of St. Wigbert, in thirty chapters, written in 836 at the
   request of Bun, abbot of Hersfeld. [1335] It tells the interesting
   story of how Wigbert came from England to Germany at the request of
   Boniface, how he became abbot of Fritzlar, where he died in 747, how he
   wrought miracles and how miracles attended the removal of his relics to
   Hersfeld and were performed at his tomb.

   § 172. Druthmar.

   I. Christianus Druthmarus: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. CVI. col.
   1259-1520.

   II. Ceillier, XII. 419-423. Hist. Lit. de la France, V. 84-90. Bähr,
   401-403.

   Christian Druthmar was born in Aquitania in the first part of the ninth
   century. Before the middle of the century he became a monk of the
   Benedictine monastery of old Corbie. [1336] About 850 he was called
   thence to the abbey of Stavelot-Malmédy, in the diocese of Liège, to
   teach the Bible to the monks. [1337] It is not known whether he died
   there or returned to Corbie.

   He was a very superior scholar for his age, well versed in Greek and
   with some knowledge of Hebrew. Hence his epithet, the "Grammarian"
   (i.e. Philologist). His fame rests upon his Commentary on Matthew's
   Gospel, [1338] a work distinguished for its clearness of statement, and
   particularly noticeable for its insistence upon the paramount
   importance of the historic sense, as the foundation of interpretation.
   [1339] To such a man the views of Paschasius Radbertus upon the Lord's
   Supper could have no attraction. Yet an attempt has been persistently
   made to show that in his comments upon Matt. 26:26-28, he teaches
   transubstantiation. Curiously enough, his exact language upon this
   interesting point cannot be now determined beyond peradventure, because
   every copy of the first printed edition prepared by Wimphelin de
   Schelestadt, Strassburg 1514, has perished, and in the MS. in
   possession of the Cordelier Fathers at Lyons the critical passage reads
   differently from that in the second edition, by the Lutheran, Johannes
   Secerius, Hagenau 1530. In the Secerius text, now printed in the Lyons
   edition of the Fathers, and in Migne, the words are, 26:26, "Hoc est
   corpus meum. Id est, in sacramento" ("This is my body. That is, in the
   sacrament," or the sacramental sign as distinct from the res
   sacramenti, or the substance represented). Matt. 26:28, Transferens
   spiritaliter corpus in panem, vinum in sanguinem ("Transferring
   spiritually body into bread, wine into blood"). [1340] In the MS. the
   first passage reads: "Id est, vere in sacramento subsistens" ("That is,
   truly subsisting in the sacrament"); and in the second the word
   "spiritaliter "is omitted. The Roman Catholics now generally admit the
   correctness of the printed text, and that the MS. has been tampered
   with, but insist that Druthmar is not opposed to the Catholic doctrine
   on the Eucharist.

   The brief expositions of Luke and John [1341] are probably mere notes
   of Druthmar's expository lectures on those books, and not the works he
   promises in his preface to Matthew. [1342]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1336] The monastery of Old Corbie was in Picardy, in the present
   department of Somme, nine miles by rail east of Amiens. That of New
   Corbie was in Westphalia, and was founded by Louis the Pious in 822 by
   a colony of monks from Old Corbie.

   [1337] Stavelot is twenty-four miles southeast of Liège, in present
   Belgium. It is now a busy manufacturing place of four thousand
   inhabitants. Its abbey was founded in 651, and its abbots had princely
   rank and independent jurisdiction down to the peace of Luneville in
   1801. The town of Malmédy lies about five miles to the northeast, and
   until 1815 belonged to the abbey of Stavelot. It is now in Prussia.

   Radbertus, surnamed Paschasius, [1343] the famous promulgator of the
   doctrine of Transubstantiation, was born of poor and unknown parents,
   about 790, in or near the city of Soissons in France. His mother died
   while he was a very little child, and as he was himself very sick he
   was "exposed" in the church of Soissons. The nuns of the Benedictine
   abbey of Our Lady in that place had compassion upon him and nursed him
   back to health. [1344] His education was conducted by the adjoining
   Benedictine monks of St. Peter, and he received the tonsure, yet for a
   time he led a secular life. His thirst for knowledge and his pious
   nature, however, induced him to take up again with the restraints of
   monasticism, and he entered (c. 812) the Benedictine monastery at
   Corbie, in Picardy, then under abbot Adalhard. There he applied himself
   diligently to study and to the cultivation of the monastic virtues, and
   so successfully that he soon won an enviable reputation for ascetic
   piety and learning. He was well read in classical literature,
   particularly familiar with Virgil, Horace and Terence, and equally well
   read in the Fathers. He knew Greek and perhaps a little Hebrew. His
   qualifications for the post of teacher of the monastery's school were,
   therefore, for that day unusual, and he brought the school up to a high
   grade of proficiency. Among his famous pupils were Adalhard the
   Younger, St. Ansgar, Odo, bishop of Beauvais, and Warinus, abbot of New
   Corbie. He preached regularly and with great acceptance and was strict
   in the observance by himself and others, of the Benedictine rule.

   In the year 822 he accompanied his abbot, Adalhard, and the abbot's
   brother and successor, Wala, to Corbie in Saxony, in order to establish
   there the monastery which is generally known as New Corbie. In 826
   Adalbard died, and Wala was elected his successor. With this election
   Radbertus probably had much to do; at all events, he was deputed by the
   community to secure from Louis the Pious the confirmation of their
   choice. This meeting with the emperor led to a friendship between them,
   and Louis on several occasions showed his appreciation of Radbertus.
   Thus in 831 he sent him to Saxony to consult with Ansgar about the
   latter's northern mission, and several times asked his advice. Louis
   took the liveliest interest in Radbertus's eucharistic views, and asked
   his ecclesiastics for their opinion.

   In 844 Radbertus was elected abbot of his monastery. He was then, and
   always remained, a simple monk, for in his humility, and probably also
   because of his view of the Lord's Supper, he refused to be ordained a
   priest. His name first appears as abbot in the Council of Paris, Feb.
   14, 846. He was then able to carry through a measure which gave his
   monastery freedom to choose its abbot and to govern its own property.
   [1345] These extra privileges are proofs that the favor shown toward
   him by Louis was continued by his sons. Radbertus was also present in
   the Council of Quiercy in 849, and joined in the condemnation of
   Gottschalk. Two years later (851) he resigned his abbotship. He had
   been reluctant to take the position, and had found it by no means
   pleasant. Its duties were so multiform and onerous that he had little
   or no time for study; besides, his strict discipline made his monks
   restive. But perhaps a principal reason for retiring was the fact that
   one of his monks, Ratramnus, had ventured to criticize, publicly and
   severely, his position upon the Eucharist; thus stirring up opposition
   to him in his own monastery.

   Immediately upon his resignation, Radbertus went to the neighboring
   abbey of St. Riquier, but shortly returned to Corbie, and took the
   position of monk under the new abbot. His last days were probably his
   pleasantest. He devoted himself to the undisturbed study of his
   favorite books and to his beloved literary labors. On April 26, 865,
   [1346] he breathed his last. He was buried in the Chapel of St. John.
   In the eleventh century miracles began to be wrought at his tomb.
   Accordingly he was canonized in 1073, and on July 12th of that year his
   remains were removed with great pomp to St. Peter's Church at Corbie.

   The fame of Paschasius Radbertus rests upon his treatise on The body
   and blood of the Lord, [1347] which appeared in 831, and in an improved
   form in 844. His arguments in it and in the Epistle to Frudegard [1348]
   on the same subject have already been handled at length in this volume.
   [1349] His treatise on The birth by the Virgin, [1350] i.e. whether
   Christ was born in the ordinary manner or not, has also been
   sufficiently noticed. [1351]

   Besides these Radbertus wrote, 1. An Exposition of the Gospel of
   Matthew. [1352] He explained this Gospel in his sermons to the monks.
   At their request, he began to write out his lectures, and completed
   four of the twelve books before his election as abbot, but was then
   compelled to lay the work aside. The monks at St. Riquier's requested
   its continuance, and it finally was finished. The special prefaces to
   each book are worth attentive reading for their information concerning
   the origin and progress of the commentary, and for the views they
   present upon Biblical study in general. As the prologue states, the
   principal sources are Jerome, Ambrose, Augustin, Chrysostom, Gregory
   the Great, and Bede. [1353] Of these, Jerome was most used. His
   excerpts are not always literal. He frequently alters and expands the
   expressions. [1354] Radbertus was particular to mark on the margin of
   his pages the names of the authors drawn upon, but in transcribing his
   marks have been obliterated. His interpretation is rather more literal
   than was customary, in his day, and he enlivens his pages with
   allusions to passing events, dwelling especially upon the disorders of
   the time, the wickedness of the clergy and monks, the abuses of the
   confessional, and the errors of the Adoptionists, Claudius of Turin and
   of Scotus Erigena. He also frequently quotes classic authors. [1355]

   2. An Exposition of Psalm XLIV [1356] It was written for the nuns of
   Soissons, to whom he owed his life, and the dedication to them is an
   integral part of the first of its four books. It is allegorical and
   very diffuse, but edifying.

   3. An Exposition of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. [1357] This was the
   fruit of his old age, and once more, as in his early manhood, he
   deplored the vices, both lay and clerical, which disgraced his times.
   His allusion to the Norman incursions in the neighborhood of Paris,
   [1358] which took place in 857, proves that he must have written the
   work after that date. In his prologue, Radbertus states that he had
   never read a commentary on Lamentations written by a Latin author.
   Hence his information must have been derived from Greek sources, and he
   was unacquainted with the similar work by Rabanus Maurus. He
   distinguished a triple sense, a literal, spiritual, and a moral, and
   paid especial regard to types and prophecies, as he considered that
   there were prophecies in Lamentations which referred to his own day.

   4. Faith, Hope and Love. [1359] This work is preceded by an acrostic
   poem, the first letters of each line forming the name "Radbertus
   Levita." Each of the three books is devoted to one of the Christian
   virtues. Radbertus wrote the treatise at the request of abbot Wala, for
   the instruction of the younger monks. The book on faith is remarkable
   for its statement that faith precedes knowledge, thus antedating the
   scholastics in their assertion, which is most pregnantly put in the
   famous expression of Anselm, Credo ut intelligam. [1360] The third
   book, On Love, is much later than the others on account of the author's
   distractions.

   5. Life of Adalhard, [1361] the first abbot of New Corbie. It is a
   panegyric rather than a strict biography, but contains much interesting
   and valuable information respecting the abbot and the founding of the
   German monastery of Corbie. The model for the work is the funeral
   oration of Ambrose upon Valentinian II. Its date is 826, the year of
   Adalhard's death. It contains much edifying matter.

   6. Life of Wala, [1362] the brother of Adalhard at Old Corbie, and his
   successor. It is in the peculiar form of conversations. In the first
   book the interlocutors are Paschasius, as he calls himself, and four
   fellow Corbie monks--Adeodatus, Severus, Chremes, Allabicus; and in the
   second, Paschasius, Adeotatus and Theophrastus. These names are, like
   Asenius, as he calls Wala, manifestly pseudonyms. He borrowed the idea
   of such a dialogue from Sulpicius Severus, who used it in his life of
   St. Martin of Tours. The date of the book is 836, the year of Wala's
   death.

   7. The Passion of Rufinus and Valerius, [1363] who were martyrs to the
   Christian faith, at or near Soissons, in the year 287. In this work he
   uses old materials, but weakens the interest of his subject by his
   frequent digressions and long paraphrases.

   § 174. Patramnus.

   I. Ratramnus, Corbeiensis monachus: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. CXXI.
   The treatise De corpore et sanguine Domini was first published by
   Johannes Praël under the title Bertrami presbyteri ad Carolum Magnum
   imperatorum, Cologne, 1532. It was translated into German, Zürich 1532,
   and has repeatedly appeared in English under the title, The Book of
   Bertram the Priest, London 1549, 1582, 1623, 1686, 1688 (the last two
   editions are by Hopkins and give the Latin text also), 1832; and
   Baltimore., U. S. A., 1843. The best edition of the original text is by
   Jacques Boileau, Paris, 1712, reprinted with all the explanatory matter
   in Migne.

   passim; Ceillier, XII. 555-568. Hist. Lit. de la France, V. 332-351.

   Dogmengeschichte der mittleren Zeit, Freiburg in Br., 1882 (pp. 631
   sqq.) Also Neander, III. 482, 497-501, 567-68.

   Of Ratramnus [1364] very little is known. He was a monk of the
   monastery of Corbie, in Picardy, which he had entered at some time
   prior to 835, and was famed for his learning and ability. Charles the
   Bald frequently appealed to his judgment, and the archbishop of Rheims
   gave over to him the defense of the Roman Church against Photius. He
   participated in the great controversies upon Predestination and the
   Eucharist. He was an Augustinian, but like his fellows he gathered his
   arguments from all the patristic writers. In his works he shows
   independence and ingenuity. One of his peculiarities is, that like
   Bishop Butler in the Analogy, he does not name those whom he opposes or
   defends. He was living in 868; how long thereafter is unknown.

   He was not a prolific author. Only six treatises have come down to us.

   1. A letter upon the cynocephali. [1365] It is a very curious piece,
   addressed to the presbyter Rimbert who had answered his queries in
   regard to the cynocephali, and had asked in return for an opinion
   respecting their position in the scale of being. Ratramnus replied that
   from what he knew about them he considered them degenerated descendants
   of Adam, although the Church generally classed them with beasts. They
   may even receive baptism by being rained upon. [1366]

   2. How Christ was born. [1367] In this treatise Ratramnus refutes the
   theory of some Germans that Christ issued from the body of the Virgin
   Mary in some abnormal way. [1368] He maintains on the contrary, that
   the birth was one of the ordinary kind, except that his mother was
   before it, during it, and after it a Virgin [1369] because her womb,
   was closed. He compares Christ's birth to his issuing from the sealed
   tomb and going through closed doors. [1370] The book is usually
   regarded as a reply to the De partu virginis of Radbertus, but there is
   good reason to consider it independent of and even earlier than the
   latter. [1371]

   3. The soul (De anima). It exists in MS. in several English libraries,
   but has never been printed. It is directed against the view of Macarius
   (or Marianus) Scotus, derived from a misinterpreted sentence of
   Augustin that the whole human race had only one soul. The opinion was
   condemned by the Lateran council under Leo X. (1512-17).

   4. Divine predestination. [1372] It was written about 849 at the
   request of Charles the Bald, who sought Ratramnus' opinion in the
   Gottschalk controversy. Ratramnus defended Gottschalk, although he does
   not mention his name, maintaining likewise a two-fold predestination,
   regardless of the fact that the synods of Mayence (848) and of Quiercy
   (849) had condemned it, and Gottschalk had been cruelly persecuted by
   Hincmar of Rheims. In the first book Ratramnus maintains the
   predestination of the good to salvation by an appeal to the patristic
   Scriptural quotations and interpretations upon this point, particularly
   those of Augustin. In the second book he follows the same method to
   prove that God has predestinated the bad to eternal damnation. But this
   is not a predestination to sin. Rather God foresees their determination
   to sin and therefore withholds his help, so that they are lost in
   consequence of their own sins.

   5. Four books upon the Greeks' indictment of the Roman Church. [1373]
   Like the former work, it was written by request. In 967 Photius
   addressed a circular letter to the Eastern bishops in which he charged
   the Roman Church with certain errors in faith and practice: e.g., the
   doctrine of the Holy Spirit, the celibacy of the clergy, the Sabbath
   and Lent fasts. Nicholas I. called upon his bishops to refute this
   charge. Hincmar of Rheims commissioned Odo of Beauvais to write an
   apologetic treatise, but his work not proving satisfactory he next
   asked Ratramnus. The work thus produced is very famous. The first three
   books are taken up with the doctrine of the Holy Spirit; but in the
   fourth he branches out upon a general defense of the ecclesiastical
   practices of the Latin Church. He does this in an admirable, liberal
   and Christian spirit. In the first chapter of the fourth book he mildly
   rebukes the Greeks for prescribing their peculiar customs to others,
   because the difference in such things is no hindrance to the unity of
   the faith which Paul enjoins in 1 Cor. i. 10. This unity he finds in
   the faith in the Trinity, the birth of Christ from a Virgin, his
   sufferings, resurrection, ascension, session at God's right hand,
   return to judgment, and in the baptism into Father, Son and Holy
   Spirit. [1374] In the first three chapters of the book he proves this
   proposition by a review of the condition of the Early Church. He then
   passes on to defend the Roman customs. [1375]

   6. The Body and Blood of the Lord. [1376] This is the most valuable
   writing of Ratramnus. It is a reply to Paschasius Radbert's book with
   the same title. [1377] It is dedicated to Charles the Bald who had
   requested (in 944) his opinion in the eucharistic controversy. Without
   naming Radbert, who was his own abbot, he proceeds to investigate the
   latter's doctrines. The whole controversy has been fully stated in
   another section. [1378]

   The book has had a strange fate. It failed to turn the tide setting so
   strongly in favor of the views of Radbertus, and was in the Middle Age
   almost forgotten. Later it was believed to be the product of Scotus
   Erigena and as such condemned to be burnt by the council of Vercelli
   (1050). The first person to use it in print was John Fisher, bishop of
   Rochester, who in writing against Oecolampadius quotes from it as good
   Catholic authority. [1379] This called the attention of the Zwinglian
   party to it and they quickly turned the weapon thus furnished against
   the Catholics. In the same year in which it was published at Cologne
   (1532), Leo Judae made a German translation of it (Zürich, 1532) which
   was used by the Zürich ministers in proof that the Zwinglian doctrine
   of the Lord's Supper was no novelty. [1380] But the fact that it had
   such a cordial reception by the Reformed theologians made it suspicious
   in Catholic eyes. The Council of Trent pronounced it a Protestant
   forgery, and in 1559 it was put upon the Index. The foremost Catholic
   theologians such as Bellarmin and Allan agreed with the Council. A
   little later (1571) the theologians of Louvain (or Douay) came to the
   defense of the book. In 1655 Sainte Beuve formally defended its
   orthodoxy. Finally Jacques Boileau (Paris, 1712) set all doubt at rest,
   and the book is now accepted as a genuine production of Ratramnus.

   It remains but to add that in addition to learning, perspicuity and
   judgment Ratramnus had remarkable critical power. The latter was most
   conspicuously displayed in his exposure of the fraudulent character of
   the Apocryphal tale, De nativitate Virginis, and of the homily of
   Pseudo-Jerome, De assumptione Virginis, both of which Hincmar of Rheims
   had copied and sumptuously bound.

   Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, was born of noble and distinguished
   ancestry, probably in the province of that name, [1381] in the year
   806. His name is also spelled Ingumar, Ingmer and Igmar. He was
   educated in the Benedictine monastery of St. Denis, near Paris, under
   abbot Hilduin. When the latter was appointed (822) chancellor to Louis
   the Pious he took young Hincmar to court with him. There his talents
   soon brought him into prominence, while his asceticism obtained for him
   the especial favor of Louis the Pious. This interest he used to advance
   the cause of reform in the monastery of St. Denis, which had become lax
   in its discipline, and when the Synod of Paris in 829 appointed a
   commission to bring this about he heartily co-operated with it, and
   entered the monastery as a monk. In 830, Hilduin was banished to New
   Corbie, in Saxony, for participation in the conspiracy of Lothair
   against Louis the Pious. Hincmar had no part in or sympathy with the
   conspiracy, yet out of love for Hilduin he shared his exile. Through
   his influence with Louis, Hilduin was pardoned and re-instated in his
   abbey after only a year's absence. Hincmar for the next nine or ten
   years lived partly at the abbey and partly at court. He applied himself
   diligently to study, and laid up those stores of patristic learning of
   which he afterwards made such an effective use. In 840 Charles the Bald
   succeeded Louis, and soon after took him into his permanent service,
   and then began that eventful public life which was destined to render
   him one of the most famous of churchmen. After his ordination as priest
   in 844, Charles the Bald gave him the oversight of the abbeys of St.
   Mary's, at Compiegne, and of St. Germer's, at Flaix. He also gave him
   an estate, [1382] which he made over to the hospice of St. Denis, on
   his elevation to the archiepiscopate. In December, 844, Hincmar took a
   prominent part in the council at Verneuil, and in April of the
   following year at the council of Beauvais he was elected by the clergy
   and people of Rheims to be their archbishop. This choice being ratified
   by Charles the Bald, and the permission of his abbot being received, he
   was consecrated by Rothad, bishop of Soissons, archbishop of Rheims and
   metropolitan, May 3, 845.

   No sooner had he been established in his see and had secured from
   Charles the restitution of all property that belonged to it, than
   trouble broke out. His diocese had fallen into more or less disorder in
   consequence of the ten years which had elapsed between Ebo's deposition
   and his election. Hincmar's first trouble came from Ebo, who contested
   Hincmar's election, on the ground that he was still archbishop. But the
   council of Paris in 846 affirmed Hincmar's election, and, in 847, Leo
   IV. sent him the pallium. The first difficulty being overcome, a second
   presented itself. For a few months in 840 Ebo had occupied his old see
   by force, and during this time bid ordained several priests. Hincmar
   degraded them and the council of Soissons in 853 approved his act. But
   naturally his course was opposed. The leader of the malcontents was
   Wulfad, one of the deposed priests. The matter was not disposed of
   until 868, when Pope Hadrian decided practically in favor of the
   deposed priests, for while exonerating Hincmar of all blame, at the
   same time he confirmed the election of Wulfad (866) as archbishop of
   Bourges.

   Another trouble came from Rothad, bishop of Soissons, who had
   consecrated him, and who was one of his suffragans. Rothad had deposed
   a priest, for unchastity and the deposition was confirmed by an
   episcopal council. Hincmar took the ground that Rothad, being only a
   suffragan bishop, had no right of deposition, and also no right to call
   a council. He also brought formal charges of disobedience against him
   and demanded the reinstatement of the deposed priest. Rothad
   persistently refusing compliance was then himself deposed (861). Both
   parties appealed to the pope, who at last (January 21, 865) decided in
   Rothad's favor and re-instated him. [1383]

   In 863 Hincmar refused to give his assent as metropolitan to the
   elevation of Hilduin, brother of Günther of Cologne, to the bishopric
   of Cambrai. Hilduin had been nominated to this position by Lothair, but
   Hincmar said that he was unfit, and the pope approved of his action.

   His longest and hardest fight was with his nephew and namesake,
   Hincmar, bishop of Laon. The latter was certainly very insubordinate
   and disobedient both to his metropolitan and his king. In consequence
   Hincmar of Rheims deposed him (871) and the king took him prisoner and
   blinded him. Pope Hadrian II. (d. 872) defended him but accomplished
   nothing. Pope John VIII. also pleaded his cause, and in 878 gave him
   permission to recite mass. He died in 882.

   These controversies, and those upon Predestination and the Eucharist,
   and his persecution of Gottschalk, elsewhere treated at length, [1384]
   have tended to obscure Hincmar's just reputation as a statesman. Yet he
   was unquestionably the leader in the West Frankish kingdom, and by, his
   wisdom and energy preserved the state during a sadly disordered time.
   His relations with Louis the Pious, Charles the Bald and Carloman were
   friendly. He crowned several queens of the Carolingian family, and in
   869 Charles the Bald. He also solemnized their marriages. In 859 he
   headed the German delegation to Louis, and in 860 conducted the peace
   deliberations at Coblenz. He took the side of Charles the Bald in his
   fight with Rome, and in 871 wrote for him a very violent letter to Pope
   Hadrian II. [1385] It may be said that in state politics he was more
   successful than in church politics. He preserved his king from
   disgrace, and secured his independence, but he was unable to secure for
   himself the papal sanction at all times, and the much coveted honor of
   the primacy of France which John VIII., in 876, gave to Ansegis,
   archbishop of Sens.

   One of the most important facts about these Hincmarian controversies is
   that in them for the first time the famous pseudo-Isidorian decretals
   [1386] are quoted; and that by all parties. Whether Hincmar knew of
   their fraudulent character may well be questioned, for that he had
   little if any critical ability is proved by his belief in two literary
   forgeries, an apocryphal tale of the birth of the Virgin, and a homily
   upon her assumption, [1387] attributed to Jerome. The fraud was exposed
   by Ratramnus. His use of the decretals was arbitrary. He quoted them
   when they would help him, as against the pope in contending for the
   liberty of the Frankish Church. He ignored them when they opposed his
   ideas, as in his struggle with his nephew, because in their original
   design they asserted the independence of bishops from their
   metropolitans.

   Hincmar was not only a valiant fighter, but also a faithful shepherd.
   He performed with efficiency all the usual duties of a bishop, such as
   holding councils, hearing complaints, settling difficulties, laying
   plans and carrying out improvements. He paid particular attention to
   education and the promotion of learning generally. He was himself a
   scholar and urged his clergy to do all in their power to build up the
   schools. He also gave many books to the libraries of the cathedral at
   Rheims and the monastery of St. Remi, and had many copied especially
   for them. His own writings enriched these collections. His attention to
   architecture was manifested in the stately cathedral of Rheims, begun
   by Ebo, but which he completed, and in the enlargement of the monastery
   of St. Remi.

   The career of this extraordinary man was troubled to its very end. In
   881 he came in conflict with Louis the Third by absolutely refusing to
   consecrate one of the king's favorites, Odoacer, bishop of Beauvais.
   Hincmar maintained that he was entirely unfit for the office, and as
   the Pope agreed with him Odoacer was excommunicated. In the early part
   of the following year the dreaded Normans made their appearance in the
   neighborhood of Rheims. Hincmar bethought himself of the precious
   relics of St. Remi and removed them for safety's sake to Epernay when
   he himself fled thither. There he died, Dec. 21, 882. He was buried two
   days after at Rheims.

   Looking back upon Hincmar through the vista of ten centuries, he stands
   forth as the determined, irrepressible, tireless opponent of both royal
   and papal tyranny over the Church. He asserted the liberty of the
   Gallican Church at a time when the State on the one hand endeavored to
   absorb her revenues and utilize her clergy in its struggles and wars,
   and the Pope on the other hand strove to make his authority in
   ecclesiastical matters supreme. That Hincmar was arrogant, relentless,
   self-seeking, is true. But withal he was a pure man, a stern moralist,
   and the very depth and vigor of his belief in his own opinions rendered
   him the more intolerant of the opinions of opponents, as of those of
   the unfortunate Gottschalk. The cause he defended was a just and noble
   one, and his failure to stem the tide setting toward anarchy in Church
   and State was fraught with far-reaching consequences.

   His Writings.

   His writings reveal his essentially practical character. They are very
   numerous, but usually very short. In contents they are designed for the
   most part to answer a temporary purpose. This makes them all the more
   interesting to the historian, but in the same degree of less permanent
   importance. The patristic learning they exhibit is considerable, and
   the ability great; but the circumstances of his life as prelate
   precluded him from study and quiet thought, so he was content to rely
   upon the labors of others and reproduce and adapt their arguments and
   information to his own design. Only the more important can be here
   mentioned. Some twenty-three writings are known to be lost. [1388]

   I. Writings in the Gottschalk Controversy. [1389]

   1. The first was in 855, Divine Predestination and the Freedom of the
   Will. It was in three books. All has perished, except the prefatory
   epistle to Charles the Bald. [1390]

   2. At the request of this king he wrote a second treatise upon the same
   subject. [1391]

   3. In 857 he refuted the charge made against him by Gottschalk and
   Ratramnus that in altering a line of a hymn from "Te, trina Deitas," to
   "Te, sancta Deitas," he showed a Sabellian leaning. [1392]

   II. Writings in the Hincmar of Laon Controversy. [1393] They consist of
   letters from each disputant to the other, formal charges against
   Hincmar of Laon, the sentence of his deposition, the synodical letter
   to Pope Hadrian II. and the letter of Hincmar of Laon to the same.

   III. Writings relative to political and social affairs.

   1. The divorce of king Lothair and queen Theutberga. [1394] This
   treatise dates from 863 and is the reply to thirty questions upon the
   general subject asked Hincmar by different bishops. It reveals his firm
   belief in witches, sorcery and trial by ordeal, and abounds in
   interesting and valuable allusions to contemporary life and manners.
   [1395]

   2. Addresses and prayers at the coronation of Charles the Bald, his son
   Louis II. the Stammerer, his daughter Judith, and his wife Hermintrude.
   [1396]

   3. The personal character of the king and the royal administration.
   [1397] It is dedicated to Charles the Bald, and is avowedly a
   compilation. The Scriptures and the Fathers, chiefly Ambrose, Augustin,
   and Gregory the Great are its sources. Its twenty-three chapters are
   distributed by Hincmar himself [1398] under three heads:

   (a) the royal person and office in general [chaps. 1-15]; (b) the
   discretion to be shown in the administration of justice [chaps. 16-28];
   (c) the duty of a king in the unsparing punishment of rebels against
   God, the Church and the State, even though they be near relatives
   [chaps. 29-33]. It was composed in a time of frequent rebellion, and
   therefore the king had need to exercise severity as well as gentleness
   in dealing with his subjects. [1399] Hincmar delivers himself with
   great plainness and gives wise counsels.

   4. The vices to be shunned and the virtues to be exercised. [1400]
   Another treatise designed for the guidance of Charles the Bald,
   compiled chiefly from Gregory the Great's Homilies and Morals. Its
   occasion was Charles's request of Hincmar to send him Gregory the
   Great's letter to king Reccared, when the latter came over to
   Catholicism. Hincmar's treatise is a sort of appendix. It begins with a
   reference to the letter's allusion to the works of mercy, and then out
   of Gregory's writings Hincmar proceeds to treat of these works and
   their opposite vices. In chaps. 9 and 10 Hincmar discusses the
   eucharist and shows his acceptance of the view of Paschasius Radbertus.

   5, 6. Treatises upon rape, a common offense in those lawless days.
   [1401]

   7. To the noblemen of the Kingdom for the instruction of King Carloman
   [1402] It was Hincmar's response to the highly complimentary request of
   the Frankish nobles, that he draw up some instructions for the young
   King Carloman, on his accession in 882. It was therefore one of the
   last pieces the old statesman prepared.

   IV. Writings upon ecclesiastical affairs. 1. The Capitularies of 852,
   874, 877, 881. [1403] 2. A defense of the liberties of the church,
   addressed to Charles. [1404] It is in three parts, called respectively
   Quaterniones, Rotula and Admonitio; the first sets forth the necessity
   of the independence of the Church of the State, and quotes the ancient
   Christian Roman imperial laws on the subject. The second is on the
   trial of charges against the clergy as laid down in synodical decrees
   and papal decisions. The third is an exhortation to the king to respect
   ecclesiastical rights.

   3. The crimination of priests, a valuable treatise upon the way in
   which their trials should be conducted, as shown by synodical decrees
   and quotations from Gregory the Great and others. [1405]

   4. The case of the presbyter Teutfrid, who had stolen Queen Imma's
   tunic, a golden girdle set with gems, an ivory box, and other things.
   [1406] The treatise deals with the ecclesiastico-legal aspects of the
   case, and shows how the criminal should be treated. Gregory the Great
   is freely quoted.

   V. Miscellaneous. 1. Exposition of Psalm civ. 17. [1407] In the Vulgate
   the second clause of the verse reads, "the nest of the stork is their
   chief." The treatise was written in answer to Louis the German's
   question as to the meaning of these words. He begins with a criticism
   of the text, in which he quotes the Septuagint rendering, the
   exposition of Jerome, Augustin, Prosper and Cassiodorus. The meaning he
   advocates is that the nest of the stork surpasses that of the little
   birds of which it is the chief or leader. The treatise is particularly
   interesting for its manner of dealing with one of the so-called
   Scripture difficulties,

   2. The vision of Bernold. [1408] This interesting little story dates
   from 877, the year of Charles the Bald's death. Bernold lived in
   Rheims, and was known to Hincmar. He had a vision after he had been
   four days at the point of death, which he related to his confessor, and
   the confessor to Hincmar, who for obvious reasons published it. Bernold
   regained his health, and was therefore a living witness to the accuracy
   of his story. In his vision he went to "a certain place," i.e.
   purgatory, in which he found forty-one bishops, ragged and dirty,
   exposed alternately to extreme cold and scorching heat. Among them was
   Ebo, Hincmar's predecessor, who immediately implored Bernold to go to
   their parishioners and clergy and tell them to offer alms, prayers and
   the sacred oblation for them. This he did, and on his return found the
   bishops radiant in countenance, as if just bathed and shaved, dressed
   in alb, stole and sandals, but without chasubles. Leaving them, Bernold
   went in his vision to a dark place, where he saw Charles the Bald
   sitting in a heap of putrefaction, gnawed by worms and worn to a mere
   skeleton. Charles called him by name and implored him to help him.
   Bernold asked how he could. Then Charles told him that he was suffering
   because he had not obeyed Hincmar's counsels, but if Bernold would
   secure Hincmar's help he would be delivered. This Bernold did, and on
   his return he found the king clad in royal robes, sound in flesh and
   amid beautiful surroundings. Bernold went further and encountered two
   other characters--Jesse, an archbishop, and a Count Othar, whom he
   helped by going to the earth and securing the prayers, alms and
   oblations of their friends. He finally came across a man who told him
   that in fourteen years he would leave the body and go back to the place
   he was then in for good, but that if he was careful to give alms and to
   do other good works he would have a beautiful mansion. A rustic of
   stern countenance expressed his lack of faith in Bernold's ability to
   do this, but was silenced by the first man. Whereupon Bernold asked for
   the Eucharist, and when it was given to him he drank almost half a
   goblet of wine, and said, "I could eat some food, if I had it." He was
   fed, revived and recovered. Hincmar, in relating this vision, calls
   attention to its similarity to those told in the Dialogues of Gregory
   the Great, the Ecclesiastical History of Bede, in the writings of St.
   Boniface, and to that of Wettin, which Walahfrid Strabo related. [1409]
   He ends by exhorting his readers to be more fervent in their prayers,
   and especially to pray for king Charles and the other dead.

   3. The life of St. Remigius, [1410] the patron saint of Rheims. This is
   an expansion of Fortunatus' brief biography by means of extracts from
   the Gesta Francorum, Gregory of Tours, and legendary and traditional
   sources, and particularly by means of moralizing and allegorizing. The
   length of the book is out of all proportion to its value or interest.
   To the life he adds an Encomium of St. Remigius. [1411] The object of
   these two books is not to produce history or criticism, but an edifying
   work and to exalt the church of Rheims by exalting its patron. Perhaps
   also he would hint that the gift which Chlodwig made to Remigius might
   be acceptably imitated. [1412]

   4. Hincmar appears as a genuine historian in the third part of the
   Bertinian Annals, [1413] so called because first published from a MS.
   found in the convent of St. Bertin. These Annals of the West Frankish
   Kingdom begin with the year 741 and go down to 882. Hincmar wrote them
   from 861 to 882. He evidently felt the responsibility of the work he
   conducted, for he put every fact down in a singularly impartial manner,
   especially when it is remembered that he was himself an important part
   of contemporary history. [1414]

   5. Letters. [1415] These are fifty-five in number, and are upon weighty
   matters; indeed they are official documents, and not familiar
   correspondence.

   6. Poems.. [1416] They are very few and devoid of poetical merit [1417]

   His Life.

   Of Johannes Scotus Erigena, philosopher and theologian, one of the
   great men of history, very little is known. His ancestry, and places of
   birth, education, residence and death are disputed. Upon only a few
   facts of his life, such as his position at the court of Charles the
   Bald, and his literary works, can one venture to speak authoritatively.

   He was born in Ireland [1418] between 800 and 815, educated in, one of
   its famous monastic schools, where the Greek Fathers, particularly
   Origen, were studied as well as the Latin. He went to France about 843,
   attracted the notice of Charles the Bald, and was honored with his
   friendship. [1419] The king appointed him principal of the School of
   the Palace, and frequently deferred to his judgment. John Scotus was
   one of the ornaments of the court by reason of his great learning, his
   signal ability both as teacher and philosopher, and his blameless life.
   He was popularly regarded as having boundless knowledge, and in reality
   his attainments were uncommon. He knew Greek fairly well and often
   introduces Greek words into his writings. He owed much to Greek
   theologians, especially Pseudo-Dionysius and Maximus. [1420] He was
   acquainted with the Timaes of Plato in the translation of Chalcidus and
   with the Categories of Aristotle. [1421] He was also well read in
   Augustin, Boëthius, Cassiodorus and Isidore. He took a leading part in
   the two great doctrinal controversies of his age, on predestination and
   the eucharist, [1422] and by request of Charles the Bald translated
   into Latin the Pseudo-Dionysian writings. The single known fact about
   his personal appearance is that, like Einhard, he was of small stature.
   He died about 877, probably shortly after Charles the Bald.

   His Writings.

   Besides the treatise upon Predestination and the translation of
   Dionysius, already discussed, [1423] Scotus Erigena wrote:

   1. A translation of the Obscurities of Gregory Nazianzen, by Maximus
   Confessor. [1424] This was made at the instance of Charles the Bald, in
   864.

   2. Expositions of the Heavenly Hierarchy, the, Ecclesiastical
   Hierarchy, and the Mystical Theology of Dionysius. [1425]

   3. Homily upon the prologue to John's Gospel. [1426]

   4. A commentary upon John's Gospel. [1427] Only four fragments of it
   have as yet been found.

   5. A commentary upon the Dialectic of Martianus Capella. This has been
   published by Hauréau. [1428]

   6. The outgoing and in-coming of a soul to God. [1429] Of this only a
   small fragment has as yet been found.

   7 The vision of God. This is in MS. at St. Omer and not yet printed.

   8. Verses. [1430] Among them are some Greek verses, with a self- made
   Latin interlinear translation. He introduces both single Greek words
   and verses similarly interlineated into his other poems.

   9. The great work of Scotus Erigena is The Division of Nature. [1431]
   It consists of five books in the form of a dialogue between a teacher
   and a disciple. The latter, generally speaking, represents the
   ecclesiastical conscience, but always in the end echoes his teacher.
   The style is lively and the range of topics embraces the most important
   theological cosmological and anthropological questions. The work was
   the first practical attempt made in the West to unite philosophy and
   theology. As in the dedication to Wulfad, the well-known opponent of
   Hincmar, John calls him simply "brother," the work must have been
   written prior to 865, the Year of Wulfad's elevation to the
   archiepiscopate of Bourges. [1432]

   His Theological Teaching.

   In the Division of Nature Scotus Erigena has embodied his theology and
   philosophy. By the term "Nature" he means all that is and is not.
   [1433] The latter expression he further interprets as including, 1st,
   that which is above the reach of our senses or our reason; 2d, that
   which though known to those higher in the scale of being is not known
   to those lower; 3d, that which is yet only potentially existent, like
   the human race in Adam, the plant in the seed, etc.; 4th, the material
   which comes and goes and therefore is not truly existent like the
   intelligible; 5th, sin as being the loss of the Divine image. [1434]
   Nature is divided into four species: (1) that which creates and is not
   created, (2) that which is created and creates, (3) that which is
   created and does not create, (4) that which neither creates nor is
   created. The first three divisions are a Neo-Platonic and Christian
   modification of the three-fold ontological division of Aristotle:
   [1435] the unmoved and the moving, the moved and moving, and the moved
   and not moving. The fourth form was suggested by the Pseudo-Dionysian
   doctrine of the return of all things to God.

   One of the fundamental ideas of his theology is the identity of true
   philosophy and true religion. Both have the same divine source. [1436]
   "True religion" and authority, i.e. the Church doctrine, are however
   not with him exactly identical, and in a conflict between them he sides
   with the former. In his use of Scripture he follows the allegorical
   method. He puts the Fathers almost upon a level with the Sacred Writers
   and claims that their wisdom in interpreting Scripture must not be
   questioned. At the same time he holds that it is permissible,
   especially when the Fathers differ among themselves, to select that
   interpretation of Scripture which most recommends itself to reason as
   accordant with Scripture. [1437] It is, he says, the province of reason
   to bring out the hidden meaning of the text, which is manifold,
   inexhaustible, and striking like a peacock's feathers. [1438] It is
   interesting to note in this connection that John Scotus read the New
   Testament in the original Greek, and the Old Testament in Jerome's
   version, not in the Septuagint. [1439] And it is still more interesting
   to know that he prayed most earnestly for daily guidance in the study
   of the Scriptures. [1440]

   The doctrinal teaching of Scotus Erigena can be reduced, as he himself
   states, to three heads. (1) God, the simple and at the same time the
   multiform cause of all things; (2) Procession from God, the divine
   goodness showing itself in all that is, from general to particular; (3)
   Return to God, the manifold going back into the one.

   First Head. God, or Nature, which creates but is not created. a. The
   Being of God in itself considered. God is the essence of all things,
   alone truly is, [1441] and is the beginning, middle and end of all
   things. [1442] He is incomprehensible. [1443] While the predicates of
   essence, truth, goodness, wisdom, &c., can be, according to the
   "affirmative" theology, applied to God, it can only be done
   metaphorically, because each such predicate has an opposite, while in
   God there is no opposition. Hence the "negative" theology correctly
   maintains they can not be. [1444] Neither can self-consciousness be
   predicated of God. [1445] Although not even the angels can see the
   essence of God, yet his being (i.e. the Father) can be seen in the
   being of things; his wisdom (i.e. the Son) in their orderly
   arrangement, and his life (i.e. the Holy Spirit) in their constant
   motion. [1446] God is therefore an essence in three substances. Scotus
   Erigena takes up the doctrine of John of Damascus concerning the
   procession of the Holy Spirit and applies it to the relation of the Son
   to the Father: "As the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the
   Son, so is the Son born of the Father through the Holy Spirit." [1447]
   In the old patristic fashion he compares the Three Persons to light,
   heat and radiance united in the flame. But he understood under
   "persons" no real beings, only names of the aspects and relations under
   which God's being comes out. God realizes himself in creation, and in
   every part of it, yet he does not thereby yield the simplicity of his
   essence. He is still removed from all, subsists outside of and above
   the world, which has no independent existence apart from God, but is
   simply his manifestation. He is both the substance and the accidents of
   all that exists. "God therefore is all and all is God." [1448] But God
   reveals himself to the creature. He appeared first to the pious in
   visions, but this was only occasional. [1449] He then appeared
   constantly in the form of the different virtues. [1450] The intellect
   is itself a theophany; and so is the whole world, visible and
   invisible. [1451]

   2. The Procession from God or Nature. a. Nature which creates and is
   created, or the primordial ideas of the world and their unity in the
   Logos. God is the nature and essence of the world. Creation is the
   effect of the divine nature, which as cause eternally produces its
   effects, indeed is itself in the primordial ideas the first forms and
   grounds of things. [1452] As the pure Being of God cannot immediately
   manifest itself in the finite, it is necessary that God should create
   the prototypes in which he can appear. In creation God passes through
   these prototypes or primordial causes into the world of visible
   creatures. So the Triune God enters the finite, not only in the
   Incarnation, but in all created existences. Our life is God's life in
   us. As remarked above, we know God because in us he reveals himself.
   These prototypes have only subjective existence, except as they find
   their unity in the Logos. [1453] Under the influence of the Holy Spirit
   they produce the external world of time and space.

   b. Nature, which is created and does not create, or the phenomenal
   world and its union in man. In the Logos all things existed from
   eternity. Creation is their appearance in time. The principle of the
   development of the primordial ideas is the Holy Spirit. [1454] The
   materiality of the world is only apparent, space and time only exist in
   the mind. The "nothing" from which God made the heavens and the earth
   was his own incomprehensible essence. [1455] The whole phenomenal world
   is but the shadow of the real existence. [1456] Man is the centre of
   the phenomenal world, uniting in himself all the contradictions and
   differences of creation. [1457] His intellect has the power to grasp
   the sensuous and intelligible, and is itself the substance of things.
   [1458] So all nature is created in man, and subsists in him, [1459]
   because the idea of all its parts is implanted in him. The divine
   thought is the primary, the human the secondary substance of things.
   [1460]

   Paradise is to be interpreted spiritually. Adam is not so much an
   historical personage as the human race in its preëxistent condition.
   Man was never sinless, for sin, as a limitation and defect, is not
   accidental or temporal, but original in the creation and nature of man.
   [1461]

   c. The union of divinity and created existence, or the Godman. Scotus
   Erigena shows upon this point the duality of' his system. On the one
   hand he presents Christ as an historical character, with body, mind,
   soul, spirit, in short the union of the entire sensible and
   intellectual qualities of the creature. [1462] But on the other hand he
   maintains that the Incarnation was an eternal and necessary fact,
   [1463] and that it came about through an ineffable and multiplex
   theophany in the consciousness of men and angels. [1464]

   3. The return to God, or the completion of the world in Nature, which
   creates not and is not created. a. The return to God according to its
   pre-temporal idea, or the doctrine of predestination. There is only one
   true predestination, viz. to holiness. There is no foreknowledge of the
   bad. God has completest unity and simplicity; hence his being is not
   different from his knowledge and will; and since he has full liberty,
   the organization of his nature is free. But this organization is at the
   same time to the world law and government, i.e. its predestination; and
   because God is himself goodness, the predestination can only be to
   good. The very character of wickedness,--it is opposed to God, not
   substantial in nature, a defect mixed up with the good, transitory, yet
   essential to the development of the world,--renders it unreal and
   therefore not an object of divine knowledge. God does not know the bad
   as such, but only as the negation of the good. "God's knowledge is the
   revelation of his essence, one and the same thing with his willing and
   his creating. As evil cannot be derived from the divine causality,
   neither can it be considered as an object of divine knowledge." [1465]
   Nor is there any divine predestination or foreknowledge respecting the
   punishment of the bad, for this ensues in consequence of their
   violation of law. They punish themselves. [1466] Hell is in the
   rebellious will. Predestination is, in brief, the eternal law and the
   immutable order of nature, whereby the elect are restored from their
   ruin and the rejected are shut up in their ruin. [1467]

   b. The return of all things to God considered according to their
   temporal principles, or the doctrine of salvation. There are only a few
   scattered remarks upon this subject in Scotus Erigena. Christ is the
   Saviour by what he is in himself, not by what he does. His death is
   important as the means of resurrection; which began with the
   resurrection and exaltation of Christ, because then all things began to
   return to their union in their primordial causes, and this return
   constitutes salvation. The consequences of salvation are therefore felt
   by angels as well as men, and even by inanimate things. [1468]
   Salvation, as far as we are concerned, consists in speculative
   knowledge. We unite ourselves with God by virtue of contemplation.
   [1469]

   c. The return of all things to God considered according to their future
   completion. All things came out from God, all things go back to God.
   This is the law of creation. The foundation of this return is the
   return of man to the Logos. The steps are, 1st, deliverance from the
   bodily forms; 2d, resurrection and the abrogation of sex; 3d, the
   transformation of body into spirit; 4th, the return to the primordial
   causes; 5th, the recession of nature, along with these causes, into
   God. But this, of course, implies that God alone will exist forever,
   and that there can be no eternal punishment. Scotus Erigena tries in
   vain to escape both these logical conclusions. [1470]

   His Philosophy.

   Ueberweg thus states Scotus Erigena's philosophical position and
   teachings: [1471] "The fundamental idea, and at the same time the
   fundamental error, in Erigena's doctrine is the idea that the degrees
   of abstraction correspond with the degrees in the scale of real
   existence. He hypostasizes the Tabula Logica. The universals are before
   and also in the individual objects which exist, or rather the latter
   are in the former: the distinction between these (Realistic) formulae
   appears not yet developed in his writings .... He is throughout a
   Realist. He teaches, it is true, that grammar and rhetoric, as branches
   of dialectic or aids to it, relate only to words, not to things, and
   that they are therefore not properly sciences; but he co-ordinates
   dialectic itself with ethics, physics and theology, defining it as the
   doctrine of the methodical form of knowledge, and assigning to it in
   particular, as its work, the discussion of the most general conceptions
   or logical categories (predicaments); which categories he by no means
   regards as merely subjective forms or images, but as the names of the
   highest genera of all created things ....

   "The most noteworthy features in his theory of the categories are his
   doctrine of the combination of the categories with each other, and his
   attempt to subsume them under the conceptions of motion and rest; as
   also his identification of the categories of place with definition in
   logic, which, he says, is the work of the understanding. The
   dialectical precepts which relate to the form or method of
   philosophising are not discussed by him in detail; the most essential
   thing in his regard is the use of the four forms, called by the Greeks
   division, definition, demonstration and analysis. Under the latter he
   understands the reduction of the derivative and composite to the
   simple, universal and fundamental; but uses the term also in the
   opposite to denote the unfolding of God in creation."

   His Influence and Importance.

   Scotus Erigena was considered a heretic or a madman while he lived, and
   this fact joined to the other that his views were far in advance of his
   age, caused his influence to be at first much less than might have been
   expected. He passed into almost complete obscurity before he died, as
   the conflicting reports of his later years show. Yet he did wield a
   posthumous influence. His idea of the unity of philosophy and theology
   comes up in Anselm and Thomas Aquinas; his speculation concerning
   primordial causes in Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus. From him
   Amalrich of Bena, and David of Dinanto drew their pantheism; and
   various mystical sects of the Middle Ages were inspired by him. The
   Church, ever watchful for orthodoxy, perceived that his book, De
   Divisione Naturae, was doing mischief. Young persons, even in convents
   read it eagerly. Everywhere it attracted notice. Accordingly a council,
   at Sens, formally condemned it, and then the Pope (Honorius III.)
   ordered, by a bull of Jan. 23, 1225, the destruction of all copies that
   could be found, styling it "a book teeming with the worms of heretical
   depravity." [1472] This order probably had the desired effect. The book
   passed out of notice. But in 1681 Thomas Gale issued it in Oxford.
   Again the Roman Church was alarmed, and Gregory XIII., by bull of April
   3, 1685, put it on the Index.

   Scotus Erigena was a man of rare originality and mental vigor. His
   writings are full of ideas and bold arguments. His strongly syllogistic
   mode of developing his theme was all his own, and the emphasis he put
   upon logic proves his superiority to his age. Unlike the scholastics,
   who meekly bowed to tradition, he treated it with manly independence.
   To his "disciple" he said: "Let no authority terrify thee. [1473] Hence
   it is erroneous to call him "the Father of Scholasticism;" rather is he
   the founder of Speculative Philosophy. [1474] The scholastics drew from
   him, but he was not a scholastic. The mystics drew from him, but he was
   not a mystic. As a pathfinder it was not given to him to thoroughly
   explore the rich country he traversed. But others eagerly pressed in
   along the way he opened. He is one of the most interesting figures
   among the mediaeval writers. He demands study and he rewards it. De
   Divsione Naturae is a master-piece, and, as Baur well says, "an
   organized system which comprehends the highest speculative ideas."
   [1475]

   Note on the country of birth and death of Scotus Erigena.

   The statement that John was born in Ireland rests upon the
   interpretation of his name. Scotus is indefinite, since it was used of
   both Ireland and Scotland, the former country being called Scotia
   Major. But Erigena is most probably a corruption of JIerou' [sc.
   nhvsou] gena, Hierugena, which John, with his fondness for using Greek
   words on all occasions, added to his original name to indicate his
   birth in the "holy isle," or "isle of saints," a common designation of
   Ireland. The derivation is the more probable since he himself calls
   Maximus Confessor Graiga-gena, to indicate the latter's birth in
   Greece. By his contemporaries and in the oldest codices he is called
   Joannes Scotus or Scottus, [1476] but in the oldest MSS. of his
   translation of Dionysius Joanna Ierugena. [1477] In course of time,
   owing to his scribes' ignorance of Greek, the epithet was written
   Eriugena, Erygena, and finally Erigena. Another derivation of the
   epithet, which has less to commend it, is from jIevrnh ? gevna, jIevrnh
   being the Greek name for Ireland. But this leaves the disappearance of
   the first v to be accounted for. The far-fetched explanations of
   Erigena either from Ayr, a city on the west coast of Scotland, or
   Ergene in Hereford, a shire in England on the south Welsh border, and
   gena, may be dismissed without discussion.

   The absence of authentic information to the contrary makes it probable
   that Scotus Erigena died in France. But there is a tradition that he
   was called by Alfred the Great into England and made abbot of
   Malmesbury, and there died a violent death at the hands of his
   scholars. It is inherently improbable that a conservative and loyal son
   of the church like Alfred, would invite to any position so eccentric,
   if not heretical, a man as Scotus Erigena. Charles the Bald died in
   877. It is not likely that Erigena would leave France before that date,
   but then he was at least sixty-two, and hence rather old to change his
   residence. A reference to Asser's biography of King Alfred affords a
   rational explanation of the tradition. Asser says that Alfred invited
   from Gaul a priest and monk named John, who was remarkable for energy,
   talent and learning, in order that the king might profit by his
   conversation. A few pages further on, Asser calls this John an old
   Saxon, and says that Alfred appointed him the first abbot of Athelney,
   and that he was almost murdered by hired ruffians. Mon. Hist. Brit.
   vol. i. [1848], pp. 489, 493, 4 Eng. trans. Six Old English Chronicles
   in Bohn's "Antiquarian Library," pp. 70, 80, 81. It needed only that
   the fame of John Scotus should reach England for the John of Asser's
   biography to be confounded with him, and thus the story arose as it is
   found in Ingulph, William of Malmesbury, and Matthew Paris.

   Anastasius, librarian of the Roman Church, hence surnamed the
   "Librarian," to distinguish him from others of the same name, was abbot
   of the monastery of Sancta Maria trans Tiberim under Nicolas I.
   (858-867). He was sent in 869 to Constantinople as ambassador to
   arrange a marriage between the daughter of Louis II. and a son of Basil
   the Macedonian. While there the eighth oecumenical council was in
   session, and by his knowledge of Greek he was very useful to the Papal
   ambassador in attendance. He brought back with him the canons of the
   council and at the request of Hadrian II. translated them into Latin.
   He died, according to Baronius, in 886.

   He has been identified by some (e.g. Fabricius [1478] and Hergenröther
   [1479] ) with the Cardinal presbyter Anastasius who was deposed and
   excommunicated in 850, anathematized in 853, but elected pope in 855 in
   opposition to Benedict III. whom he imprisoned. He was deposed in 856
   and died in 879. Those who accept the statement are obliged to suppose
   that for some reason Nicolas and Louis II. condoned his fault and
   Hadrian II. continued him in favor. The name Anastasius is too common
   in Church history to render it necessary or safe to resort to such an
   improbable identification.

   The fame of Anastasius rests upon his numerous translations from the
   Greek and his supposed connection with the Liber Pontificalis. [1480]
   His style is rude and semi-barbarous, but he brought to the knowledge
   of the Latins much information about the Greeks. He translated the
   canons of the sixth, seventh and eighth oecumenical councils; [1481]
   the Chronology of Nicephorus; [1482] the collection of documents in
   Greek for the history of Monotheletism which John the Deacon had made;
   [1483] and the lives of several saints. [1484] He also compiled and
   translated from Nicephorus, George Syncellus, and Theophanus Confessor
   a church history, which has been incorporated with the so-called
   Historia Miscella of Paulus Diaconus.

   His original writings now extant consist of a valuable historical
   introduction to the translation of the canons of the Eighth Oecumenical
   Council, a preface to that of the Collectanea, three letters (two to
   Charles the Bald and one to archbishop Ado), [1485] and probably the
   life of Pope Nicolas I. [1486] in the Liber Pontificalis.

   § 178. Ratherius of Verona.

   I. Ratherius, Veronensis episcopus: Opera omnia, in Migne, Tom. CXXXVI.
   col. 9-768 (reprint of ed. by Peter and, Jerome Balterini, Verona,
   1765).

   846-860. Hist. de la France, VI. 339-383. Bähr, 546-553.

   Ratherius (Rathier) was born of noble ancestry at or near Liège in 890
   (or 891) and educated at the convent of Lobbes. He became a monk,
   acquired much learning and in 931 was consecrated bishop of Verona. By
   his vigorous denunciation of the faults and failings of his clergy,
   particularly of their marriages or, as he called them, adulteries, he
   raised a storm of opposition. When Arnold of Bavaria took Verona (934),
   king Hugo of Italy deposed him for alleged connivance with Arnold and
   held him a close prisoner at Pavia from February, 935, until August,
   937, when he was transferred to the oversight of the bishop of Como.

   In the early part of 941 Ratherius escaped to Southern France, was
   tutor in a rich family of Provence, and in 944 re-entered the monastery
   of Lobbes. Two years later he was restored to his see of Verona; whence
   he was driven again in 948. From 953 to 955 he was bishop of Liège. On
   his deposition he became abbot of Alna, a dependency of the monastery
   of Lobbes, where he stirred up a controversy upon the eucharist by his
   revival of Paschasian views. In 961 he was for the third time bishop of
   Verona, but having learned no moderation from his misfortunes he was
   forced by, his indignant clergy to leave in 968. He returned to Liège
   and the abbotship of Alna. By money he secured other charges, and even
   for a year (971) forcibly held the abbotship of Lobbes. On April 25,
   974, he died at the court of the count of Namur.

   Ratherius "deserves in many respects to be styled the Tertullian of his
   time." [1487] Some see in his castigation of vice the zeal of a
   Protestant reformer, but his standpoint was different. He was learned
   and ambitious, but also headstrong and envious. His works are obscure
   in style, but full of information. The chief are

   1. The Combat, also called Preliminary discourses, in six books. [1488]
   It treats in prolix style of the different occupations and relations in
   life, and dwells particularly upon the duties of bishops. It was the
   fruit of his prison-leisure (935-937), when he was without books and
   friends.

   2. On contempt for canonical law. [1489] It dates from 961, and is upon
   the disorders in his diocese, particularly his clergy's opposition to
   his dispensation of its revenues. In all this Ratherius sees contempt
   of the canons which he cites.

   3. A conjecture of a certain quality. [1490] This is a vigorous defense
   of his conduct, written in 966. Fourteen of his Letters and eleven of
   his Sermons have been printed. [1491] In the first letter he avows his
   belief in transubstantiation.

   Gerbert, the scholar and philosopher in the Fisherman's chair, and the
   brightest light in the darkness of the tenth century was born before
   950, of low parentage, in or near Aurilac in Auvergne, and educated as
   a monk in the Benedictine convent of that place. He accompanied Count
   Borel of Barcelona to Spain and acquired there some knowledge of Arabic
   learning, but probably only through Latin translations. He also visited
   Rome (968) in company of his patron Borel, and attracted the attention
   of Pope John XIII., who recommended him to Emperor Otho the Great. He
   afterwards became the tutor and friend of the youthful Otho III., and
   inspired him with the romantic and abortive scheme of re-establishing
   the Graeco-Roman empire of Constantine the Great in the city of Rome.
   He was ambitious and fond of basking in the sunshine of imperial and
   royal favor.

   Gerbert became master of the cathedral school of Rheims and acquired
   great fame as a scholar and teacher. He collected rare and valuable
   books on every subject. He was intensely interested in every branch of
   knowledge, divine and human, especially in mathematics, astronomy,
   physics, and music; he first introduced the Arabic numerals and the
   decimal notation into France, and showed his scientific and mechanical
   genius by the construction of astronomical instruments and an organ
   blown by steam. At the same time he was a man of affairs, a statesman
   and politician. [1492]

   In 972 he obtained through imperial favor the abbey, of Bobbio, but was
   involved in contentions with the neighboring nobles and left in
   disgust, though retaining his dignity. "All Italy," he wrote to a
   friend, "appears to me a Rome, and the morals of the Romans are the
   horror of the world." He returned to his position at Rheims, attracted
   pupils from near and far and raised the cathedral school to the height
   of prosperity. He was the secretary of the council held in the basilica
   of St. Basolus near Rheims in 991, and gave shape to the flaming speech
   of the learned bishop Arnulf of Orleans against the assumptions and
   corruptions of the papacy. [1493] No Gallican could have spoken more
   boldly. By the same synod Arnulf, archbishop of Rheims, an illegitimate
   son of one of the last Carolingian kings, was deposed on the charge of
   treason against Hugh Capet, and Gerbert was chosen in his place, at the
   desire of the king. But his election was disputed, and he assumed an
   almost schismatical attitude towards Rome. He was deposed, and his
   rival Arnulf, with the aid of the pope, reinstated by a Council of
   Senlis or Rheims (996). [1494] He now left France and accepted an
   invitation of his pupil Otho III. to Magdeburg, followed him to Italy
   (996), was by imperial favor made archbishop of Ravenna (998), and a
   year afterwards raised to the papal throne as Sylvester II. He was the
   first French pope. The three R's (Rheims, Ravenna, Rome) mark his
   highest dignities, as expressed in the line ascribed to him:

   "Scandit ab R. Gerbertus in R., fit postea papa vigens R."

   As Gerbert of Rheims he had advocated liberal views and boldly attacked
   the Roman Antichrists who at that time were seated in the temple of
   God; but as Sylvester II. he disowned his Gallican antecedents and
   supported the claims of the papacy. [1495] He did, however, nothing
   remarkable during his short and troublesome pontificate (between
   999-1003), except crown King Stephen of Hungary and give the first
   impulse, though prematurely, to the crusades at a time when hundreds of
   pilgrims flocked to the Holy Land in expectation of the end of the
   world after the lapse of the first Christian millennium. [1496]

   His character has been very differently judged. The papal biographers
   of the later middle ages malignantly represent him as a magician in
   league with the devil, and his life and pontificate as a series of
   monstrous crimes. [1497] This story arose partly from his uncommon
   learning and supposed contact with Mohammedanism, partly from his
   former antagonistic position to Rome. Some modern historians make him
   an ambitious intriguer. [1498]

   His literary labors are chiefly mathematical. [1499] His theological
   works are few and unimportant, and do not rise above the superstition
   of his age. His short treatise, "De Corpore et Sanguine Domini," is a
   defense of the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught by Paschasius
   Radbertus, with the additional notion that the consecrated elements are
   not digested like other food (as the Stercorianists held), but are
   imperishable spiritual nourishment for the inner man, and constitute
   the germ of the future resurrection body. [1500] Where words give out
   there is the more room for faith. [1501]

   In his sermon De informatione episcoporum, if genuine, [1502] he
   presents the high theocratic view of the middle ages, raises the
   episcopate far above royalty, [1503] and attacks the common traffic in
   ecclesiastical dignities (simony), but maintains also that all bishops
   share with Peter the care of Christ's flock. [1504] This indicates that
   the tract was written before his elevation to the papacy, and that he
   did not hold the ultramontane or Vatican doctrine of papal absolutism.

   His Epistles to popes, emperors, kings, queens, archbishops and other
   dignitaries., shed light on the history of the times, and show his high
   connections, and his genius for politics and intrigue. [1505] They are
   mostly short, and include also some letters of Otho III. The longest
   and most interesting is addressed to Queen Adelaide, wife of Hugo
   Capet, and the suffragans of the diocese of Rheims, [1506] in defense
   of his ordination as archbishop of Rheims in opposition to his rival
   Arnulf, whom he afterwards reinstated in his see as soon as he became
   pope. [1507]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1492] Giesebrecht (I. 615) says of Gerbert: "Er gehörte zu den
   seltenen Gelehrten, die in den weltlichen Dingen gleich heimisch sind,
   wie in dem Reich der Ideen, die von unbegrenzter Empfänglichkeit sich
   jeden Stoff aneignen, leicht alle Verhältnisse durchschauen und
   bemeistern, denen die Hülfsmittel des Geistes nie versiegen, und deren
   Kräfte auch die zerstreuteste Thätigkeit kaum erschöpft."

   [1493] See above, p. 290 sqq. Baronius declares this synod a fiction of
   Gerbert, and makes him responsible for the sentiments, the Benedictine
   editors of the Hist. Lit. only for the style, of the acts, "qui est
   beaucoup au-dussus de celuis de quantité d' autres écrits du mème
   temps." The acts were first published in the Magdeburg Centuries, and
   then by Mansi and Pertz. See Hefele, IV. 647 sq.

   [1494] Richer says Senlis (in the province of Rheims); Aimons, his
   continuator says Rheims. The acts of that synod are lost. See Hefele,
   IV. 646.

   [1495] Hefele (IV. 654) assumes a gradual change in his views on the
   papal power in consequence of deeper reflection and bitter experience,
   and applies to him the words of Pius II.: "Aeneam rejicite, Pium
   recipite." Reuter says (I. 84): "Der Heros der Aufklärung wurde, der
   Repräsentant der auf übernatürlichem Fundament basirten Autorität." But
   Gerbert was a strong supernaturalist before that time, as his book on
   the Lord's Supper proves. His controversy with the papacy had nothing
   to do with doctrine any more than the controversy between Gallicanism
   and Ultramontanism. It was simply a question as to the extent of papal
   jurisdiction.

   [1496] See above, p. 295 sq.

   [1497] Döllinger, in his Papstfabeln des Mittelalters (English transl.
   ed. by Henry B. Smith, pp. 267-272), devotes several pages to this
   fable, and tram it to Rome and to Cardinal Benno, the calumnious enemy
   of Gregory VII., who was likewise accused of black arts. According to
   Benno, Satan promised his pupil Gerbert that he should not die till he
   had said mass in Jerusalem. Gerbert thought himself safe till he should
   get to Palestine; but when he read mass in the Jerusalem church (Santa
   Croce in Jersalemme) at Rome, he was summoned to die, and caused his
   tongue and hand to be cut off by way of expiation. The Dominicans
   adopted the myth, and believed that Gerbert early sold himself to
   Satan, was raised by him to the papal throne, and had daily intercourse
   with him, but confessed at last his enormous crimes, and showed his
   repentance by hacking off one limb after another. Since that time the
   rattling of his bones in the tomb gives notice of the approaching death
   of the pope.

   [1498] So especially Gfrörer, partly also Hauck. But Hock, Büdinger and
   Damberger defend his character and orthodoxy. Neander, Hefele,
   Giesebrecht deal justly with him.

   [1499] 502 "Lesavoir dominant de Gerbert était la science des
   mathematiques." (Hist. Lit. de la France.) He wrote De numerorum
   divisione; De geometria; De spherae constructione; De Rationali et

   [1504] L.c. col. 171, in explaining "Pasce oves meas " (John 21: 15

   The most distinguished pupils of Gerbert were the Emperor Otho III.,
   King Robert of France, Richer, the historian of France, and Fulbert of
   Chartres, the most renowned teacher of his age. They represent the rise
   of a new zeal for learning which began to dispel the darkness of the
   tenth century. France took the lead, Italy followed.

   Fulbert, called by his admiring disciples "the Socrates of the Franks,"
   was born of poor and obscure parents, probably at Chartres, about 950,
   and educated in the cathedral school of Rheims by Gerbert. He founded a
   similar school at Chartres, which soon acquired a brilliant reputation
   and rivalled that of Rheims. About 1003 he was elected chancellor of
   the church of Chartres, and in 1007 its bishop. When the cathedral
   burned down (1020), he received contributions from all parts of France
   and other countries for its reconstruction, but did not live to finish
   it. He was involved in the political and ecclesiastical disturbances of
   his country, opposed the use of the sword by the bishops, and the
   appropriation of church property, and sale of offices by the avaricious
   laity. He lost the favor of the court by his opposition to the
   intrigues of Queen Constantia. He died April 10, 1029. [1508]

   Fulbert's fame rests chiefly on his success as a living teacher. This
   is indicated by his surname. [1509] He was not an original thinker, but
   knew how to inspire his pupils with enthusiasm. [1510] His personality
   was greater than his learning. He wisely combined spiritual edification
   with intellectual instruction, and aimed at the eternal welfare of his
   students. He used to walk with them at eventide in the garden and to
   engage in familiar conversations on the celestial country; sometimes he
   was overcome by his feelings, and adjured them with tears, never to
   depart from the path of truth and to strive with all might after that
   heavenly home. [1511]

   His ablest pupil was Berengar of Tours, the vigorous opponent of
   transubstantiation, and it has sometimes been conjectured that he
   derived his views from him. [1512] But Fulbert adhered to the
   traditional orthodoxy, and expressed himself against innovations, in
   letters to his metropolitan, Leutberich, archbishop of Sens. He
   regarded the real presence as an object of faith and adoration rather
   than of curious speculation, but thought that it is not more difficult
   to believe in a transformation of substance by Divine power than in the
   creation of substance. [1513] He was a zealous worshipper of the
   saints, especially of the Virgin Mary, and one of the first who
   celebrated the festival of her Nativity.

   The works of Fulbert consist of one hundred and thirty-nine (or 138)
   Letters, including some letters of his correspondents; [1514] nine
   Sermons; [1515] twenty-seven Hymns and Poems,, [1516] and a few minor
   compositions, including probably a life of St. Autbert. [1517] His
   letters have considerable interest and importance for the history of
   his age. The longest and most important letter treats of three
   doctrines which he regarded as essential and fundamental, namely, the
   trinity, baptism, and the eucharist. [1518]

   From the school of Gerbert at Rheims proceeded the school of Fulbert at
   Chartres, and from this again the school of Berengar at Tours--all
   equally distinguished for popularity and efficiency. They in turn were
   succeeded by the monastic school of Lanfranc at Bec, who came from
   Italy, labored in France, opposed Berengar, his rival, and completed
   his career in England as archbishop of Canterbury. He was excelled by
   his pupil and successor, Anselm, the second Augustin, the father of
   Catholic scholasticism. With him began a new and important chapter in
   the development of theology.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1508] An epitaph (in Migne, l.c. 165) describes Fulbert as "suae
   tempestatis [sui temporis] pontificum decus, lux praeclara mundo a Deo
   data, pauperum sustentator, desolatorum consolator, praedonum et
   latronuin refrenator, vir eloquentissimus, et sapientissimus tam in
   divinis quam in liberalium artium libris" There is also an epitaph in
   poetry, l.c. col. 171.

   [1509] "Venerabilis ille Socrates" he is called by Adelmann.

   [1510] Reuter (I. 89) characterizes him very well: "Ein ungewöhnliches
   pädagogisches Talent ist sicher demjenigen eigen gewesen, welchen die
   bewundernden Schüler den Socrates der Franken nannten. Die
   Persönlichkeit war ungleich grösser als die wissenschaftliche Leistung,
   das individuell Anfassende bedeutsamer als die materielle Unterweisung.
   Nicht fähig originelle Gedanken zu entwickeln und mitzutheilen, hat
   Fulbert als Bildner der Eigenthümlichkeit begabter Schüler seine
   Virtuosität in der anreqenden Kraft seines Umgangs gezeigt. Dieser
   Lehrer wurde der Vater gar verschieden gestimmter wissenschaftlicher
   Söhne."

   [1511] Adelmann, one of his pupils, in a letter to Berengar, his
   fellow-student, reminded him of these memorable conversations, and
   warned him against error. See p. 554, and Neander, III. 502.

   [1512] By Bishop Cosin (in his Hist. Transsubstantiationis), as quoted
   by Robertson, If. 607.

   [1513] Ep. V. (Migne, col. 201): "Jam nunc ad illud Dominici corporis
   et sanguinis transeamus venerabile sacramentum, quod quidem tantum
   formidabile est ad loquendum: quantum non terrenum, sed coeleste est
   mysterium; non humanae aestimationi comparabile, sed admirable non
   disputandum, sed metuendum. De quo silere potius aestimaveram quam
   temeraria disputatione indigne aliquid definire; quia coelestis
   altitudo mysterii plane non valet officio linguae corruptibilis exponi.
   Est enim mysterium fide non specie aestimandum, non visu corporeo, sed
   spiritu intuendum." Then toward,; the close of the same letter (col.
   204) he says: "Si Deum omnia posse credis, et hoc consequitur ut
   credas; nec humanis disputationibus discernere curiosus insistes, si
   creaturas quas de nihilo potuit creare, has ipsas multo magis valeat in
   excellentioris naturae dignitatem convertere, et in sui corporis
   substantiam transfundere." The last phrase is nearly equivalent to
   transubstantiation.

   Among the historical writers of the eleventh century, Rodulfus Glaber,
   and Adam of Bremen deserve special mention, the one for France, the
   other for the North of Europe.

   Rodulfus Glaber [1519] was a native of Burgundy, sent to a convent in
   early youth by his uncle, and expelled for bad conduct; but he reformed
   and joined the strict Benedictine school of Cluny. He lived a while in
   the monastery of St. Benignus, at Dijon, then at Cluny, and died about
   1050.

   His chief work is a history of his own time, from 1000-1045, in five
   books. Though written in barbarous Latin and full of inaccuracies,
   chronological blunders, and legendary miracles, it is an interesting
   and indispensable source of information, and gives vivid pictures of
   the corrupt morals of that period. [1520] He wrote also a biography of
   St. William, abbot of Dijon, who died 1031. [1521]

   Adam of Bremen, a Saxon by birth, educated (probably) at Magdeburg,
   teacher and canon of the chapter at Bremen (1068), composed, between
   1072 and 1076, a history of the Bishops of Hamburg-Bremen. [1522] This
   is the chief source for the oldest church history of North Germany and
   Scandinavia, from 788 to the death of Adalbert, who was archbishop of
   Bremen from 1045-1072. Adam drew from the written sources in the rich
   library, of the church at Bremen, and from oral traditions. [1523] He
   went to the Danish King Sven Estrithson, who "preserved the whole
   history of the barbarians in his memory as in a book." He is impartial
   and reliable, but neglects the chronology, . He may almost be called
   the Herodotus of the North except for his want of simplicity. He was
   familiar with Virgil, Horace, Lucian, and formed his style chiefly
   after Sallust; hence his artificial brevity and sententiousness. [1524]
   He ranks with the first historians of the middle ages. [1525]

   [1520] This is the judgment of Waitz (Mon. Germ. VII. 49), and
   Giesebrecht (II. 567). Wattenbach (Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen,

   gewissenhafte Forschung geht auf Adam zurück und seine Autorität stand
   von Anfang an mit Recht in hohem Ansehen."

   [1525] Lappenberg (in Mon. Gem. VII. 267): "Paucissimi sane sunt inter
   medii aevi historicos, qui rerum traditarum gravitate, perspicuitate,
   iudicii ingenuitate, fontium scriptorum cognitione, sermonium ore
   traditorum accurata perceptione ita emineant, ut Adamus, magister

   I. Life. Peter Damianus or Damiani (1007-1072), [1526] a friend of
   Hildebrand and zealous promoter of the moral reform of the clergy, was
   a native of Ravenna, had a very hard youth, but with the help of his
   brother Damianus (whose name he adopted), [1527] he was enabled to
   study at Ravenna, Faenza and Parma. He acquired honor and fortune as a
   teacher of the liberal arts in his native city. In his thirtieth year
   he suddenly left the world and became a hermit at Fonte Avellano near
   Gubbio (Eugubium) in Umbria, following the example of his countryman,
   Romuald, whose life he described. [1528] He soon reached the height of
   ascetic holiness and became abbot and disciplinarian of the hermits and
   monks of the whole surrounding region. Even miracles were attributed to
   him.

   He systematized and popularized a method of meritorious
   self-flagellation in connection with the recital of the Psalms; each
   Psalm was accompanied with a hundred strokes of a leathern thong on the
   bare back, the whole Psalter with fifteen thousand strokes. This
   penance became a rage, and many a monk flogged himself to death to the
   music of the Psalms for his own benefit, or for the release of souls in
   purgatory. The greatest expert was Dominicus, who wore an iron cuirass
   around his bare body (hence called Loricatus), and so accelerated the
   strokes that he absolved without a break twelve Psalters; at last he
   died of exhaustion(1063). [1529] Even noble women ardently practiced
   "hoc purgatorii genus," as Damiani calls it. He defended this
   self-imposed penance against the opponents as a voluntary imitation of
   the passion of Christ and the sufferings of martyrs, but he found it
   necessary also to check unnatural excesses among his disciples, and
   ordered that no one should be forced to scourge himself, and that forty
   Psalms with four thousand strokes at a time should be sufficient as a
   rule.

   The ascetic practice which he encouraged by word and example, had
   far-reaching consequences; it became a part of the monastic discipline
   among Dominicans [1530] and Franciscans, and assumed gigantic
   proportions in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially
   during the reign of the Black Death (1349), when fraternities of
   Flagellants or Cross-bearers, moved by a spirit of repentance, preceded
   by crosses, stripped to the waist, with faces veiled, made pilgrimages
   through Italy, Germany and England and scourged themselves, while
   chanting the penitential psalms, twice a day for thirty-three days, in
   memory of the thirty-three years of our Lord's life. [1531]

   Damiani became the leader of the strict monastic party which centred at
   Cluny and labored, from the sacerdotal and theocratic point of view,
   for a reformation of the clergy and the church at a time of their
   deepest degradation and corruption. He compared the condition of his
   age to that of Sodom and Gomorrah; he opposed simony and the
   concubinage of priests, as the two chief sources of evil. He advocated
   a law which punished simony with deposition, and which prohibited the
   laity from hearing mass said by married priests. Such a law was enacted
   by the Lateran Council of 1059. He also condemned in the clergy the
   practice of bearing arms, although even Pope Leo IX., in 1053, led an
   army against the pillaging Normans. He firmly maintained that a priest
   should not draw the sword even in defense of the faith, but contend
   only with the Word of God and the weapon of the Spirit.

   A man of such talent, piety and energy could not remain hidden in the
   desert. He was drawn to Rome, and against his will chosen bishop of
   Ostia and Cardinal of the Roman church by Stephen X. in 1058. He
   narrowly escaped the triple crown in 1061. He was the spiritual
   counsellor and censor of the Hildebrandian popes (Gregory VI., Clement
   II., Leo IX., Victor II., Stephen X., Nicolas II., Alexander II.), and
   of Hildebrand himself. He was employed on important missions at Milan,
   Florence, Montecassino, Cluny, Mainz, Frankfort. He helped to put down
   the papal schism of Cadalous. [1532] He had the confidence of the
   Emperor Henry III. whom he highly praise as a second David, became
   confessor of the widowed Empress Agnes, and prevented the divorce of
   her son Henry IV. from his wife Bertha. He resigned his bishopric, but
   was again called out from his retreat by Hildebrand; hence he called
   him his holy Satan, and also the lord of the pope. [1533] He despised
   the vanities and dignities of high office. He preferred his monastic
   cell in the Apennines, where he could conquer his own world within,
   recite the Psalter, scourge himself, and for a change write satires and
   epigrams, and make wooden spoons. "What would the bishops of old have
   done," he said, "had they to endure the torments which now attend the
   episcopate? To ride forth constantly accompanied by troops of soldiers
   with swords and lances, to be girt about with armed men, like a heathen
   general! Every day royal banquets, every day parade! The table loaded
   with delicacies for voluptuous guests; while the poor pine away with
   famine!"

   His last work was to heal a schism in the church of his native city. On
   his return he died of fever at Faenza, Feb. 23, 1072, one year before
   Hildebrand ascended the papal chair to carry out the reforms for which
   Damiani had prepared the way with narrow, but honest, earnest and
   unselfish devotion.

   II. The Works of Damiani consist of Epistles, Sermons, Lives of Saints,
   ascetic tracts, and Poems. They are a mirror of the church of his age.

   1. The Epistles are divided into eight books. They are addressed (a) to
   contemporary Roman Bishops (Gregory VI., Clement II., Leo IX., Victor
   II., Nicolas II., Alexander II., and the Anti-pope Cadalous or Honorius
   II.); (b) to the Cardinal Bishops, and to Cardinal Hildebrand in
   particular; (c) to Patriarchs and to the Archbishops of Ravenna and
   Cologne; (d) to various Bishops; (e) to Archpresbyters, Archdeacons,
   Presbyters and other clergy. They give a graphic picture of the
   corruptions of the church in his times, and are full of zeal for a
   moral reform. He subscribes himself "Petrus peccator monachus." The
   letters to the anti-pope Cadalous show his power of sarcasm; he tells
   him that his very name from cado, to fall, and laov", people, was
   ominous, that he deserved a triple deposition, that his new crime was
   adultery and simony of the worst sort, that he had sold his own church
   (Parma) and bought another, that the church was desecrated to the very
   top by such adulteries. He prophesied his death within one year, but
   Cadalous outlived it, and Damiani defended his prophecy as applying to
   moral death.

   2. Sermons, seventy-four in number. [1534] They are short and treat of
   church festivals, apostles, the Virgin Mary, martyrs, saints, relics,
   and enjoin a churchly and ascetic piety.

   3. Lives of Saints, of the Benedictine order, namely, Odilo of Cluny,
   Romuald, Rodulphus, and Dominicus Loricatus (the hero of
   self-flagellation), whose examples are held up for imitation. [1535]

   4. Dogmatic Discussions, De Fide Catholica; Contra Judaeos; Dialogus
   inter Judaeum et Christianum; De Divina Omnipotentia; De Processione
   Spiritus Sancti (against the Greeks), etc. [1536]

   5. Polemic and ascetic treatises. The most important is the Liber
   Gomorrhianus (1051), a fearless exposure of clerical immorality which
   appeared to him as bad as the lewdness of Sodom and Gomorrah (hence the
   title). [1537] It is addressed to Pope Leo IX. and calls on him to
   exercise his authority in removing the scandals. The Liber Gratissimus,
   addressed to Henry, archbishop of Ravenna, is directed against simony.
   [1538] He wrote also tracts on the contempt of the world, on monastic
   perfection, on the life of hermits, on sacerdotal celibacy, against
   intemperance, against avarice, etc. [1539]

   6. On Miracles and Apparitions. [1540]

   7. On the Pictures of the chief Apostles, especially Peter and Paul.
   [1541]

   8. Exposition of the Canon of the Mass, and other liturgical topics.
   [1542]

   9. Exegetical Fragments on the Old and New Testaments. [1543]

   10 Poems, satires, epigrams and Prayers. [1544] His best hymn is on the
   glory of Paradise, based on poetic prose of St. Augustin: "Ad perennis
   vitae fontem mens sativit arida." [1545]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1526] There are several distinguished persons of that name, (a)
   Damianus, brother of Cosmas; they were physicians in Sicily who took no
   fees, and died as "silverless" martyrs of the Diocletian persecution
   (303), and became the patrons of physicians and druggists throughout
   the middle ages. The Greeks distinguish three pairs of these brothers.
   (b) Damianus, patriarch of Alexandria, d. 601, who leaned to
   Sabellianism and Monophysitism. (c) D., bishop of Pavia, who drew up a
   confession of faith against the Monothelites, A.D. 679.

   Pamphilus,

   [1530] St. Dominic, the founder of the order of the Dominicans
   (1170-1221), is said to have scourged himself every night three times,
   first for himself, then for his contemporaries, and last for the souls
   in purgatory.

   [1533] In two of his best epigrams, he says of Hildebrand (Migne, II.

       a poetical composition on the Martyrs of the monastery of Mar Sâba
       (March 20), and one on the Circumcision. "His style," he says,
       "seems formed on that of S. Cosmas, rather than on that of his own
       uncle. He is not deficient in elegance and richness of typology,
       but exhibits something of sameness, and is occasionally guilty of
       very hard metaphors.": [499]1

       Italien erhalten haben; es ist soeben bemerkt worden, dass, nach
       dem Zeugniss des Jonas von Orléans, man um 840 versuchte, sie von
       neuen zu verbreiten. Dass sie sich aber bis zum Auftreten des Peter
       Waldus und speciell in den piemontesischen Thälern fortgepflanzt,

       Er ging aber täglich, wenn er bei guter Laune war, bei allen seinen
       Frauen umher, gab jeder einen Kuss, sprach einige Worte und spielte
       mit ihr. Wir haben gesehen, dass seine Familie neun Hütten besass,
       dies war auch die, Anzahl der Frauen, welche er bei seinem Tode
       hinterliess. Doch gab es Zeiten, zu denen sein Harem stärker war.
       Er brachte dann einige seiner Schönen in den Häusern von Nachbarn

       sobald der concrete Boden der Erwählung nicht mehr die Kirche und
       ihre Sakramente, sondern ein lediglich fingirtes vorzeitliches
       Decret Gottes ist. Es taucht dann immer ein Surrogat der Phantasie,
       die s. g. unsichtbare Kirche auf, und diejenigen, welche die
       grossartige realistische Lehre des hl. Augustin von der Kirche und
       den Sakramenten zerstören, nennen sich vorzüglich Augustinianer,
       indem sie nicht wissen, dass die Lehre Augustins von der

     * Die Lehre Berengar's schliesst sich ganz an die des Ratramnus an,
       ist aber zugleich eine Fortbildung derselben. Wie Ratramnus sich
       eigentlich nur in der Sphäre des Verhältnisses von Bild und Sache
       bewegt, so sucht dagegen Berengar zu zeigen, dass ungeachtet keine
       andere Ansicht vom Abendmahl möglich sei, als die symbolische, dem
       Abendmahldoch seine volle Realität bleibe, dass, wenn man auch im
       Abendmahl den Leib und das Blut Christi nicht wirklich geniesse,
       doch auch so eine reelle Verbindung mit den Fleisch oder der in den
       Himmel erhöchten Menschheit Christi stattfinde. Es ist im

       vorher und nachher kein Volk ein gleiches an die Seite gesetzt hat.
       Das Bild des Karolingischen Staates tritt uns in voller

       als die materielle Unterweisung. Nicht fähig originelle Gedanken zu
       entwickeln und mitzutheilen, hat Fulbert als Bildner der
       Eigenthümlichkeit begabter Schüler seine Virtuosität in der

       der heidnisch-antiken Philosophie, hauptsächlich dem Platonismus,
       und zwar in der neuplatonischen Form, wie schon eine sehr
       fluechtige Kenntniss desselben alsbald zeigt, und in allen
       Einzelheiten, freilich nicht ohne einige Uebertreibung, von Nitzsch
       nach gewiessen worden Werk erhält nicht bloss durch das starke
       Hervortreten stoischroemischer Ethik einen christlichen Anschein,
       sondern diesenimmt hier auch mitunter in der That eine specifisch
       christliche Färbung an, wie es denn selbst auch an Reminiscenzen
       aus der Bibel nicht ganz fehlt. Hoechst merkwuerdig ist, wie in
       diesem Werke des letzten der roemischen Philosophen, wie Zeller ihn
       mit Recht nennt, diese verschiedenen, zum Theil ganz heterogenen
       Elemente sich durchdringen zu einer doch einigen Gesammtwirkung in
       Folge des sittlichen Moments, worin seine, wie ueberhaupt des
       römischen Eklekticismus Stärke beruht.": [705]1
