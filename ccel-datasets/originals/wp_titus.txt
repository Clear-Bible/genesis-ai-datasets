  Titus

A.T. Robertson
     __________________________________________________________________

   1:1 According to the faith of God's elect [kata pistin eklektOn theou].
   Here [kata] expresses the aim of Paul's apostleship, not the standard
   by which he was chosen as in Php 3:14; a classic idiom, repeated here
   with [epignOsin, eusebeian, epitagen], "with a view to" in each case.
   For "God's elect" see Ro 8:33; Col 3:12. The knowledge [epignOsin].
   "Full knowledge," one of Paul's favourite words. For the phrase see 1Ti
   2:4. Which is according to godliness [tes kat' eusebeian]. "The (truth)
   with a view to godliness." The combination of faith and full knowledge
   of the truth is to bring godliness on the basis of the hope of life
   eternal.

   1:2 God who cannot lie [ho apseudes theos]. "The non-lying God." Old
   adjective [a] privative and [pseudes], here only in N.T. See 2Ti 2:13.
   In Polycarp's last prayer. Promised [epeggeilato]. First aorist middle
   indicative of [epaggellO]. Antithesis in [ephanerOsen de] (manifested)
   in verse 3 (first aorist active indicative of [phaneroO]. Same contrast
   in Ro 16:25; Col 1:26. Before times eternal [pro chronOn aiOnOn]. Not
   to God's purpose before time began (Eph 1:4; 2Ti 1:9), but to definite
   promises (Ro 9:4) made in time (Lock). "Long ages ago." See Ro 16:25.

   1:3 In his own seasons [kairois idiois]. Locative case. See 1Ti 2:6;
   6:15. In the message [en kerugmati]. See 1Co 1:21; 2:4 for this word,
   the human proclamation (preaching) of God's word. Wherewith I was
   intrusted [ho episteuthen]. Accusative relative [ho] retained with the
   first aorist passive indicative of [pisteuO] as in 1Ti 1:11. See 1Ti
   2:7. Of God our Saviour [tou sOteros hemOn theou]. In verse 4 he
   applies the words "[tou sOteros hemOn]" to Christ. In 2:13 he applies
   both [theou] and [sOteros] to Christ.

   1:4 My true child [gnesiOi teknOi]. See 1Ti 1:2 for this adjective with
   Timothy. Titus is not mentioned in Acts, possibly because he is Luke's
   brother. But one can get a clear picture of him by turning to 2Co 2:13;
   7:6-15; 8:6-24; 12:16-18; Ga 2:1-3; Tit 1:4f.; 3:12; 2Ti 4:10. He had
   succeeded in Corinth where Timothy had failed. Paul had left him in
   Crete as superintendent of the work there. Now he writes him from
   Nicopolis (Tit 3:12). After a common faith [kata koinen pistin]. Here
   [kata] does mean standard, not aim, but it is a faith [pistin] common
   to a Gentile (a Greek) like Titus as well as to a Jew like Paul and so
   common to all races and classes (Jude 1:3). [Koinos] does not here have
   the notion of unclean as in Ac 10:14; 11:8.

   1:5 For this cause [toutou charin]. In N.T. only here and Eph 3:1,14.
   Paul may be supplementing oral instruction as in Timothy's case and may
   even be replying to a letter from Titus (Zahn). Left I thee in Crete
   [apeleipon se en Kretei]. This is the imperfect active of [apoleipO],
   though MSS. give the aorist active also [apelipon] and some read
   [kateleipon] or [katelipon]. Both are common verbs, though Paul uses
   [kataleipO] only in 1Th 3:1 except two quotations (Ro 11:4; Eph 5:31)
   and [apoleipO] only here and 2Ti 4:13, 20. Perhaps [apoleipO] suggests
   a more temporary stay than [kataleipO]. Paul had apparently stopped in
   Crete on his return from Spain about A.D. 65. That thou shouldest set
   in order [hina epidiorthOsei]. Late and rare double compound
   (inscriptions, here only in N.T.), first aorist middle subjunctive
   (final clause with [hina] of [epidiorthoO], to set straight [orthoO]
   thoroughly [dia] in addition [epi], a clean job of it. The things that
   were wanting [ta leiponta]. "The things that remain." See 3:13; Lu
   18:22. Either things left undone or things that survive. In both senses
   the new pastor faces problems after the tornado has passed. Parry takes
   it "of present defects" in Cretan character. And appoint [kai
   katasteseis]. Final clause still and first aorist active subjunctive of
   [kathistemi], the word used in Ac 6:13 about the deacons. The word does
   not preclude the choice by the churches (in every city, [kata polin],
   distributive use of [kata]. This is a chief point in the [epidorthOsis]
   (White). Elders [presbuterous]. See 1Ti 3:2; 4:17. As I gave thee
   charge [hOs egO soi dietaxamen]. First aorist (constative) middle
   imperative of [diatassO], clear reference to previous personal details
   given to Titus on previous occasions.

   1:6 Blameless [anegkletos]. In a condition of first class. Used in 1Ti
   3:10 of deacons which see. That believe [pista]. Added to what is in
   1Ti 3:4. "Believing children." Not accused of riot [me en kategoriai
   asOtias]. See 1Ti 5:19 for [kategoria] and Eph 5:18 for [asOtia]. "Not
   in accusation of profligacy." Unruly [anupotakta]. See 1Ti 1:9. Public
   disorder, out of doors. See also verse 10.

   1:7 The bishop [ton episkopon]. Same office as "elder" in 1:5. "Elder
   is the title, oversight is the function" (B. Weiss). As God's steward
   [hOs theou oikonomon]. See 1Co 4:1f. for Paul's idea of the bishop
   (elder) as God's steward (cf. 1Co 9:17; Col 1:25; Eph 3:2; 1Ti 1:4).
   Not self-willed [me authade]. Old word (from [autos, hedomai],
   self-pleasing, arrogant. In N.T. only here and 2Pe 2:10. Not soon angry
   [orgilon]. Old adjective from [orge] (anger). Here only in N.T.
   Vulgate, iracundum. For "brawler" and "striker" see 1Ti 3:2. Not greedy
   of filthy lucre [aischrokerde]. "Not greedy of shameful gain." Used of
   deacons in 1Ti 3:8, [aphilarguron] used of elders in 1Ti 3:3.

   1:8 A lover of good [philagathon]. Late double compound [philos,
   agathos]. See Wisdom 7:22. Here only in N.T. Just [dikaion], holy
   [hosion] not in 1Ti 3. Temperate [egkrate]. Old and common adjective
   [en, kratos], strength), having power over, controlling, here only in
   N.T. Picture of self-control.

   1:9 Holding to [antechomenon]. Present middle participle of [antechO],
   old verb, to hold back, in middle to hold oneself face to face with, to
   cling to, as in 1Th 5:14. The faithful word [tou pistou logou]. See 1Ti
   1:15; 6:3; Ro 16:17. Some would see a reference here to Christ as the
   Personal Logos. That he may be able [hina dunatos ei]. Final clause
   with present active subjunctive. Paul several times uses [dunatos eimi]
   in the sense of [dunamai], with infinitive as here (Ro 4:21; 11:23; 2Ti
   1:12). The gainsayers [tous antilegontas]. Present active participle of
   [antilegO], old word, to answer back, as in Ro 10:21. "The talkers
   back."

   1:10 Vain talkers [mataiologoi]. Late and rare compound, empty talkers,
   in Vett. Val. and here. See 1Ti 1:6 for [mataiologia]. Deceivers
   [phrenapatai]. Late and rare compound, in papyri, eccl. writers, here
   alone in N.T. "Mind-deceivers." See Ga 6:3 for [phrenapatain].
   Specially they of the circumcision [malista hoi ek tes peritomes]. Same
   phrase in Ac 11:2; Ga 2:12; Col 4:11. Jews are mentioned in Crete in Ac
   2:11. Apparently Jewish Christians of the Pharisaic type tinged with
   Gnosticism.

   1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped [hous dei epistomizein]. Literally,
   "whom it is necessary to silence by stopping the mouth." Present active
   infinitive [epistomizein], old and common verb [epi], [stoma], mouth),
   here only in N.T. To stop the mouth either with bridle or muzzle or
   gag. Overthrow [anatrepousin]. Old and common verb, to turn up, to
   overturn. In N.T. only here and 2Ti 2:18. In papyri to upset a family
   by perversion of one member. Things which they ought not [ha me dei].
   Note subjective negative [me] with indefinite relative and indicative
   mode. For filthy lucre's sake [aischrou kerdous charin]. The Cretans
   are given a bad reputation for itinerating prophets for profit by
   Polybius, Livy, Plutarch. Paul's warnings in 1Ti 3:3,8; 6:5 reveal it
   as "a besetting temptation of the professional teacher" (Parry). See
   verse 7 above. Disgraceful gain, made in shameful ways.

   1:12 A prophet of their own [idios autOn prophetes]. "Their own
   prophet." Self-styled "prophet" (or poet), and so accepted by the
   Cretans and by Cicero and Apuleius, that is Epimenides who was born in
   Crete at Cnossos. It is a hexameter line and Callimachus quoted the
   first part of it in a Hymn to Zeus. It is said that Epimenides
   suggested to the Athenians the erection of statues to "unknown gods"
   (Ac 17:23). Liars [pseustai]. See 1Ti 1:10 for the word. The Cretans
   had a bad reputation on this line, partly due to their claim to having
   the tomb of Zeus. Evil beasts [kaka theria]. "Wicked wild beasts." Lock
   asks if the Minotaur was partly responsible. Idle gluttons [gasteres
   argai]. "Idle bellies." Blunt and forceful. See Php 3:19 "whose god is
   the belly" [he koilia]. Both words give the picture of the sensual
   gormandizer.

   1:13 Testimony [marturia]. Of the poet Epimenides. Paul endorses it
   from his recent knowledge. Sharply [apotomOs]. Old adverb from
   [apotomos] (from [apotemnO], to cut off), in N.T. only here and 2Co
   13:10, "curtly," "abruptly." It is necessary to appear rude sometimes
   for safety, if the house is on fire and life is in danger. That they
   may be sound [hina hugiainOsin]. Final clause with [hina] and present
   active subjunctive of [hugiainO], for which verb see on 1Ti 1:10.

   1:14 See 1Ti 1:4 for [prosechO] and [muthois], only here we have Jewish
   [Ioudaikois] added. Perhaps a reference to the oral traditions
   condemned by Christ in Mr 7:2-8. See also Col 2:22, apparently
   Pharisaic type of Gnostics. Who turn away from the truth
   [apostrephomenOn]. Present middle (direct) participle of [apostrephO],
   "men turning themselves away from the truth" (accusative according to
   regular idiom). "The truth" (1Ti 4:3) is the gospel (Eph 4:21).

   1:15 To them that are defiled [tois memiammenois]. Perfect passive
   articular participle of [miainO], old verb, to dye with another colour,
   to stain, in N.T. only here, Jude 1:8; Heb 12:15. See [memiantai]
   (perf. pass. indic.) in this verse. [MolunO] (1Co 8:7) is to smear.
   Unbelieving [apistois]. As in 1Co 7:12f.; 1Ti 5:8. The principle or
   proverb just quoted appears also in 1Co 6:12; 10:23; Ro 14:20. For the
   defilement of mind [nous] and conscience [suneidesis] in both Gentile
   and Jew by sin, see Ro 1:18-2:29.

   1:16 They profess [homologousin]. Present active indicative of
   [homologeO], common verb [homou, legO] as in Ro 10:10f. [Eidenai]
   (know) is second perfect active infinitive of [oida] in indirect
   assertion. By their works [tois ergois]. Instrumental case. They deny
   [arnountai]. Present middle of [arneomai], old verb, common in the
   Gospels and the Pastoral Epistles (1Ti 5:8; Tit 2:12; 2Ti 2:12).
   Abominable [bdeluktoi]. Verbal adjective from [bdelussomai]. Only in
   LXX and here. Disobedient [apeitheis]. See Ro 1:30. Reprobate
   [adokimoi]. See on 1Co 9:27; Ro 1:28.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 But speak thou [su de lalei]. In contrast to these Pharisaic
   Gnostics in Crete. Befit [prepei]. Old verb to be becoming, seemly. See
   1Ti 2:10; Eph 5:3. With dative case [didaskaliai]. Sound
   [hugiainousei]. Healthful as in 1:13; 2:2; 1Ti 1:10, common word in the
   Pastorals.

   2:2 Aged men [presbutas]. See Phm 1:9 for this word. For discussion of
   family life see also Co 3:18-4:1; Eph 5:22-6:9; 1Ti 5:1-6:2. For the
   adjectives here see 1Ti 3:2, 8; for the substantives see 1Ti 6:11.

   2:3 Aged women [presbutidas]. Old word, feminine of [presbutes], only
   here in N.T. See [presbuteras] in 1Ti 5:2. Reverent [hieroprepeis]. Old
   word [heiros, prepei]. Only here in N.T. Same idea in 1Ti 2:10. Like
   people engaged in sacred duties (Lock). In demeanour [en katastemati].
   Late and rare word (inscriptions) from [kathistemi], deportment, only
   here in N.T. Not slanderers [me diabolous]. See 1Ti 3:11; 2Ti 3:3. Nor
   enslaved to much wine [mede oinOi pollOi dedoulOmenas]. Perfect passive
   participle of [douloO], with dative case [oinOi]. See 1Ti 3:8. "It is
   proved by experience that the reclamation of a woman drunkard is almost
   impossible" (White). But God can do the "impossible." Teachers of that
   which is good [kalodidaskalous]. Compound word found here alone, bona
   docentes (teaching good and beautiful things). A sorely needed mission.

   2:4 That they may train [hina sOphronizOsin]. Purpose clause, [hina]
   and present active subjunctive of [sOphronizO], old verb (from
   [sOphrOn], sound in mind, [saos, phren], as in this verse), to make
   sane, to restore to one's senses, to discipline, only here in N.T. To
   love their husbands [philandrous einai]. Predicate accusative with
   [einai] of old adjective [philandros] [philos, aner], fond of one's
   husband), only here in N.T. [Aner] means man, of course, as well as
   husband, but only husband here, not "fond of men" (other men than their
   own). To love their children [philoteknous]. Another old compound, here
   only in N.T. This exhortation is still needed where some married women
   prefer poodle-dogs to children.

   2:5 Workers at home [oikourgous]. So the oldest MSS. (from [oikos,
   ergou] instead of [oikourous], keepers at home (from [koiso, ouros],
   keeper). Rare word, found in Soranus, a medical writer, Field says. Cf.
   1Ti 5:13. "Keepers at home" are usually "workers at home." Kind
   [agathas]. See Ro 5:7. See Col 3:18; Eph 5:22 for the same use of
   [hupotassomai], to be in subjection. Note [idiois] (their own). See 1Ti
   6:1 for the same negative purpose clause [hina me blasphemetai].

   2:6 The younger men [tous neOterous]. Just one item, besides "likewise"
   [hosautOs] as in 3; 1Ti 2, 9), "to be soberminded" [sOphronein], old
   verb as in Rom 12:3). It is possible to take "in all things" [peri
   panta] with [sOphronein], though the editors take it with verse 7.

   2:7 Shewing thyself [seauton parechomenos]. Present middle (redundant
   middle) participle of [parechO] with the reflexive pronoun [seauton] as
   if the active voice [parechOn]. The Koine shows an increasing number of
   such constructions (Robertson, Grammar, p. 811). See active in 1Ti 1:4.
   An ensample [tupon]. For this word see 2Th 3:9; Php 3:17. Uncorruptness
   [aphthorian]. Only example, from late adjective [aphthoros] [a]
   privative and [phtheirO].

   2:8 Sound [hugie], Attic usually [hugia] in accusative singular),
   elsewhere in Pastorals participle [hugianOn] (verse 1). That cannot be
   condemned [akatagnOston]. Only N.T. example (verbal, [a] privative and
   [katagnOstos] and in IV Macc. 4:47. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 200)
   quotes it from an inscription and the adverb from a papyrus. He that is
   of the contrary part [ho ex enantias]. "The one on the opposite side"
   (your opponent). Cf. verse 9; 1Ti 5:14. May be ashamed [hina entrapei].
   Final clause with [hina] and second aorist passive subjunctive of
   [entrepO], to turn, in middle and passive to turn one on himself and so
   be ashamed (to blush) as in 2Th 3:14; 1Co 4:14. This sense in the
   papyri. Evil [phaulon]. Old word, easy (easy morals), worthless; bad,
   as in 2Co 5:10.

   2:9 Servants [doulous]. "Slaves." Supply "exhort" [parakalei]. See 1Ti
   6:1 for "masters" [despotais]. Well-pleasing [euarestous]. See on 2Co
   5:9. Not gainsaying [me antilegontas]. "Not answer back." See Ro 10:21.

   2:10 Not purloining [me nosphizomenous]. Present middle participle of
   [nosphizO], old verb (from [nosphi], apart), in middle to set apart for
   oneself, to embezzle, in N.T. only here and Ac 5:2f. Fidelity [pistin].
   See Ga 5:22; 1Ti 5:12 for [pistis] in the sense of faithfulness.
   Nowhere else in the N.T. do we have [agathe] with [pistis] as here, but
   an Oxyr. papyrus (iii. 494, 9) has this very phrase [pasan pistin
   endeiknumenei]. Westcott and Hort put [agapen] in the margin. See 3:2.
   That they may adorn [hina kosmOsin]. Final clause with [hina] and
   present active subjunctive. See 1Ti 2:9 for [kosmeO]. Paul shows slaves
   how they may "adorn" the teaching of God.

   2:11 Hath appeared [epephane]. "Did appear," the first Epiphany (the
   Incarnation). Second aorist passive indicative of [epiphainO], old
   verb, in N.T. here, 3:4; Lu 1:79; Ac 27:20. Bringing salvation
   [sOterios]. Old adjective from [sOter] (Saviour), here alone in N.T.
   except [to sOterion] (salvation, "the saving act") in Lu 2:30; 3:6; Eph
   6:17. Instructing [paideuousa]. See 1Ti 1:20. Ungodliness [asebeian].
   See Ro 1:18. Worldly lusts [tas kosmikas epithumias]. Aristotle and
   Plutarch use [kosmikos] (from [kosmos] about the universe as in Heb 9:1
   about the earthly. Here it has alone in N.T. the sense of evil "in this
   present age" as with [kosmos] in 1Jo 2:16. The three adverbs set off
   the opposite (soberly [sOphronOs], righteously [dikaiOs], godly
   [eusebOs].

   2:13 Looking for [prosdechomenoi]. Present middle participle of
   [prosdechomai], old verb, the one used of Simeon (Lu 2:25) and others
   (Lu 2:38) who were looking for the Messiah. The blessed hope and
   appearing of the glory [ten makarian elpida kai epiphaneian tes doxes].
   The word [epiphaneia] (used by the Greeks of the appearance of the
   gods, from [epiphanes, epiphainO] occurs in 2Ti 1:10 of the Incarnation
   of Christ, the first Epiphany (like the verb [epephane], Tit 2:11), but
   here of the second Epiphany of Christ or the second coming as in 1Ti
   6:14; 2Ti 4:1, 8. In 2Th 2:8 both [epiphaneia] and [parousia] (the
   usual word) occur together of the second coming. Of our great God and
   Saviour Jesus Christ [tou megalou theou kai sOteros Iesou Christou].
   This is the necessary meaning of the one article with [theou] and
   [sOteros] just as in 2Pe 1:1, 11. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 786.
   Westcott and Hort read [Christou Iesou].

   2:14 Who gave himself for us [hos edOken heauton huper hemOn]. Paul's
   great doctrine (Ga 1:4; 2:20; 1Ti 2:6). That he might redeem us [hina
   lutrOsetai]. Final clause, [hina] and the aorist middle subjunctive of
   [lutroO], old verb from [lutron] (ransom), in N.T. only here, Lu 24:21;
   1Pe 1:18. Purify to himself [katharisei heautOi]. Final clause with
   first aorist active subjunctive of [katharizO], for which verb see Eph
   5:26. Lawlessness [anomias]. See 2Th 2:3. A people for his own
   possession [laon periousion]. A late word (from [perieimi], to be over
   and above, in papyri as well as [periousia], only in LXX and here,
   apparently made by the LXX, one's possession, and so God's chosen
   people. See 1Pe 2:9 [laos eis peripoiesin]. Zealous of good works
   [zelOten kalOn ergOn]. "A zealot for good works." Substantive for which
   see 1Co 14:12; Ga 1:14. Objective genitive [ergOn].

   2:15 With all authority [meta pases epitages]. See 1Co 7:6; 2Co 8:8.
   Assertion of authority is sometimes necessary. Let no man despise thee
   [medeis sou periphroneitO]. Present active imperative in prohibition of
   [periphroneO], old verb, only here in N.T., to think around (on all
   sides). Literally, "let no man think around thee" (and so despise
   thee). In 1Ti 4:12 it is [kataphroneitO] (think down on), a stronger
   word of scorn, but this one implies the possibility of one making
   mental circles around one and so "out-thinking" him. The best way for
   the modern minister to command respect for his "authority" is to do
   thinking that will deserve it.

   3:1 To be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient
   [archais exousiais hupotassesthai peitharchein]. Remarkable double
