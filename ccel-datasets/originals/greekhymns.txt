SOME PRESS NOTICES

   "This work at its best reaches the level of absolute excellence, and
   the book is entitled to a warm and grateful welcome."--Record.

   "Mr Brownlie has taste and a poetic gift, and his verses are easy and
   natural, rarely, if ever, betraying the fact that they are the work of
   a translator."--Church Times.

   "This dainty volume will certainly enhance his reputation."--Glasgow
   Herald.

   "It brings into dignified Church-English some sixty simple and powerful
   hymns. The book should prove welcome to men generally interested in
   hymnody, and particularly to those who are ignorant of the richness of
   the Greek liturgy."--Scotsman.

   "Mr Brownlie has the knack of hymn-writing, and the translations from
   the Greek which he has published in this book will be a welcome
   addition to English hymnology."--Athenaeum.

   "Mr Brownlie has done eminent service as a hymnologist and translator
   of hymns. These translations are in smooth and flowing English verse,
   and the hymns are interesting both on their intrinsic merits and as
   representing the religious thought and emotion of an important section
   of the Church."--Aberdeen Free Press.

PREFATORY NOTE

   After ten years this, the first of five series of hymns of the Greek
   Church, is issued in cheap form in the hope that those who regard the
   unity of Christian praise, and wish to realise it, and who seek its
   enrichment from the Church of the Apostles, may be induced to give the
   subject that consideration which it deserves, and which has been too
   long neglected.

   The past ten years have seen much activity in the department of Church
   hymnody,--all sections of the Church have had their hymnals under
   revision with varied results; but in this particular we are bound to
   feel satisfaction that the praise literature of the Early and Mediaeval
   Church has been more fully drawn upon than at any former period, and
   the Greek Church no longer stands in the background. From this volume
   alone no fewer than ten renderings have been utilised by hymnal
   compilers, and they make together twenty appearances. This fact is
   mentioned to indicate an appreciation of Greek hymnody which, it is
   hoped, may grow.

INTRODUCTION

   I. Thirty-eight years ago, Dr. John Mason Neale published his [55]Hymns
   of the Eastern Church, and for the first time English readers were
   introduced to the priceless gems of Greek hymnody. At the close of his
   preface he throws out a challenge which, as far as the present writer
   is aware, has not yet been taken up. He says: And while fully sensible
   of their imperfections, I may yet, by way of excuse rather than of
   boast, say, almost in Bishop Hall's words--


   "I first adventure: follow me who list,

   And be the second Eastern Melodist."'

   It would be presumptuous to believe that the translations which follow
   are in any particular a worthy answer to that challenge; but the
   translator can honestly say that they are a very earnest attempt to
   acquaint English readers still further with the valuable praise
   literature which lies buried in the service-books of the Greek Church,
   and they constitute the first real attempt in that direction since Dr.
   Neale issued his collection in 1862.

   II. The renderings contained in this volume are the product of many
   happy hours during the past five years. No method was adopted in the
   work. As the translator waded through the closely printed pages of the
   Greek offices, what appeared at first sight to be lines worthy of
   translation were taken up and examined, sometimes to be cast aside
   again because of some unremovable blemish, at other times to be moulded
   to the form which they now bear. Of the forty-seven pieces, thirty-five
   appear for the first time in English verse.

   For the original, the translator has gone to the service-books, and for
   the most part has confined himself to the hymns which are to be found
   in the Triodion, containing the Lenten services; and in the
   Pentecostarion, in which are found the hymns for the services of Easter
   and Pentecost. A few specimens are also given from other offices,
   particularly that for Christmas.

   Renderings from the work of the earlier Greek hymn-writers are added at
   the end of this volume; but, unlike the hymns of the Church
   service-books, these hymns originally are in the classical measures,
   and illustrate the work of the best Christian poets, who in some cases
   wrote extensively.

   III. It is a very remarkable fact, and certainly not to our credit,
   that, with the exception of a very few who have made the study a
   specialty, our educated men show a most unaccountable ignorance of the
   most attractive and valuable material for praise and prayer contained
   in the Greek Church service-books. We have learning more than enough,
   and zeal enough for the pursuit of study in other departments, but this
   unworked field lies fallow, and no one thinks it worth his while to
   cultivate it. That the study will reward the student, although not in a
   material sense--for the meaningless prejudice of the great mass of our
   people for what is local and against the thought of the stranger, no
   matter how beautiful it may be, is still to be reckoned with--yet in
   the highest sense as conferring upon him a new delight, there can be no
   doubt; for, after the necessary expenditure of patient application, and
   the passing of the initiatory stages which in every department of study
   are somewhat trying, the attraction will begin, and the subject become
   positively fascinating. To any one having the lyrical gift and the
   necessary qualifications for the study of Greek, those service-books
   might prove a mine of treasure inexhaustible. In the seventeen quarto
   volumes which contain the Greek Church offices, there must be material
   of one kind or another for many thousands of hymns; yet, when hymnal
   compilers ask for hymns from the Greek for their collections, they are
   not to be had, save in the few renderings made by Dr. Neale. In the
   most recently compiled collection for church use--The Church
   Hymnary--only five pieces from the Greek find a place. What a humbling
   confession! They are the best available from the very small number of
   translations in our possession, which, perhaps, does not exceed one
   hundred and fifty pieces in all.

   We have not treated the Latin Church after that fashion. There is not a
   hymn of real merit in the Latin which has not been translated, and in
   not a few cases oftener than once; with the result that the gems of
   Latin hymnody are the valued possession of the Church in all
   English-speaking lands.

   IV. One does not proceed far before making some discoveries which may
   account, to a certain extent, for the neglect of Greek hymnody by men
   who are best qualified to pursue the study of it. The writers are not
   poets, in the true sense, and their language is not Greek as we have
   known it.

   (1) None of the hymn-writers in the service-books or out of them is a
   poet of more than ordinary merit; although, when John of Damascus
   forgets his adversaries, and dispenses with his rhythmical
   peculiarities and gives forth the utterance of his deep emotional
   nature, he proves himself to be worthy of the title--the greatest of
   Greek Christian poets.

   (2) The Greek language lived long and died slowly, and the Christian
   hymn-writers wrote in its decadence. It was then an instrument that has
   lost its fineness, and keenness, and polish--worn out and
   ineffective,--not the language of the men whose thoughts still charm
   the world, and who by its deft use gained for themselves and for their
   work immortality. It has little of the subtilty of expression, the
   variety of cadence, or the intellectual possibility, of the Greek of
   Homer, Plato, and Aristophanes. It is a language, moreover, crippled by
   the introduction of ecclesiastical and theological terms and phrases,
   which stubbornly refuse to lend themselves to classical rhythm. Such a
   language cannot be expected to have attraction for men to whom the
   ancient poets are a delight.

   (3) The hymns of the Greek Church are all in rhythmical
   prose--strangely Oriental in appearance--with the exception of those by
   John of Damascus, which are in iambics; and difficulties confront one
   on every page. What lines will reward the work of rendering? Prayer,
   Gospel, psalm, hymn, and exhortation follow each other, and are
   sometimes strangely interlaced. Where does one begin and another end?
   Then, there is meaningless repetition which must be passed over, and
   expressions demanding modification. The symbolism is extravagant, and
   sometimes a single hymn is crowded with figures the most grotesque. The
   Mariolatry is excessive, and the hagiolatry offensive. Sifting and
   pruning are needed before a cento can be formed which would commend
   itself to modern taste.

   But when all that is said, there remains much that is both beautiful
   and attractive. Some of the hymns and fragments are most
   chaste,--beautiful and tender in their simple expression of Gospel
   truths, which are so attractive to all true hearts, no matter by what
   creed dominated.

   (4) The remarkable simplicity characterising those hymns constitutes,
   strangely it may seem, no small difficulty for the translator. The mere
   rendering of them into English prose is a comparatively easy task, and
   can be of no value to any one but the specialist, but to take the
   unmeasured lines and cut them to form stanzas, and in the process
   sacrifice nothing of their spirit to the exigencies of rhyme and
   rhythm, is a task by no means easy. But such drawbacks and difficulties
   are not insurmountable; and with the growing interest in hymnology
   which characterises our time, it will be strange if, in the years to
   come, the Greek service-books are not made to yield their tribute to
   the praise of the Christian Church in the West.

   V. One prime characteristic of Greek hymnody should be referred to.
   Unlike the English hymn, which is intensely subjective--in some cases
   unhealthily so--the Greek hymn is in most cases objective. God in the
   glory of His majesty, and clothed with His attributes, is held up to
   the worship and adoration of His people. Christ, in His Person and
   Work, is set before the mind in a most realistic manner. His birth and
   its accompaniments; His life; the words He spoke, and the work He did;
   His Passion, in all the agony of its detail; the denial of Peter; the
   remorse of Judas; the Crucifixion; the darkness, the terror, the opened
   graves; the penitent thief; the loud cry, the death--all are depicted
   in plain, unmistakable language. So we have in the hymns of the Greek
   service-books a pictorial representation of the history of Redemption,
   which by engaging the mind appeals ultimately to the heart and its
   emotions. Our self-regarding praise is perhaps inevitable, as being the
   product of the meditative spirit which has its birth, and lives in the
   land of the twilight; but the advantages of the objectiveness of Greek
   hymnody are so patent, that its cultivation might be fostered by our
   hymn-writers, with advantage to the devotional feeling of our people
   and to the worship of the Church.

   VI. The hymns as they appear in the original are distinguished by a
   variety of terms, the meaning in certain cases being extremely vague,
   and in others to be derived from the subject of the hymn, or from its
   form, or the time, place, or manner in which it is sung. As we have no
   corresponding terms in our language, it is necessary to retain the
   original.

   The following collection contains specimens of some of these. They
   are:--

   The Canon (kanon). This is the most elaborate form into which the
   praise of the Greek Church is cast. A canon consists, nominally, of
   nine odes or hymns, but the second ode is always omitted on account of
   the denunciations of God against Israel which it contains. The canons
   of the Great Fast are made up of those rejected odes.

   Hirmos (heirmos) is the first stanza of each ode. It may or may not
   have a connection with the stanzas following, but its function is to
   give them their rhythmical model.

   Troparion (troparion). The Troparia are the stanzas which follow the
   Hirmos, and the term is doubtless derived from the verb trepo, to turn.
   The Troparia turn to the strophes of the Hirmos, as to a model.

   Contakion (kontakion) is a term of uncertain origin. Contakia occur
   after the sixth ode of a canon. They are short hymns, and the term may
   be derived from the Latin Canticum.

   Stichera (stichera) designates a series of verses which are often taken
   from the Psalter.

   Idiomelon (idiomelon). Unlike Troparia, which follow the model set by
   the Hirmos, Idiomela follow no model.

   Stichera Idiomela are a collection of irregular verses.

   Antiphon (antiphonon) is, as is well known, a hymn sung alternately by
   the choir, which is divided for that purpose into two parts.

   Other terms are found over hymns in the Greek service-books, but there
   is no need to refer to them here, as no specimens of the particular
   hymns find a place in this collection.

   To-day the groans of Hades rise,--

   My power is gone from me;

   The Shepherd died upon the Cross,

   And Adam's sons are free;

   The bars are taken from the tomb,

   Death can no more appal;

   For He who gave Himself to death,

   By death hath rescued all.'

   Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!

   When Lazarus rose at Christ's command,

   The children cried Hosanna then,

   When seated with Thy chosen band

   Thou didst to Thy disciples say

   That one, O Christ, would Thee betray,

   But Judas would not understand.


   The sop revealed the traitor's hand,

   In answer to the question made;

   They saw by whom Thou wert betrayed,

   But Judas would not understand.


   The Jews, O Christ, Thy life demand,

   'Twas purchased for a price like this--

   For silver pieces and a kiss,

   But Judas would not understand.


   Thou, with Thine own unstainèd hand,

   Didst wash the feet, and humbly teach

   That such a task becometh each,

   But Judas would not understand.

  CANON FOR EASTER DAY
  BY
  ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS

    ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS

   John of Damascus is by far the most prominent and most poetical of all
   the Greek Christian poets. He dwelt for many years in his native city
   of Damascus, a valiant champion of orthodoxy against all comers. His
   influence on Greek hymnody was immense, and he is held in high esteem
   by the Greek Church for his work in that department, and as a
   theologian. The Octoechos, which contains the Ferial Office, was, it is
   said, arranged by John of Damascus. There his Canons are found, which
   are perhaps his greatest work in hymnody. John retired eventually to
   the monastery of Mar Saba, where he spent a life of devotion, and sang
   those Christian hymns which have cheered and inspired so many
   generations of Christians in the East. There he penned the Golden
   Canon' for Easter Day, which breathes the glorious hopes of the
   Resurrection.

  HYMNS
  FROM
  THE EARLY GREEK POETS
  NOT FOUND IN THE SERVICE-BOOKS OF THE GREEK CHURCH
     __________________________________________________________________

    ST. METHODIUS

   Methodius, a prominent name in Ecclesiastical history, and a Father of
   the Church, was born about the middle of the third century. He was
   first of all Bishop of Olympus in Lycia, and, according to Jerome,
   became ultimately Bishop of Tyre. He combated certain views of Origen,
   but would seem to have been influenced not a little by the teaching of
   that great theologian.

   In his principal work, The Banquet of the Ten Virgins, the hymn is
   found from which the following is a cento. It contains twenty-four
   strophes, each beginning with a letter of the Greek alphabet in
   alphabetical order, and ending with the same refrain.

   Methodius is said to have suffered martyrdom under Diocletian about 311
   A.D.

   I

   Behold the Bridegroom! Hark the cry,

   The dead, awaking, rends the sky!

   Go, virgins, He is near,

   Your lamps all burning clear;

   He enters where the rising light

   Asunder bursts the gates of night.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   II

   The smiles of earth that turn to tears,

   Its empty joys and foolish fears

   I leave, for Thou dost call--

   Thou art my Life, my All;

   I would Thy beauty ever see,

   Then let me, Blessed, cling to Thee.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   III

   For Thee I leave the world behind--

   Thou art my Bliss, O Bridegroom kind;

   My beauty's not mine own--

   'Tis Thine, O Christ, alone;

   Thy bridal-chamber I would see,

   In perfect happiness to be.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   IV

   O God, exalted on Thy throne,

   Who dwell'st in purity unknown,

   Lo, now we humbly wait,

   Throw wide the Heavenly gate,

   And with the Bridegroom, of Thy grace,

   Give us at Thy right hand a place.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

  ST. GREGORY

    ST. GREGORY

   Gregory of Nazianzus, son of Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus, and
   life-long friend of Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, was born at Nazianzus,
   325 A.D. He took up the priestly office at the earnest request of his
   father, and for some time was helpful to the aged bishop.

   The times in which Gregory lived were trying times. The orthodox
   Christians clung to the creed of Nicea, and their champions did valiant
   battle with the Arians. As an advocate and exponent of evangelical
   truth, Gregory was summoned to Constantinople in 379, and as bishop of
   that See adorned the high position with gifts and graces as brilliant
   as they were rare. But he was not the man for such a position at such a
   time. Hilary, the Hammer of the Arians,' could keep the heretics at
   bay, and do in the Latin Church what Gregory could not do in the Greek
   Church--maintain his position and his cause against all comers. For one
   thing, the retiring disposition of Gregory inclined him to shrink from
   the din of conflict, and his high ideals weakened his hopefulness. The
   result was that he abandoned his position and retired to Nazianzus in
   381. Deprived by death of his life-long friend, and of his brother
   Caesarius, to whom he was bound by more than brotherly love, he retired
   from the world and penned those poems, some of which are among the
   treasures of the Church Catholic. He died in 390.

   The hymns of Gregory are found in the second volume of the Benedictine
   Edition of his works which was published in Paris in 1842. A selection
   can be seen in Daniel's Thesaurus, and in the Anthologica Graeca,
   Carminum Christianorum.

   I

   O Light that knew no dawn,

   That shines to endless day,

   All things in earth and heaven

   Are lustred by Thy ray;

   No eye can to Thy throne ascend,

   Nor mind Thy brightness comprehend.


   II

   Thy grace, O Father, give,

   That I may serve in fear;

   Above all boons, I pray,

   Grant me Thy voice to hear;

   From sin Thy child in mercy free,

   And let me dwell in light with Thee.


   III

   That, cleansed from filthy stain,

   I may meet homage give,

   And, pure in heart, behold

   And serve Thee while I live;

   Clean hands in holy worship raise,

   And Thee, O Christ my Saviour, praise.


   IV

   In supplication meek

   To Thee I bend the knee;

   O Christ, when Thou shalt come,

   In love remember me,

   And in Thy kingdom, by Thy grace,

   Grant me a humble servant's place.


   V

   Thy grace, O Father, give,

   I humbly Thee implore;

   And let Thy mercy bless

   Thy servant more and more.

   All grace and glory be to Thee

   From age to age eternally.

   For from death this glorious morning

   Thou hast risen triumphantly.

   Death is slain; O power surprising!

   Cam'st that he new born might be;

   Thou upon the cross in weakness

   Diedst that he might die with Thee.


   IV

   Thou didst rise--we hail Thee, Jesus!

   And we leave the tomb with Thee.

   Victor, by the power that frees us,

   Where Thou art, there we would be.

   Choirs angelic lead the strain,

   And my opened lips in singing

   O Thou, my Christ, to Thee,

   Thou Word of God, Eternal Light,

   All grateful praises be.

   Third beam of peerless light,

   And in Thyself one glorious orb

   Thy word and wisdom Thou

   To lighten man hast given,

   That he the splendour might reflect

   And daily rise, till he himself

   Is altogether light.

A MORNING HYMN

   I

   The morning breaks, I place my hand in Thine,

   My God, 'tis Thine to lead, to follow mine;

   No word deceitful shall I speak the while,

   Nor shall I stain my hand with action vile.


   II

   Thine be the day with worthy labour filled,

   Strong would I stand to do the duty willed;

   Nor swayed by restless passion let me be,

   That I may give the offering pure to Thee;


   III

   Else were I 'shamed when hoary age I see,

   Shamed were this board that bears Thy gifts to me:

   Mine is the impulse; O my Christ, I pray,

   Be Thou Thyself to me the Blessed Way!

   I

   O Word of Truth! in devious paths

   My wayward feet have trod,

   I have not kept the day serene

   I gave at morn to God.


   II

   And now 'tis night, and night within,

   O God, the light hath fled!

   I have not kept the vow I made

   When morn its glories shed.


   III

   For clouds of gloom from nether world

   Obscured my upward way;

   O Christ the Light, Thy light bestow

   And turn my night to day!

  SYNESIUS

    SYNESIUS

   Synesius was born about 375. In more particulars than one he was an
   outstanding man. His pedigree is said to have extended through
   seventeen centuries, and to have included the names of the most
   illustrious. Not only was he of noble lineage, he was a man also of
   high character and brilliant attainments. He was versed in the
   Neoplatonic philosophy, and his Christianity has been called in
   question by no less an authority than Mosheim; but how any one can read
   his odes and doubt the reality of his Christian faith, even in the full
   sense of the term, as believing in the Divinity of Christ and in His
   Resurrection, is hard to understand. He certainly was a good man, and
   knew Christ and loved Him. His writings prove that; and in 410 A.D.,
   though reluctantly, he became Bishop of Ptolemais. Very little of his
   poetry has come down to us, but that little is of the highest order. He
   died 430 A.D.

   I

   When darkness falls and night is here,

   My hymns of praise in silence rise--

   This knows the moon, whose silver sphere

   Shines in the star-bespangled skies.


   II

   When morning breaks, and glorious day

   Shines in the dawn and noontide fair--

   This knows the sun--a grateful lay

   Springs from my heart in fervent prayer.


   III

   When fails the light at sunset gray,

   And twilight listens for my song--

   This know the stars--in bright array

   My praises mingle with their throng.

   Direct her gaze to where Thou art,

   And in Thy splendour find, O Christ,

   The strength of life Thou canst impart.


   II

   And freed from sin's depressing load,

   May I pursue the path divine,

   And rise above the cares of earth

   Until my life is merged in Thine.


   III

   Unsullied life Thy servant grant

   Who tunes his harp to sound Thy praise,

   And still my life shall hymn Thy love,

   And glory to the Father raise.


   IV

   And when I rest in glory bright,

   The burden of my labour past,

   In hymns I'll praise Thee more and more

   While the eternal ages last.

   Framer of the world, we hail Thee!

   Thou didst mould the stars of night;

   Earth to life Thou dost awaken,

   When the sun illumes the skies,

   And the dark of night relaxes

   When Thou bidst the moon arise.

   At Thy word the harvest ripens,

   Flocks and herds their pasture find;

   Earth gives bread to feed the hungry,

   For the hand of God is kind.


   V

   May my soul, her want perceiving,

   Turn her gaze to where Thou art,

   And in all Thy fulness find Thee

   Food to satisfy the heart.
