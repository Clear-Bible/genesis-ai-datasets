                                 Introduction.

   We feel in placing this work before the public we should accompany it
   with some words of explanation. It is unique, presenting a combination
   of features never before collected in one work. Harmonies and Fourfold
   Gospels are plentiful, and we have examined a large number of them,
   beginning with the pioneer work of Tatian. We have sought to utilize
   all the good features employed by others, and to introduce several new
   and helpful inventions of our own.
     __________________________________________________________________

Preserving the Text.

   Believing fully and firmly that the Scriptures are the word of God, we
   have sought to preserve all that is contained in them, and have, in
   combining them, regarded it as wrong to take liberties with them. To
   carry out this reverential idea we have introduced the variant readings
   of each Gospel, enclosing them in braces, so that they will not confuse
   the reader. By doing this we have, according to our count, except in
   the cases of a few redundant pronouns, only omitted five words of the
   text, which, if we remember correctly, are three "ands," and "but" and
   one "with." To accomplish this almost absolute conservation of the word
   of the text without involving the reader in hopeless confusion, has
   been no easy task, especially in cases where all four Gospels are
   combined in a single section.
     __________________________________________________________________

To Distinguish the Gospels.

   Then, to enable the reader to discriminate as he reads, we have
   indicated the particular Gospel from which our word or words are taken,
   by the several superior letters; namely: a, b, c, and d, which stand
   respectively for the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. We
   have followed the punctuation of each Gospel as we have used its words,
   also giving the punctuation mark which followed the last word taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

Combination Illustrated.

   To illustrate our method of combination, let us take Section 36, which
   is a fitting together of the following passages, namely:

     9 And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew,
     sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And
     he arose, and followed him.--Matt. ix. 9.

     13 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
     resorted unto him, and he taught them. 14 And as he passed by, he
     saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at the place of toll, and he
     saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.--Mark ii.
     13, 14.

     27 And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican named
     Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me. 28
     And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.--Luke v. 27, 28.

   Which three passages are combined as follows:

     ^c 27 And after these things he went forth, again by the sea side;
     and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 14 And
     as he ^a Jesus passed by from thence, he saw ^c and beheld ^a a man,
     ^c a publican, named { ^a called} Matthew, ^c Levi, ^b the son of
     Alphæus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith { ^c said} unto
     him, Follow me. 28 And he forsook all, ^b and he arose { ^c rose up}
     and followed him.

   Now, in this passage we have retained the redundant pronoun "he" in the
   phrase he Jesus. Where Luke has the phrase named Matthew, Matthew has
   the variant reading called Matthew. Where Mark says saith, Luke gives
   the variant said, and where Mark says arose, Luke says rose up. By
   variant reading we mean one which can not be combined with the other
   texts so that the combined text will read smoothly.
     __________________________________________________________________

Lesser and Fuller Forms.

   Moreover, we have endeavoured to use the fullest form, including the
   words of those Gospels which have the lesser forms of sentences, except
   where the sentence ends in a period, in which case have given the least
   form, so that the larger form of the other Gospels might be made
   apparent; as, for instance, this sentence, taken from Matt. xii. 47;
   Mark iii. 32; Luke viii. 20: ^c 20 And it was told him, ^a Behold, thy
   mother and thy brethren bseek for thee. ^c stand without desiring to
   see thee. ^a seeking to speak to thee. Here Mark has the short form,
   Luke a longer form, and Matthew a trifle the longest form; all of which
   is indicated by the order in which each part is placed, and the several
   periods which close the thought of each evangelist.

   But in compiling the work we have bound ourselves by no inflexible
   rule; for to do so would, in many instances, make the reading very
   complex, whereas our first study has been to make the work simple, and
   to avoid confusing the mind of the reader
     __________________________________________________________________

Sections and Subdivisions.

   We have divided the work into sections for analytical purposes, and in
   order to aid in the work of indexing and giving cross references. We
   have arranged the sections in what we believe to be the best
   chronological order, but have not attempted to justify our chronology,
   because space would not permit. We have also given the time and place
   of each section, where these things could be ascertained with any
   degree of accuracy. In this matter, however, we are liable to
   disappoint many of our readers, because we have been conservative. The
   dates and places given in similar works are too often more arbitrary
   assumptions: there being so little ground of reason back of them that
   they do not even justify one in calling them speculative. Unless we
   have had some reason for fixing a date or assigning a locality, we have
   refrained from doing either, though we have found them freely and
   positively asserted in such places in similar works.
     __________________________________________________________________

Four Points of Economy.

   By the use of pronounced black letter type we enable to reader to
   follow the Scripture text, omitting the comments if he chooses. But by
   thus combining the four Gospels and interjecting the comment into the
   text, we have produced the most labor-saving, time-saving, condensed
   commentary ever placed before the people. Those familiar with
   commentaries can best realize what this means. Incidents told in one
   Gospel are repeated in other Gospels, and when a commentator has given
   his annotations on Matthew, and comes to the same facts recorded in
   Mark, or Luke, or John, he wastes his space by printing the duplicate
   text, and he wastes his reader's time by referring him to his comments
   in the volume on Matthew. by combining the Gospels for commentary
   purposes we have saved this space and time.

   Again, in most commentaries a fifth or sixth of the space is taken up
   in drawing distinctions between the texts of the four Gospels, while in
   this work these distinctions are placed before the reader's eye, where
   he can see them for himself at a glance. Moreover, in other
   commentaries, which give the text, another sixth or seventh of the work
   is taken up in reprinting in the notes that portion of the text
   concerning which the commentator wishes to speak. Our interjected
   method avoids all this needless repetition, and makes it possible for
   us to present the comment with the least preliminary verbiage or
   introductory setting. Time is also saved because the reader does not
   have to look back and forth from the text at the top of the comment at
   the bottom of the page. Again, other commentaries lose a large amount
   of space by using the King James text. Those which preceded the
   revision waste space correcting the translation and modernizing its
   English: those published since the revision suffer a similar waste by
   drawing endless comparisons between the two texts. By choosing the
   American revision as the basis for our work, we have a text which needs
   but little explanation or apology, and we are thereby enabled to employ
   the reader's time and strength to his best advantage.
     __________________________________________________________________

Care in Preparing this Work.

   In preparing this work there has been no sparing of time, labor, or
   expense. While we have carefully avoided all conceits, quibblings, and
   useless refinements, and have studied to present only that which was
   useful, helpful, and practical, we have endeavored to put into the work
   the results of careful investigation and studious research. Besides
   theological treatises and works of reference, a full line of
   commentaries has been used. In some few cases, where the sections have
   been simple, from thirty to fifty commentaries have been consulted; but
   in the vast majority of sections between eighty and one hundred
   commentaries have been searched and sifted. To these painstaking labors
   of the junior editor, there has been added the results of the wider
   researches of the senior editor, effected during a half century of
   continuous Bible study and teaching. We have not aimed to produce a
   commentary for the textual critic, the theologian, or the professor;
   but a plain and simple work for all reader's of God's word.
     __________________________________________________________________

An Object in View.

   Moreover, having in view the preparation of a new series of
   Sunday-school lessons, we have prepared this work as a basis of such
   series. As the present International Series handles mere scraps of the
   Bible, it is practicable to print the text in quarterlies; but with a
   series which deals with the whole Bible, larger portions must be
   assigned for the lessons, and such printing of the text in the
   quarterlies becomes impossible. In such a series the pupil must be
   referred to the Bible itself, and in order that he may have a Bible
   with comments, we have prepared the present work, intending to follow
   it with similar volumes until the entire Bible is given to the public
   in this annotated form, if God permit.

Luke's Preface and Dedication.

^C Luke I. 1-4. [1]

   ^c 1 Forasmuch as many [of whom we know nothing and have even no
   tradition] have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those
   matters which have been fulfilled [completed, or accomplished according
   to the divine will] among us, 2 even as they delivered them unto us,
   which from the beginning were eyewitnesses [the apostles were
   necessarily such and there were some few others--Acts i. 21-23] and
   ministers of the word [the apostles were ministers, and not
   ecclesiastical dignitaries] , 3; it seemed good to me also, having
   traced the course of all things accurately from the first [and being
   therefore thoroughly fitted to write the gospel], to write unto thee in
   order [not in chronological, but in topical order], most excellent
   Theophilus [Luke also dedicated the Book of Acts to this man. Nothing
   is known of Theophilus, but he is supposed to have been a Greek of high
   official rank]; 4 that thou mightest know the certainty [might have a
   fixed written record, and not trust to a floating, variable tradition
   or a treacherous memory] concerning the things [the gospel facts]
   wherein thou wast instructed.

John's Introduction.

^D John I. 1-18.

   ^d 1 In the beginning was the Word [a title for Jesus peculiar to the
   apostle John], and the Word was with God [not going before nor coming
   after God, but with Him at the beginning], and the Word was God. [Not
   more, not less.] 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things
   were made through him [the New Testament often speaks of Christ as the
   Creator--see ver. 10; I. Cor. viii. 6; Col. i. 13, 17; Heb. i. 2]; and
   without him was not anything made that hath been made. [This shows that
   Jesus himself is not a creature.] 4 In his was life [As in the Father
   (chap. v. 26 ). As this life animates the living, so can it reanimate
   the dead--John xi. 25]; and the life was the light of men. [The life of
   Jesus is the light of men, because from that life we get our intellect
   and understanding, and because that life formed and governs the
   creation around us by which we become enlightened as to the existence
   and power of God--Rom. i. 18-21; Acts xiv. 16, 17.] 5 And the light
   shineth in the darkness [an ignorant, benighted world]; and the
   darkness apprehended it not. [Did not receive or admit it. Jesus, the
   Light of the world, was despised and rejected by men.] 6 There was a
   man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came for witness,
   that he might bear witness of the light. [that he might tell men that
   Jesus was the Messiah], that all [who heard his testimony] might
   believe [in Jesus] through him. 8 He was not the light ["He was the
   lamp that burneth and shineth" ( chap. v. 35); but not the Sun of
   righteousness-- Mal. iv. 2], but came that he might bear witness of the
   light. 9 There was the true light [as opposed to the imperfect,
   incomplete, and transitory lights], even the light which lighteth every
   man [all men are enlightened in some degree and enlightened of Christ:
   some by nature, some by conscience, and some by Bible revelation],
   coming into the world. 10 He was in the world. [invisibly present,
   renewing and sustaining his creation], and the world was made through
   him, and the world knew him not. [Though it might and should have known
   him--Rom. i. 18-21; Acts xiv. 16, 17.] 11 He came [visibly in the
   flesh] unto his own [his own land or possessions--Hos. ix. 3; Jer. ii.
   7; Zech. ii. 12], and they that were his own [the children of
   Israel--Ex. xix. 5; Deut. vii. 6; xiv. 2] received him not. 12 But as
   many as received him [whether Jew or Gentile], to them gave he the
   right to become children of God [comp. Rom. iii. 14-17; Gal. iii. 26;
   iv. 6, 7; I. John iii. 1, 2], even to them that believe on his name: 13
   who were born, not of blood [descent from Abraham, David or any other
   godly person does not make a man a child of God--Luke iii. 8; Matt.
   iii. 9; ch. viii. 39, 40; Gal. iii. 6, 7, 29], nor of the will of the
   flesh [the efforts and exertions of our own human hearts and natures
   may reform, but can not regenerate, the life--ch. iii. 6], nor of the
   will of man [we are not begotten of God by the acts and deeds of our
   fellow-men, however much they may aid us in leading right lives], but
   of God. [ Ch. iii. 5; I. John iv. 7; v. 1.] 14 And the Word became
   flesh [by being born in Bethlehem of the Virgin Mary], and dwelt among
   us, (and we beheld his glory [in his miracles, and especially in his
   transfiguration--ch. ii. 11; II. Pet. i. 16-18], glory as of the only
   begotten from the Father) [such glory as was suitable to the Son of
   God], full of grace and truth. [The glory of Christ was not in pomp and
   worldly grandeur, but in the holiness, grace, and truth of his daily
   life.] 15 John [the Baptist] beareth witness of him [the words of John
   the Baptist still witness to unbelieving Jews and Gentiles], and
   crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said [John had preached about
   Jesus before Jesus appeared; he now points to Jesus as the one about
   whom he had preached] , He that cometh after me [He for whom I as a
   forerunner have prepared the way--Matt. iii. 3] is become before me [is
   worthy of more honor and reverence than am I] : for he was before me.
   [Though born into the world six months later than John, Jesus, as the
   Word, had existed from eternity. (In verse 16 the words are the apostle
   John's, and not John the Baptist's.)] 16 For of his fulness [Jesus was
   full of grace and truth--and all the attributes of God--Eph. i. 23;
   iii. 19; iv. 13; Col. i. 19; ii. 9] we all received [by union with him
   all his perfection and righteousness became ours--Phil. i. 10, 11; iii.
   8, 9; I. Cor. i. 30], and grace for grace. [This may mean that we
   receive a grace kindred to or like each several grace that is in Christ
   (Rom. viii. 29; xii. 2; Eph. iv. 11-13). But it more probably means
   fullness of grace, or fresh grace daily added to the grace already
   bestowed.] 17 For the law [the Old Dispensation with its condemnation
   (Rom. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 21) and its types and shadows--Col. ii. 16, 17;
   Heb. viii. 4, 5; x. 1] was given through Moses [by angels at Mt.
   Sinai--Heb. ii. 2]; grace and truth [the New Dispensation with its
   justification (Rom. iii. 21-26) and its realities-- Heb. ix. 1-15] came
   through Jesus Christ. [Heb. i. 1, 2; ii. 3.] 18 No man hath seen God at
   any time [I. John iv. 12, 20; ch. i. 18; I. Tim. vi. 16]; the only
   begotten Son [the word "only begotten" indicates that none other bears
   with Christ a like relationship to God], who is in the bosom of the
   Father [who bears the closest and tenderest relationship and fellowship
   as to the Father] , he hath declared him. [Ch. iii. 2; ch. xv. 9; Col.
   i. 15.]

III.

Genealogy of Jesus According to Matthew.

^A Matt. I. 1-17.

   ^a 1 The book of the generation [or genealogy] of Jesus Christ, the son
   of David [the Messiah was promised to David--II. Sam. vii. 16; John
   vii. 42], the son of Abraham. [Messiah was also promised to
   Abraham--Gen. xxii. 18; Gal. iii. 16.] 2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac
   begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren [mentioned here
   because they were the heads of the tribes for whom especially Matthew
   wrote his Gospel]; 3 and Judah begat Perez and Zerah [these two were
   twins] of Tamar [she was the incestuous daughter-in-law of Judah]; and
   Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 4 and Ram begat Amminadab;
   and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 5 and Salmon
   begat Boaz of Rahab [she had been a heathen and a harlot of Jericho];
   and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth [she was a heathen Moabitess]; and Obed
   begat Jesse; 6 and Jesse begat David the king. [These fourteen were
   patriarchs. The second fourteen were all kings.] And David [we may
   count David twice, first as a patriarch, second as one of the kings;
   and thus make up the full number of the second fourteen] begat Solomon
   of her that had been the wife [the adulteress Bathsheba] of Uriah; 7
   and Solomon [a wise but sinful king] begat Rehoboam [a foolish king,
   from whose kingdom of twelve tribes God cut off ten tribes]; and
   Rehoboam begat Abijah [a sinful king, like his father Rehoboam]; and
   Abijah begat Asa [a godly king who reformed his kingdom of Judah]; 8
   and Asa begat Jehoshaphat [a good king, much like his father Asa; but
   he displeased God somewhat by being too friendly with Ahab, the wicked
   king of Israel]; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram [Joram married Athaliah,
   the wicked daughter of Ahab, and followed Ahab in all his ungodly
   practices]; and Joram [Joram begat Ahaziah, and Ahaziah begat Joash,
   and Joash begat Amaziah; and Amaziah begat Uzziah. The names of
   Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah were probably omitted for the sake of
   symmetry, but may have been dropped because they were wicked
   descendants of Ahab unto the fourth generation--Ex. xx. 4, 5] begat
   Uzziah [he was a good king, but smitten with leprosy for presumptuously
   entering the temple]; 9 and Uzziah begat Jotham [a good king like
   Uzziah, his father]; and Jotham begat Ahaz [one of Judah's worst
   kings]; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah [a royal, godly king, like David]; 10
   and Hezekiah begat Manasseh [an evil king, like Ahaz, but, being
   punished of God, he repented]; and Manasseh begat Amon [an evil king
   like his father Manasseh; who waxed worse and worse till his people
   conspired against him and slew him]; and Amon begat Josiah [a good
   king, much like Hezekiah]; 11 and Josiah begat [Jehoiakim, and
   Jehoiakim begat] Jechoniah and his brethren [So far as is known,
   Jechoniah had no literal brothers. We may, therefore, take the word
   "brethren" as meaning his royal kindred; viz.: his father Jehoiakim,
   and his uncles, Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, the three sons of Josiah], at
   the time [probably about b.c. 599] of the carrying away [into
   captivity] to Babylon. 12 And after the carrying away to Babylon
   Jechoniah [If we do not count David twice, as above indicated (as a
   patriarch and a king), we must count Jechoniah twice (as a king who
   became a citizen). But if we count Jehoiakim as properly included in
   the phrase "his brethren" at verse 11, we need count no one twice]
   begat Shealtiel [Luke calls Shealtiel the son of Neri Jechoniah may
   have been the natural, and Neri the legal, father of Shealtiel--Deut.
   xxv. 5-10; Matt. xxii. 24. Or Luke's Shealtiel and Zerubbabel may have
   been different persons from the Shealtiel and Zerubbabel of Matthew] ;
   and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel [the governor of Jerusalem, who rebuilt
   the temple, as told by Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah]; 13 and Zerubbabel
   begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 14 and
   Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 15 and
   Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat
   Jacob; 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
   Jesus [the name Jesus means Saviour], who is called Christ. [The word
   "Christ" is a title. It means the anointed One. Prophets, priests, and
   kings were anointed; Jesus was all three.] 17 So all the generations
   from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the
   carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying
   away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations. [The Jews, to
   whom Matthew wrote his Gospel, were extremely fond of such groupings
   and divisions as this.]

   about thirty years of age [the age when a Levite entered upon God's
   service--Num. iv. 46, 47], being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph,

   Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri [Matthew calls
   Shealtiel the son of Jechoniah. Jechoniah may have been the natural,
   and Neri the legal, father of Shealtiel--Deut. xxv. 5-10; Matt. xxii.
   24], 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosan, the son
   of Elmadam, the son of Er, 29 the son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the

   two spies who were sent to Jericho by Joshua--Josh ii. 1-24], the son

   in the wilderness--Num. i. 4-7; x. 14], 33 the son of Amminadab, the

   the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of
   Noah [the hero of the flood], the son of Lamech, 37 the son of
   Methuselah [who lived to be the oldest man on record, dying when 969
   years old], the son of Enoch [whom God translated], the son of Jared,
   the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 38 the son of Enos, the son
   of Seth [the third son of Adam] , the son of Adam, the son of God [Adam
   was the son of God, being not merely a creature, but a creature made in
   God's image and likeness--Gen. i. 26, 27.]

Annunciation to Zacharias of the Birth of John the Baptist.

(at Jerusalem. Probably b.c. 6.)

^C Luke I. 5-25.

   ^c 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judæa [a Jewish
   proselyte, an Idumæan or Edomite by birth, founder of the Herodian
   family, king of Judæa from b.c. 40 to a.d. 4, made such by the Roman
   Senate on the recommendation of Mark Antony and Octavius Cæsar], a
   certain priest named Zacharias, of the course [David divided the
   priests into twenty-four bodies or courses, each course serving in
   rotation one week in the temple (I Chron. xxiv. 3-19 ). Of these
   courses that of Abijah was the eighth] of Abijah: and he had a wife of
   the daughters of Aaron [The Baptist was of the priestly race by both
   parents, a family distinction much esteemed among the Jews. He who was
   thus doubly a priest proclaimed Him who changed the priesthood], and
   her name was Elisabeth. [She was named after her ancestress Elisheba,
   the wife of Aaron.] 6 And they were both righteous before God [that is,
   truly righteous, or righteous in God's judgment, and not in mere
   appearance--Gen. vii. 1], walking in all the commandments and
   ordinances [Strictly construed, commandments would refer to moral, and
   ordinances to ceremonial laws. The two words include all the positive
   and negative precepts] of the Lord blameless. 7 And they had no child
   [this fact was a reproach and shame to her, barrenness being considered
   even a punishment for sin by many], because that Elisabeth was barren
   [the births of Isaac, Samson, Samuel and the Baptist were all contrary
   to nature, and were faint foreshadowings of the greater miracle which
   took place in the birth of our Lord], and they both were now well
   stricken in years. 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the
   priest's office before God in the order of his course [that is, when it
   came the turn of his course to minister in the temple], 9 according to
   the custom [there were many duties in the temple service, and the
   priests in each course daily drew lots for these duties] of the
   priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple [not that group
   of buildings, courts, and enclosures which was all called the temple;
   but the real sanctuary itself, the small but holy building which took
   the place of the tabernacle of the wilderness] of the Lord and burn
   incense. [Made of a mixture of sweet spices. The temple incense was
   made of stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense, in equal
   parts, beaten very small--Ex. xxx. 7, 8, 34-38.] 10 The whole multitude
   [the presence of the multitude indicates that it was a sabbath or a
   feast day] of the people were praying [Incense is a symbol of prayer
   (Ps. cxli. 1, 2; Rev. viii. 3). Each of the multitude prayed in
   silence] without [outside the sanctuary, in the temple courts,
   particularly the court of the women] at the time of incense. [Incense
   was offered evening and morning (Ex. xxx. 1-8). Probably at 9 A. M. and
   at 3 P. M. Compare Acts iii. 1. The text favors the idea that
   Zacharias' vision came in the morning.] 11 And there appeared unto him
   [one of God's invisible messengers who came visibly--II. Kings vi. 17;
   Ps. xxxiv. 7] an angel of the Lord [Luke frequently tells of the
   ministration of angels (ch. i. 26; ii. 9, 13, 21; xii. 8; xv. 10; xvi.
   22; xxii. 43; xxiv. 4, 23). They are also often mentioned in the Book
   of Acts. There had been no appearance of an angel for about four
   hundred years] standing on the right side [the place of honor and
   dignity--Acts vii. 56] of the altar of incense. [The altar on which
   Zacharias was burning incense. It stood in the Holy Place in front of
   the veil which hung between the holy and the most holy places. It was a
   small table twenty-two inches in breadth and length and forty-four
   inches in height. It was made of acacia wood, and overlaid with
   gold--Ex. xxxvii. 25.] 12 And Zacharias was troubled [as men always are
   at the sight of heavenly beings -- Gen. iii. 9, 10; Dan. x. 7-12; Rev.
   i. 17, 18] when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel
   said unto him, Fear not [These are the first words of the gospel which
   began at that hour to unfold itself], Zacharias: because thy
   supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
   and thou shalt call his name John. [This name means "the Lord is
   gracious," or "the Lord is merciful."] 14 And thou shalt have joy and
   gladness [thou shalt feel as Abraham did when he named his new-born son
   Isaac; that is, "Laughter"]; and many [but not all] shall rejoice at
   his birth. 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord [compare
   verse 6], and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink. [Strong drink is
   any other fermented liquor. Wycliffe's version calls it "syder," and
   the Anglo-Saxon version calls it "beor," of which palm wine was the
   most common kind. As to the temperance of the Baptist, compare the
   history of Samson (Judg. xiii. 3-5) and the law of the Nazarite--Num.
   vi. 2-4]; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit [the stimulation
   of the Spirit is elsewhere thus contrasted with alcoholic stimulants--
   Acts ii. 15-18; Eph. v. 18], even from his mother's womb. [See verse
   41.] 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord
   their God. [These words were quoted from Mal. iv. 6, and resumed the
   thread of prophecy which had been broken nearly four centuries before.
   Roman rule had brought in the vices and profligacy of Italy and Greece,
   and the nation needed to turn back to its former godly life.] 17 And he
   shall go before his face [the face of Messiah, who is also the Lord
   God--Mal. iii. 1] in the spirit and power of Elijah [And thus in
   fulfillment of the prophecy that Elijah should come again (Mal. iv. 6;
   Matt. xvii. 9-13). The Jews still expect Elijah as the forerunner of
   Messiah. John showed the spirit of Elijah in his ascetic dress and life
   (II. Kings i. 8; Matt. iii. 4) and in his message of repentance--I.
   Kings xviii. 21-40], to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.
   ["These are the last words of the Old Testament, there used by a
   prophet; here expounded by an angel; there concluding the law; here
   beginning the gospel." The phrase may mean: 1. John will restore unity
   to the families of Israel, now divided into political factions, as
   Herodians or friends of Rome, and zealots or patriots; and into
   religious factions, as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, etc.; or more
   likely it may mean, 2. That John would restore the broken relationship
   between the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their degenerate
   descendants--Isa. xxix. 22, 23; lxiii. 16; John viii. 37-40], and the
   disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the
   Lord a people prepared for him. [As in the East the "friend," or
   go-between, prepares the bride to understand and appreciate her
   bridegroom--John iii. 28, 29.] 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel,
   Whereby shall I know this? [In asking for a sign Zacharias showed his
   unbelief (Matt. xii. 38, 39 ). His question in the original is in four
   words. Four faithless words cost him forty weeks of silence.] for I am
   an old man [So said Abraham (Gen. xvii. 17). The law which retired
   Levites from service at the age of fifty years (Num. viii. 25, 26) did
   not apply to priests. They served to extreme old age] , and my wife
   well stricken in years. 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am
   Gabriel [This name means "hero, or mighty one, of God." Gabriel
   announced to Daniel the time of Christ's birth and death, and the
   overthrow and final restoration of the Jewish nation (Dan. vii.-xii.).
   He also announced the birth of Jesus to Mary (verse 26). The Bible
   gives the name of but one other angel; viz.: Michael, meaning "Who is
   like God?" Since Gabriel was the messenger who announced God's merciful
   and gracious purposes, and Michael the one who executed his decrees and
   punishments, the Jews had a beautiful saying that "Gabriel flew with
   two wings, and Michael with only one." The very ancient book of Enoch
   (Jude 14) gives us the name of two other archangels; viz.: Uriel,
   meaning "God is light"; and Raphael, meaning "healer of God"], that
   stand in the presence of God [Seven angels are spoken of as standing in
   the presence of God (Rev. viii. 2) and may probably be called angels of
   the presence (Isa. lxiii. 9). But to see the face of God is no doubt
   accorded to all angels (Matt. xviii. 10). One who stands in the
   presence of God should be believed by men without approving signs]; and
   I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.
   [Our word "gospel" means good tidings.] 20 And, behold, thou shalt be
   silent [it was a sign; and also a punishment for having sought a sign]
   and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to
   pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in
   their season. 21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they
   marvelled while he tarried [The Jews considered slow service as
   irreverent and displeasing to God. The punishment attached to
   displeasing service made them fearful--Lev. xvi. 13] in the temple. 22
   And when he came out, he could not speak unto them [Could not dismiss
   them with the usual blessing (Num. vi. 23-26). Disbelief is always
   powerless to bless]: and they perceived [probably by his excited
   manner] that he had seen a vision [the most vivid and objective of all
   spiritual phenomena--ch. xxiv. 23; Acts xxvi. 19; II. Cor. xii. 1; Dan.
   ix. 23] in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and
   remained dumb. 23 And it came to pass, when the days of his
   ministration [They are said to have lasted from the evening of one
   Sabbath (Friday at sundown) to the morning of the next. Though
   doubtless chagrined at the punishment which had come upon him, the old
   priest remained at his post, and dwelt in the temple until his week was
   finished] were fulfilled, he departed unto his house. [Some guess that
   he lived at Hebron, others at Jutta, five miles south of Hebron, others
   at Ain Karim, four miles west of Jerusalem, but no one knows.] 24 And
   after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself
   [probably through mingled feelings of modesty, humility, devotion, and
   joy] five months [at the end of which time her seclusion was
   interrupted by the visit of Mary], saying, 25 Thus [graciously and
   mercifully] hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked
   upon me, to take away my reproach [the reproach of being
   childless--Gen. xxx. 23] among men.

Annunciation of the Birth of Jesus.

(at Nazareth, b.c. 5.)

^C Luke I. 26-38.

   ^c 26 Now in the sixth month [this is the passage from which we learn
   that John was six months older than Jesus] the angel Gabriel was sent
   from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth [Luke alone tells us
   where Mary lived before the birth of Jesus. That Nazareth was an
   unimportant town is shown by the fact that it is mentioned nowhere in
   the Old Testament, nor in the Talmud, nor in Josephus, who mentions two
   hundred four towns and cities of Galilee. The way in which Luke
   introduces Galilee and Nazareth shows that he wrote to those unfamiliar
   with Palestine. Compare the conversation at John i. 45, 46. Galilee
   comprised the lands of Zebulun, Naphtali, Issachar and Asher. It was
   rich in trees and pastures. Its people were hardy and warlike], 27 to a
   virgin betrothed to a man [In the East, the betrothal or engagement was
   entered into with much ceremony, and usually took place a year before
   the marriage. It was so sacred that the parties entering into it could
   not be separated save by a bill of divorcement--Matt. i. 19] to a man
   whose name was Joseph, of the house of David [that is, Joseph was of
   the house of David]; and the virgin's name was Mary. [The same as
   Miriam--Ex. xv. 20.] 28 And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou
   that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. 29 But she was greatly
   troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation
   this might be. [Whether it meant a present sorrow or joy, for God's
   salutations all mean joy, but usually is in the distant future--Heb.
   xii. 11; II. Cor. iv. 17, 18.] 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not
   [the gospel is full of "Fear nots"; it teaches us that perfect love
   which casts out fear--I. John iv. 18], for thou hast found favour with
   God. 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
   son, and shalt call his name JESUS. [The same as Hoshea ( Num. xiii.
   8), Joshua, and Jeshua (Zech. iii. 1). It means the "salvation of
   Jehovah." It was one of the most common Jewish names, but was given to
   Jesus by divine direction because of its fitness--Matt. i. 21 .] 32 He
   shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High [A common
   Hebrew way of saying "He shall be." Even the evil spirits called Jesus
   by this name--Mark v. 7 ]: and the Lord God shall give unto him [he
   shall not receive his kingdom as a bribe from Satan (Matt. iv. 9 ), nor
   win it by force of arms (John xviii. 10, 11, 36; Matt. xxvi. 53), but
   as the gift of God--Acts ii. 32-36; Phil. ii. 9-11; Matt. xxviii. 18]
   the throne [see Ps. cxxxii. 11] of his father David [this must refer to
   Mary's descent from David, for she is expressly told in verse 35 that
   her son would have no earthly father]: 33 and he shall reign over the
   house of Jacob [That is, over the family or descendants of Jacob; but
   the expression includes his spiritual, rather than his carnal,
   descendants (Gal. iii. 7, 28, 29). This name therefore includes the
   Gentiles as the name of a river includes the rivers which flow into it]
   forever [Dan. ii. 44; vii. 13, 14, 27; Mic. iv. 7; Ps. xlv. 6; Heb. i.
   8; Rev. xi. 15]; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. [Isa. vii.
   9. Christ shall resign his mediatorial kingdom to the Father at the
   close of this dispensation (I. Cor. xv. 24-28); but as being one with
   his Father he shall rule forever.] 34 And Mary unto the angel, How
   shall this be [Her question indicates surprise, not disbelief. Unlike
   Zacharias, she asked no sign. The youthful village maiden, amid her
   humble daily duties, shows a more ready faith in the far more startling
   message than the aged priest in the holy place of the temple in the
   atmosphere of the sacred incense], seeing I know not a man? 35 And the
   angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee,
   and the power of the Most High shall overshadow [the Spirit of God is
   thus spoken of as "brooding over" or overshadowing creation to develop
   it--Gen. i. 2] thee [This indicates that the Holy Spirit himself
   created the body of Christ (Heb. x. 5). The spirit, or divine nature,
   of Christ was from the beginning, and was unbegotten--that is, in the
   sense of being created]: wherefore also the holy thing. [the body of
   Jesus--Heb. vii. 26; I. Pet. ii. 22] which is begotten [Gal. iv. 4]
   shall be called the Son of God. [As the Evangelist is here talking
   about the bodily and human nature of Jesus, it is possible that he may
   here speak of Jesus as the Son of God in the same sense in which he
   called Adam the son of God (ch. iii. 38); that is, his body and human
   nature were the direct and miraculous production of the divine power.
   If so, we find Jesus called the Son of God in three several senses: 1.
   Here, because he was born into the world in a supernatural manner. 2.
   Elsewhere, because by his resurrection he was begotten from the dead
   (Rom. i. 4; Acts xiii. 33; Ps. ii. 7). 3. Also elsewhere, because of
   the eternal, immutable, and unparalleled relationship which he sustains
   to the Father-- John i. 1, 14, 18.] 36 And behold, Elisabeth thy
   kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age. [The angel
   tells of Elisabeth's condition, that it may encourage the faith of
   Mary, and lead her to trust in Him with whom nothing is
   impossible--Jer. xxxii. 17, 27; Gen. xviii. 14; Matt. xix. 26.] 37 For
   no word from God shall be void of power. [Isa. lv. 11.] 38 And Mary
   said, Behold, the handmaid [Literally, "slave" or "bondservant." It is
   the feminine form of the word which Paul so often applies to himself (
   Rom. i. 1; Tit. i. 1). Mary uses it to indicate her submissive and
   obedient spirit] of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. [In
   great faith she not only believes the promise, but prays for its
   fulfillment. She bowed to the will of God like Eli ( I. Sam. iii. 18),
   and became the mother of Him who prayed, "Not my will, but thine, be
   done"--Luke xxii. 42.] And the angel departed from her.

VII.

Mary, Future Mother of Jesus, Visits Elisabeth, Future Mother of John the
Baptist.

(in the Hill Country of Judæa, b.c. 5.)

^C Luke I. 39-56.

   ^c 39 And Mary arose in these days [within a week or two after the
   angel appeared to her] and went into the hill country [the district of
   Judah lying south of Jerusalem, of which the city of Hebron was the
   center] with haste [she fled to those whom God had inspired, so that
   they could understand her condition and know her innocence--to those
   who were as Joseph needed to be inspired, that he might
   understand--Matt. i. 18-25], into a city of Judah [where Zacharias
   dwelt--see verse 23]; 40 and entered into the house of Zacharias and
   saluted Elisabeth. 41 And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the
   salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb [see verse 15]; and
   Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit [sufficiently to have a
   supernatural knowledge of things and to utter prophecy]; 42 And she
   lifted up her voice with a loud cry [Indicating intense, ecstatic joy.
   What joy must have filled the hearts of these two women as they
   realized that one was to be the mother of the long-expected Messiah,
   and the other of his Elijah-like forerunner!], and said, Blessed [see
   verse 28] art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
   43 And whence is this to me [why am I thus honored?--Matt. viii. 7, 8],
   that the mother of my Lord [This word imported sometimes divinity, and
   sometimes mere superiority. The Jews employed this term in connection
   with the Messiah; but in which sense can not now be determined.
   Inspired writers employ it in the higher sense when applying it to
   Jesus (Matt. xxii. 41-45), and in that sense it is no doubt used here]
   should come unto me? 44 For behold, when the voice of thy salutation
   came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy 45 And blessed
   is she that believed [Elisabeth may have here remembered how her own
   husband failed to believe]; for there shall be a fulfilment of the
   things which have been spoken to her from the Lord. 46 And Mary said
   [She speaks in poetic strain. Her song closely resembles that of
   Hannah--I. Sam. ii. 1-10 ], My soul doth magnify [Mary's song is called
   "The Magnificat" from this word] the Lord, 47 and my spirit hath
   rejoiced in God my Saviour. 48 For he hath looked upon the low estate
   [this refers to the contrast between her present condition and that of
   the former glories of David's house, from which she sprang] of his
   handmaid: For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
   blessed. [Here ends the first section of her song. In it she speaks of
   herself, and her adoration toward God for his condescending blessing.
   Mary was blessed in her motherhood, Abraham in his covenant and
   promises, Paul in his apostleship, etc., but none of these human beings
   are to be worshiped because of the blessings which they received.
   Rather should we bestow the more worship on God, from whom these their
   blessings flow--Jas. i. 17.] 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me
   great things; And holy is his name. [Ex. xx. 7.] 50 And his mercy is
   unto generations and generations. [that is, it is unceasing--Ex. xx. 6]
   On them that fear him. [Here ends the second division of her song. In
   it Mary glorifies God for his power, holiness and mercy.] 51 He hath
   showed strength with his arm. ["God's efficacy is represented by his
   finger (Ex. viii. 19); his great power by his hand (Ex. iii. 20); and
   his omnipotence by his arm--Ex. xv. 16"] ; He hath scattered the proud
   in the imagination of their heart. 52 He hath put down princes from
   their thrones, And hath exalted them of low degree. 53 The hungry he
   hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away.
   [These expressions are hyperboles for the disappointment of the proud,
   the princely, and the rich, in whose families the Messiah was expected.
   God has passed these by, and exalted a lowly one. Here ends the third
   section or verse of the hymn. It speaks of the changes which the
   Messiah should work as if he had already worked them.] 54 He hath given
   help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy; 55 (As he
   spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham [ Mic. vii. 20; Gal. iii. 16]
   and his seed for ever. [The hymn closes with an expression of gratitude
   to God for his faithfulness in keeping his covenants.] 56 And Mary
   abode with her about three months [or until John was born], and
   returned [a favorite word with Luke, used twenty-one times in his
   Gospel] unto her house.

VIII.

The Birth and Early Life of John the Baptist.

(Hill Country of Judæa, b.c. 5.)

^C Luke I. 57-80.

   ^c 57 Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered;
   and she brought forth a son. 58 And her neighbors and her kinsfolk
   heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her [mercy in
   granting a child; great mercy in granting so illustrious a child] ; and
   they rejoiced with her. 59 And it came to pass on the eighth day [See
   Gen. xvii. 12; Lev. xii. 3; Phil. iii. 5. Male children were named at
   their circumcision, probably because at that time the names of Abram
   and Sarai had been changed (Gen. xvii. 5, 15). Females were named when
   they were weaned], they came to circumcise the child; and they would
   have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 60 And his
   mother answered and said, Not so [Zacharias had evidently written, and
   thus communicated to his wife all that the angel had told him, and how
   the child was to be named John]; but he shall be called John. 61 And
   they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred [Family names were
   even more thought of, and honored, among the Jews than among us. They
   had no taste for romantic and eccentric names] that is called by this
   name. 62 And they made signs [this seems to indicate that Zacharias was
   deaf as well as dumb] to his father, what he would have him called. 63
   And he asked for a writing tablet [tablets were sometimes made of lead,
   but were usually small wooden boards, either smeared with wax, or
   having sand sprinkled over them, on which words were written with an
   iron stylus or pencil], and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they
   marvelled all. [Being surprised that both parents should thus unite
   upon an unexpected name.] 64 And his mouth was opened immediately [See
   verse 20. The angel's words were now completely fulfilled, therefore
   the punishment for disbelief was removed], and his tongue loosed, and
   he spake, blessing God. [Probably the words recorded in verses 68-79.]
   65 And fear came [The miraculous phenomena attending the birth of John
   made the people so conscious of the presence of God as to fill them
   with awe. The influence of this fear spread far and wide until the
   chills and tremors of expected changes and revolutions were felt even
   by the citizens of Rome, as their poets and historians testify] on all
   that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad
   throughout all the hill country of Judæa. 66 And all that heard them
   laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? [We
   probably find an echo of this question thirty years later when John
   entered upon his ministry--John i. 19.] And the hand of the Lord was
   with him. 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit,
   and prophesied [This his prophecy is the last of the old dispensation,
   and the first of the new, or Christian, era. It also is poetry, and is
   a hymn of thanksgiving for the time of Messiah's advent], saying, 68
   Blessed [the hymn gets its name from this word, and is called the
   Benedictus] be the Lord, the God of Israel; For he hath visited [Come
   back, in the person of his Spirit, to his people. After some four
   hundred years of absence the Holy Spirit, as the spirit of prophecy,
   had again returned to God's people. Malachi, the last of the prophets,
   had been dead about four centuries] and wrought redemption for his
   people, 69 And hath raised up a horn [the horn is a symbol of
   power--Dan. vii. 7, 8; viii. 21] of salvation for us In the house of
   his servant David [this also indicates that Mary was of the house of
   David] 70 (As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been
   from of old) [Gen. iii. 15; xxii. 18; xlix. 10; Num. xxiv. 17; II. Pet.
   i. 21; Heb. i. 1], 71 Salvation from our enemies [not only Rome, the
   enemy of Israelitish prosperity, but also those evil agencies which
   wage ceaseless warfare against the souls of men--Eph. vi. 12], and from
   the hand of all that hate us; 72 To show mercy towards our fathers, And
   to remember his holy covenant [contract or agreement]; 73 The oath
   which he sware unto Abraham our father [see Gen. xii. 3; xvii. 4; xxii.
   16, 17], 74 To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of
   our enemies Should serve him without fear, 75 In holiness and
   righteousness [holiness is good conduct toward God, righteousness is
   good conduct toward men] before him all our days. 76 Yea and thou,
   child [the rest of the psalm is addressed to the infant John], shalt be
   called the prophet [see Matt. xi. 9; Luke xx. 6 ] of the Most High: For
   thou shalt go before the face of the Lord [the Lord Jesus Christ] to
   make ready his ways [ Isa. xl. 3; Matt. iii. 3]; 77 To give knowledge
   of salvation unto his people [Israel had a false idea that the
   Messiah's salvation would be from political evil. John was needed to
   tell them that it was from sin that God proposed to deliver them.
   Perdition does not consist in political wrongs, but in divine
   condemnation] In the remission of their sins [through Christ's
   work--Acts v. 31], 78 Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby
   the dayspring from on high [One of the many names for Jesus or his
   kingdom. The prophets loved to picture Messiah's advent as a sunrise
   (Isa. ix. 2; lx. 1-3; Mal. iv. 2; Matt. iv. 16; John i. 4, 5). Christ's
   coming was the dawn of a new day for Israel and for mankind] shall
   visit us, 79 To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of
   death; To guide our feet into the way of peace. [Travelers in the
   Judæan mountains often waited patiently for the morning light, lest
   they should lose their lives by a false step taken in the
   darkness--Isa. lix. 8.] 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in
   spirit [I. Sam. ii. 26; Luke ii. 40, 52] and was in the deserts [The
   thinly settled region west of the Dead Sea. In I. Sam. xxiii. 19 it is
   called Jeshimon, or "the Horror"] till the day of his showing unto
   Israel. [The day when he commenced his ministry and declared his
   commission as Messiah's forerunner.]

Annunciation to Joseph of the Birth of Jesus.

(at Nazareth, b.c. 5.)

^A Matt. I. 18-25.

   ^a 18 Now the birth [The birth of Jesus is to handled with reverential
   awe. We are not to probe into its mysteries with presumptuous
   curiosity. The birth of common persons is mysterious enough (Eccl. ix.
   5; Ps. cxxxix. 13-16), and we do not well, therefore, if we seek to be
   wise above what is written as to the birth of the Son of God] of Jesus
   Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed [The
   Jews were usually betrothed ten or twelve months prior to the marriage.
   So sacred was this relationship that unfaithfulness to it was deemed
   adultery, and was punishable by death--death by stoning (Deut. xxii.
   23-28; Lev. xx. 10; Ezek. xvi. 38; John viii. 5). Those betrothed were
   regarded as husband and wife, and could only be separated by
   divorcement. Hebrew betrothals set the world a good example. Hasty
   marriage is too often followed by hasty repentance. "No woman of Israel
   was married unless she had been first espoused"] to Joseph, before they
   came together [Before Joseph brought his bride to his own house. An
   espoused maiden lived in her father's house until the marriage, as is
   our own custom] she was found with child of the Holy Spirit [The two
   evangelists (Matthew and Luke) which give the earthly genealogy of
   Jesus are each careful to mention his miraculous conception through the
   Holy Spirit (comp. Luke i. 35). All New Testament writers recognize
   Jesus as at once both human and divine. Christ's physical nature was
   begotten of the Holy Spirit, but the Christian's spiritual nature is
   begotten of him (John i. 13). The act of the Holy Spirit in this case
   indicates that he is a personality, and not a mere influence, as some
   are disposed to imagine. Influences do not create physical bodies.] 19
   And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man [As a righteous man he
   could not complete his marriage, and thus stain his family name. As a
   merciful man he did not wish to openly disgrace the one to whom he was
   so fondly attached. He wished to act justly toward his own reputation,
   and mercifully toward the reputation of Mary], and not willing to make
   her a public example [he did not wish to expose her to the shame of a
   public trial before the court, nor to punish her as the law permitted],
   was minded to put her away privily [The law of Moses gave the husband
   the power of divorce (Deut. xxiv. 1). The bill or writing certifying
   the divorce usually stated the cause, and was handed to the wife in the
   presence of witnesses. Joseph evidently intended to omit stating any
   cause in the bill, that there might be no record to convict her of
   shame. The law of divorce applied to betrothed as well as to married
   persons. In his kindness Joseph anticipates the special teaching of
   Christ (Matt. xix. 8) and the general instruction of Paul (Gal. vi. 1).
   How different the conduct of the innocent Joseph from that of guilty
   Judah (Gen. xxxviii. 24). Judah needed some one to point out his
   unfitness-- John viii. 7.] 20 But when he thought on these things [God
   guides the thoughtful, not the unthinking], behold, an angel of the
   Lord appeared unto him [The Lord looks after the good name of those who
   honor his name, and he serves those who serve him ( I. Sam. ii. 30;
   John xii. 26). The sufferings of both Mary and Joseph must have been
   very extreme at this time--one being forced to suspect the chief object
   of his affections, and the other being compelled to rest under the
   unjust suspicions of loved ones, because of a condition which God alone
   could explain. But God does explain where we can not understand without
   his revelation, and where we absolutely need to know] in a dream [A
   mode of communication frequently used by God ( Gen. xx. 3; xxxi. 11,
   24; xxxvii. 5; xli. 1; I. Kings iii. 5; Dan. vii. 1; Job iv. 13-15). It
   is difficult to say how men determined between ordinary and divine
   dreams, but doubtless the latter came with a glory and vividness which
   gave assurance of their supernatural nature. Matthew mentions four
   divine dreams, viz.: this one; the second one given to Joseph (Matt.
   ii. 13); the dream of the Magi (Matt. ii. 12); the dream of Pilate's
   wife--ch. xxvii. 19], saying, Joseph [We are known to angels, and they
   address us by name (Acts x. 3, 13; xxvii. 24). Much more does the Lord
   know our names--John x. 3; Luke xix. 5], thou son of David [the name of
   David was calculated to waken the memories of God's promises, and
   helped to prepare Joseph to receive the wonderful news that Messiah was
   about to be born, for Messiah was the promised heir of David], fear not
   to take unto thee Mary thy wife [Have no fear as to Mary's virtue and
   purity. Fear no disgrace in taking her. Joseph feared as a son of David
   that this marriage would sully his genealogy. But it was that which
   gave point and purpose to an otherwise barren and uninteresting record.
   He feared as a man lest he should share Mary's apparent disgrace; but
   he had infinitely more reason to fear his unworthiness to share with
   her the exalted responsibilities of parentage to our Lord]: for that
   which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 And she shall bring
   forth a son [the angel does not say "shall bear thee a son," as he said
   to Zacharias--Luke i. 13]; and thou shalt call his name JESUS [Joseph
   was to take the position of a legal father to the child and name it.
   The name means "Salvation of Jehovah" or "Jehovah is the Saviour."
   Would we could all bear our names, such as Christian, pastor,
   magistrate, father, mother, child, etc., as Jesus bore that wonderful
   and responsible name of Saviour]; for it is he that shall save his
   people from their sins [Thus from before his very birth-hour the nature
   of Christ's salvation is fully set forth. He came to save from the
   guilt of sin by having shed his blood, his may be remitted or washed
   clean. He saves from the power of sin by bestowing the gift of the
   Spirit, who regenerates, comforts, and strengthens, and ultimately he
   saves from the punishment of sin by giving us a resurrection from the
   dead, and an abundant entrance into the home of glory. That is no
   salvation at all which fails to free us from this triple bondage of
   sin.] 22 Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which
   was spoken by the Lord [It was not fulfilled because predicted, but was
   rather predicted because sure to take place. Prophecies are fulfilled
   in four ways, namely, 1. When a thing clearly predicted comes to pass.
   2. When that which has been pictured in type and shadow is at last
   shown forth in substance and reality. 3. When an event which has been
   described in language more elevated and elaborate than it demands is
   followed by another similar event to which the said language is more
   perfectly suited. 4. When parabolic or figurative language may be
   applied to some subsequent event. The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled
   after the third fashion, which was spoken by the Lord. In innumerable
   passages the divine origin and inspiration of the Scriptures are
   clearly and unmistakably set forth. The same Spirit which foretold
   through the lips of the prophet now interprets the foretelling through
   the lips of the angel] through the prophet [Isa. vii. 14. Isaiah's name
   is not given. The ancients were studious readers, and had few books, so
   that there was little need to cite authors by name], saying [About the
   year 740 b.c. While Ahaz was king of Judah, his land was threatened
   with an invasion by the united armies of Syria and Israel. Isaiah came
   to frightened Ahaz, promised divine aid, and told Ahaz to seek from God
   a sign confirming this promise. This Ahaz refused to do; whereupon
   Isaiah replied that God would grant a sign anyway. The sign was that a
   virgin should have a son, and before the son reached the age of
   discretion, the kingdoms of Syria and Israel should be destroyed. The
   sign given Ahaz was one of deliverance, and prefigured the birth of
   Christ, the great Deliverer, in four ways: 1. A virgin bearing a child.
   2. A male child (Rev. xii. 5). 3. The divinely ordered naming of the
   child. 4. The significance of the name given. Jesus fulfilled in his
   ministry man predictions; but many more such as this one were fulfilled
   upon him without his volition], 23 Behold, the virgin shall be with
   child [The Sonship of Jesus demands a miraculous birth. If we doubt the
   miracle of his conception, we can never solve the perplexing problem of
   his marvelous life and death], and shall bring forth a son, and they
   shall call his name [rather, title; under the head of "name" the titles
   of Jesus are also set forth at Isa. ix. 6] Immanuel; which is, being
   interpreted, God with us [Nature shows God above us; the Law shows God
   against us; but the Gospel shows God with us, and for us. The blessing
   of the church militant is Christ, God with us; that of the church
   triumphant is Christ, us with God. In this world Jesus walked "with us"
   in human form (John i. 14); and because he did so, we, in the world to
   come, shall walk "with him" in divine form (I. John iii. 2; I. Cor. xv.
   49). In a personal sense Jesus may fitly be called "God with us," for
   he was God and man united in one body.] 24 And Joseph arose from his
   sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. [he followed the
   instructions, though contrary to his first inclination. Blessed are
   they who permit God to guide them. As Joseph appears to have acted at
   once upon the angel's instruction, the marriage must have taken place
   several months prior to the birth of Jesus], and took unto him his wife
   [thus becoming the legally recognized father of Jesus, and though he
   bestowed upon Jesus but a humble name (Luke iv. 22; Matt. xiii. 55), he
   nevertheless rescued him from the reproach of an illegitimate birth];
   25 and knew her not till she had brought forth a son [Romish teachers
   contend for the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, that she
   may be regarded as an object of worship. This doctrine can not be
   proved by Scripture. But there are weightier reasons than this which
   forbid us to worship her; namely, it can not be proven from Scripture
   either that she was divine or that she was sinless. Moreover, the fact
   that she entered the marital state at all, shows that she was perfectly
   human, and comported herself as such]: and he called his name JESUS.
   [Two Old Testament heroes bore the name Jesus under the form of Joshua.
   One was captain of Israel for the conquest of Canaan, the other was
   high priest of Israel for rebuilding the Temple (Zech. vi. 11, 12).
   Christ was both the Captain of our salvation and the High Priest of our
   profession.]

The Birth of Jesus.

(at Bethlehem of Judæa, b.c. 5.)

^C Luke II. 1-7.

   ^c 1 Now it came to pass in those days [the days of the birth of John
   the Baptist], there went out a decree [a law] from Cæsar Augustus
   [Octavius, or Augustus, Cæsar was the nephew of and successor to Julius
   Cæsar. He took the name Augustus in compliment to his own greatness;
   and our month August is named for him; its old name being Sextilis],
   that all the world should be enrolled. [This enrollment or census was
   the first step in the process of taxation.] 2 This was the first
   enrolment. [Publius Sulpicius Quirinius was governor of Syria, a.d.
   6-11, and made a census of his province at that time, as Luke well knew
   (Acts v. 37). We have no other record showing either his governorship
   or a census made by him at the time of the birth of Christ. But he was
   held in high favor by the Emperor, and was, about the time of the birth
   of Christ, carrying on a war just north of Syria, in Cilicia, and it is
   therefore easy for us to accept Luke's statement that as imperial
   commissioner or as governor of Syria he made such a census.] made when
   Quirinius was governor [Quirinius was doubtless twice governor of
   Syria, his first term being about b.c. 5-1. The Greek word hegemon,
   which Luke uses for governor, would be used for either of the Roman
   titles, viz.: Proprætor, or senatorial governor; or Quæstor, or
   imperial commissioner. Quirinius may have commenced the enrollment as
   Quæstor and finished it ten years later as Proprætor. He was well-known
   character in that age. Harsh and avaricious as a governor, but an able
   and loyal soldier, earning a Roman triumph for successes in Cilicia,
   and being honored by a public funeral in a.d. 21] of Syria. [A Roman
   province including all Palestine, and a tract four or five times as
   large lying to the northeast of Palestine.] 3 And all went to enroll
   themselves [The enrollment may have had no reference to taxation. It
   was more probably to ascertain the military strength of the various
   provinces. The Romans enrolled each person at the place where he was
   then residing; but permitted the Jews to thus return to their ancestral
   or tribal cities and enroll themselves as citizens of these cities],
   every one to his own city. [The city where his ancestors had been
   settled by Joshua when he divided the land--Josh. xiii.-xviii.] 4 And
   Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth [see ch.
   i. 26], unto Judæa, to the city of David [after the lapse of ten
   centuries the name of David still cast its fragrance over the place of
   his birth--I. Sam. xvii. 12], which is called Bethlehem [Meaning "house
   of bread." It was the later or Jewish name for the old Canaanitish
   village of Ephrath, the Ephrath near which Rachel died (Gen. xxxv. 19).
   It was marked by Micah as the birthplace of Messiah--Mic. v. 2; Matt.
   ii. 5, 6], because he was of the house and family of David; 5 to be
   taxed with Mary, who was betrothed to him [see Matt. i. 25], being
   great with child. 6 And it came to pass, while they were there, the
   days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. [The early Christians
   made no record of the date of Christ's birth; we find no mention of
   December 25 earlier than the fourth century. The Eastern church
   celebrated Christ's birth by a feast called Epiphany, which means
   manifestation. They chose January 6 as the date for this feast, for
   they reasoned that if the first Adam was born on the sixth day of
   creation, the second Adam must have been born on the sixth day of the
   year. The Western church celebrated Christ's birth on the 25th of
   December by a feast called Natalis, which means Nativity. But Pope
   Julius I. (a.d. 337-352) designated December 25 as the proper day, and
   the Eastern churches soon united with the Western churches in observing
   this day; and the custom has become universal. We do not observe this
   day because of the Pope's decree, but because of the tradition on which
   the Pope's decree was founded.] 7 And she brought forth her firstborn
   [This word in no way implies that the Virgin subsequently had other
   children. Jesus, the only begotten, is also called the firstborn--Heb.
   i. 6] son; and she wrapped [having none to help her, she swathed him in
   bands with her own hands] him in swaddling clothes [the new-born Jewish
   child was washed in water, rubbed with salt, and then wrapped in bands
   or blankets, which confined the limbs closely--Ezek. xvi. 4] , and laid
   him in a manger [Justin Martyr, who born about the beginning of the
   second century and suffered martyrdom a.d. 165, first tells us the
   tradition that the stable in which Jesus was born was a cavern. Caves,
   however, were never used for stables except when opened on the sides of
   hills. The one at Bethlehem is a cellar fourteen feet under the level
   surface. Justin must, therefore, be mistaken], because there was no
   room for them in the inn. [Eastern inns had landlords like our own. The
   inn was full at this time because of the number who had come to be
   enrolled. Inns contained rooms for persons and stalls for animals:
   there was no room in the former, but there was in the latter.]

The Birth of Jesus Proclaimed by Angels to the Shepherds.

(Near Bethlehem, b.c. 5.)

^C Luke II. 8-20.

   ^c 8 And there were shepherds in the same country [they were in the
   same fields from which David had been called to tend God's Israel, or
   flock] abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their
   flock. [When the flock is too far from the village to lead it to the
   fold at night, these shepherds still so abide with it in the field,
   even in the dead of winter.] 9 And an angel of the Lord stood by them
   [He stood upon the earth at their side, and did not float above them in
   the heavens, as he is usually pictured. His standing upon the earth
   shows a fuller fellowship and sympathy with men--comp. Acts i. 10 ],
   and the glory of the Lord shone round about them [The Shechinah, or
   bright cloud, which symbolizes the divine presence (Ex. xxiv. 16; I.
   Kings viii. 10; Isa. vi. 1-3; Rom. ix. 4). It was seen by the three
   apostles upon the mount of transfiguration (Matt. xvii. 5), by Stephen
   (Acts vii. 55), and by Paul--Acts xxii. 6-11] : and they were sore
   afraid. 10 And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I
   bring you good tidings of great joy [Christianity is a religion of
   present joys, and leads onward to joy eternal] which shall be to all
   the people: 11 for there is born to you [born as a gift to us--John
   iii. 16] this day in the city of David a Saviour. [the angel omits the
   name of Jesus, but gives the meaning of his name], who is the Christ
   [Messiah is the Hebrew and Christ is the Greek for our English word
   "anointed." Prophets, priests, and kings were anointed. Jesus held all
   these three offices for all our race for all eternity] the Lord. 12 And
   this is the sign [The token by which to identify the child. A babe in a
   manger was not ordinary sight] unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped
   in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. ["What fearful odds! What
   a strange contrast! Idolatry on the throne (in the person of Augustus
   Cæsar), and the founder of a new religion and a new empire lying in a
   manger!"] 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude [The
   event was too important to be heralded by any one angel. All heaven was
   interested in the departure of its Prince, and marveled at the grace of
   the Father who sent him--I. Pet. i. 12] of the heavenly host [God's
   army (I. Kings xxii. 19; Ps. ciii. 20, 21). The Deity is called "God of
   Sabaoth"; that is, God of hosts or multitude (Rom. ix. 29; Jas. v. 4;
   Dan. vii. 10; Rev. v. 11, 12); but at this time God's army appeared to
   announce the coming of eternal peace] praising God, and saying, 14
   Glory to God in the highest [in the highest heavens--Job xvi. 19; Ps.
   cxlviii. 1], And on earth peace among men [The angels invoke blessing
   on God and peace upon man. Peace between God and man, and ultimately
   peace between man and man] in whom he is well pleased. [The love of God
   is shed abroad upon all, even the vilest of sinners ( Rom. v. 8; I.
   Tim. i. 15); but his peace comes upon those who have accepted his Son,
   and in whom he is therefore especially well pleased (Rom. ix. 11).
   Peace is the unfailing apostolic salutation toward Christians (Rom. i.
   7; I. Cor. i. 3; II. Cor. i. 2, etc.), and is attainable in the highest
   degree by Christians only--John xiv. 27; xvi. 33; Col. iii. 15; Phil.
   iv. 7.] 15 And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them
   into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto
   Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath
   made known unto us. 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and
   Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. 17 And when they saw it, they
   made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about the
   child. [They were the first evangelists. Among the heralds of Christ we
   note one great prophet, John the Baptist, and one learned Pharisee,
   Paul; the rest are shepherds, fishermen, and publicans, yet their
   gospel has triumphed over the wisdom of men (I. Cor. i. 26-29; II. Cor.
   iv. 7). The shepherds were moved to publish by the same spirit which
   actuated the lepers at Samaria--II. Kings vii. 9.] 18 And all that
   heard it wondered [the gospel story excites wonder; the more we ponder
   it the more wonderful it becomes] at the things which were spoken unto
   them by the shepherds. 19 But Mary kept all these sayings [The silence
   of Mary contrasts with the talkativeness of the shepherds. But is the
   duty of Christians both to ponder and to publish], pondering them in
   her heart. [Only Mary could know the fact here stated; and the
   statement indicates that Luke got the opening parts of his Gospel from
   the mother of our Lord. She had much to think about. The angelic
   messages to Zacharias, to herself, and to the shepherds were full of
   significance, and her mind would search diligently to comprehend the
   fullness of their meaning. In her quiet thoughtfulness the beauty of
   the Virgin's character shines forth--I. Pet. iii. 4.] 20 And the
   shepherds returned [they did not make this glorious occasion an excuse
   for neglecting their humble duties], glorifying [because of the
   greatness of that which had been revealed] and praising God [because of
   the goodness of that which he revealed] for all the things that they
   had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them. [Jesus came in
   exactly the same manner in which his coming had been spoken of or
   described by the angels a few hours before; and also just as his coming
   had been spoken of or described by the prophets centuries and centuries
   before. God's word holds good for eternity as truly as for one day. The
   shepherds doubtless passed to their reward during the thirty years
   which Jesus spent in seclusion prior to his entering upon his ministry.
   But the rest of their commonplace life was now filled with music of
   praise, and their night watches lit by the glory of God, which could
   never entirely fade away.]

Circumcision, Temple Service, and Naming of Jesus.

(the Temple at Jerusalem, b.c. 4)

^C Luke II. 21-39.

   ^c 21 And when eight days [Gen. xvii. 12] were fulfilled for
   circumcising him [The rite was doubtless performed by Joseph. By this
   rite Jesus was "made like unto his brethren" (Heb. ii. 16, 17); that
   is, he became a member of the covenant nation, and became a debtor to
   the law--Gal. v. 3] , his name was called JESUS [see Luke i. 59], which
   was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. [Luke
   i. 31.] 22 And when the days of their purification according to the law
   of Moses were fulfilled [Purification took place on the fortieth day
   after the nativity in the case of males, and eighty days in the case of
   females (Lev. xii. 1-5). Until it was performed the mother was not
   permitted to go to the temple, take part in any public service, or even
   to leave her house. It seems that the members of her family were also
   ceremonially unclean, because they came in daily contact with her],
   they brought him up to Jerusalem [to the temple], to present him to the
   Lord [When God slew the firstborn of Egypt he spared the firstborn of
   Israel. For this reason all the firstborn of Israel were regarded as
   being peculiarly the Lord's (Ex. xii. 29, 30; xiii. 2); and the
   firstborn male child of each family had to be redeemed with money (Ex.
   xiii. 11-15; Num. xviii. 15, 16). Originally the firstborn or eldest
   son was priest of the household after his father's death; but God chose
   the Levites to serve in his sanctuary in the place of these firstborn
   or household priests (Num. iii. 11-13; viii. 14-19); but this choosing
   did not annul the statute which required the payment of redemption
   money. The redemption money for a male was five shekels of the
   sanctuary, or about $3.75-- Lev. xxvii. 6] 23 (as it is written in the
   law of the Lord [for additional passages see Ex. xxii. 29; xxxiv. 19,
   20], Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the
   Lord), 24 and to offer a sacrifice [By redemption money and sacrifice
   the life of Jesus was ceremonially redeemed from God the Father, that
   his consecration of it to the will of the Father might be perfect. We
   likewise are redeemed by the blood of Christ, but are expected
   nevertheless to be more consecrated than ever] according to that which
   is said in the law of the Lord [Lev. xii. 6-8; v. 11], A pair of
   turtledoves, or two young pigeons. [The required offering was a
   yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon for a
   sin-offering. But the law allowed a poor mother to substitute doves or
   pigeons for the lamb. We see here an early trace of the poverty of Him
   who had not where to lay his head. Knowing the greatness of the child,
   Joseph and Mary would never have used the lesser sacrifice if they
   could have afforded the regular and more costly one. Poverty is not
   dishonorable in God's sight; for Mary was honored of him above all
   women.] 25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
   Simeon [the name means "Hearing." Some think that it was Rabbi Simeon,
   the son of the great teacher Hillel; but the context forbids such an
   idea]; and this man was righteous and devout [Right in outward and
   devout in his inward life. The first prophet to tell the world that its
   Messiah had come was a thoroughly good man], looking for [Waiting like
   Jacob (Gen. xlix. 18), and Joseph of Arimathæa ( Mark xv. 43), he
   realized the truth of God's promise (Isa. xlix. 23). The Jews waited
   for a coming Prince, local, carnal, finite, temporal; we wait for a
   KING universal, spiritual, infinite, eternal, the Son of God. Hence the
   magnitude of our expected consolation is to theirs as an ocean is to a
   drop of water] the consolation of Israel [A common name for the era of
   the Messiah, which was so called because the advent of the Christ would
   bring comfort to his people (Isa. xl. 1). Jews swore by the consolation
   of Israel, and the phrase, "May I see the consolation of Israel," was
   common among them. A prayer for the coming of the Messiah was daily
   used by them]: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. [Luke i. 68.] 26 And
   it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit [probably in a dream],
   that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. [A
   remarkable favor, a notable blessing--Luke x. 23, 24.] 27 And he came
   in the Spirit [moved by the impulses of inspiration--Matt. xxii. 14;
   Rev. i. 10] into the temple [those who go to church perfunctorily see
   little; those who go in the Spirit--according to the measure in which
   He is given them--see and hear much]: and when the parents brought in
   the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of
   the law, 28 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and
   said, 29 Now lettest thou thy servant depart [This hymn of Simeon is
   called the "Nunc Dimittis" from the two words with which the Latin
   translation of it begins. Simeon regards his death as now near, since
   he had seen that for which God had kept him alive. He represents as a
   sentinel who, seeing the rising of the day-star which is the signal
   that his watch is relieved, knows his weary waiting is at an end],
   Lord, According to thy word [God keeps his word, and never
   disappoints], in peace [to the living the Jews said, "Go in peace"
   (Leshalom), as Jethro said to Moses; to the dying they said, "Go in
   peace" (Beshalom)--Gen. xv. 15]; 30 For mine eyes have seen thy
   salvation [Only the eye which sees Christ is satisfied with seeing (
   Eccl. i. 18). To one who has Christ in his arms and salvation before
   his eyes the world looks poor indeed, and the loss of it appears
   gain--Phil. i. 21], 31 Which thou hast prepared [God prepared the
   gospel in his counsels before Christ came into the world (Acts ii. 23
   ), and foretold it by the prophets--Acts iii. 18] before the face of
   all peoples [The Jewish Scriptures were then scattered among all
   nations, and all people were acquainted with the Hebrew expectations of
   a Messiah. Simeon saw in the Babe the initial step of God toward
   fulfilling all these prophecies]; 32 A light for revelation to the
   Gentiles. [A reference to Isa. xlix. 6. Christ's light has revealed the
   Father to the Gentiles. That Simeon should prophesy this is an evidence
   of the large spiritual knowledge given him, since even the apostles
   were slow to grasp the fullness of Christ's world-wide mission--see Ps.
   xcviii. 2, 3; Isa. lii. 10; xlii. 6] to the Gentiles, And the glory
   [Isa. xlv. 25. Israel is doubly glorified in Jesus, in that God chose
   this people to receive the Word, or divine Son, in that Jesus, as a
   Jew, presented to the world the picture of the perfect manhood. In his
   divinity and his humanity Jesus glorified Israel] of thy people Israel.
   [The Gentiles and Israel are here contrasted. The Gentiles refused the
   knowledge of God (Rom. i. 28), and Israel abused it--Rom. iii. 1-9.] 33
   And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were
   spoken concerning him [Not because they heard anything which was really
   new, but because the words caused them to see the truth in a new way.
   They were also doubtless surprised to find that an utter stranger
   should speak thus about the child. Such manifestations of inspiration
   were no more common then than now]; 34 and Simeon blessed them [While
   blessing the parents, he refrained from blessing the child, lest it
   might appear that he did it as a superior. He could bless God in the
   heavens (see verse 28) without fear of being misunderstood; but to
   bless this little Babe might seem to be presumptuous], and said unto
   Mary his mother [thus distinguishing between Mary the real parent, and
   Joseph the supposed one] , Behold, this child is set [either as a stone
   of stumbling (Isa. viii. 14; Rom. ix. 32, 33; I. Cor. i. 23), or a
   precious cornerstone (I. Pet. ii. 7, 8; Acts iv. 11; I. Cor. iii. 11).
   Jesus is the cornerstone of true religion. Those who reject him fall
   over him and are broken; those who accept him, build upon him, and are
   lifted up and edified] for the falling and the rising of many in Israel
   [Jesus has always wrought changes which were like fallings and risings.
   In his own early lifetime Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, Nazarenes,
   Gadarenes, etc., sank down before his example and teaching; while
   fishermen, publicans and outcasts were elevated and encouraged by his
   sympathy. In the ecclesiastical field Jesus has brought down the powers
   of superstition and priestcraft, and exalted the common worshiper,
   giving him liberty of conscience. In the political field Jesus has
   brought down the pride of kings and lifted up the common people, and
   given them sovereign powers. In the spiritual realm this work of Jesus
   is most clearly displayed. Not only did he bring down the pride of
   Judah and lift up the despised Gentiles (Rom. ix. 25); but he has
   worked a leveling and a lifting work in the life of each of his
   followers. Those proud of their manhood, he has made as children, that
   they might become truly men (Matt. xviii. 3); those wise in their own
   conceit, he approaches with the foolishness of preaching, that they
   might be instructed in true learning (I. Cor. i. 26-31); those strong
   in self-confidence, he makes weak, that he may fill them with the
   divine power (II. Cor. xii. 10; Phil. iv. 13). Like Paul, we fall and
   rise in Christ--Acts ix. 4-6]; and for a sign [Something which
   challenges attention, and is full of significant meaning. Signs were
   intended to allay controversy, and to exclude contradiction, but Jesus
   provoked both. When he was thus first in the temple, opposition was
   prophesied; when he was last there it was fully realized--Matt. xxiii.
   38] which is spoken against [during his earthly lifetime Jesus was
   called "deceiver," "Samaritan," "demoniac," etc., and subsequently his
   followers were abused (Acts xxviii. 22); later the Jews wrote of him as
   "the deceiver," "that man," and "the hung." Early Christians were
   charged by the pagans with committing cannibalism, incest, and every
   conceivable atrocity, and in this day "Christian" is--after Jew--the
   most stringing term of reproach known to the Eastern tongue]; 35 yea
   and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul [Simeon had read and
   understood the prophecies which told of the suffering Messiah (Isa.
   xlii. 14-xliii. 12). Hence, to prepare the soul of Mary he touches this
   minor chord. By as much as the prophecies and annunciations concerning
   Jesus, led Mary to expect honor, and glory for her son; by so much did
   the rejection, persecution and cruel death of Jesus overwhelm her with
   piercing anguish and disappointment. It is also probable that at the
   time of the crucifixion Mary shared with the apostles the doubts as to
   the mission of Jesus, and these doubts must have been unspeakably
   bitter to her]; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. [The
   word here translated "thoughts" is generally used to signify bad or
   evil thoughts. Jesus often revealed such (John ix. 16); but the context
   shows that Simeon had in mind the evil thoughts which were revealed by
   the sufferings inflicted on Christ. The human heart is desperately
   wicked (Jer. xvii. 9); but its wickedness was never more manifest than
   when it chose a murderer and crucified its Creator (Acts iii. 14, 15).
   Men are still revealed by their attitude toward Christ, the sincere
   being drawn to him, and the hypocrites being repelled from him. But at
   the judgment he shall shine forth as the perfect revealer of all
   thoughts and actions--Matt. x. 26.] 36 And there was one Anna [the same
   name as Hannah (I. Sam. i. 20 ), meaning "He was gracious"], a
   prophetess [like Miriam, Deborah, Huldah--II. Chron. xxxiv. 22], the
   daughter of Phanuel [the same as Peniel, meaning "Face of God"--Gen.
   xxxii. 30], of the tribe of Asher [Asher was the second son of Jacob
   and Zilpah (Gen. xxx. 12, 13). The name means "happy." Though the ten
   tribes were lost and scattered, many individuals belonging to them
   remained in Judah--Acts xxvi. 7; Jas. i. 1] (she was of a great age,
   having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 37 and she
   had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years) [She had been
   married seven years, and was now eight-four years old. Her long
   widowhood is mentioned, because young widows who did not remarry were
   held in especial honor. Anna was about twenty-four years old when
   Jerusalem was conquered by Pompey, and came under the power of Rome] ,
   who departed not from the temple [This may simply mean that she was
   unusually assiduous in her attendance at all the temple services (Acts
   ii. 46); or it may be taken literally, in which case we may suppose
   that her prophetic talents had secured for her the right of living in
   one of the temple chambers. Those who patiently frequent God's house
   will sooner or later obtain a blessing], worshipping with fastings.
   [Moses appointed one yearly fast, viz.: that on the day of Atonement;
   but the Pharisees introduced the custom of fasting twice a week to
   commemorate the days when Moses was supposed to have ascended and
   descended Mt. Sinai; viz.: on Monday and Thursday. They had also
   otherwise multiplied the fasts--Luke v. 33] and supplications night and
   day. [In Hebrew idiom night is mentioned before day, following the
   example of Moses (Gen. i. 5). The Hebrew theory that "God made the
   world in six days and seven nights," may have given birth to this
   idiom. For instances of this idiom, see Acts xxvi. 7; I. Tim. v. 5.
   There were probably night services of sacred music held in the temple,
   at which priests sung anthems--Ps. cxxxiv. 1, 2; cxix. 62.] 38 And
   coming up at that very hours she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him
   [Jesus] to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
   39 And when they [the parents of Jesus] had accomplished all things
   that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned. [Luke here
   adds the words "into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth." We have
   omitted these words from the text here, and carried them forward to
   [1]Section XV., where they rightfully belong. Luke omits to tell that
   Jesus returned to Nazareth by way of Bethlehem and Egypt. Such
   omissions are common in all biographies, and this one is paralleled by
   Luke himself in his life of Paul. Compare Acts ix. 19-26 with Gal. i.
   17, 18.]

Eastern Wise-Men, or Magi, Visit Jesus, the New-Born King.

(Jerusalem and Bethlehem, b.c. 4.)

^A Matt. II. 1-12.

   ^a 1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem [It lies five miles south by
   west of Jerusalem, a little to the east of the road to Hebron. It
   occupies part of the summit and sides of a narrow limestone ridge which
   shoots out eastward from the central chains of the Judæan mountains,
   and breaks down abruptly into deep valleys on the north, south, and
   east. Its old name, Ephrath, meant "the fruitful." Bethlehem means
   "house of bread." Its modern name, Beitlaham, means "house of meat." It
   was the home of Boaz and Ruth, of Jesse and David. The modern town
   contains about five hundred houses, occupied by Greek-church
   Christians. Over the rock-hewn cave which monks point out as the stable
   where Christ was born, there stands a church built by the Empress
   Helena, a.d. 325-327, which is the oldest monument to Christ known to
   men. Bethlehem was a suitable birthplace for a spiritual king; as
   suitable as Rome would have been a temporal king. We do not know when
   the town received its name, nor by whom the name was given, but as God
   had chosen it as the birthplace of Jesus for many centuries before the
   incarnation, he may have caused it to be named Bethlehem, or "house of
   bread," with prophetic reference to Him who is the "Bread of Life"] of
   Judæa [called thus to distinguish it from Bethlehem of Zebulon--Josh.
   xix. 15] in the days [it is difficult to determine the exact year of
   Christ's birth. Dionysus the Small, an abbot at Rome in a.d. 526,
   published an Easter cycle, in which he fixed the birth of Christ in the
   year 754 of the city of Rome (A. U. C.). This date has been followed
   ever since. But Jesus was born before the death of Herod, and Josephus
   and Dion Cassius fix the death of Herod in the year 750 A. U. C. Herod
   died that year, just before the Passover, and shortly after an eclipse
   of the moon, which took place on the night between the 12th and 13th of
   March. Jesus was born several months previous to the death of Herod,
   either toward the end of the year 749 A. U. C. (b.c. 5) or at the
   beginning of the year 750--b.c. 4] of Herod [This man was born at
   Ascalon, b.c. 71, and died at Jericho, a.d. 4. His father was an
   Edomite, and his mother an Ishmaelite. He was a man of fine executive
   ability and dauntless courage, but was full of suspicion and duplicity,
   and his reign was stained by acts of inhuman cruelty. He enlarged and
   beautified the temple at Jerusalem, and blessed his kingdom by many
   other important public works] the king [The life of Herod will be found
   in Josephus' Antiquities, Books 14-17. He was not an independent
   monarch, but a king subject to the Roman Empire.] behold, Wise-men
   [This word designates an order, or caste, of priests and philosophers
   (called magi), which existed in the countries east of the Euphrates,
   from a very remote period. We first find the word in Scripture at Jer.
   xxxix. 13, in the name rab-mag, which signifies chief magi. This class
   is frequently referred to in the Book of Daniel, where its members are
   called magicians, and it is probable that Daniel himself was a rab-mag
   (Dan. v. 11). The order is believed to have arisen among the Chaldeans
   and to have come down through the Assyrian, Medean and Persian
   kingdoms. The magi were, in many ways, the Levites of the East; they
   performed all public religious rites, claimed exclusive mediatorship
   between God and man, were the authority on all doctrinal points,
   constituted the supreme council of the realm, and had charge of the
   education of the royal family. The practiced divination, interpreted
   auguries and dreams, and professed to foretell the destinies of men.
   They were particularly famous for their skill in astronomy, and had
   kept a record of the more important celestial phenomena, which dated
   back several centuries prior to the reign of Alexander the Great. They
   were probably originally honest seekers after truth, but degenerated
   into mere imposters, as the Bible record shows (Acts viii. 9-11 and
   xiii. 8). Nothing is said as to the number who came nor as to the
   country whence they came. The number and quality of the gifts has
   become the foundation for a tradition that they were three kings from
   Arabia, and during the Middle Ages it was professed that their bodies
   were found and removed to the cathedral at Cologne. Their shrine is
   still shown there to credulous travelers, and their names are given as
   Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar] from the east [Probably from Persia,
   the chief seat of the Median religion. Jews dwelling in Persian
   provinces among the Parthians, Medes, and Elamites (Acts ii. 9) may
   have so prepared the minds of the magi as to set them looking for the
   star of Bethlehem. But in addition to the knowledge carried by captive
   Israelites, the men of the East had other light. The great Chinese
   sage, Confucius ( b.c. 551-479), foretold a coming Teacher in the West,
   and Zoroaster, the founder of the Persian religion, who is thought to
   have been a contemporary of Abraham, had predicted the coming of a
   great, supernaturally begotten Prophet. To these Balaam had added his
   prophecy (Num. xxiv. 17). Moreover, the Septuagint translation made at
   Alexandria about 280 b.c. had rendered the Old Testament Scriptures
   into Greek, the language of commerce, and had carried the knowledge of
   Hebrew prophecy into all lands, and had wakened a slight but world-wide
   expectation of a Messiah. The Roman writers, Suetonius (70-123, a.d.)
   and Tacitus (75-125, a.d.) bear witness to this expectation that a
   great world-ruling king would come out of Judæa. But all this put
   together can not account for the visit of the magi. They were guided
   directly by God, and nothing else may have even influenced them] came
   to Jerusalem [They naturally sought for the ruler of the state at the
   state's capital. They came to Jerusalem after Jesus had been presented
   in the temple, and taken back to Bethlehem, and, therefore, when the
   infant Jesus was more than forty days old. They must have come at least
   forty days before the death of Herod, for he spent the last forty days
   of his life at Jericho and the baths of Callirrhoe; but the wise men
   found him still at Jerusalem. Jesus must, therefore, have been at least
   eighty days old when Herod died], saying, 2 Where is he [They seem to
   have expected to find all Jerusalem knowing and worshiping this
   new-born King. Their disappointment is shared by many modern converts
   from heathendom who visit so-called Christian countries, and are filled
   with astonishment and sadness at the ignorance and unbelief which they
   discover] that is born King of the Jews? [These words were calculated
   to startle Herod, who was by birth neither king nor Jew. This title was
   accorded to Jesus by Pilate, who wrote it in his inscription, and
   caused it to be placed over the head of Christ upon the cross. None has
   borne the title since; so Jesus has stood before the world for nearly
   two thousand years as the last and only king of the Jews. The king of
   the Jews was the prophetically announced ruler of all men] for we saw
   [Those in the pagan darkness of the East rejoiced in the star. It was
   as a light that shineth in a dark place (II. Pet. i. 19). But those in
   Jerusalem appear not to have seen it, and certainly ignored it] his
   star [The great astronomer Kepler, ascertaining that there was a
   conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in 747 A. U. C., to which
   conjunction the planet Mars was also added in the year 748, suggested
   that this grouping of stars may have formed the so-called star of
   Bethlehem. But this theory is highly improbable; for these planets
   never appeared as one star, for they were never nearer to each other
   than double the apparent diameter of the moon. Moreover, the magi used
   the word "aster," star, not "astron," a group of stars. Again, the
   action of the star of Bethlehem forbids us to think that it was any one
   of the ordinary heavenly bodies. It was a specially prepared luminous
   orb moving toward Bethlehem as a guiding sign, and resting over the
   house of Joseph as an identifying index] in the east [the magi were in
   the east; the star was in the west], and are come [if the reign of
   Edomite Herod began to fulfill the first part of Jacob's prophecy by
   showing the departure of the scepter from Judah (Gen. xlix. 10), the
   coming of the Gentile magi began the fulfillment of the second part by
   becoming the firstfruits of the gathering of the people] to worship
   him. [Was their worship a religious service or a mere expression of
   reverence for an earthly king? More likely the former. If so, the
   boldness with which they declared their purpose to worship proved them
   worthy of the benediction of Him who afterwards said, "And blessed is
   he whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me."] 3 And when
   Herod the king had heard it [his evil heart, full of suspicions of all
   kinds, caused him to keep Jerusalem full of spies; so that knowledge of
   the magi soon reached his ears], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
   with him. [Herod was troubled because his succession to the throne was
   threatened, and Jerusalem was troubled because it dreaded a conflict
   between rival claimants for the throne. A short time before this,
   certain Pharisees had predicted that "God had decreed that Herod's
   government should cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it."
   In consequence, six thousand Pharisees had refused to take the oath of
   allegiance to Herod, and a great commotion had ensued (Josephus xvii.
   2, 4). Herod was determined to maintain his rule at any cost. To secure
   himself against the claims of the house of the Maccabees, he had slain
   five of its princes and princesses, including his favored wife
   Mariamne, thus extirpating that line of pretenders. Of course, prophecy
   predicted that Messiah should have the kingdom; but Herod's sinful
   heart hoped that these prophecies would not be fulfilled in his own
   time. Modern Herods know concerning Christ's second coming, but hope
   that it will be postponed till their own career is finished. Modern
   Jerusalemites prefer their Herods with peace to Messiah with
   revolution. Multitudes rest under the dominion of Satan, because they
   fear the revolutionary conflict and struggle necessary to enthrone the
   Christ in his stead. Christ is the peace of the righteous, the trouble
   of the wicked. Imperfect knowledge of him troubles, but perfect
   knowledge and love cast out fear--I. John iv. 18.] 4 And gathering
   together all the chief priests and scribes of the people [This is one
   of several expressions which designate the whole of or a portion of the
   Sanhedrin or Jewish court. This body consisted of seventy-one or
   seventy-two members, divided into three classes; namely, chief priest,
   scribes, or lawyers, and elders, or men of age and reputation among the
   people. The Sanhedrin was probably formed in imitation of the body of
   elders appointed to assist Moses ( Num. xi. 16). It is thought to have
   been instituted after the Babylonian captivity. As the scribes
   transcribed the Scriptures, they were familiar with their contents, and
   well skilled in their interpretation], he inquired of them [Herod shows
   that common but strange mixture of regard and contempt for the Word of
   God which makes men anxious to know its predictions, that they may form
   their plans to defeat him. The first inquirers for Jesus were
   shepherds, the second were wise men, the third was a king, the fourth
   were scribes and priests. He wakens inquiry among all classes; but each
   uses a different means of research. The shepherds are directed by
   angels; the wise men by a star; the scribes by Scriptures; the king by
   counselors] where the Christ [the fact that these foreigners came thus
   wondrously guided, coupled with the fact that the King they sought was
   one by birth (David's line having been so long apparently extinct), led
   Herod to the conclusion that this coming King could be none other than
   the Messiah] should be born. [Thus, by light from different sources,
   king and priests and people were informed of the fact that Messiah was
   newly born into the world, and the very time and place of his birth
   were brought to notice. God gave them the fact, and left them to make
   such use of it as they would.] 5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem
   [It was generally known that Christ should be born in Bethlehem (John
   vii. 42). The very body or court which officially announced the
   birthplace of Jesus subsequently condemned him to death as an imposter]
   of Judæa: for thus it is written. [The quotation which follows in the
   sixth verse is taken from Mic. v. 2-4, but is freely translated. The
   translation sets the words of Micah in the language of the times of
   Herod, and therefore resembles some of our modern attempts at Biblical
   revision. The use which the scribes made of this prophecy is very
   important, for it shows that the Jews originally regarded this passage
   of Scripture as fixing the birthplace of Messiah, and condemns as a
   fruit of bigotry and prejudice the modern effort of certain rabbis to
   explain away this natural interpretation] through the prophet, 6 And
   thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in no wise least among the princes
   of Judah: For out of thee shall come forth a governor, Who shall be
   shepherd of my people Israel. 7 Then Herod privily [Herod did not wish
   to give the infant claimant the honor and prestige of an open and
   avowed concern about him. Moreover, had he openly professed a desire to
   worship the new King, all Jerusalem would have been conscious of his
   hypocrisy, and some would have found it hard to keep silent] called the
   Wise-men, and learned of them [Though Herod sought Christ from improper
   motives, yet he used the best methods. He asked aid of those versed in
   the Scriptures, and also of those proficient in science] exactly what
   time the star appeared. [That he might ascertain, if possible, exactly
   on what night Christ had been born.] 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem
   [thus answering their question asked in verse 2], and said, Go and
   search out excatly concerning the young child; and when ye have found
   him, bring me word that I also may come and worship him. [His meaning
   was, That I may come with my Judas kiss to betray and to destroy.
   Duplicity was a well-known characteristic of Herod. He had Aristobulus,
   the high priest, drowned by his companions while bathing, though they
   seemed to be only ducking him in sport. In this case Herod concealed
   fraud beneath an appearance of piety. Religion is one of the favorite
   masks of the devil (II. Cor. xi. 13-15). It is as hard for the
   ambitious to avoid hypocrisy as it is for the rich to shun avarice.] 9
   And they, having heard the king, went their way [No scribes were with
   them. The scribes were content with the theory as to the place of
   Christ's birth, but desired no practical knowledge of the Babe
   himself]; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before
   them [guiding them], till it came and stood [thus stopping them] over
   where the young child was. [A real or ordinary star would have stood
   indiscriminately over every house in Bethlehem, and would have been no
   aid whatever toward finding the right child. For planets to stand over
   any place, they must be in the zenith and have an altitude of ninety
   degrees. This star, therefore, could not have been a conjunction of
   planets, for their altitude at Bethlehem is fifty-seven degrees, and
   seen that this angle they would have led the magi on down into Africa.
   The magi were undoubtedly favored with a special revelation as to the
   Babe and the star. It was probably given in a dream similar to that
   spoken of in verse 12. The star, as one of the temporary incidentals of
   Christianity, faded away; but the Sun of righteousness which took its
   place in the spiritual firmament shines on, and shall shine on
   forever.] 10 And when they saw the star, they rejoiced [a comfort
   restored is a comfort multiplied] with exceeding great joy. [The return
   of the star assured them that God would lead them safely and surely to
   the object of their desires. Their joy was such as comes to those who
   come from seasons of dark doubt to the glories of light and faith. The
   star enabled them to find Jesus without asking questions, and bringing
   such public attention to him as would aid Herod in preventing his
   escape. Since the magi were guided by a star, they were forced to enter
   Bethlehem by night, and this contributed to the privacy of their coming
   and the safety of Jesus.] 11 And they came into the house [the humble
   home of the carpenter might have shook their faith in the royalty of
   the son, but the miraculous honors accorded him in the star and the
   Scripture raised him in their estimation above all the humiliation of
   external circumstances], and saw the young child with Mary his mother
   [she was the only attendant in this King's retinue--the retinue of him
   who became poor that we, out of his poverty, might be made rich]; and
   they fell down [The usual Oriental method of showing either reverence
   or worship] and worshipped him [It is safe to think that the manner in
   which they had been led to Jesus caused them to worship him as divine.
   Their long journey and their exuberant joy at its success indicate that
   they sought more than the great king of a foreign nation. The God who
   led them by a star, would hardly deny them full knowledge as to the
   object of their quest. Had their worship been mere reverence, Mary
   would, no doubt, have been included in it. We should note their faith.
   They had known Christ but one day; he had performed no miracles; he had
   none other to do him homage; he was but a helpless Babe, yet they fell
   down and worshiped him. Their faith is told for a memorial of them.
   They worshiped him not as one who must win his honors; but as one
   already invested with them. When we come to Christ, let us come to
   worship, not to patronize, not to employ him for sectarian uses, not to
   use him as an axiom on which to base some vapid theological
   speculation]; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts
   [Oriental custom requires that an inferior shall approach his superior
   with a gift. These gifts probably contributed to the sustenance of the
   parents and the child while in Egypt] , gold and frankincense [A white
   resin or gum obtained by slitting the bark of the Arbor thuris. The
   best is said to come from Persia. It is also a product of Arabia. It is
   very fragrant when burned] and myrrh. [It is also obtained from a tree
   in the same manner as frankincense. The tree is similar to the acacia.
   It grows from eight to ten feet high, and is thorny. It is found in
   Egypt, Arabia, and Abyssinia. Myrrh means bitterness. The gum was
   chiefly used in embalming dead bodies, as it prevented putrefaction. It
   was also used in ointments, and for perfume; and as an anodyne it was
   sometimes added to wine.] 12 And being warned of God in a dream [this
   suggests that as they came by night, so they were aroused and caused to
   depart by night, that their coming and going might, in no way, betray
   the whereabouts of the infant King] that they should not return to
   Herod, they departed into their own country another way. [They took the
   road from Bethlehem to Jericho, and thus passed eastward without
   returning to Jerusalem.]

Flight into Egypt and Slaughter of the Bethlehem Children.

(Bethlehem and Road Thence to Egypt, b.c. 4.)

^A Matt. II. 13-18.

   ^a 13 Now when they were departed [The text favors the idea that the
   arrival and departure of the magi and the departure of Joseph for
   Egypt, all occurred in one night. If so, the people of Bethlehem knew
   nothing of these matters], behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to
   Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise [this command calls for immediate
   departure] and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt
   [This land was ever the refuge of Israel when fleeing from famine and
   oppression. One hundred miles in a direct line from Bethlehem would
   carry Joseph well over the border of Egypt. Two hundred miles would
   bring him to the river Nile. In Egypt he would find friends, possibly
   acquaintances. There were at that time about one million Jews in the
   Nile valley. In Alexandria, a city of 300,000, from one-fifth to
   two-fifths of the population were Jews, two of the five wards being
   given over to them; and the Talmud describes how, in its great
   synagogue, all the men of like craft or trade sat together. Thus Joseph
   might there find fellow-craftsmen, as did Paul in Corinth--Acts xviii.
   3], and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young
   child to destroy him. [Thus joy at the honor of the magi's visit and
   worship gives place to terror at the wrath of Herod. The quiet days at
   Bethlehem are followed by a night of fear and flight. The parents of
   Jesus were experiencing those conflicting joys and sorrows which
   characterize the lives of all who have to do with Christ-- Mark x. 30;
   II. Tim. iii. 12.] 14 And he arose and took the young child and his
   mother by night, and departed into Egypt [What a criticism upon Israel
   when Egypt, the house of bondage, the seat of tyranny, the land of the
   immemorial enemies of God's people, was regarded as a place of refuge
   from its ruler. Jesus was saved by flight. God invariably prefers the
   ordinary to the extraordinary means]; 15 and was there until the death
   of Herod [as Herod died soon after the flight to Egypt, the sojourn of
   the family of Jesus in that land must have been brief, for they
   returned after his death]: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
   by the Lord [the message is the Lord's, the words and voice are the
   prophet's] through the prophet [see Hos. xi. 1], saying, Out of Egypt
   did I call my son. [This prophecy, no doubt, had a primary reference to
   the Exodus, and was an echo of the words of Moses at Ex. iv. 22, 23. In
   their type and antitype relationship the Old and New Testaments may be
   likened to the shell and kernel of a nut. Israel was Israel, and God's
   Son, because it included in itself the yet unformed and unborn body
   which was later to be inhabited by the spirit of the Word or Son of
   God. The seed of Abraham was called out of Egypt, that the promised
   seed enveloped within it might have a body and nature prepared in the
   land of liberty, and not in that of bondage. Israel was the outer
   shell, and Christ the kernel, hence the double significance of the
   prophecy--the twice repeated movement of the nation and the Man.] 16
   Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked [the magi, no doubt,
   intended to return to Herod, and would have done so but for the dream,
   but when they failed to return, they seemed to Herod to have taken
   pleasure in deceiving him, and the very honesty of their conduct passed
   for the lowest depth of cunning] of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth
   [wroth at being made sport of, and doubly wroth because of the serious
   matter as to which they presumed to jest], and sent forth [murderers,
   suddenly], and slew [Thus early did persecution attend those associated
   with Christ (Matt. x. 24, 25 ). This brutality was in keeping with
   Herod's character. Jealousy as to his authority led him to murder two
   high priests, his uncle Joseph, his wife, and three of his own sons,
   besides many other innocent persons. Fearing lest the people should
   rejoice at his departure, he summoned the leading citizens of all the
   cities of his realm, and, shutting them up in the circus grounds at
   Jericho, ordered his sister Salome and her husband to have them all put
   to death at the moment when he died, that the land might mourn at his
   death] all the male children that were in Bethlehem [As Bethlehem was
   not a large place, the number of martyrs could not have been large. It
   is variously estimated that from twelve to fifty were slain. Had the
   parents of Bethlehem known that Jesus was on the way to Egypt, they
   might have saved their own children by giving information as to the
   whereabouts of the right child; that is, if we may assume that they
   were being butchered], and in all the borders [Adjacent places;
   settlements or houses around Bethlehem. The present population of the
   town is fully five thousand; it was probably even larger in Christ's
   time] thereof, from two years old and under [According to Jewish
   reckoning this would mean all children from birth up to between twelve
   and thirteen months old, all past one year old being counted as two
   years old], according to the time which he had exactly learned of the
   Wise-men. [That is, he used their date as a basis for his calculations.
   It is likely that six months had elapsed since the star appeared, and
   that Herod doubled the months to make doubly sure of destroying the
   rival claimant. Not knowing whether the child was born before or after
   the appearing of the star, he included all the children of that full
   year in which the star came.] 17 Then was fulfilled [Verses 6, 15, and
   18 give us three different kinds of prophecy. The first is direct, and
   relates wholly to an event which was yet future; the second is a case
   where an act described is symbolic of another later and larger act; the
   last is a case where words describing one act may be taken as fitly and
   vividly describing another later act, though the acts themselves may
   bear small resemblance. Matthew does not mean that Jeremiah predicted
   the slaughter at Bethlehem; but that his words, though spoken as to
   another occasion, were so chosen of the Spirit that they might be fitly
   applied to this latter occasion] that which was spoken through Jeremiah
   the prophet [Jer. xxxi. 15], saying, 18 A voice was heard in Ramah
   [This word means "highland" or "hill." The town lies six miles north of
   Jerusalem. It was the birthplace and burial-place of the prophet
   Samuel. It is also supposed to be the Aramathea of the New Testament.
   See Matt. xxvii. 57], Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
   her children [Why these tearful mothers in Bethlehem? Because that
   which Christ escaped remained for his brethren, their children, to
   suffer. If he would escape death, all his brethren must die. But he
   died that all his brethren might live]; And she would not be comforted,
   because they are not. [The words here quoted were originally written
   concerning the Babylonian captivity (Jer. xxxi. 15). Ramah was a town
   of Benjamin (Josh. xviii. 25). Jeremiah was carried thither in chains
   with the other captives, but was there released by the order of
   Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. xl. 1; xxxix. 11, 12). Here he saw the captives
   depart for Babylon, and heard the weeping of the poor who were left in
   the land (xxxix. 10); hence the mention of Ramah as the place of
   lamentation. He represents Rachel weeping, because the Benjamites were
   descendants of Rachel, and, perhaps, because the tomb of Rachel was "in
   the border of Benjamin," and not far away (I. Sam. x. 2). The image of
   the ancient mother of the tribe, rising from her tomb to weep, and
   refusing to be comforted because her children were not around her, is
   inimitably beautiful; and this image so strikingly portrayed the
   weeping in Bethlehem that Matthew adopts the words of the prophet, and
   says that they were here fulfilled. It was the fulfillment, not of a
   prediction, properly speaking, but of certain words spoken by the
   prophet.]

The Child Jesus Brought from Egypt to Nazareth.

(Egypt and Nazareth, b.c. 4.)

^A Matt. II. 19-23; ^C Luke II. 39.

   ^a 19 But when Herod was dead [He died in the thirty-seventh year of
   his reign and the seventieth of his life. A frightful inward burning
   consumed him, and the stench of his sickness was such that his
   attendants could not stay near him. So horrible was his condition that
   he even endeavored to end it by suicide], behold, an angel of the Lord
   [word did not come by the infant Jesus; he was "made like unto his
   brethren" (Heb. ii. 17), and being a child, "he spake as a child" ( I.
   Cor. xiii. 11), and not as an oracle] appeareth in a dream to Joseph in
   Egypt [Joseph had obeyed the command given at verse 13, and God kept
   the promise contained therein. God ever keeps covenant with the
   obedient], saying, 20 Arise [Happy Joseph! his path was ordered of God.
   Let us also seek such ordering. "in all thy ways acknowledge him, And
   he will direct thy paths--Prov. iii. 6] and take the young child and
   his mother, and go into the land of Israel [The phrase "land of Israel"
   originally meant all Palestine, but during the period of the kingdom of
   the ten tribes it was restricted to their portion of the country. After
   the captivities and the return of Judah from Babylon the phrase resumed
   its original meaning, and hence it is here used to include all
   Palestine. As Jesus was "not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel" (Matt. xv. 24), it was fitting that he return thither from
   Egypt]; for they ["They" is doubtless the plural of majesty; though it
   may include others unknown to us, who were employed by him or advised
   him] are dead [How prophetic the words! Christ's enemies die, but he
   lives on. How innumerable this host of opposers! Persecutors,
   oppressors, infidels, critics, literatures, organizations,
   principalities, and powers, a vast and motley array of forces, have
   sought the life of Jesus, have made a great noise in the world, and
   died away in silence. Pharoahs, Neros, Diocletians, many a Charles,
   Torquemada and Bloody Mary have come up and gone down, but the king of
   Israel lives on] that sought the young child's life. 21 And he arose
   and took the young child and his mother, and came [The length of his
   sojourn in Egypt is uncertain. It is variously estimated at from two
   weeks to more than seven months] into the land of Israel. 22 But when
   he heard [Joseph heard this on entering Palestine. As he knew of
   Herod's death by revelation, and hence before any one else in Egypt,
   there was no one there to tell him who succeeded Herod] that Archelaus
   [By his last will and testament Herod divided his kingdom among three
   of his sons, and Augustus Cæsar consented to the provision of this
   will. Archelaus, under the title of Ethnarch, received Judæa, Idumæa,
   and Samaria; Antipas, under the title of Tetrarch, received Galilee and
   Peræa; and Philip, under the title of Tetrarch, received Trachonitis
   (with Ituræa), Batanæa, and Auranitis. Each of these sons bore the name
   of Herod, like their father. Augustus withheld from Archelaus the title
   of king, promising it to him "if he governed that part virtuously." But
   in the very beginning of his reign he massacred three thousand Jews at
   once, in the temple, at the time of the Passover, because they called
   for justice upon the agents who performed the barbarities of his
   father's reign. Not long after this a solemn embassy of the Jews went
   to Rome, and petitioned Augustus to remove Archelaus, and make his
   kingdom a Roman province. After a reign of nine years, Archelaus was
   banished to Vienne, in Gaul, where he died in a.d. 6. After him Judæa
   had no more native kings, and the scepter was clean departed from
   Judah. The land became a Roman province, and its governors were
   successively Quirinius, Coponius, Ambivius, Annius Rufus, Valerius
   Gratus, and Pontius Pilate] was reigning over Judæa in the room of his
   father Herod [These words sound like an echo of those employed by the
   embassy just referred to, for it said to Augustus concerning this man,
   "He seemed to be so afraid lest he should not be deemed Herod's own
   son, that he took special care to prove it"], he was afraid to go
   thither [As Matthew has spoken of Joseph residing at Bethlehem (and he
   did reside there for quite awhile after the birth of Jesus), the use of
   word "thither" implies that Joseph planned to return to that town. Mary
   had kindred somewhere in the neighborhood (Luke i. 36, 39, 40), and
   doubtless both parents thought that David's city was the most fitting
   place for the nurture of David's heir]; and being warned of God in a
   dream [God permitted Joseph to follow the bent of his fear. Joseph's
   obedience shows him a fit person for the momentous charge entrusted to
   him], { ^c they returned} ^a he withdrew [From the territory of
   Archelaus to that of Antipas, who was a man of much milder disposition.
   As the brothers were on no good terms, Joseph felt sure that in no case
   would Antipas deliver him and his to Archelaus] into the parts of
   Galilee [It means "circuit." It is the northern of the three divisions
   of the Holy Land. Its population was very dense, and was a mixture of
   Jews and Gentiles. Hence all Galilæans were despised by the purer Jews
   of Judæa] , 23 and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; ^c
   their own city [This town lies on a hillside, girt in by fifteen higher
   hills. It is a secluded nook. Here Jesus grew up in obscurity till he
   reached his thirtieth year. Here he spent about nine-tenths of his
   earthly life. Sweet humility! Lowliness is as rare and precious a
   virtue as pride is a plentiful and repugnant vice] ^a that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets [Matthew uses the
   plural, "prophets," because this prophecy is not the actual words of
   any prophet, but is the general sense of many of them. We have noted
   three kinds of prophecy; this is the fourth kind, viz.: one where the
   very trend or general scope of Scripture is itself a prophecy], that he
   should be called a Nazarene. [The Hebrew word netzer means "branch" or
   "sprout." It is used figuratively for that which is lowly or despised
   (Isa. xvii. 9; Ezek. xv. 1-6; Mal. iv. 1). See also John xv. 6; Rom.
   xi. 21. Now, Nazareth, if derived from netzer, answered to its name,
   and was a despised place ( John i. 45, 46), and Jesus, though in truth
   a Bethlehemite, bore the name Nazarene because it fitly expressed the
   contempt of those who despised and rejected him.]

Jesus Living at Nazareth and Visiting Jerusalem in His Twelfth Year.

(Nazareth and Jerusalem, a.d. 7 or 8.)

^C Luke II. 40-52.

   ^c 40 And the child grew [This verse contains the history of thirty
   years. It describes the growth of our Lord as a natural, human growth
   (compare Luke i. 80); for, though Jesus was truly divine, he was also
   perfectly man. To try to distinguish between the divine and human in
   Jesus, is to waste time upon an impracticable mystery which is too
   subtle for our dull and finite minds], and waxed strong [His life
   expanded like other human lives. He learned as other boys; he obeyed as
   other children. As he used means and waited patiently for growth, so
   must each individual Christian, and so must the church. Though the
   latter is a mystical body, and animated by the Holy Spirit, it must
   nevertheless make increase of itself before coming to the perfect
   man--Eph. iv. 16], filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon
   him [These words describe briefly the life of Christ during the
   preparatory period at Nazareth. It was a quiet life, but its sinless
   purity made the Baptist feel his own unworthiness compared to it (Matt.
   iii. 14), and its sweet reasonableness inspired in Mary, the mother,
   that confidence which led her to sanction, without reserve, any request
   or command which Jesus might utter--John ii. 5.] 41 And his parents
   [Males were required to attend the Passover (Ex. xiii. 7); but women
   were not. The great rabbi, Hillel (born about b.c. 110; died a.d. 10),
   recommended that they should do so, and the practice was esteemed an
   act of admirable piety] went every year to Jerusalem [regular
   attendance upon worship is likewise enjoined upon us--Heb. x. 25] to
   Jerusalem at the feast of the passover [The Passover, one of the three
   great Jewish feasts, commemorated the mercy of God in causing his angel
   to "pass over" the houses in Israel on the night that he slew all the
   firstborn of Egypt. It took place at the full moon which occurred next
   after the vernal equinox. At it the firstfruits of the harvest were
   offered (Lev. xxiii. 10-15). The second feast, Pentecost, occurred
   fifty days later, and commemorated the giving of the law. At it the
   firstfruits of the wheat harvest, in the form of bread (Lev. xxiii.
   17), were offered. The third feast, or Tabernacles, occurred near the
   end of September, or beginning of October, and commemorated the days
   when Israel dwelt in tents in the wilderness. It was observed as a
   thanksgiving for the blessings of the year. Every adult male Jews
   dwelling in Judæa was required to attend these three feasts. Josephus
   tells us that the members assembled at them in Jerusalem often exceeded
   two millions.] 42 And when he was twelve years old [The incident which
   Luke here reports is the only one given in the period between the
   return from Egypt and Jesus' thirtieth year. It shows that Jesus did
   not attend the school of the rabbis in Jerusalem (Mark vi. 2; John vi.
   42; vii. 15). But we learn that he could write (John viii. 6), and
   there is little doubt but that he spoke both Hebrew and Greek], they
   went up [the altitude of Jerusalem is higher than that of Nazareth, and
   the distance between the two places is about seventy miles] after the
   custom of the feast [the custom was that the feast was celebrated
   annually in Jerusalem]; 43 and when they had fulfilled the days [eight
   days in all; one day for killing the passover, and seven for observing
   the feast of unleavened bread which followed it--Ex. xii. 15; Lev.
   xxiii. 5, 6], as they were returning, the boy Jesus [Luke narrates
   something about every stage of Christ's life. He speaks of him as a
   babe (ii. 16), as a little child (ii. 40), here as a boy, and
   afterwards as a man] tarried behind in Jerusalem [to take advantage of
   the opportunity to hear the great teachers in the schools]; and his
   parents knew it not [As vast crowds attended the Passover, it was easy
   to lose sight of a boy amid the festal throng. Indeed, the incident is
   often repeated even to this day during the feast seasons at Jerusalem];
   44 but supposing him to be in the company [We see here the confidence
   of the parents, and the independence of the child. The sinlessness of
   Jesus was not due to any exceptional care on the part of his parents.
   Jews going to and from their festivals traveled in caravans for
   pleasure and safety. In the daytime the young folks mingled freely
   among the travelers, and sought out whatever companionship they wished.
   But in the evening, when the camp was formed, and the tents were
   pitched, the members of each family came together] , they went a day's
   journey [They probably returned by the way of Jericho to avoid passing
   through Samaria, because of the hatred existing between Jews and
   Samaritans. In more moderns times the first day's journey is a short
   one, and it was probably so then. It was made so in order that the
   travelers might return to the city whence they had departed, should
   they discover that they had forgotten anything--should they find that
   they had forgotten a sack of meal, a blanket, or a child]; and they
   sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance [those with whom
   he was most likely to have traveled during the day]: 45 and when they
   found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. [Parents
   who have temporarily suffered the loss of their children can easily
   imagine their feelings. Christ, though a divine gift to them, was lost.
   So may we also lose him, though he be God's gift to us.] 46 And it came
   to pass, after three days [Each part of a day was reckoned as a day
   when at the beginning and ending of a series. The parents missed Jesus
   on the evening of the first day, returned to Jerusalem and sought for
   him on the second day, and probably found him on the morning of the
   third day. The disciples of Jesus also lost him in the grave for part
   of one day, and all of the next, and found him resurrected on the
   morning of the third day--Luke xxiv. 21] they found him in the temple
   [Probably in one of the many chambers which tradition says were built
   against the walls of the temple and its enclosures, and opened upon the
   temple courts. The sacred secret which they knew concerning the child
   should have sent them at once to the temple to seek for him]; sitting
   [Jewish scholars sat upon the ground at the feet of their teachers] in
   the midst [the teachers sat on semi-circular benches and thus partially
   surrounded by their scholars] of the teachers [these teachers had
   schools in which they taught for the fees of their pupils, and are not
   to be confounded with the scribes, who were mere copyists], both
   hearing them, and asking them questions [He was not teaching: the God
   of order does not expect childhood to teach. He was among them as a
   modest scholar, and not as a forward child. The rabbinical method of
   instruction was to state cases, or problems, bearing upon the
   interpretation or application of the law, which cases or problems were
   to be solved by the pupils. For typical problems see Matt. xxii.
   15-46]: 47 and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
   and answers. 48 And when they [his parents] saw him, they were
   astonished [Mary and Joseph stood as much in awe of these renowned
   national teachers as peasants do of kings, and were therefore
   astonished that their youthful son presumed to speak to them]; and his
   mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? [Her
   language implies that Jesus had been fully instructed as to the time
   when his parents and their caravan would depart for Galilee, and that
   he was expected to depart with them. Obedience to his higher duties
   constrained him to appear disobedient to his parents] behold, thy
   father [As legal father of Jesus, this expression would necessarily
   have to be used when speaking of Joseph. But Jesus does not accept
   Joseph as his father, as we see by his answer] and I sought thee
   sorrowing. [Because they thought him lost.] 49 And he said unto them
   [What follows are the first recorded words of Jesus; he here speaks of
   the same being--the Father--to whom he commended his spirit in his last
   words upon the cross (Luke xxiii. 46). His last recorded words on earth
   are found at Acts i. 7, 8; his last recorded words in heaven are found
   in Rev. xxii. 10-20, but these last words are spoken through the medium
   of an angel], How is it that ye sought me? [Mary, knowing all that had
   been divinely revealed to her concerning Jesus, should have expected to
   find him in the temple] knew ye not that I must [In this oft-repeated
   phrase, "I must," Jesus sets forth that devotion (John iv. 34) to the
   will of the Father by which his whole life was directed] be in my
   Father's [Literally "the Father of me." Jesus invariably used the
   article in speaking of himself, and said "the Father of me," and
   invariably omitted the article, and said, "Father of you," when
   speaking of his disciples. His relationship to the Father differed from
   ours, and God, not Joseph, was his father] house? [See John ii. 16, 17;
   viii. 35.] 50 And they understood not [It may seem strange that Mary,
   knowing all that she did concerning the birth of Jesus, etc., did not
   grasp the meaning of his words, but we are all slow to grasp great
   truths; and failure to be understood was therefore a matter of daily
   occurrence with Jesus. (Luke ix. 45; xviii. 34; Mark ix. 32; John x.
   6.) Christ spoke plainly, but human ears were slow to comprehend his
   wonderful sayings. We need to be watchful lest our ears be censured for
   a like slowness] the saying which he spake unto them. 51 And he went
   down with them [Jerusalem was among the mountains, Nazareth among the
   hills], and came to Nazareth [A beautiful and healthful town, but so
   lacking in piety and learning as to form the "dry ground" out of which
   it was prophetically predicted that the glorious and fruitful life of
   Jesus would spring. Here Christ rose above all times and schools and
   revealed to man that "life more abundant" than all kings, lawgivers or
   sages ever discovered. His character, like the New Jerusalem, descended
   from God out of heaven, and no education obtained in Nazareth will
   explain it. The struggle of self-made men with their early environment
   is noticeable to the last, but it is not so with him. The discourses of
   Jesus are the outpourings of divine knowledge, and not the result of
   study or self-culture]; and he was subject [Our example in all things,
   he here set before us that pattern of obedience which children should
   observe toward their parents. In these years Jesus learned the trade of
   his supposed father (Mark vi. 3). Christ was a laborer, and thereby
   sanctified labor, and showed that dignity and glory belong to inward
   and not to outward conditions] unto them [His parents, Joseph and Mary.
   We find no mention of Joseph after this, and the probability is that he
   soon died]: and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. [She
   had many treasured sayings of angels, shepherds, wise men, and
   prophets. She now began to add to these the sayings of Christ himself.]
   52 And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and
   men. [He did not literally grow in favor with God. This is a phenomenal
   expression. The favor of God and man kept company for quite awhile; but
   the favor of God abode with Jesus when man's good will was utterly
   withdrawn. Men admire holiness until it becomes aggressive, and then
   they feel an antagonism against it as great, or intense, as their
   previous admiration.]

John the Baptist's Person and Preaching.

(in the Wilderness of Judæa, and on the Banks of the Jordan,

Occupying Several Months, Probably a.d. 25 or 26.)

^A Matt. III. 1-12; ^B Mark I. 1-8; ^C Luke III. 1-18.

   ^b 1 The beginning of the gospel [John begins his Gospel from eternity,
   where the Word is found coexistent with God. Matthew begins with Jesus,
   the humanly generated son of Abraham and David, born in the days of
   Herod the king. Luke begins with the birth of John the Baptist, the
   Messiah's herald; and Mark begins with the ministry of John the
   Baptist. While the three other evangelists take a brief survey of the
   preparation of the gospel, Mark looks particularly to the period when
   it began to be preached. Gospel means good news, and news is not news
   until it is proclaimed. The gospel began to be preached or proclaimed
   with the ministry of John the Baptist (Luke xvi. 16). His ministry was
   the dawn of that gospel of which Christ's preaching was the sunrise] of
   Jesus [Our Lord's name as a human being; it means "Saviour"] Christ
   [Though this is also sometimes used as a name, it is in reality our
   Lord's title. It means "the Anointed," and is equivalent to saying that
   Jesus is our Prophet, Priest and King] the Son of God. [This indicates
   our Lord's eternal nature; it was divine. Mark's gospel was written to
   establish that fact, which is the foundation of the church (Matt. xvi.
   18). John's Gospel was written for a like purpose (John xx. 31). John
   uses the phrase "Son of God" twenty-nine times, and Mark seven times.
   As these two evangelists wrote chiefly for Gentile readers, they
   emphasized the divinity of Jesus, and paid less attention to his Jewish
   ancestry. But Matthew, writing for Hebrews, prefers the title "Son of
   David," which he applies to Jesus some nine times, that he may identify
   him as the Messiah promised in the seed of David--II. Sam. vii. 12; Ps.
   lxxii. 1-17; lxxxix. 3, 4; cxxxii. 11, 12.] ^c 1 Now in the fifteenth
   year of the reign [Tiberius Cæsar, stepson of and successor to
   Augustus, began to reign as joint ruler with Augustus in August, A. U.
   C. 765 (a.d. 11). On Aug. 19, 767, Augustus died and Tiberius became
   sole ruler. Luke counts from the beginning of the joint rule, and his
   fifteen years bring us to 779. In August, 779, Tiberius began his
   fifteenth year, and about December of that year Jesus would have
   completed his thirtieth year] of Tiberius Cæsar [He was born b.c. 41,
   died March 16, a.d. 37. As a citizen he distinguished himself as
   orator, soldier and public official. But as emperor he was slothful,
   self-indulgent, indescribably licentious, vindictive and cruel. He was
   a master of dissimulation and cunning, and was a veritable scourge to
   his people. But he still found flatterers even in Palestine, Cæsarea
   Philippi, and the town Tiberias being named for him], Pontius Pilate
   [see mention of him in account of our Lord's trial] being governor of
   Judæa [The province of Judæa was subdued by Pompey and brought under
   Roman control in b.c. 63. Its history from that date till the
   governorship of Pilate can be found in Josephus], and Herod [Also
   called Antipas. The ruler who murdered John the Baptist and who
   assisted at the trial of Jesus] being tetrarch [this word means
   properly the ruler of a fourth part of a country, but was used loosely
   for any petty tributary prince] of Galilee [This province lay north of
   Samaria, and measured about twenty-five miles from north to south, and
   twenty-seven miles from east to west. It was a rich and fertile
   country], and his brother [half-brother] Philip [He was distinguished
   by justice and moderation, the one decent man in the Herodian family.
   He married Salome, who obtained John the Baptist's head for a dance. He
   built Cæsarea Philippi, and transformed Bethsaida Julius from a village
   to a city, and died there a.d. 44. After his death his domains became
   part of the Roman province of Syria] tetrarch of the region of Ituræa
   [A district thirty miles long by twenty-five broad, lying north of
   Batanæa, east of Mt. Hermon, west of Trachonitis. It received its name
   from Jetur, son of Ishmael (Gen. xxv. 15). Its Ishmaelite inhabitants
   were conquered by Aristobulus, king of Judæa, b.c. 100, and forced by
   him to accept the Jewish faith. They were marauders, and famous for the
   use of the bow] and Trachonitis [A district about twenty-two miles from
   north to south by fourteen from east to west. Its name means "rough" or
   "stony," and it amply deserves it. It lies between Ituræa and the
   desert, and has been infested with robbers from the earliest ages. It
   is called the Argob in the Old Testament, "an ocean of basaltic rock
   and boulders, tossed about in the wildest confusion, and intermingled
   with fissures and crevices in every direction"], and Lysanias [Profane
   history gives us no account of this man. It tells of a Lysanias, king
   of Chalcis, under Mt. Lebanon, who was put to death by Mark Antony,
   b.c. 36, or sixty-odd years before this, and another who was tetrarch
   of Abilene in the reigns of Caligula and Claudius twenty years after
   this. He probably was son of the first and father of the second]
   tetrarch of Abilene [The city of Abila (which comes from the Hebrew
   word "abel," meaning "meadow") is eighteen miles from Damascus and
   thirty-eight from Baalbec. The province laying about it is mentioned
   because it subsequently formed part of the Jewish territory, being
   given to Herod Agrippa I. by Emperor Claudius about a.d. 41], 2; in the
   high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas [Annas had been high priest 7-14
   a.d., when he was deposed by the procurator, Gratus. Caiaphas was
   son-in-law of and successor to Annas. Luke gives both names, one as the
   rightful and the other as the acting high priest. Compare Acts iv. 6.
   Gentile innovations had made sad havoc with the Jewish law as to this
   office. In the last one hundred and seven years of the temple's
   existence there were no less than twenty-eight high priests. Luke is
   the only one who fixes the time when Jesus began his ministry. He
   locates it by emperor and governor, tetrarch and high priest, as an
   event of world-wide importance, and of concern to all the kingdoms of
   men. He conceives of it as Paul did--Acts xxvi. 26], the word of God
   [The divine commission which bade John enter his career as a prophet
   (Jer. i. 2; Ezek. vi. 1). Prophets gave temporary and limited
   manifestations of God's will (Heb. i. 1, 2). Jesus is the everlasting
   and unlimited manifestation of the divine purpose and of the very
   Godhead--John xiv. 9; xii. 45; Col. i. 15; Heb. i. 3; II. Cor. iv. 6]
   came unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. [The wilderness
   of Judæa is that almost uninhabitable mass of barren ridges extending
   the whole length of the Dead Sea, and a few miles further north. It is
   from five to ten miles wide.] ^a 1 And in those days [Some take this
   expression as referring to the years when Jesus dwelt at Nazareth. But
   it is better to regard it as a Hebraism equivalent to "that age" or
   "that era" (Ex. ii. 11). It contrasts the era when the Baptist lived
   with the era when Matthew wrote his Gospel, just as we say "in these
   days of enlightenment" when we wish to contrast the present time with
   the days of the American Revolution] cometh John [he was cousin to
   Jesus] the Baptist [So called because God first gave through him the
   ordinance of baptism. It has been erroneously thought by some that John
   borrowed this ordinance from the Jewish practice of proselyte baptism.
   This could not be, for John baptized his converts, but Jewish
   proselytes baptized themselves. The law required such self-baptism of
   all persons who were unclean (Lev. xiv. 9; Num. xix. 19; viii. 7; Lev.
   xv., xvi .). More than twenty distinct cases are specified in which the
   law required bathing or self-baptism, and it is to these Paul refers
   when he states that the law consisted in part "of divers baptisms"
   (Heb. ix. 10). But the law did not require this of proselytes, and
   proselyte baptism was a human appendage to the divinely given Jewish
   ritual, just as infant baptism is to the true Christian ritual.
   Proselyte baptism is not mentioned in history till the third century of
   the Christian era. Neither Josephus, nor Philo, nor the Apocrypha, nor
   the Targums say anything about it, though they all mention proselytes.
   In fact, the oldest mention of it in Jewish writings is in the
   Babylonian Gemara, which was completed about five hundred years years
   after Christ. The New Testament implies the non-existence of proselyte
   baptism ( Matt. xxi. 25; John i. 25, 33). John could hardly have been
   called the Baptist, had he used an old-time rite in the accustomed
   manner. The Baptist was a link between the Old and New Testament.
   Belonging to the Old, he announced the New], preaching [Not
   sermonizing, but crying out a message as a king's herald making a
   proclamation, or a policeman crying "Fire!" in a slumbering town. His
   discourse was brief and unembellished. Its force lay in the importance
   of the truth announced. It promised to the Hebrew the fulfillment of
   two thousand years of longing. It demanded repentance, but for a new
   reason. The old call to repentance had wooed with the promise of
   earthly blessings, and warned with the threat of earthly judgments; but
   John's repentance had to do with the kingdom of heaven and things
   eternal. It suggested the Holy Spirit as a reward, and unquenchable
   fire as the punishment] in the wilderness of Judæa [that part of the
   wilderness which John chose for the scene of his ministry is a desert
   plain, lying along the western bank of the Jordan, between Jericho and
   the Dead Sea] , saying, 2 Repent ye [to repent is to change the will in
   reference to sin, resolving to sin no more] for [John sets forth the
   motive for repentance. Repentance is the duty, and the approach of the
   kingdom is the motive inciting to it. Only by repentance could the
   people be prepared for the kingdom. Those who are indifferent to the
   obligations of an old revelation would be ill-prepared to receive a new
   one] the kingdom of heaven is at hand [Dan. ii. 44. "Kingdom of heaven"
   is peculiar to Matthew, who uses it thirty-one times. He also joins
   with the other evangelists in calling it the kingdom of God. We know
   not why he preferred the expression, "kingdom of heaven."] 3 For this
   is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, ^c 3 And he came
   [he made his public appearance, and, like that of Elijah, it was a
   sudden one--I. Kings xvii. 1] into all the region about the Jordan [The
   Jordan valley is called in the old Testament the Arabah, and by the
   modern Arabs the Ghor. It is the deepest valley in the world, its
   lowest part being about thirteen hundred feet below the level of the
   ocean] preaching the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins
   [as a change leading to remission or forgiveness of sins] ^b even ^c 4
   as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet [Isaiah
   flourished from about 759 to 699 b.c.], ^a saying, ^b Behold [The
   clause beginning with "Behold," and ending with "way," is taken from
   Mal. iii. 1. The Revised Version makes Mark quote this passage as if it
   were from Isaiah, the reading being "written in Isaiah the prophet,"
   but the King James' version gives the reading "written in the
   prophets." Following the reasoning of Canon Cook, we hold that the
   latter was the original reading--see Speaker's Commentary, note at the
   end of Mark i.] I send my messenger [John the Baptist was that
   messenger] before thy face [Malachi says, "my face." "Thy" and "my" are
   used interchangeably, because of the unity of the Deity--John x. 30],
   who shall prepare thy way [Mark says little about the prophets, but at
   the outset of his Gospel he calls attention to the fact that the entire
   pathway of Jesus was the subject of prophetical prediction]; ^c The
   voice [Isaiah xl. 3, 4, quoted from the LXX. The words were God's, the
   voice was John's. So Paul also spake (I. Thess. ii. 1-13). It was
   prophesied before he was born that John should be a preparing messenger
   for Christ--Luke i. 17] of one crying in the wilderness [This prophecy
   of Isaiah's could relate to none but John, for no other prophet ever
   made the wilderness the scene of his preaching. But John always
   preached there, and instead of going to the people, he compelled the
   people to come out to him. John was the second Elijah. The claims of
   all who in these days profess to be reincarnations of Elijah may be
   tested and condemned by this prophecy, for none of them frequent the
   wilderness], Make ye ready the way [See also Isa. xxxv. 8-10. Isaiah's
   language is highly figurative. It represents a band of engineers and
   workmen preparing the road for their king through a rough, mountainous
   district. The figure was familiar to the people of the East, and nearly
   every generation there witnessed such road-making. The haughty
   Seriramis leveled the mountains before her. Josephus, describing the
   march of Vespasian, says that there went before him such as were to
   make the road even and straight, and if it were anywhere rough and
   hard, to smooth it over, to plane it, and to cut down woods that
   hindered the march, that the army might not be tired. Some have thought
   that Isaiah's prophecy referred primarily to the return of the Jewish
   captives from Babylon. But it refers far more directly to the ministry
   of the Baptist; for it is not said that the way was to be prepared for
   the people, but for Jehovah himself. It is a beautiful figure, but the
   real preparation was the more beautiful transformation of repentance.
   By inducing repentance, John was to prepare the people to receive Jesus
   and his apostles, and to hearken to their preaching] of the Lord, Make
   his paths straight. 5 Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain
   and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight,
   And the rough way smooth [The literal meaning of this passage is
   expressed at Isa. ii. 12-17. See also Zech. iv. 7. Commentators give
   detailed application of this prophecy, and, following their example, we
   may regard the Pharisees and Sadducees as mountains of
   self-righteousness, needing to be thrown down, and thereby brought to
   meekness and humility; the outcasts and harlots as valleys of
   humiliation, needing to be exalted and filled with hope; and the
   publicans and soldiers as crooked and rough byways, needing to be
   straightened and smoothed with proper details of righteousness. But the
   application is general, and not to be limited to such details. However,
   civil tyranny, and ecclesiastical pride must be leveled, and the rights
   of the common people must be exalted before for kingdom of God can
   enter in] ; 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God [This last
   clause of the prophecy is added by Luke alone. He loves to dwell upon
   the universality of Christ's gospel.] ^b 4 John came, who baptized in
   the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto the
   remission of sins. [Pardoning mercy was to be found in Christ, and all
   rites then looked forward to the cleansing effected by the shedding of
   his blood, as all rites now look back to it. But in popular estimation
   John's baptism was no doubt regarded as consummating an immediate
   forgiveness] ^a 4 Now John himself [Himself indicates that John's
   manner of life differed from that of his disciples. He did not oblige
   them to practice the full measure of his abstinence] had his raiment of
   [John's dress and food preached in harmony with his voice. His clothing
   and fare rendered him independent of the rich and great, so that he
   could more freely and plainly rebuke their sins. Calling others to
   repentance, he himself set an example of austere self-denial. So much
   so that the Pharisees said he had a demon--Matt. xi. 18] ^b 6 And was
   clothed with ^a camel's hair [Camels were plentiful in the East. Their
   finer hair was woven into elegant cloths; but that which was coarser
   and shaggier was made into a fabric like our druggets, and used for the
   coats of shepherds and camel-drivers, and for the covering of tents.
   Prophets often wore such cloth (Zech. xiii. 4), and no doubt it was the
   habitual garb of John's prototype (Mal. iv. 5), the prophet Elijah (II.
   Kings i. 8). In Elijah's day there was demand for protest against the
   sad havoc which Phoenician luxury and licentiousness were making with
   the purer morals of Israel; and in John's day a like protest was needed
   against a like contamination wrought by Greek manners and customs. Both
   prophets, by their austerity, rebuked such apostasy, and Jezebel
   answered the rebuke by attempting Elijah's life, while Herodias
   actually took the life of John. As a herald, John was suited to the
   King whose appearing he was to announce, for Jesus was meek and lowly
   (Zech. ix. 9), and had no form nor comeliness that he should be
   desired--Isa. liii. 2], and a leathern girdle about his loins [The
   loose skirts worn in the East required a girdle to bind them to the
   body. This was usually made of linen or silk, but was frequently more
   costly, being wrought with silver and gold. John's girdle was plain,
   undressed leather]; And his food was { ^b and did eat} ^a locusts
   [Locusts, like Western grasshoppers, were extremely plentiful (Joel i.
   4; Isa. xxxiii. 4, 5). The law declared them clean, and thus permitted
   the people to eat them for food (Lev. xi. 22). Arabs still eat them,
   and in some Oriental cities they are found for sale in the market. But
   they are regarded as fit only for the poor. They are frequently
   seasoned with camel's milk and honey] and wild honey. [Canaan was
   promised as a land flowing with milk and honey (Ex. ii. 8-17; xiii. 15;
   I. Sam. xiv. 26). Many of the trees in the plains of Jericho, such as
   the palm, fig, manna, ash and tamarisk, exuded sweet gums, which went
   by the name of tree honey, but there is no need to suppose, as some do,
   that this was what John ate. The country once abounded in wild bees,
   and their honey was very plentiful. We have on the record an instance
   of the speed with which they could fill the place which they selected
   for their hives (Judg. xiv. 5-9). The diet of the Baptist was very
   light, and Jesus so speaks of it (Matt. xi. 18). He probably had no set
   time for his meals, and all days were more or less fast-days. Thus John
   gave himself wholly to his ministry, and became a voice--all voice.
   John took the wilderness for a church, and filled it. He courted no
   honors, but no Jew of his time received more of them, and by some he
   was even regarded as Messiah-- Luke iii. 15.] ^b 5 And there ^a 5 Then
   went out unto him ^b all [A hyperbole common with Hebrew writers and
   such as we use when we say, "the whole town turned out," "everybody was
   there," etc. Both Matthew and Luke show that some did not accept John's
   baptism (Matt. xxi. 23-25; Luke vii. 30). But from the language of the
   evangelist we might infer that, first and last, something like a
   million people may have attended John's ministry] the country of Judæa,
   and all they of Jerusalem; ^a all the region round about the Jordan
   [The last phrase includes the entire river valley. On both sides of the
   river between the lake of Galilee and Jericho, there were many
   important cities, any one of which would be more apt to send its
   citizens to John's baptism than the proud capital of Jerusalem] ; 6 and
   they were baptized of him [Literally, immersed by him. In every stage
   of the Greek language this has been the unquestioned meaning of the
   verb baptizo, and it still retains this meaning in modern Greek. In
   accordance with this meaning, the Greek Church, in all its branches,
   has uniformly practiced immersion from the earliest period to the
   present time. Greek Christians never speak of other denominations as
   "baptizing by sprinkling," but they say, "they baptize instead of
   baptizing." John's baptism was instituted of God (John i. 33), just as
   Christian baptism was instituted by Christ (Matt. xxviii. 19). The
   Pharisees recognized John's rite as so important as to require divine
   authority, and even then they underestimated it, regarding it as a mere
   purification--Josephus Ant. xviii. 5, 2] in the river Jordan,
   confessing their sins. [As John's baptism was for the remission of
   sins, it was very proper that it should be preceded by a confession.
   The context indicates that the confession was public and general. There
   is no hint of such auricular confession as is practiced by the
   Catholics. See also Acts xix. 18. John, writing to baptized Christians,
   bids them to confess their sins, that Jesus may forgive them (I. John
   i. 9). Christian baptism is also for the remission of sins (Acts ii.
   38), the ordinance itself a very potent confession that the one
   baptized has sins to be remitted, and it seems to be a sufficient pubic
   expression of confession as to sins; for while John's baptism called
   for a confession sins, Christian baptism calls only for a confession of
   faith in Christ--Acts xxii. 16; Rom. x. 9, 10; Mark xvi. 16.] 7 But
   when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees [Josephus tells us that
   these two leading sects of the Jews started about the same time in the
   days of Jonathan, the high priest, or b.c. 159-144. But the sentiments
   which at that time divided the people into two rival parties entered
   the minds and hearts of the Jews immediately after the return from the
   Babylonian captivity. These returned Jews differed as to the attitude
   and policy which Israel should manifest toward the neighboring heathen.
   Some contended for a strict separation between the Jews and all pagan
   peoples. These eventually formed the Pharisee party, and the name
   Pharisee means "the separate." Originally these men were genuine
   patriots and reformers, but afterwards the majority of them became mere
   formalists. As theologians the Pharisees represented the orthodox
   party, and were followed by the vast majority of the people. They
   believed (1) in the resurrection of the dead; (2) a future state with
   rewards and punishments; (3) angels and spirits; and (4) a special
   providence of God carried out by angels and spirits. As a sect they are
   said to have numbered six thousand at the time of Herod's death. They
   were the patriotic party, and the zealots were their extreme section.
   They covered an extremely selfish spirit with a pious formalism, and by
   parading their virtues they obtained an almost unbounded influence over
   the people. By exposing their hypocrisy, Jesus sought to destroy their
   power over the multitude, and incurred that bitter enmity with which
   they pursued him to his death. But certain other of the captives who
   returned from Babylon desired a freer intercourse with the pagans, and
   sought to break away from every restraint which debarred therefrom.
   These became Sadducees. They consented to no other restraint than the
   Scriptures themselves imposed, and they interpreted these as laxly as
   possible. Some take their name to means "the party of 'righteousness,'"
   but more think it comes from their founder, Zadok, and is a corruption
   of the word Zadokite. Zadok flourished 260 b.c. His teacher, Antigonus
   Sochæus, taught him to serve God disinterestedly--that is, without hope
   of reward or punishment. From his teaching Zadok inferred that there
   was no future state of rewards or punishment, and on this belief
   founded his sect. From this fundamental doctrine sprang the other
   tenets of the Sadducees. They denied all the four points held by the
   Pharisees, asserting that there was no resurrection; no rewards and
   punishments hereafter; no angels, no spirits. They believed there was a
   God, but denied that he had any special supervision of human affairs
   (Matt. xxii. 23; Acts xxiii. 8). They were the materialists of that
   day. Considering all God's promises as referring to this world, they
   looked upon poverty and distress as evidence of God's curse. Hence to
   relieve the poor was to sin against God in interfering with his mode of
   government. Far fewer than the Pharisees, they were their rivals in
   power; for they were the aristocratic party, and held the
   high-priesthood, with all its glories. Their high political position,
   their great wealth, and the Roman favor which they courted by
   consenting to foreign rule and pagan customs, made them a body to be
   respected and feared] coming to his baptism, he said { ^c therefore to
   the multitudes that went out to be baptized on him} ^a unto them [John
   spoke principally to the leaders, but his denunciation indirectly
   included the multitude who followed their leadership], Ye offspring of
   vipers [A metaphor for their likeness to vipers--as like them as if
   they had been begotten of them. The viper was a species of serpent from
   two to five feet in length, and about one inch thick. Its head is flat,
   and its body a yellowish color, speckled with long brown spots. It is
   extremely poisonous (Acts xxviii. 6). John here uses the word
   figuratively, and probably borrows the figure from Isa. lix. 5. It
   means that the Jewish rulers were full of guile and malice, cunning and
   venom. With these words John gave them a vigorous shaking, for only
   thus could he hope to waken their slumbering consciences. But only one
   who has had a vision of "the King in his beauty," should presume thus
   to address his fellow-men. The serpent is an emblem of the devil (Gen.
   iii. 1; Rev. xii. 9, 14, 15), and Jesus not only repeated John's words
   (Matt. xii. 35; xxiii. 23, 33), but he interpreted the words, and told
   them plainly that they were "the children of the devil" (John viii.
   44). The Jewish rulers well deserved this name, for they poisoned the
   religious principles of the nation, and accomplished the crucifixion of
   the Son of God], who warned you to flee [John's baptism, like that of
   Moses at the Red Sea (I. Cor. x. 2), was a way of escape from
   destruction, of rightly used. Christian baptism is also such a way, and
   whosoever will may enter thereby into the safety of the kingdom of
   Christ, but baptism can not be used as an easy bit of ritual to charm
   away evil. It must be accompanied by all the spiritual changes which
   the ordinance implies] from the wrath to come? [Prophecy foretold that
   Messiah's times would be accompanied with wrath (Isa. lxiii. 3-6; Dan.
   vii. 10-26); but the Jews were all of the opinion that this wrath would
   be meted out upon the Gentiles and were not prepared to hear John apply
   the prophecy to themselves. To all his hearers John preached the coming
   kingdom; to the impenitent, he preached the coming wrath. Thus he
   prepared the way for the first coming of the Messiah, and those who
   would prepare the people for his second coming would do well to follow
   his example. The Bible has a voice of warning and denunciation, as well
   as words of invitation and love. Whosoever omits the warning of the
   judgment, speaks but half the message which God would have him deliver.
   God's wrath is his resentment against sin--Matt. xviii. 34; xxii. 7;
   Mark iii. 5.] 8 Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance [John
   had demanded repentance, he now demands the fruits of it. By "fruit" or
   "fruits," as Luke has it, he means the manner of life which shows a
   real repentance]: 9 and think not { ^c begin not} [John nips their
   self-excuse in the bud] ^a to say within yourselves [speaking to your
   conscience to quiet it], We have Abraham to our father [The Jews
   thought that Messiah would rule over them as a nation, and that all
   Jews would, therefore, be by birthright citizens of his kingdom. They
   thought that descent from Abraham was all that would be necessary to
   bring them into that kingdom. John's words must have been very
   surprising to them. The Talmud is full of expressions showing the
   extravagant value which Jews of a later age attached to Abrahamic
   descent. "Abraham," it says, "sits next the gates of hell, and doth not
   permit any wicked Israelite to go down into it." Again, it represents
   God as saying to Abraham, "If thy children were like dead bodies
   without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail for them." Again, "A
   single Israelite is worth more before God than all the people who have
   been or shall be." Again, "The world was made for their [Israel's]
   sake." This pride was the more inexcusable because the Jews were
   clearly warned by their prophets that their privileges were not
   exclusive, and that they would by no means escape just punishment for
   their sins (Jer. vii. 3, 4; Mic. iii. 11; Isa. xlviii. 2). John
   repeated this message, and Jesus reiterated it (Matt. viii. 11, 12;
   Luke xvi. 23). We should note that in this preparation for the gospel a
   blow was struck at confidence and trust in carnal descent. Birth gives
   no man any privileges in the kingdom of God, for all are born outside
   of it, and all must be born again into it (John i. 13; iii. 3); yet
   many still claim peculiar rights from Christian parentage, and infant
   baptism rests on this false conception. The New Testament teaches us
   that we are children of Abraham by faith, and not by blood; by
   spiritual and not carnal descent (Rom. iv. 12-16; Gal. iii. 26; vi. 15;
   John viii. 39). It had been better for the Jews never to have heard of
   Abraham, than to have thus falsely viewed the rights which they
   inherited from him]: for I say unto you, that God is able of these
   stones to raise up children unto Abraham [John meant that their being
   children of Abraham by natural descent gave them no more merit than
   children of Abraham made out of stone would have. He pointed to the
   stones along the bank of Jordan as he spoke.] 10 And even now the axe
   ^c also ^a lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that
   bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down [The threatened cutting down
   means the end of the probation of each hearer, when, if found
   fruitless, he would be cast into the fire mentioned below], and cast
   into the fire. [Used as fuel.] ^c 10 And the multitudes asked him,
   saying, What then must we do? [This is the cry of the awakened
   conscience (Acts ii. 37; xvi. 30; xxii. 10). John answered it by
   recommending them to do the very reverse of what they were doing,
   which, in their case, was true fruit of repentance.] 11 And he answered
   and said unto them, He that hath two coats [By coat is meant the tunic,
   or inner garment, worn next to the skin. It reached to the knees, and
   sometimes to the ankles, and generally had sleeves. Two tunics were a
   luxury in a land where thousands were too poor to own even one. Wrath
   was coming, and he that would obtain mercy from it must show
   mercy--Matt. v. 7], let him impart to him that hath none [For a like
   precept given to Christians, see II. Cor. viii. 13-15; Jas. ii. 15-17;
   I. John iii. 17]; and he that hath food, let him do likewise. 12 And
   there came also publicans [The Roman Government did not collect its own
   taxes. Instead of doing so, it divided the empire into districts, and
   sold the privilege of collecting the taxes in these districts to
   certain capitalists and men of rank. The capitalists employed agents to
   do the actual collecting. These agents were usually natives of the
   districts in which they lived, and those in Palestine were called
   publicans. Their masters urged and encouraged them to make the most
   fraudulent and vexatious exactions. They systematically overcharged the
   people and often brought false accusation to obtain money by blackmail.
   These publicans were justly regarded by the Jews as apostates and
   traitors, and were classed with the lowest and most abandoned
   characters. The system was bad, but its practitioners were worse. The
   Greeks regarded the word "publican" as synonymous with "plunderer."
   Suidas pictures the life of a publican as "unrestrained plunder,
   unblushing greed, unreasonable pettifogging, shameless business." The
   Turks to-day collect by this Roman method. Being publicly condemned,
   and therefore continually kept conscious of their sin, the publicans
   repented more readily than the self-righteous Pharisees. Conscience is
   one of God's greatest gifts, and he that destroys it must answer for
   it] to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher [The publicans,
   though lowest down, gave John the highest title. Self-abnegation is
   full of the virtue of reverence, but self-righteousness utterly lacks
   it], what must we do? 13 And he said unto them, Extort no more than
   that which is appointed you. [Such was their habitual, universal sin.
   No man should make his calling an excuse for evil-doing.] 14 And
   soldiers [These soldiers were probably Jewish troops in the employ of
   Herod. Had they been Romans, John would doubtless have told them to
   worship God] also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he
   said unto them, Extort from no man by violence [The soldiers, poorly
   paid, often found it convenient to extort money by intimidation. Strong
   in their organization, they terrified the weak and enforced gratuities
   by acts of violence], neither accuse any one wrongfully [John here
   condemns the custom of blackmailing the rich by acting as informers and
   false accusers against them]; and be content with your wages. [The term
   wages included rations and money. The soldiers were not to add to their
   receipts by pillage or extortion. Soldiers' wages were about three
   cents a day, so they were exposed to strong temptation. Yet John did
   not bid them abandon their profession, and become ascetics like
   himself. His teachings was practical. He allowed war as an act of
   government. Whether Christianity sanctions it or not, is another
   question.] 15 And as the people were in expectation [Expecting the
   Christ--see John i. 19-28], and all men reasoned in their hearts
   concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ [Prophecy induced a
   Messianic expectation. The scepter had departed from Judah, and Cæsar's
   deputies ruled. Tetrarchs and procurators held the whole civil
   government. In their hands lay the power of life and death from which
   only Roman citizens could appeal (Acts xxv. 11). The power of the
   Jewish courts was limited to excommunication or scourging. The seventy
   weeks of Daniel were now expiring, and other prophecies indicated the
   fullness of time. But distress, rather than prophecy, enhanced their
   expectation. Tiberius, the most infamous of men, governed the world.
   Pontius Pilate, insolent, cruel, was making life irksome and maddening
   the people. Herod Antipas, by a course of reckless apostasy and
   unbridled lust, grieved even the religious sense of the hypocrite.
   Annas and Caiaphas, impersonators of materialism, sat in the chief seat
   of spiritual power. Men might well look for a deliverer, and hasten
   with joy to hear of a coming King. But, nevertheless, we could have no
   more forceful statement of the deep impression made by John's ministry
   than that the people were disposed to take him for the Christ]; 16 John
   answered, saying unto them all, ^b 7 And he preached, saying, ^a 11 I
   indeed baptize { ^b baptized} ^a you in { ^c with} water unto
   repentance [That is, unto the completion of your repentance. Repentance
   had to begin before the baptism was administered. After the sinner
   repented, baptism consummated his repentance, being the symbolic
   washing away of that from which he had repented and the bringing of the
   candidate into the blessings granted to the repentant--Mark i. 4; Luke
   iii. 3] : ^c But there { ^a he that} [John preached repentance because
   of a coming King; he now announces who the King is. He pictures this
   King as, first, administering a different baptism from his own; second,
   as a judge who would separate the righteous from the wicked, just as a
   husbandman sifts the wheat from the chaff] ^b cometh after me
   [Subsequent to me in ministry. But John indicates that the coming of
   Christ would be closely coupled with his own appearing. One event was
   to immediately follow the other. So Malachi binds together in one time
   the appearing of both forerunner and judge--Mal. iii. 1-3] he that is
   mightier than I [mightier both to save and to punish], ^a whose shoes
   [The sandal then worn was a piece of wood or leather bound to the sole
   of the foot to protect it from the burning sand or the sharp stones. It
   was the forerunner of our modern shoe] I am not worthy to bear [To
   untie or carry away the shoe of the master or his guest was the work of
   the lowest slave of the household. As a figure of speech, the shoe is
   always associated with subjugation and slavery (Ps. lx. 8). John means,
   "I am not worthy to be his servant." John was simply the forerunner of
   Jesus; the higher office and honor of being Jesus' attendants was
   reserved for others--Matt. xi. 11]: ^b the latchet [the lace or strap]
   of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. ^c he shall
   baptize you in the Holy Spirit [That which is here referred to was
   foretold by the prophets (Isa. xliv. 3; Joel ii. 28). In the early
   church there was an abundant outpouring of the Spirit of God (Tit. iii.
   5, 6; Acts ii. 3, 4, 17; x. 44). This prophecy began to be fulfilled on
   the day of Pentecost (Acts i. 5; ii. 4). In the choice of the word
   "baptize" God indicated through his prophet how full this flooding of
   the Spirit would be] and in fire [Many learned commentators regard the
   expression "in fire" as a mere amplification of the spiritual baptism
   added to express the purging and purifying effects of that baptism, but
   the context forbids this, for, in verse 10, casting the unfruitful
   trees into the fire represents the punishment of the wicked, and, in
   verse 12, the burning of the chaff with fire does the same, and
   consequently the baptizing in fire of the intervening verse must,
   according to the force of the context have the same reference. True,
   the expression "he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire,"
   does not separate the persons addressed into two parties, and, if the
   context is disregarded, might be understood as meaning that the same
   persons were to be baptized in both; yet the context must not be
   disregarded, and it clearly separates them]: 17 whose fan [Winnowing
   shovel. In the days of John the Baptist, and in that country at the
   present day, wheat and other grain was not threshed by machinery. It
   was beaten out by flails, or trodden out by oxen on some smooth, hard
   plot of ground called the threshing-floor. These threshing-floors were
   usually on elevations where the wind blew freely. When the grain was
   trodden out, it was winnowed or separated from the chaff by being
   tossed into the air with a fan or winnowing shovel. When so tossed, the
   wind blew the chaff away, and the clean grain fell upon the
   threshing-floor] is in his hand [Ready for immediate work. Both John
   and Malachi, who foretold John, are disposed to picture Jesus as the
   judge (Mal. iii. 2-5). Of all the pictures of God which the Bible
   gives, that of a judge is the most common and frequent], thoroughly to
   { ^a and he will thoroughly} ^c cleanse his threshing-floor [Removing
   the chaff is called purging the floor. Humanity is a mixture of good
   and bad, and to separate this mixture, save the good and destroy the
   bad, is the work of Christ. He partially purges the floor in this
   present time by gathering his saints into the church and leaving the
   unrepentant in the world. But hereafter on the day of judgment he will
   make a complete and final separation between the just and the unjust by
   sending the evil from his presence and gathering his own into the
   garner of heaven (Matt. xxv. 32, 33). He shall also winnow our
   individual characters, and remove all evil from us--Luke xxii. 31, 32;
   Rom. vii. 21-25], and to { ^a and he will} ^c gather the { ^a his} ^c
   wheat into his { ^a the} ^c garner [Eastern garners or granaries were
   usually subterranean vaults or caves. Garnered grain rested in safety.
   It was removed from peril of birds, storms, blight and mildew.
   Christians are now on God's threshing-floor; hereafter they will be
   gathered into the security of his garner]; but the chaff [when the
   Bible wishes to show the worthlessness and the doom of the ungodly,
   chaff is one of its favorite figures--Job xxi. 18; Ps. i. 4; Isa. xvii.
   13; Jer. xv. 7 Hos xiii. 3; Mal. iv. 1] he will burn up [To prevent
   chaff from being blown back and mixed again with the wheat, it was
   burned up. All the chaff in the church shall be consumed on the day of
   judgment (I. Cor. iii. 12, 13), and there shall be no mixing of good
   and bad after death-- Luke xvi. 26] with unquenchable fire [In this and
   in other places (II. Thess. i. 8, 9; Mark ix. 48; Matt. xxv. 41), the
   future suffering of the wicked is taught in the Bible. He shows no
   kindness to his neighbor, no friendship toward mankind, who conceals
   the terrors of the Lord. These terrors are set forth in no uncertain
   terms. Many believe that God will restore the wicked and eventually
   save all the human race. Others hold that God will annihilate the
   wicked, and thus end their torment. This passage and the one cited in
   Mark would be hard to reconcile with either of these views; they
   indicate that there will be no arrest of judgment nor stay of
   punishment when once God begins to execute his condemnation. God purged
   the world with water at the time of the flood; he will again purge it
   with fire on the day of judgment-- II. Pet. iii. 7-10.] 18 With many
   other exhortations [The sermon here given is in the nature of a
   summary. It embodies the substance of John's preaching. Afterwards John
   preached Christ more directly--John i. 29-36] therefore preached he
   good tidings unto the people. [but, like the good tidings of the angel
   at Bethlehem, it was good only to those who, by repentance, made
   themselves well pleasing to God.]

Jesus Baptized by John in the Jordan.

(Jordan East of Jericho, Spring of a.d. 27.)

^A Matt. III. 13-17; ^B Mark I. 9-11; ^C Luke III. 21-23.

   ^b 9 And { ^a 13 Then} ^b it came to pass in those days, that Jesus
   came { ^a cometh} ^b from Nazareth of Galilee, ^a to the Jordan
   [Tradition fixes upon a ford of Jordan east of Jericho as the place
   where Jesus was baptized. It is the same section of the river which
   opened for the passage of Israel under Joshua, and later for Elijah and
   Elisha. This ford is seventy or eighty miles from Nazareth] unto John,
   to be baptized of him [He set out from Nazareth, intending to be
   baptized. Such was his intention before he heard John preach, and he
   was therefore not persuaded to do it by the preaching. His
   righteousness was not the result of human persuasion.] ^b and was
   baptized of John in [Greek "into." The body of Jesus was immersed or
   plunged into the river] 14; ^a But John would have hindered him [It
   seemed to John too great an honor for him to baptize Jesus, and too
   great a humiliation for Jesus to be baptized. There is some dispute as
   to how John came to know this righteousness of Christ, which prompted
   his protest. The one natural explanation is, that the intimacy of the
   two families indicated at the beginning of Luke's account had been kept
   up, and John knew the history of his kinsman], saying, I have need to
   be baptized of thee [those are most fit to administer an ordinance who
   have themselves deeply experienced the need of it], and comest thou to
   me? [John felt that he needed Jesus' baptism, but could not think that
   Jesus needed his. The words "I," "thee," "thou," and "me," show that
   John contrasted the baptizers as well as the baptisms. As a human being
   he marveled that the Son of God should come to him to be immersed. The
   comings of Jesus and the purposes for which he comes are still the
   greatest marvels which confront the minds of men. Moreover, it should
   be noted that this protest of John's needed to be made, for it saved
   Jesus from being baptized without explanation, as if he were a sinner.
   Baptism without such explanation might have compromised our Lord's
   claim as the sinless one.] 15 But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer
   it now [Permit me for this moment to appear as your inferior. The
   future will make plain and clear the difference between us, both as to
   our missions and our natures. The words show a Messianic consciousness
   on the part of Jesus]: for thus it becometh us [Some take the word "us"
   as referring to Jesus and John, but the clause "to fulfil all
   righteousness" shows that "us" refers to Jesus, and he uses the plural
   to show that it also becometh all of us] to fulfil all righteousness
   [Jesus came not only to fulfill all the requirements of the law, but
   also all that wider range of righteousness of which the law was only a
   part. 1. Though John's baptism was no part of the Mosaic ritual, it
   was, nevertheless, a precept of God, given by his prophet (John i. 33).
   Had Jesus neglected or refused to obey this precept he would have
   lacked a portion of the full armor of righteousness, and the Pharisees
   would have hastened to strike him at this loose joint of his harness
   (Matt. xxi. 23-27). 2. It was the divinely appointed method by which
   the Messiahship of Jesus was to be revealed to the witness John (John
   i. 33, 34). We should note here that those who fail to obey God's
   ordinance of baptism fail (1) to follow the example of Jesus in
   fulfilling the divine will and precepts; (2) to obey one of the
   positive commands of almighty God spoken by his own Son.] Then he
   suffereth him. [John's humility caused him to shrink from this duty,
   but did not make him willfully persist in declining it. Humility ceases
   to be a virtue when it keeps us from performing our allotted tasks.] ^c
   21 Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized [This may
   mean that, on the day of his baptism, Jesus was the last candidate, and
   hence his baptism was the most conspicuous of all; but it more probably
   means that Jesus was baptized in the midst of John's work--at the
   period when his baptism was in greatest favor], that, Jesus also having
   been { ^a 16 And Jesus, when he was} ^c baptized, and praying [All
   divine ordinances should be accompanied with prayer. Luke frequently
   notes the times when Jesus prayed. Here, at the entrance of his
   ministry, he prayed, and at the last moment of it he also prayed (Luke
   xxiii. 46). In his highest exultation at the transfiguration (Luke ix.
   29), and in the lowest depths of humiliation in Gethsemane (Luke xxii.
   41), he prayed. He prayed for his apostles whom he chose (Luke vi. 12),
   and for his murderers by whom he was rejected (Luke xxiii. 34). He
   prayed before Peter confessed him (Luke ix. 18 ), and also before Peter
   denied him--Luke xxii. 32], ^b 10 And straightway coming up out of { ^a
   went up straightway from} ^b the water [the two prepositions, "out of"
   and "from," show that Jesus was not yet fully out of the river, and
   that the vision and the voice were immediately associated with his
   baptism] , ^a and lo, ^b he saw [The statement that he saw the Spirit
   descending, which is also the language of Matthew, has been taken by
   some as implying that the Spirit was invisible to the multitude. But we
   know from John's narrative that it was also seen by John the Baptist
   (John i. 33, 34), and if it was visible to him and to Jesus, and it
   descended, as Luke affirms, in a bodily shape like a dove (Luke iii.
   22), it would have required a miracle to hide it from the multitude.
   Moreover, the object of the Spirit's visible appearance was to point
   Jesus out, not to himself, but to others; and to point him out as the
   person concerning whom the voice from heaven was uttered. No doubt,
   then, the Spirit was visible and audible to all who were present [2] ]
   the heavens rent asunder [for], ^a the heavens were { ^c heaven was} ^a
   opened unto him [The heavens open at the beginning of Jesus' ministry
   to honor him, and at the end of it to receive him. Christ is the opener
   of heaven for all men], and he saw the Spirit of God descending [the
   Spirit came upon Jesus to give him the miraculous power which he
   afterward exerted--Luke iv. 14] as a dove [That is, like a dove. All
   four evangelists are careful to inform us that it was not an actual
   dove], and coming upon him; ^c 22 and the Holy Spirit descended in a
   bodily form [Lightfoot suggests that the Spirit thus descended that he
   might be revealed to be a personal substance and not merely an
   operation of the Godhead, and might thus make a sensible demonstration
   as to his proper place in the Trinity], as a dove [The descent of the
   Spirit upon Jesus was in accordance with prophecy (Isa. xi. 2; xli. 1).
   The dove shape suggests purity, gentleness, peace, etc. Jesus makes the
   dove a symbol of harmlessness (Matt. x. 15). In fact, the nature of
   this bird makes it a fit emblem of the Spirit, for it comports well
   with the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. v. 22, 23). The nations of the
   earth emblazon eagles upon their banners and lions upon their shields,
   but He who shall gather all nations into his kingdom, appeared as a
   Lamb, and his Spirit appeared under the symbol of a dove. Verily his
   kingdom is not of this world. It is a kingdom of peace and love, not of
   bloodshed and ambition. Noah's dove bore the olive branch, the symbol
   of peace, and the Holy Spirit manifested Jesus, God's olive branch of
   peace sent into this world--Ps. lxxii. 7; Luke ii. 14; John xiv. 27;
   Eph. ii. 11-18 ], upon him, ^a 17 and lo, a voice ^c came ^a out of the
   heavens, { ^c heaven} [Voices from heaven acknowledged the person of
   Christ at his birth, his baptism, his transfiguration and during the
   concluding days of his ministry. At his baptism Jesus was honored by
   the attestation of both the Spirit and the Father. But the ordinance
   itself was honored by the sensible manifestation of each several
   personality of the Deity--that the three into whose name we ourselves
   are also baptized], ^a saying, This is { ^b thou art} [The "this is,"
   etc. of Matthew are probably the words as John the Baptist reported
   them; the "thou art," etc., of Mark and Luke are the words as Jesus
   actually heard them. The testimony of the Father is in unreserved
   support of the fundamental proposition of Christianity on which the
   church of Christ is founded (Matt. xvi. 15-18). On this point no
   witness in the universe was so well qualified to speak as the Father,
   and no other fact was so well worthy the honor of being sanctioned by
   his audible utterance as this. The testimony of Christ's life, of his
   works, of the Baptist, and of the Scriptures might have been
   sufficient; but when the Father himself speaks, who shall doubt the
   adequacy of the proof?] ^a my beloved Son [See also Matt. xvii. 5. The
   Father himself states that relationship of which the apostle John so
   often spoke (John i. 1). Adam was made (Gen. i. 26), but Jesus was
   begotten (Ps. ii. 7). Both were sons of God, but in far different
   senses. The baptism of Jesus bears many marked relationships to our
   own: 1. At his baptism Jesus was manifested as the Son of God. At our
   baptism we are likewise manifested as God's children, for we are
   baptized into the name of the Father, and are thereby permitted to take
   upon ourselves his name. 2. At his baptism Jesus was fully commissioned
   as the Christ. Not anointed with material oil, but divinely consecrated
   and qualified by the Spirit and accredited by the Father. At baptism we
   also received the Spirit (John iii. 5; Acts ii. 38; xix. 1-6), who
   commissions and empowers us to Christian ministry--Acts i. 8; I. John
   iii. 24 ], in whom { ^c in thee} [Some make the phrases "in whom" and
   "in thee" to mean more than simply a declaration that God is pleased
   with Jesus. They see in it also the statement that the Father will be
   pleased with all who are "in Christ Jesus"--Eph. i. 6] ^a I am well
   pleased [It is no slight condemnation to be well pleasing to God (Job
   iv. 18). It is the Christian's joy that his Saviour had this
   commendation of the Father at the entrance upon his ministry.] ^c 23
   And Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years of
   age. [The age when a Levite entered upon God's service (Num. iv. 3,
   47); at which Joseph stood before Pharaoh (Gen. xli. 46); at which
   David began to reign (II. Sam. v. 4 ). Canon Cook fixes the date of
   Christ's baptism in the spring A. U. C. 780. Wiseler in the summer of
   that year, and Ellicott in the winter of that year.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] * Recognizing the weight of Bro. McGarvey's argument, I
   nevertheless contend that the multitude only shared partially in such a
   vision, if they shared it at all; for 1. There is no Scripture which
   even hints that the vision was seen by more than the two "inspired"
   parties, Jesus and John; and, on the contrary, the words of Jesus at
   John v. 37, though not addressed to the specific audience present at
   his baptism, were addressed to the Jews generally. 2. Jesus was to be
   manifested by his character and teaching rather than by heavenly sights
   and sounds (Matt. xii. 39), and the mysteries of the kingdom (Matt.
   xiii. 11), and the opened heavens (John i. 50, 51), with many other
   manifestations, were reserved for believers (John xii. 28-30; Matt.
   xvii. 1, 2, 9; Acts i. 9; vii. 55, 59; x. 40, 41), and are still so
   reserved (I. Cor. ii. 14). As to the arguments given above, we suggest
   that "bodily shape" does not insure universal sight. Baalam did not see
   what the ass saw (Num. xxii. 21-31). Again, it may be true that Jesus
   did not need to see the vision to "point him out to himself," but he
   must have needed it for some purpose, for it is twice asserted that he
   saw it, and the temptations which immediately follow show that
   assurances of his divinity at this particular time were by no means
   misplaced.

Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness.

^A Matt. IV. 1-11; ^B Mark I. 12, 13; ^C Luke IV. 1-13.

   ^c 1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, ^b
   12 And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth ^c and ^a 1 Then [Just
   after his baptism, with the glow of the descended Spirit still upon
   him, and the commending voice of the Father still ringing in his ears,
   Jesus is rushed into the suffering of temptation. Thus abrupt and
   violent are the changes of life. The spiritually exalted may expect
   these sharp contrasts. After being in the third heaven, Paul had a
   messenger of Satan to buffet him--II. Cor. xii. 7] was Jesus led up
   [The two expressions "driveth" and "led up" show that Jesus was drawn
   to the wilderness by an irresistible impulse, and did not go hither of
   his own volition (Ezek. xl. 2). He was brought into temptation, but did
   not seek it. He was led of God into temptation, but was not tempted of
   God. God may bring us into temptation (Matt. vi. 13; xxvi. 41; Job i.
   12; ii. 6), and may make temptation a blessing unto us, tempering it to
   our strength, and making us stronger by the victory over it (I. Cor. x.
   13; Jas. i. 2, 12), but God himself never tempts us--Jas. i. 13] of the
   Spirit into the wilderness [The wilderness sets in back of Jericho and
   extends thence along the whole western shore of the Dead Sea. The
   northern end of this region is in full view from the Jordan as one
   looks westward, and a more desolate and forbidding landscape it would
   be hard to find. It is vain to locate the temptation in any particular
   part of it. Jesus may have wandered about over nearly all of it] to be
   tempted of the devil [As a second David, Jesus went forth to meet that
   Goliath who had so long vaunted himself against all who sought to serve
   God, and had as yet found none to vanquish him. The account of the
   temptation must have been given to the disciples by Jesus himself, and
   as it pleased him to give it to us as an actual history of real facts,
   it behooves us to accept it without being presumptuously inquisitive.
   Of course, it has supernatural features, but the supernatural confronts
   us all through the life of Jesus, so there is nothing strange about it
   here. Jesus had taken upon him our flesh, and hence he could be
   tempted, with a possibility of falling. But his divinity insured his
   victory over temptation. He became like us in ability to fall, that he
   might make us like unto himself in power to resist. It behooved him to
   be tempted, and thus sharing our nature with its weakness and
   temptation he might bring us to share his nature with its strength and
   sinlessness (Heb. ii. 17, 18; iv. 15, 16). Sinlessness does not
   preclude temptation, else Adam could not have been tempted, nor could
   Satan himself have fallen. Moreover, temptation is in so sense sin. It
   is the yielding of the will to temptation which constitutes sin. The
   spiritual history of humanity revolves around two persons; namely, the
   first and the second Adam. The temptation of Christ was as real as that
   of Adam. He had taken upon himself our temptable nature (Phil. ii. 7,
   8), and he was tempted not as a private soldier, but as the second
   Adam, the Captain of our salvation (Heb. ii. 10-18). The failure of the
   first Adam brought sorrow, darkness and death; the success of the
   second Adam brought joy, light and immortality. One of the tenets of
   modern infidelity is the denial of the personality of the devil. It is
   asserted that the idea of a devil was not known to the early Hebrews,
   but was borrow from Persian dualism. The Persians held that there were
   two contending deities--a good one and a bad one; and the Hebrews,
   according to these critics, learned this doctrine from the Persians
   during the days of their Babylonian captivity, and modified it so that
   the god of evil became the devil. But such a theory is based upon the
   absurd notion that all the books of the Old Testament were written
   after the return of the Jews from Babylon. Their theory requires this
   notion, for the books of Genesis and Job, which were written centuries
   before the captivity, both show a knowledge of this being, and the
   first connects him and his work with the very beginning of human
   history. Those who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures must
   also believe in the personality of the devil, for they plainly teach
   it. The devil is a fallen angel ( Jude 6; II. Pet. ii. 4). This
   doctrine need startle no one, for as there are good and bad spirits in
   the body, so there are good and bad spirits out of the body. Since God
   permits sinful spirits in the body, why should he not also permit them
   out of the body? If there can be a Herod, a Nero, a Judas, among men,
   why may there not be a Satan among evil spirits? Being but an angel,
   Satan is neither omnipresent, omniscient nor omnipotent. He is only a
   tolerated rebel, as we are tolerated rebels. He was the first sinner
   (I. John iii. 8), and was the originator of sin (John viii. 44). He is
   the perpetual tempter of mankind (Rev. xx. 2, 8), but he shall be
   conquered by the Redeemer (John xii. 31; Rev. xii. 9), and may be
   conquered by us also through the grace of Christ (I. Pet. v. 8, 9; Jas.
   iv. 7); but is, nevertheless, dangerous (Rev. ii. 10; iii. 9). Jesus,
   therefore, teaches us to pray for deliverance from him (Matt. vi. 13,
   R.V.). Jesus will destroy the works of Satan (I. John iii. 8), and
   Satan himself shall suffer eternal punishment (Rev. xx. 10). There is
   but one devil in the spirit world. The word which our King James
   Version translates "devils" should be translated "demons." The word
   "devil" means false accuser or slanderer, and the word in the plural is
   twice applied, metaphorically, to men and women (II. Tim. iii. 3; I.
   Tim. iii. 11). The devil is called slanderer because he speaks against
   men ( Rev. xii. 10-12) and against God ( Gen. iii. 1-5). The word
   "devil" is Greek. The word "Satan" is Hebrew, and means adversary (Job
   ii. 1). Satan is referred to under many other terms, such as Beelzebub
   (Matt. xii. 24); serpent (Rev. xii. 9); prince of the powers of the air
   (Eph. ii. 2); Abaddon (Hebrew) and Apollyon (Greek), meaning destroyer
   (Rev. ix. 11); Belial, meaning good for nothing ( II. Cor. vi. 15);
   murderer and liar ( John viii. 44); prince of this world ( John xii.
   31); god of this world (II. Cor. iv. 4); and the dragon (Rev. xii. 7).
   These terms are always used in the Bible to designate an actual person;
   they are never used merely to personify evil. The devil may have
   appeared to Jesus in bodily form, or he may have come insensibly as he
   does to us. Our Lord's temptation makes the personality of the tempter
   essential, else Christ's own heart must have suggested evil to him,
   which is incompatible with his perfect holiness.] ^b 13 And he was ^c
   led in the Spirit [that is, under the power of the Spirit] in the
   wilderness [Isolation from humanity is no security from temptation. In
   fact, our present passage of Scripture shows that it is highly
   favorable to temptation. The experience of all hermits shows that
   loneliness is the mother of a multitude of evil desires] 2 during forty
   days [Matthew speaks of the temptation as coming "after" forty days.
   Evidently Mark and Luke regard the long fast as part of the process of
   temptation, seeing that without it the first temptation would have been
   without force. There is no evidence of any other specific temptations
   before the three], being tempted of ^b Satan; ^c the devil, ^b and he
   was with the wild beasts [A graphic touch, showing the dreariness and
   desolation of the wilderness, and indicating its peril. Lions, wolves,
   leopards and serpents have been found in the Judæan wilderness]; ^c And
   he did eat nothing [It used to be thought that a forty days' absolute
   fast was a practical impossibility, and Luke's words were therefore
   modified to mean that he ate very little. But as a forty days' fast has
   been safely accomplished in modern times, and as it was Jesus who
   fasted, we see no reason why we should not take Luke's statement
   literally, as indicating an absolute fast] in those days: and when they
   were completed. ^a 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights
   [A forty days' fast was accomplished by Moses (Ex. xxxiv. 28; Deut. ix.
   18), and by Elijah (I. Kings xix. 8), and it is a significant fact in
   this connection that these two men appeared with Christ at his
   transfiguration ( Matt. xvii. 3). Those who share Christ's sufferings
   shall also share his glorification (Rom. viii. 17; II. Tim. ii. 11,
   12). The forty days' fast became a basis for the temptation. We are
   told that temptation results from the excitement of desire (Jas. i.
   14), and, as a rule, the greater the desire the greater the temptation.
   Viewed from this standpoint the temptation of the second Adam greatly
   exceeded in strength that of the first, for Adam abstained as to a
   particular fruit, but Christ fasted as to all things edible], he
   afterward hungered. [Here, for the first time, our Lord is shown as
   sharing our physical needs. We should note for our comfort that one may
   lack bread and suffer want, and still be infinitely beloved in heaven.]
   3 And the tempter came [Satan is pre-eminently the tempter, for other
   tempters are his agents. He may possibly have appeared as an angel of
   light (II. Cor. xi. 14), but the purpose of his coming is more
   important than the manner of it. He came to produce sin in Jesus, for
   sin would render him forever incapable of becoming our Saviour--a
   sacrifice for the sins of others] ^c 3 And the devil said unto him, If
   thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it { ^a command that
   these stones} become bread. [The devil's "if" strikes at the faith of
   Christ, and faith is the bond of union and accord between man and God.
   The main sin of this temptation was therefore distrust, though it had
   other sinful phases. The Father's voice had just declared the Sonship
   of Jesus, and Satan here boldly questions the truth of God's words,
   just as he did in the beginning (Gen. iii. 3-5). The temptation smacks
   of curiosity, and curiosity is the mother of many sins. Though Satan so
   glibly questioned the divinity of Christ, his kingdom soon began to
   feel the power of that divinity (Luke iv. 34-41), and shall continue to
   feel it until his kingdom is destroyed (Heb. ii. 14; I. John iii. 8 ).
   This temptation appealed to the present appetite, the impulse of the
   moment, as many of our temptations do. It has been quaintly said of the
   tempter that "he had sped so successfully to his own mind by a
   temptation about a matter of eating with the first Adam, that he
   practiced the old manner of trading with the second." This first
   temptation is still Satan's favorite with the poor. He suggests to them
   that if they were really the beloved objects of God's care, their
   condition would be otherwise. We should note that Jesus wrought no
   selfish miracle. Such an act would have been contrary to all Scripture
   precedent. Paul did not heal himself ( I. Cor. xii. 7-9; Gal. iv. 13;
   Col. iv. 14), nor Epaphroditus, (Phil. ii. 25-27), nor Trophimus (II.
   Tim. iv. 20). Denying himself the right to make bread in the
   wilderness, Christ freely used his miraculous power to feed others in
   the desert ( Matt. xiv. 15-21), and merited as just praise those words
   which were meant as a bitter taunt--Matt. xxvii. 42.] 4 But he { ^c 4
   And Jesus} ^a answered and said, ^c unto him, It is written [Jesus
   quotes Deut. viii. 3 . It is a saying relative to the times when Israel
   was sustained by manna in the wilderness. The case of Jesus was now
   similar to that of Israel. He was in a foodless wilderness, but he
   trusted that as God had provided for Israel in its helplessness, so
   would he now provide for him. Israel sinned by doubt and murmuring, and
   proposing to obtain bread in its own way--that is, by returning to
   Egypt (Ex. xvi. 1-9 ). Jesus avoided a like sin. We should note the use
   which our Lord made of Scripture: in his hour of trial he did not look
   to visions and voices and special revelation for guidance, but used the
   written Word as the lamp for his feet (Ps. cxix. 105); in the conflict
   of temptation he did not defend himself by his own divine wisdom, but
   used that wisdom which God had revealed to all Israel through his
   prophets. Jesus fought as a man (Phil. ii. 6, 7), and used that weapon
   which, as God, he had given to man (Eph. vi. 17). Jesus used the
   Scripture as of final, argument-ending authority. Eve also started with
   "God hath said" (Gen. iii. 3); but she was not constant in her
   adherence to God's word. Jesus permitted Satan neither to question nor
   pervert the Scripture], Man [In using the word "man" Jesus takes his
   stand with us as a human being] shall not live by bread alone [Called
   out of Egypt as God's Son (Matt. ii. 15), Jesus could well expect that
   he would be fed with manna after his forty days' fast. He trusted that
   God could furnish a table in the wilderness (Ps. lxxviii. 19). We, too,
   have abundant reason for a like trust. God gave us our lives, and gave
   his Son to redeem them from sin. He may let us suffer, but we can not
   perish is we trust him. Let us live by his word rather than by bread.
   It is better to die for righteousness than to live by sin. God fed
   Israel with supernatural bread, to show the people that they lived
   thus, and not by what they were pleased to call natural means. The
   stomach is a useful agent, but it is not the source of life, nor even
   the life sustainer. Those who think that the securing of bread is the
   first essential to the sustaining of life, will fail to seek any
   diviner food, and so will eventually starve with hunger--soul hunger.]
   ^a but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God [To
   satisfy our sense of duty is often more pleasant than to appease the
   pangs of hunger (John iv. 32-34; Job xxiii. 12; Jer. xv. 16). The trust
   of Jesus that God would speak in his behalf and save him, was like that
   of Job (Job xiii. 15). God can sustain our lives without food if he
   chooses. We shall live if God wills it, bread or no bread; and we shall
   likewise die at his word ( Matt. vi. 25; John vi. 47-58; Acts xvii.
   28). God can support our lives independent of our body--Matt. x. 28.] 5
   Then the devil taketh him [Matthew emphasizes the compulsory
   companionship of Satan. Jesus was in the hands of Satan as was Job (Job
   ii. 5, 6); but in Jesus' case Satan had the power of life and death,
   and he eventually took Jesus to the cross and slew him there] into the
   holy city [A common name for Jerusalem. The inscription on Jewish coins
   was "Jerusalem the Holy." Arabs to-day call it "el Kuds," "the Holy."
   The Holy City did not exclude the tempter nor temptations. The church
   may be the scene of man's sorest trial to resist wrong. But in the Holy
   City which is to come there will be no temptation]; ^c 9 And he led him
   to Jerusalem, ^a and set him [The two verbs "taketh" and "setting"
   imply that Satan exercised a control over the bodily person of our
   Lord] on the pinnacle of the temple [It is not known exactly what spot
   is indicated by the word "pinnacle." Hence three places have been
   contended for the proper locality: 1. The apex of the temple structure
   itself. 2. The top of Solomon's porch. 3. The top of Herod's royal
   portico. As to the temple itself, Josephus tells us that its roof was
   covered with spikes of gold, to prevent even birds from alighting upon
   it, and, if so, men could not stand upon it. Solomon's porch, or the
   eastern portico, faced the Mount of Olives, and has been fixed upon by
   tradition as the place from which James, the Lord's brother, was
   hurled. The royal portico of Herod was at the southeast corner of the
   temple enclosure, and overlooked the valley of Kidron. Here was then,
   and is yet, the greatest height about the temple, and it was,
   therefore, the most suitable place for Satan's proposal], 6 and saith {
   ^c said} ^a unto him, If [Godly life rests on faith. The life the devil
   would have us lead rests on ifs and uncertainties, on doubt and
   skepticism. We should note that foolish men doubt the divinity of
   Jesus, but the temptations of our Lord show how positively Satan was
   convinced of it. The opening scenes of Christ's ministry are redolent
   with his divinity. The Baptist asserted his purity and might, the
   Spirit visibly acknowledged his worthiness, the Father audibly
   testified to his Sonship, and the devil twice assaulted him as the
   divine champion] thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down [The first
   temptation was to under-confidence; the second to over-trust and
   presumption--two very dangerous conditions of the soul. Men begin by
   disparagingly doubting that Jesus can save them from their sins, and
   end by recklessly presuming that he will save them in their sins.
   Comparing this with Eve's temptation, we find that she was vainly
   curious to see if she might be like God (Gen. iii. 5), but Christ
   resisted such curiously. It is urged by some as to this temptation that
   there is no hint of vainglory or display, because nothing is said about
   casting himself down in the presence of the people, and that Jesus was
   merely taken to the temple because the sacred locality would tend to
   heighten his trust in the protecting promise which Satan quoted. But
   this ground is not well taken, for 1. The temple presumes a crowd. 2.
   We have a right to presume that this temptation would be like others to
   which Jesus was subjected. He was frequently invited to work miracles
   to satisfy curiosity, and he invariably refused to do so]: ^c from
   hence: 10 for it is written [This quotation is taken from Ps. xci. 11,
   12, and applies to man generally. Note 1. The devil's head is full of
   Scripture, but to no profit, for his heart is empty of it. 2. By
   quoting it he shows a sense of its power which modern rationalism would
   do well to consider. 3. Satan's abuse of Scripture did not discourage
   Christ's use of it], He shall give his angels charge concerning thee
   [Regarding Satan's words as a quotation, we are struck with the fact
   that his knowledge of this particular passage was based upon his
   personal experience. He had been confronted by the presence of the
   guardian angels and had fretted at it (Job i. 10; II. Kings vi. 8, 17;
   Ps. xxxiv. 7; Jude 9). As a temptation, Satan's words appeal to Jesus
   to be more religious; to put more trust and reliance upon the promises
   of the Father; and he puts him in the place--the temple--where he might
   argue that God could least afford to let his promise fail], to guard
   thee: 11 and, On their hands they shall bear thee up [All who love
   pomp, display of artistic taste, gaieties of fashion, intoxication of
   fame, etc., fall by this temptation. Those who truly rest on God's
   promises, stand on a sure foundation, but those who rise on bubbles
   must come down when they burst], Lest haply thou dash thy foot against
   a stone. 12 And Jesus answering, said unto him, ^a again it is written
   { ^c said,} ["Written," "said"; the writings of Scripture are in
   general the sayings of God. But the Bible is not made up of isolated
   texts. To get a right understanding we must compare Scripture with
   Scripture. We could have no higher indorsement of the Old Testament
   than this use of it by Christ. It was sufficient for him in his
   temptations, and with the addition of the New Testament, it is
   sufficient for us in all things--II. Tim. iii. 16, 17; Col. iii. 3-16],
   ^a Thou shalt not make trial [Make experiment upon God, set traps for
   him, put one's self in dangerous situations, hoping thereby to draw
   forth some show of loving deliverance. Had Jesus cast himself down, he
   would have demanded of the Father a needless miracle to prove his
   Sonship, and would thereby have put the love of God to an unnecessary
   trial. All who jeopardize themselves without any command of God or call
   of duty, make trial of his love] of the Lord thy God. 8 Again, the
   devil taketh him [whether naturally or supernaturally, "whether in the
   body or out of the body" (II. Cor. xii. 2-4 ), we can not tell. But it
   was a real, practical trial and temptation] unto an exceeding high
   mountain [it is immaterial which mountain this was; for from no
   mountain could one see the whole earth with the natural eye], ^c 5 And
   he led him up, ^a And showeth { ^c showed} ^a him [It is not said by
   either evangelist that Jesus saw the kingdoms from the mountain-top,
   but that Satan showed them to him. From any high Judæan mountain it
   would be easy for him to locate Rome, Greece, Egypt, Persia and
   Assyria, and as he pointed out their locality a few brief words of
   description would picture them to the imagination of Jesus, and cause
   their glories to move before his eyes. But it is very likely that to
   this description some sort of supernatural vision was added. It tempted
   the eye of Jesus as the luscious fruit did the eye of Eve--Gen. iii. 6]
   all the kingdoms of the world [It tempted Jesus to realize the dreams
   which the Jewish nation entertained. It was an appeal to him to reveal
   himself in the fullness of his power and authority as above generals,
   princes, kings, and all beings of all ages. An appeal to obtain by
   physical rather than by spiritual power; by the short-cut path of
   policy rather than by the long road of suffering and martyrdom. Jesus
   came to obtain the kingdoms of the world. He was born King of the Jews,
   and confessed himself to be a King before Pilate. All authority is now
   given to him, and he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his
   feet, and until all the kingdoms of the world become his kingdom.
   Satan's way to obtain this kingdom differed from God's way. He might
   obtain it by doing Satan's will and becoming his worshiper, or by
   worshiping God and doing his will. Satan would give the speedier
   possession, but God the more lasting. We also strive for a kingdom; but
   let us obtain ours as Christ did his], and the glory of them [That is,
   all their resources as well as their magnificence. Their cities, lands
   and people, their armies, treasures and temples, etc. Many parents, in
   encouraging their children to seek earthly glory and distinction,
   unconsciously assist Satan in urging this temptation]; ^c in a moment
   of time [These words strongly indicate that the prospect must have been
   supernaturally presented. The suddenness of the vision added greatly to
   the power of the temptation]; ^a 9 and he ^c the devil said unto him,
   To thee will I give all this authority { ^a All these things will I
   give thee,} [From the standpoint of Christ's humanity, how overwhelming
   the temptation! It was the world's honors to one who had for thirty
   years led the life of a village carpenter; it was the world's riches to
   him who had not where to lay his head. From the standpoint of Jesus'
   divinity the temptation was repulsive. It was a large offer in the
   sight of Satan, but a small one in the sight of him who made all the
   worlds. Such offers are large to the children of the world, but small
   to those who are by faith joint-heirs with Christ (Rom. viii. 17; Phil.
   iii. 7, 8). But the temptation was, nevertheless, very specious and
   plausible. The power of Jesus linked with that of Satan, and operating
   through Jewish fanaticism and pagan expectation would, in a few months,
   have brought the whole earth into one temporal kingdom, with Jesus as
   its head. But the kingdom of Christ rested upon a surer promise (Ps.
   ii. 8) than that here given by the "father of lies." God had promised,
   and, despite the pretensions of Satan, God had not yet retired from the
   government of the world. It was true that Satan and his emissaries had,
   by usurpation, gained an apparent possession of the world, but Jesus
   had right to it as the heir of God (Matt. xxi. 33-43 ). Being stronger
   than Satan, he had come to regain his kingdom, not by treaty, but by
   conquest (Luke xi. 19-22 ). Moreover, he would obtain it as a spiritual
   and not as a carnal kingdom. Servants of Christ should remember this.
   Every attempt to establish Messiah's kingdom as an outward, worldly
   dominion is an effort to convert the kingdom of heaven into the kingdom
   of the devil. God's kingdom can not be secularized. It should be noted
   also that Satan omits the words "if thou art the Son of God" in this
   instance, for their presence would have marred the force of the
   temptation. Note also that this was the only temptation wherein Satan
   evinced any show of generosity. He is slow to give anything, and most
   of us sell out to him for nothing--Isa. lii. 3], and the glory of them:
   for it hath been delivered unto me [Satan does not claim an absolute
   but a derivative right, and his claim is not wholly unfounded (John
   xii. 31; xiv. 30; xvi. 11). But the kingdom has been delivered unto him
   by men rather than by God (Eph. ii. 2). How much more quickly Jesus
   would have obtained power, had he received it from men by consenting to
   co-operate with them in their sinful practices as does Satan] ; and to
   whomsoever I will [Not so Jesus. His giving is according to the
   Father's will--Matt. ix. 23] I give it [The Emperor Tiberius then held
   it in the fullest sense ambition ever realized. Yet he was the most
   miserable and degraded of men. Satan knows how to take full toll for
   all that he gives.] 7 If [In the temptations Satan uses three "ifs."
   The first "if" is one of despairing doubt; the second, one of
   vainglorious speculation; the third, one of moral and spiritual
   compromise] thou therefore wilt ^a fall down and worship ^c before me
   [Satan and God each seek the worship of man, but from very different
   motives. God is holiness and goodness, and we are invited to worship
   him that we may thereby be induced to grow like him. But Satan seeks
   worship for vanity's sake. How vast the vanity which would give so
   great a reward for one act of worship! Verily the devil is fond of it.
   He gives nothing unless he obtains it, and all his generosity is
   selfishness. Worshiping before Satan is the bending of the soul rather
   than of the body. He holds before each of us some crown of success, and
   says: "Bend just a little; slightly compromise your conscience. Accept
   the help of Pharisee and Sadducee, and keep silent as to their sins.
   Mix a little diplomacy with your righteousness. Stoop just a little. If
   you do, I will aid you and insure your success. If you do not, I will
   defeat you and laugh at your failures." It is Satan's sin to make such
   suggestions, but it is not our sin until we comply with them. We may
   more quickly obtain by his wrong way, but more surely by God's right
   way. Let no Christian be humiliated or discouraged by gross temptation,
   since even the Son of God was tempted to worship the devil. What Jesus
   would not do, the Beast has done, and has received the kingdoms for a
   season (Rev. xiii. 1-9). Note, too, that it is all one whether we
   worship Satan, or mammon, the gift which he offers--Matt. vi. 24], it
   shall all be thine. 8 And ^a 10 Then ^c Jesus answered and said { ^a
   saith} ^c unto him, ^a Get thee hence [The passionate utterance of an
   aroused soul. Indignation is as divine as patience (Eph. iv. 26).
   Satan's sweetest temptation was most disgusting to Christ, for its sin
   was so grossly apparent. It ran counter to the very first of the ten
   commandments. Jesus would give it no room in his thoughts; he spurned
   it, as being as heinous as the law describes it (Deut. v. 6-11).
   Temptation must be peremptorily rejected. Jesus did not stop to weigh
   the worthiness of Satan; it was sufficient that God only is to be
   worshiped. As God, Jesus was himself an object of worship; but as man
   he worshiped the Father privately and publicly. Satan sought to command
   Jesus, but was commanded of him. Step by step Satan has obeyed this
   command, and foot after foot, earth's spiritual world has been yielded
   by his departing presence], Satan [The first and second temptations
   were so subtle and covert, and their sin so skillfully disguised, as to
   suggest that Satan himself was disguised. If so, his pride and vanity,
   revealed in this last temptation, betrayed him so that Jesus tore off
   his mask and called him by his right name. When he tempted him in a
   somewhat similar matter, Jesus called Simon Peter by this name (Matt.
   xvi. 23), but he laid a different command upon each of them. To Satan
   he spoke as an enemy, saying, "Get thee hence." He ordered Satan from
   his presence, for he had no proper place there. To Peter he spoke as to
   a presumptuous disciple, saying, "Get thee behind me." The disciple is
   a follower of his master, and his proper place is in the rear]: for it
   is written [Jesus gives a free translation of Deut. vi. 13. He
   substitutes the word "worship" for the word "fears." Fear prohibits
   false and induces true worship, and loving worship is the source of all
   acceptable service. The three Scripture quotations used by Jesus are
   all from the book of Deuteronomy. He struck Satan with that very part
   of the Spirit's sword which modern critical infidelity, in the name of
   religion, and often aided by so-called religious organizations, seeks
   to persuade us to cast away], Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
   him only shalt thou serve. [By serving God, Jesus obtained all the
   earthly authority which the devil offered him, and heavenly authority
   in addition thereto (Matt. xxviii. 18). So much better are the rewards
   of God than Satan's.] ^c 13 And when the devil had completed every
   temptation. ^a 11 Then the devil leaveth { ^c he departeth from} him
   for a season. [See Jas. iv. 7. But Satan left to return many times.
   Here was the first being endowed with human nature who had defeated
   Satan under all circumstances for thirty years. This was Satan's first
   defeat under Christ's ministry. His last is yet to come, and it shall
   come by this same Christ. Temptations are battles. They leave the
   victor stronger and the vanquished weaker. Hence Satan when resisted is
   represented as fleeing. But he only flees for a season. He never
   despairs of the conflict so long as man is on the earth. Christ was
   constantly tempted by the returning devil (Luke xxii. 28). As Jesus
   hung upon the cross, all these three temptations with their
   accompanying "ifs" were spread out before him--Matt. xxvii. 39-43] ^a
   and behold, angels came [They had probably witnessed the contest.
   Compare I. Cor. iv. 9; I. Tim. iii. 16. Angels do not appear again
   visibly ministering unto Jesus until we find him in Gethsemane (Luke
   xxii. 43). When Satan finally departs from us, we, too, shall find
   ourselves in the presence of angels--Luke xvi. 22] and ministered unto
   him. [Jesus was probably fed by the angels, as was Elijah by one of
   them (I. Kings xix. 4-7). Satan and suffering first, then angels,
   refreshment and rest. God had indeed given his angels charge, and they
   came to him who refused to put the father to the test. But they did not
   succor Jesus during his temptation, for that was to be resisted by
   himself alone--Isa. lxiii. 3.]

John's First Testimony to Jesus.

(Bethany Beyond Jordan, February, a.d. 27.)

^D John I. 19-34.

   ^d 19 And this is the witness of John [John had been sent to testify,
   "and" this is the matter of his testimony], when the Jews [The term
   "Jews" is used seventy times by John to describe the ruling classes of
   Judæa] sent unto him [In thus sending an embassy they honored John more
   than they ever honored Christ. They looked upon John as a priest and
   Judæan, but upon Jesus as a carpenter and Galilæan. It is probable that
   the sending of this investigating committee marks the period when the
   feelings of the rulers toward John changed from friendliness to
   hostility. At the first, probably led on by the prophecies of Daniel,
   these Jews found joy in John's coming (John v. 33-35). When they
   attended his ministry in person he denounced their wickedness and
   incurred their hatred] from Jerusalem priests and Levites [they were
   commissioned to teach (II. Chron. xv. 3; Neh. viii. 7-9 ), and it was
   probably because of their wisdom as teachers that they were sent to
   question John about his baptism] to ask him, Who art thou? 20 And he
   confessed, and denied not; and he confessed [The repetition here
   suggests John's firmness under repeated temptation. As the questioners
   ran down the scale from "Christ" to "that prophet," John felt himself
   diminishing in their estimation, but firmly declined to take honors
   which did not belong to him], I am not [in this entire section (vs.
   20-24) John places emphasis upon the pronoun "I," that he may contrast
   himself with Christ] the Christ [When the apostle John wrote this
   Gospel it had become fashionable with many of the Baptist's disciples
   to assert that the Baptist was the Christ. (Recognitions of Clement 1.
   50, 60; Olshausen, Hengstenberg, Godet.) In giving this testimony of
   the Baptist, John corrects this error; but his more direct purpose is
   to show forth John's full testimony, and give the basis for the words
   of Jesus found at John v. 33. The fact that the Jews were disposed to
   look upon John as the Messiah gave all the greater weight to his
   testimony; for the more exalted the person of the witness, the
   weightier are his words. John's own experience doubtless caused him to
   feel the influence of the Baptist's testimony.] 21 And they asked him,
   What then? Art thou Elijah? [Malachi had declared that Elijah should
   precede the Messiah (Mal. iv. 5). The Jews interpreted this prophecy
   literally, and looked for the return of the veritable Elijah who was
   translated (Matt. xvii. 10). This literal Elijah did return, and was
   seen upon the Mount of Transfiguration before the crucifixion of our
   Lord. But the prophecy of Malachi referred to a spiritual Elijah--one
   who should come "in the spirit and power of Elijah," and in this sense
   John fulfilled Malachi's prediction--Luke i. 17; Matt. xi. 14; xvii.
   12.] And he saith, I am not [He answered their question according to
   the sense in which they had asked it. He was not the Elijah who had
   been translated about nine hundred years before this time.] Art thou
   the prophet? [Moses had foretold a prophet who should come (Deut.
   xviii. 15-18), but the Jews appear to have had no fixed opinion
   concerning him, for some thought he would be a second Moses, others a
   second Elijah, others the Messiah. The Scriptures show us how uncertain
   they were about him (Matt. xvi. 14; John vi. 14; vii. 40, 41). As to
   Jeremiah being that prophet, see II. Macc. ii. 7. Even Christians
   disagree as to whether Moses refers to Christ or to a line of prophets.
   Though divided in opinion as to who this prophet would be, the Jews
   were fairly unanimous as to what he would do. Finding in their
   Scriptures two pictures of the Christ, one representing him as a great
   Conqueror, and the other of his priesthood, setting him forth as a
   great Sufferer, they took the pictures to refer to two personages, one
   denoting a king--the Messiah--and the other a prophet. The Jews to this
   day thus divide the Christ of prophecy, and seek to make him two
   personages.] And he answered, No. [He was not the prophet, either as he
   or they understood that term. John gives us a beautiful example of
   humility. Like Paul, he would not be overvalued--Acts xiv. 13-15; I.
   Cor. i. 12, 13.] 22 They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we
   may give an answer to them that sent us What sayest thou of thyself?
   [Unable to guess his office, they asked him to state it plainly.] 23 He
   said, I am the voice [It is as though John answered, "You ask who I am.
   My personality is nothing; my message everything. I shall pass away as
   a sound passes into silence; but the truth which I have uttered shall
   abide." In his answer John shows himself to be the spiritual Elijah,
   for he declares that he came to do the work of Elijah; viz.: to prepare
   the people for the advent of Messiah. There are many echoes in the
   world; but few voices] of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight
   the way of the Lord [prepare the minds and hearts of the people that
   Christ may freely enter in] , as said Isaiah the prophet. [Isa. xl. 3.]
   24 And they had been sent were from The Pharisees. [Of all the Jewish
   sects the Pharisees were most attentive to external rites and
   ceremonies, and hence would notice John's baptism more than would
   others. It is interesting to notice that the Pharisees, who were
   Christ's most bitter opponents, were warned of John about the presence
   of Messiah from the very beginning.] 25 And they asked him, and said
   unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither
   Elijah, neither the prophet? [If you are no more important personage,
   who do you presume to introduce any other ordinance than those provided
   for by the law of Moses? The question shows that to them John's baptism
   was a new rite. Even if proselyte baptism then existed at this time (of
   which there is certainly no sufficient evidence), it differed in two
   marked ways from John's baptism: 1. John baptized his converts, while
   proselytes baptized themselves. 2. John baptized Jews and not
   Gentiles.] 26 John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: but in
   the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, 27 even he that cometh
   after me [that is, follows in that way which I as forerunner am
   preparing for him], The latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to
   unloose. [The words "standeth" and "shoe" showed that the person of
   whom the Baptist spoke had a visible, bodily form. To loose the latchet
   was a peculiarly servile office. The Talmud says, "Every office a
   servant will do for his master, a scholar should perform for his
   teacher, except loosing his sandal-thong." The greatest prophet felt
   unworthy to render Christ this humble service, but unconverted sinners
   often presume to serve Christ according to their own will, and fully
   expect to have their service honored and rewarded. Taken as a whole,
   the answer of John appears indirect and insufficient. What was there in
   all this to authorize him to baptize? This appears to be his meaning:
   "You demand my authority for baptism. It rests in him for whom I
   prepare the way. It is a small matter to introduce baptism in water for
   one so worthy. If you accept him, my baptism will need no explanation;
   and if you reject him, my rite and its authority are both wholly
   immaterial."] 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan
   [Owing to variation in the manuscripts, we may read "Bethany" or
   "Bethabara," or even possibly "Bethabara in Bathania." Tradition fixes
   upon the Jericho ford, which is about five miles on an air line north
   of the Dead Sea, as the site of Jesus' baptism. But this spot is eighty
   miles from Cana of Galilee, and hence Jesus, leaving it on foot, could
   not well have attended the wedding in Cana on "the third day" (John ii.
   1 ). We must therefore look for Bethany or Bethabara farther up the
   river. John the Baptist was a roving preacher (Luke iii. 3), and during
   the forty days of Jesus' temptation seems to have moved up the river
   Jordan. Fifty miles above the Jericho ford, and ten miles south of the
   Sea of Galilee, Lieutenant Conder found a ford named 'Abarah (meaning
   "ferry"), which answers to Bethabara (meaning "house of the ferry"). It
   was in the land of Bashan, which in the time of Christ was called
   Bathania (meaning "soft soil"). This spot is only twenty-two miles from
   Cana. Being beyond the Jordan, it is not in Galilee, as Dr. Thomson
   asserts. Conder says: "We have collected the names of over forty fords,
   and no other is called 'Abarah; nor does the word occur again in all
   nine thousand names collected by the survey party."] where John was
   baptizing. 29 On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him [Jesus had
   just returned from the temptation in the wilderness. This is his first
   appearance in John's Gospel. The fact that John leaves out all the
   early history of Jesus shows that he wrote many years after the other
   evangelists, when all these facts were so well known as to need no
   mention by him], and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God [Lambs were
   commonly used for sin-offerings (Lev. iv. 32), and three of them were
   sacrificed in the cleansing of a leper (Lev. xiv. 10). A lamb was also
   the victim of the morning (9 A. M.) and evening (3 P. M.) sacrifice
   (Ex. xxix. 38)--the hours when Jesus was nailed to the cross and when
   he expired. A lamb was also the victim at the paschal supper. The great
   prophecy of Isaiah, setting forth the vicarious sacrifice of Christ
   (Isa. liii. 1-12) depicts him as a lamb, and in terms which answer
   closely to the words here used by John. The Jews to whom John spoke
   readily understood his allusion as being to sacrificial lambs; but they
   could not understand his meaning, for they had no thought of the
   sacrifice of a person. Jesus is called the Lamb of God because he is
   the lamb or sacrifice which God provided and accepted as the true and
   only sin-offering--Heb. x. 4-14; I. Pet. i. 19], that taketh away the
   sin of the world! [The present tense, "taketh," is used because the
   expiatory effect of Christ's sacrifice is perpetual, and the fountain
   of his forgiveness never fails. Expiated sin is this spoken of as being
   taken away (Lev. x. 17; Ex. xxxiv. 7; Num. xiv. 18). Some, seeking to
   avoid the vicarious nature of Christ's sacrifice, claim that the
   Baptist means that Jesus would gradually lift the world out of sin by
   his teaching. But lambs do not teach, and sin is not removed by
   teaching, but by sacrifice (Heb. ix. 22; Rev. v. 9). Jesus was
   sacrificed for the world, that is, for the entire human family in all
   ages. All are bought, but all do not acknowledge the purchase (II. Pet.
   ii. 1). He gives liberty to all, but all do not receive it, and some
   having received it return again to bondage (Gal. iv. 9). The Baptist
   had baptized for the remission of sins. He now points his converts to
   him who would make this promise good unto their souls. A Christian
   looks upon Christ as one who has taken away his past sin (I. Pet. ii.
   24), and who will forgive his present sin--I. John i. 9.] 30 This is he
   of whom I said [for this saying see John i. 15, 27] , After me cometh a
   man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. [As a man John
   was six months older than Jesus, but Jesus was the eternal Word. The
   Baptist therefore asserts here the pre-existence of our Lord.] 31 And I
   knew him not [had no such certain knowledge of him as would fit me to
   testify concerning him]; but that he should be made manifest to Israel,
   for this cause came I baptizing in water. [John baptized not only that
   he himself might know Christ by the spiritual sign, but also that
   through that knowledge duly published all Israel might know him.] 32
   And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a
   dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. [The descent of the Spirit
   served at least two purposes: 1. It enabled John to identify the
   Messiah. 2. It was, so to speak, an official recognition of Jesus as
   Messiah similar to the anointing or crowning of a king. It is asserted
   by some that it was of no benefit to Jesus, since his own divine powers
   permitted of no addition; but the language of Scripture indicates
   otherwise--Isa. xi. 2, 3; Luke iv. 17-19; John iii. 34 .] 33 And I knew
   him not [John's assertions that he did not know Jesus are assertions
   that he did not know him to be the Messiah. He believed it, as appears
   from his reluctance to baptize him, but he did not know it. His
   language to the people shows this (John i. 26). Many of the people must
   have known Jesus, but none of them knew him to be the Messiah.
   Moreover, when John denied that he knew Jesus as Messiah we must not
   take it that he was ignorant of the past history of Jesus. No doubt he
   knew in a general way who Jesus was; but as the official forerunner and
   announcer of Jesus, and as the heaven-sent witness ( John i. 6, 7), it
   was necessary that the Baptist should receive, by personal revelation
   from God, as here stated, an indubitable, absolute knowledge of the
   Messiahship of Jesus. Without this, John would not have been truly
   qualified as a witness. That Jesus is the Son of God must not rest on
   hearsay evidence. John kept silent till he could testify of his own
   knowledge]: but he that sent me [thus humbly does John claim his divine
   commission as a prophet] to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon
   whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him
   [John seems to emphasize the abiding of the Spirit. The Spirit of God
   was also bestowed upon the prophets and the apostles, but in them his
   power was intermittent, and not constant; visions came to them
   intermittently, but with Christ the fellowship of the Spirit was
   continuous], the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. [Christ
   bestows the Spirit upon his own. If he himself received the Spirit at
   the time of his baptism, why should it be thought strange that he
   bestows the Spirit upon his disciples at the time of their
   baptism?--See Acts ii. 38; xix. 1-7; Tit. iii. 5.] 34 And I have seen
   [that is, I have seen the promised sign], and have borne witness that
   this is the Son of God. [This is the climax of John's testimony. It was
   twofold, embracing the results of the two senses of sight and hearing.
   1. John saw the dove-like apparition of the Spirit, which convinced him
   that Jesus was the one to baptize in the Spirit. 2. He heard the voice
   of the Father, which convinced him that Jesus was the Son of God. As to
   each of these two facts he had a separate revelation, appealing to a
   different sense, and each given by the personage of the Deity more
   nearly concerned in the matter revealed. John was not only to prepare
   the people to receive Christ by calling them to repentance, and
   baptizing them for the remission of their sins; there was another work
   equally great and important to be performed. Their heads as well as
   their hearts needed his preparatory services. His testimony ran counter
   to and corrected popular opinion concerning Christ. We see that John
   corrected four errors: 1. The Jews looked for a Messiah of no greater
   spiritual worthiness than John himself, but the Baptist disclaimed even
   the right to unlace the Lord's shoe, that he might emphasize the
   difference between himself and the Messiah in point of spiritual
   excellency. 2. The Jews looked for one who would come after Moses,
   David, and the prophets, and lost sight of the fact that he would be
   before them, both in point of time and of honor (Matt. xxii. 41-46). 3.
   The Jews looked for a liberator from earthly bondage--a glorious king;
   John pointed them to a liberator from spiritual bondage, a perfect
   sacrifice acceptable to God. 4. The Jews looked for a human Messiah, a
   son of David. John enlarged their idea, by pointing them to a Messiah
   who was also the Son of God. When the Jews accept John's guidance as a
   prophet, they will believe in the Messiahship of Jesus.]

Jesus Makes His First Disciples.

(Bethany Beyond Jordan, Spring a.d. 27.)

^D John I. 35-51.

   ^d 35 Again on the morrow [John's direct testimony bore fruit on the
   second day] John was standing, and two of his disciples [An audience of
   two. A small field; but a large harvest]; 36 and he looked [Gazed
   intently. The word is used at Mark xiv. 67; Luke xxii. 61 Mark x. 21,
   27. John looked searchingly at that face, which, so far as any record
   shows, he was never to see on earth again. The more intently we look
   upon Jesus, the more powerfully we proclaim him] upon Jesus as he
   walked [This detail seems to be introduced to show that the Baptist did
   not stop Jesus and enter into familiar conversation with him. The
   witness of John was wholly that of an inspired, unbiased prophet, and
   not that of a friend or a familiar acquaintance], and saith, Behold the
   Lamb of God! [John repeats this testimony. He might have chosen another
   message, but preferred this one. Paul also had but one theme--I. Cor.
   ii. 2; Gal. vi. 14.] 37 And the two disciples [Andrew and probably
   John, the writer of this Gospel. The following are indications that it
   was John: 1. From this time on he speaks as an eye-witness. 2. We have
   no other account in his Gospel on his call to discipleship. 3. On seven
   other occasions in this Gospel he withholds his name--John xiii. 23;
   xix. 26, 35; xx. 2; xxi. 7, 20, 24] heard him speak, they followed
   Jesus. [Here is the fountainhead of Christianity, for Christianity is
   following Jesus.] 38 And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and
   saith unto them, What seek ye? [They doubtless felt such awe and
   reverence for the person of Jesus as would make them hesitate to
   address him. Hence Jesus himself opens the way for intercourse with
   himself.] And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being
   interpreted, Teacher) [By the way in which John explains Jewish words
   and customs, it becomes apparent that his Gospel was written for
   Gentiles as well as for Jews. Some take these explanations as evidence
   that John's Gospel was written after the destruction of the temple at
   Jerusalem. They are indeed a slight evidence of this, for it is more
   expedient to explain a custom which has ceased to exist than one which
   survives to explain itself] , where abidest thou? 39 He saith, Come,
   and ye shall see. [The fitting invitation of him who says: "Seek, and
   ye shall find."] They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they
   abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. [It being a
   crisis in his life, John remembered the very hour. If John reckoned
   time according to the Jewish method, it was about 4 P. M. If according
   to the Roman method, it was 10 A. M. We are inclined to accept the
   latter as correct.] 40 One of the two that heard John speak, and
   followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He findeth first
   [before he did anything else] his own brother Simon [The word "own" is
   here coupled with "brother" to show that Simon was not a mere relative
   (as the word "brother" might mean), but it was literally Andrew's
   brother] and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being
   interpreted, Christ). ["Messiah" is Hebrew, "Christ" is Greek,
   "Anointed" is English. Jesus is the anointed of God. In finding him,
   Andrew had made the greatest discovery which it is possible for a man
   to make.] 42 He brought him unto Jesus. [Thus Andrew has in a sense the
   honor of being the first Christian evangelist.] Jesus looked upon him,
   and said, Thou art Simon [this name means "hearing"] the son of John:
   thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
   [Cephas is Hebrew, Peter is Greek, stone is English. It means a mass of
   rock detached from the bed-rock or strata on which the earth rests. The
   future tense, "thou shalt be," indicates that Peter was to win his
   name. It is given prophetically to describe the stability to which the
   then weak and vacillating Simon should attain.] 43 On the morrow he was
   minded to go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip [In the synoptists,
   Philip is a mere name in the apostolic list. Through John we gain some
   acquaintance with him--vi. 5; xii. 21; xiv. 8]: and Jesus saith unto
   him, Follow me. [The Lord's usual invitation to discipleship-- Matt.
   viii. 22; ix. 9; xix. 21; Mark ii. 14; x. 21; Luke v. 27; ix. 59; John
   xxi. 19.] 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida [Bethsaida of Galilee, on
   the northwestern shore of the Lake of Galilee. It was a wicked
   place--Matt. xi. 21], of the city of Andrew and Peter. [It appears that
   Peter afterward removed to Capernaum--Mark i. 29.] 45 Philip findeth
   Nathanael [Nathanael is commonly identified with Bartholomew for the
   following reasons: 1. The name Bartholomew is only a patronymic, and
   hence its bearer would be likely to have an additional name. (Compare
   Matt. xvi. 17; Acts iv. 36.) 2. John never mentions Bartholomew, and
   the Synoptists never mention Nathanael, though John mentions him among
   apostles at the beginning and at the close of Christ's ministry. 3. The
   Synoptists, in their list of apostles, invariably place Philip next to
   Bartholomew, and show a tendency to place brothers and friends
   together. 4. All the other disciples mentioned in this chapter become
   apostles, and none are so highly commended as Nathanael. 5. Bartholomew
   is connected with Matthew in the list at Acts i. 13, and the names
   Matthew and Nathanael both mean the same, and are equal to the Greek
   name Theodore, which means "gift of God." But even so the
   identification is not perfect] , and saith unto him, We have found him,
   of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote [The whole law is
   full of symbolism which refers to Christ. The following references may
   be taken as more specific: Gen. xlix. 10; Num. xxiv. 17-19; Deut.
   xviii. 15. The passages in the prophets are too numerous to mention.
   For samples see Isa. vii. 14; ix. 6; lii. 13; liii. 1-12; Ezek. xxxiv.
   23-31. In brief, Moses wrote of him as a Prophet, David as Lord, Isaiah
   as the Son of the virgin and suffering Servant, Jeremiah as the Branch,
   Ezekiel as the Shepherd, Malachi as the Messenger of the Covenant,
   Daniel as the Messiah. Christ is the hero and subject-matter of both
   Testaments--I. Pet. i. 11; John v. 39], Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
   Joseph. [Philip knew no better at this time, and John did not change
   the words of Philip to suit his later knowledge of Christ's parentage.
   John has already declared the divine origin of Jesus (ver. 14), thereby
   agreeing with the detailed account of Matthew and Luke.] 46 And
   Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
   [Because of their want of culture, their rude dialect, and their
   contact with Gentiles, the Galileans were lightly esteemed by the
   inhabitants of Judæa (John vii. 52). But here Nathanael, a Galilean
   himself, speaks slightingly of Nazareth. Some think that Nazareth was
   no worse than the rest of Galilee, and that Nathanael speaks thus
   disparagingly because he dwelt in the neighboring town of Cana, and
   felt that jealousy which often exists between rival villages. The
   guileless Nathanael had no such jealousy, and the persistency with
   which the enemies of Jesus called him the Nazarene indicates that there
   was more than a local odium attached to the name Nazareth. Moreover, it
   was the first city to offer violence to Christ and was ready on one
   day's acquaintance with his preaching to put him to death.] Philip
   saith to him, Come and see. [So said afterward the woman of Samaria
   (John iv. 29). Investigation removes prejudice.] 47 Jesus saw Nathanael
   coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed [An
   Israelite in spirit as well as in flesh (Rom. ii. 28, 29; ix. 16). Such
   a character contrasted sharply with the prevalent formalism and
   hypocrisy of that day], in whom is no guile! [Some see in the word
   guile a reference to Jacob. He was a man full of all subtlety and guile
   in his early years, but his experience at Peniel (Gen. xxxii. 22-31)
   changed his nature and his name, and he became Israel, the spiritual
   father of all true Israelites.] 48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence
   knowest thou me? [Nathanael's surprise clearly indicates that the
   knowledge which Jesus exhibited was miraculous. Jesus answered and said
   unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig
   tree, I saw thee. [The fig-tree affords the densest shade in
   Palestine--a shade where no sunspot can be seen. This fact has made it
   immemorially a resting-place and a refuge from the fierce Syrian
   sunlight. Under such a cover Jesus saw Nathanael when he was alone.
   Such superhuman knowledge wrought faith in Nathanael, as it did
   afterward in the woman of Samaria.--See Prov. xv. 3.] 49 Nathanael
   answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art
   the King of Israel. [Psalm ii. and Isa. ix. 6 prophetically announce
   Jesus as the Son of God. These and other prophecies had just been more
   clearly announced by the Baptist (ver. 34). It is clear, therefore,
   where Nathanael got his words; but it is not so clear how well he
   understood them. This is the first recorded uninspired confession of
   the divinity of Jesus, but Matt. xvi. 16, 17 indicates that it was but
   partially comprehended, else Peter might have been instructed by
   Nathanael. The expression "King of Israel" probably expressed the hope
   which Nathanael then entertained that Jesus would restore the ancient
   Jewish kingdom of David--Acts i. 6.] 50 Jesus answered and said unto
   him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree,
   believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. [Nathanael
   regarded the revelation of his character and whereabouts as a great
   thing, but he was destined to see yet greater miracles. Opportunities
   improved lead to larger privileges, and for those who believe, the
   evidences are increased.] 51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily
   [This word means "in truth." John twenty-five times represents the
   Saviour as thus using the double "verily." Matthew quotes the single
   "verily" thirty times, Mark fourteen times, and Luke seven times. The
   word is used to mark the importance of the truth about to be uttered] ,
   I say unto you ["you" is plural and includes all present as well as
   Nathanael], Ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
   and descending upon the Son of man. [Jesus having referred to Nathanael
   as a true Israelite, promises to him--and to those like him--a blessing
   answering to Jacob's vision of the ladder; that is, that the ascent and
   descent of ministering angels shall be by means of Christ. Jesus calls
   himself the Son of man upwards of eighty times. The expression is found
   in all four Gospels, but is there invariably used by Christ himself.
   Stephen (Acts vii. 56) and John (Rev. i. 13) also use this title, to
   indicate that the glorious being whom they saw was like Jesus--like him
   in his human estate. In this chapter Jesus has been called by others
   "The Lamb of God," "the Son of God," "the Messiah," and "the King of
   Israel." Jesus chooses yet another title, "Son of man," for himself. At
   this earliest dawning of their expectations, while their minds were
   thus full of his titles of glory, Jesus introduces to his disciples
   this one which speaks of his humanity and humility. The expression may
   have been suggested by Dan. vii. 13, 14.]

Jesus Works His First Miracle at Cana in Galilee.

^D John II. 1-11.

   ^d 1 And the third day [From the calling of Philip (John i. 43). The
   days enumerated in John's first two chapters constitute a week, and may
   perhaps be intended as a contrast to the last week of Christ's ministry
   ( John xii. 1). It took two days to journey from the Jordan to Cana]
   there was a marriage [In Palestine the marriage ceremony usually began
   at twilight. The feast after the marriage was at the home of the
   bridegroom, and was sometimes prolonged for several days (Gen. xxix.
   27; Judg. xiv. 12); but in this case it seems likely that poverty
   limited the wedding feast to one day.] in Cana of Galilee [The site of
   Cana is disputed. From the eighth century a place called Kefr-Kenna
   (village of Cana), lying a little over three miles northeast of
   Nazareth, has been regarded as John's Cana of Galilee. But recently
   some ruins called Khurbet-Cana, twelve miles north of Nazareth, which
   doubtfully are said to have retained the name of Kana-el-Jilil (Cana of
   Galilee), have been preferred by some as the true site. In our judgment
   Kefr-Kenna has the stronger claim. It is situated on a westward slope
   of a hill, with a copious and unfailing spring adjoining it on the
   southwest]; and the mother of Jesus was there [John never called our
   Lord's mother by her name. He assumes that she is known to his readers.
   This is one of the many points tending to show the supplemental
   character of John's Gospel. He avoids repeating what is found in the
   first three Gospels]: 2 and Jesus also was bidden [being the Creator of
   woman, and the author of matrimony, it was fitting that the Son of God
   should grace a marriage feast with his presence] , and his disciples,
   to the marriage. [This is the earliest use of the term "disciples" in
   the ministry of Jesus. His disciples were Andrew, Peter, Philip,
   Nathanael, and probably John and James.] 3 And when the wine failed
   [Probably the arrival of Christ and his disciples helped to exhaust the
   supply. Shortage of provision when guests are invited is considered a
   sore humiliation the world over], the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
   They have no wine. [The interest which Mary took in the feast and the
   way in which she addressed the servants at verse 5, suggests that she
   was a close friend of the bridegroom's family. Though she merely states
   the unfortunate condition to Jesus, her statement is a covert petition
   to him that would remedy it, as our Lord's answer shows. She
   practically requested him to work a miracle, nor is it strange that she
   should do this. Remembering the many early sayings about him which she
   had treasured in her heart (Luke ii. 19, 51), and doubtless being
   informed of what had occurred at his baptism, and of the proclamation
   which John the Baptist had made concerning him, and seeing a group of
   disciples gathered about him, it was very reasonable for her to expect
   him to do something which would reveal the high purposes for which he
   had been born.] 4 And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do
   with thee? [Jesus did not call her "mother," but "woman," a term of
   courteous respect, but indicating no spirit of obedience. Says
   Augustine, "As much as to say thou art not the mother of that in me
   which worketh miracles." Moses recognized that parental duties were
   subordinate to divine (Deut. xxxiii. 9); and Jesus emphasized the
   principles (Matt. x. 37). Jesus taught that relationship to him was
   spiritual, and not fleshly (Matt. xii. 46-50), and Paul coveted such
   relationship (II. Cor. v. 16, 17). The expression, "What have I," etc.,
   is used frequently in the Scriptures and invariably indicates a mild
   rebuke (Judg. xi. 12; II. Sam. xvi. 10; I. Kings xvii. 18; II. Kings
   iii. 13; Matt. viii. 29; Mark i. 24; Luke viii. 28). It means, "leave
   me to act as I please," and Jesus uses it to assert that he is
   independent of all human relationships in the exercise of his
   Messiahship. It corrects two errors taught by the Catholic Church: 1.
   Catholicism says that our Lord's mother was immaculate, but if this
   were true she could not have incurred our Lord's rebuke. 2. Catholicism
   teaches that Mary's intercession is recognized by Christ. But this is
   the only instance on record of such intercession, and though it was
   addressed to Christ while in the flesh and was concerning a purely
   temporal matter, it was promptly rebuked.] mine hour is not yet come.
   [Our Lord's answer indicates that Mary's request had in it more than a
   desire for the gift of wine. What she principally wanted was to have
   Jesus manifest himself as Messiah. Now, Jesus gave many secondary, but
   only one supreme, manifestation of his glory or Messiahship. His
   miracles were secondary manifestations, but his Passion was the supreme
   manifestation (John viii. 28; ii. 18, 19; Matt. xii. 38-40). Jesus
   called this supreme sign his "hour" (John xii. 23, 27; xvii. 1; Matt.
   xxvi. 45; Luke xxii. 53; see also John vii. 30; viii. 20). His mother
   sought for a supreme sign, but at that time only a secondary sign could
   be fittingly given. The triumph at Pentecost was not to be achieved at
   Cana.] 5 His mother saith unto the servants [though he had spoken words
   of rebuke, his mother was neither offended nor discouraged because of
   them], Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. [She commands unlimited
   obedience. Though her words are not addressed to us, they will prove of
   untold profit to us if we obey them.] 6 Now there were six waterpots of
   stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying [The details of the
   account suggest that John was an eye-witness. The Jews regarded
   themselves as ceremonially unclean if they did not wash their hands
   before eating--Matt. xv. 2; Mark vii. 3, 4], containing two or three
   firkins apiece. [At Kefr-Kenna an old, one-story house near the lower
   edge of the village is regarded by the Greeks as the one in which this
   wedding feast was held. The room is a rude chapel, and at one side
   stand two old stone mortars, one holding about eight gallons and the
   other about ten, now used for immersing infants, but said by the
   attending priest to be two of the identical waterpots here mentioned.
   The simple-minded old man was not aware that the six waterpots held
   each two or three firkins apiece--between eighteen and twenty-seven
   gallons, a firkin being nine gallons--or double the quantity of his
   mortars. If he had known this, he might have chiseled out his mortars a
   little deeper!] 7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.
   [The jars had been partially emptied by the ablutions of the company.]
   And they filled them up to the brim. [This statement serves two
   purposes. 1. It emphasizes the great quantity. 2. It shows there was no
   room to add anything whatever to the contents of the jars. As to the
   quantity, it was between 106 and 162 gallons. As we do not know the
   number of guests nor the duration of the feast, we can not accurately
   measure the Lord's bounty. But as twelve basketfuls were left after
   feeding the five thousand, there was doubtless here a like sufficiency,
   and the surplus would serve as an acceptable gift to the married
   couple.] 8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now [the word "now" seems
   to indicate the turning-point when the water became wine], and bear
   unto the ruler of the feast. [According to the custom of that age, one
   of the guests was usually chosen to preside over such festivities, and
   he was called the ruler. Our modern toastmaster is probably a relic of
   this ancient custom.] And they bare it. 9 And when the ruler of the
   feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but
   the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast
   called the bridegroom, 10 and saith unto him, Every man setteth on
   first [when the taste is sharpest, and most critical] the good wine
   [the adjective "good" refers rather to flavor than to strength]; and
   when men have drunk freely [The ruler was no disciple of Jesus, and he
   speaks in the merry spirit of the world. He gives his own experience as
   to the habits of feasts, and his words give no indication that those
   present indulged to excess], then that which is worse: thou hast kept
   the good wine until now. [It is part of Christ's system to reserve the
   best until the last. Sin's first cup is always the sweetest, but with
   God that which follows is ever superior to that which has preceded it.
   As to the bearing of this miracle upon the question of temperance, the
   New Testament elsewhere clearly condemns the immoderate use of wine,
   and as these condemnations proceed from Christ we may rightly conceive
   of him, as in this instance, doing nothing contrary thereto. The
   liquors of this land in the strength of their intoxicating properties
   differ so widely from the light wines of Palestine that even the most
   moderate use of them seems immoderate in comparison. In creating wine
   Jesus did no more than as Creator and Renewer of the earth he had
   always done. From the beginning God has always so created or
   replenished the earth as to allow the possibility of excess.] 11 This
   beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his
   glory [This was the beginning or first of the miracles, and John's
   statement brands as false all the Catholic traditions which tell of
   miracles performed by Christ in his childhood. We should note also that
   it was a sign. The value of the miracle was in what it signified, not
   in what it wrought. It manifested the glory of Christ, part of which
   glory is his power to change the worse into the better, the simpler
   into the richer. It is the glory of Christ that he can transform
   sinners into his own likeness--I. John iii. 2; I. Cor. xv. 42-44; Phil.
   iii. 20, 21]; and his disciples believed on him. [In this chapter John
   as a disciple three times gives us a disciple's point of view as to
   Christ's miracles; here, and at verse 17 and at verse 22. They
   implanted faith in those whose hearts were right before God (John v.
   38). The miracles of Christ created widespread excitement. There had
   been none of a notorious nature since Daniel had been cast to the
   lions, and had read the writing on Belshazzar's wall some five hundred
   and eighty years before.]

Jesus' First Residence at Capernaum.

^D John II. 12.

   ^d 12 After this he went down to Capernaum [The site of Capernaum is
   generally conceded to be marked by the ruins now called Tel-Hum. Jesus
   is said to have gone "down" because Cana is among the hills, and
   Capernaum was by the Lake of Galilee, about six hundred feet below sea
   level], he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples [There
   is much dispute as to what the New Testament writers mean by the phrase
   the "brethren of the Lord." This phrase, found in any other than a
   Jewish book, would be taken to mean either the full or half brothers of
   Jesus, and it has probably that meaning here. The Catholic Church,
   contending for the perpetual virginity of our Lord's mother, has argued
   that his brethren were either the sons of Joseph by a former marriage,
   or that they were sons of Alphæus (also called Clopas) and a sister of
   our Lord's mother, who, like her, was also called Mary (John xix. 25).
   This latter view is based upon the fact that two of the sons of Alphæus
   bear the same names as those borne by two of our Lord's brethren, which
   is far more conclusive, since the names James and Judas were extremely
   common. Moreover, we learn from John vii. 5, that the Lord's brethren
   did not believe on him, and harmonists place the time of this unbelief
   late in our Lord's ministry, when the sons of Alphæus were not only
   believers, but some of them even apostles. Our Lord's brethren are
   mentioned nine times in the New Testament, and a study of these
   references will give us some light. Three of them, viz.: John vii. 3,
   5, 10; I. Cor. ix. 5; Gal. i. 19, are rather noncommittal. The other
   six (Matt. xii. 46; xiii. 55; Mark iii. 32; vi. 3; Luke viii. 19, 20;
   John ii. 12) speak of his brethren in connection with his mother, and
   strongly indicate that Jesus was the first-born son of Mary, and that
   she had at least four other sons, besides daughters. These brethren of
   Jesus are constantly represented as attending his mother, without a
   hint that they were not her children. Against this conclusion there is
   but one argument which has any force; namely, that our Lord committed
   his mother into the keeping of the apostle John, rather than to his
   brethren (John xix. 25-27), but this fact may be easily accounted for.
   Many mothers are but scantily and grudgingly supported by their sons];
   and there they abode not many days. [Because the passover was at hand,
   and he went up to Jerusalem. This notice of the brief sojourn of Jesus
   at Capernaum throws light on several things: 1. It shows where Jesus
   spent most of his time between his baptism and the first passover. 2.
   It helps to explain how the nobleman, who afterwards sought him at
   Cana, became acquainted with him. 3. It prepares us to look for his
   first visit to Nazareth at a later period. 4. It also explains why
   Jesus sought Capernaum as his place of residence after leaving
   Nazareth. Moreover, it shows that the natural ties of kindred were not
   immediately snapped by Christ. Until he went up to the first passover,
   he abode with his mother and his brethren.]

Jesus Attends the First Passover of His Ministry.

(Jerusalem, April 9, a.d. 27.)

Subdivision A. Jesus Cleanses the Temple.

^D John II. 13-25.

   ^d 13 And the passover of the Jews was at hand [We get our information
   as to the length of our Lord's ministry from John's Gospel. He groups
   his narrative around six Jewish festivals: 1, He here mentions the
   first passover; 2, another feast, which we take to have been also a
   passover (v. 1); 3, another passover (vi. 4); 4, the feast of
   tabernacles (vii. 2); 5, dedication (x. 22); 6, passover (xi. 55). This
   gives the entire length of our Lord's ministry as three years and a
   fraction], and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. [It was fitting that he
   should enter upon his full ministry in this city, as it was still the
   center of what was recognized as a heaven-revealed worship. The fitness
   of Jerusalem for such beginnings was afterwards recognized in the
   preaching of the gospel of the New or Christian dispensation--Acts i.
   8.] 14 And he found in the temple [Our English word "temple" includes
   two Greek words; namely, 1. The naos, or sanctuary--the small structure
   which contained the holy and most holy places, and which answered to
   the tabernacle used in the wilderness. 2. The heiron, or entire court
   space which surrounded the naos, and which included some nineteen
   acres. The heiron was divided into four courts, and as one entered
   toward the naos from the east, he passed successively through them, as
   follows: 1, Court of the Gentiles; 2, of the women; 3, of Israel; 4, of
   the priests. It was in this outer or Gentiles' court that the markets
   described in this section were held] Those that sold oxen and sheep and
   doves, and the changers of money sitting [This market in the temple was
   for the convenience of the people, and the nearness of the passover
   increased its size. Oxen and doves were constantly needed for
   sacrificial purposes, and as each family which ate the passover
   required a lamb, they would be in the market in great abundance.
   Josephus tells us it required about two hundred thousand lambs for the
   passover feast, but his exaggerations will stand a liberal discount]:
   15 and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all [The rest of the verse
   shows that "all" does not refer to men, but to sheep and oxen. The
   scourge was used in driving them out] out of the temple, both the sheep
   and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew
   their tables [The Jews were each required to pay, for the support of
   the temple service, one half-shekel annually (Ex. xxx. 13; Matt. xvii.
   24). These money-changers sat at small tables, on which their coins
   were piled and counted]; 16 and to them that sold the doves he said,
   Take these things hence [As the doves were in cages of wicker-work,
   they could not be driven out; hence Jesus called upon their owners to
   remove them. Though Jesus cleansed the house, he wrought no waste of
   property. The sheep and oxen were safe outside the temple, the
   scattered money could be gathered from the stone pavement, and the
   doves were not set free from their cages]; make not my Father's house a
   house of merchandise. [Jesus bases his peculiar authority over the
   temple on his peculiar relationship to Him for whom the temple was
   built. As a Son, he purged the temple of his Father. In the beginning
   of his ministry he contested their right to thus appropriate his
   Father's house to their uses, but in the end of his ministry he spoke
   of the temple as "your house" ( Matt. xxiii. 38), thereby indicating
   that the people had taken unto themselves that which truly belonged to
   God, even as the wicked husbandmen appropriated the vineyard (Luke xx.
   14, 15). The rebuke of Jesus was addressed to the priests, for the
   market belonged to them, and the money-changers were their agents.
   Edersheim says that this traffic alone cleared the priests about three
   hundred thousand dollars a year. Though churches differ widely from the
   temple, they are still God's houses, and should not be profaned.
   Religion should not be mixed with traffic, for traffic tends toward
   sin. Phariseeism is its fruit--a wish to carry on profitable business,
   even with God. On this occasion Jesus objected to the use of the temple
   for trade without criticising the nature of the trade. When he purged
   the temple three years later, he branded the traders as robbers--Matt.
   xxi. 13.] 17 His disciples remembered that it was written [Ps. lxix.
   9], Zeal for [loving concern for] thy house shall eat me up. 18 The
   Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto
   us, seeing that thou doest these things? [The Jews felt that only a
   divinely commissioned person could thus interfere with the ordering of
   God's house. They therefore called upon Jesus to give them a sign as an
   evidence that he possessed such divine commission. The manner in which
   he had cleansed the house of its trafficers was of itself a sign, if
   they had only had eyes to see it. Jesus could not have thus cleansed
   the temple unaided had he been a mere man. The power which he showed in
   the temple was much like that which he manifested in Gethsemane--John
   xviii. 6.] 19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple,
   and in three days I will raise it up. [John here records this saying,
   and Matthew (ch. xxvi. 61) and Mark (xiv. 58) tells us how at the trial
   it was twisted into a charge against Christ; thus the Evangelists
   supplement each other. For the temple in this sentence uses the word
   "naos," or sanctuary, the structure which was peculiarly the seat of
   God's presence. The sanctuary was a figure or symbol of the body of
   Christ, and the words of Jesus were a covert prediction that as they
   were desecrating the symbol so would they destroy his body, which it
   symbolized. They reverenced the Spirit of God neither as it dwelt in
   the sanctuary nor as it dwelt in the body of Christ. The body of Jesus
   was a temple (Col. ii. 9), and Christians and the church are also
   temples (I. Cor. iii. 16, 17; vi. 19; II. Cor. v. 1; II. Pet. i. 13).
   God's temples can not be permanently destroyed. They are "raised up."]
   20 The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in
   building [The temple which then stood upon Mt. Moriah was the third
   structure which had occupied that site. The first temple, built by
   Solomon (b.c. 1012-1005), was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. The second
   temple, built by Zerubbabel and Jeshua (b.c. 520), had been torn down
   and rebuilt by Herod the Great, but in such a manner as not to
   interfere with the temple service. The sanctuary was completed in one
   year and a half, while the courts required eight years. Josephus says
   eighteen thousand workmen were employed in its erection. Additional
   outbuildings and other work had been carried on from that time, and the
   whole was not completed until a.d. 64], and wilt thou raise it up in
   three days? [To put before him the difficulty of what he apparently
   proposed to do, they merely mention one item--time. They say nothing of
   the army of workmen, nothing of a variety and cost of material, nothing
   of the skill required in the process of construction. How impossible
   seemed his offer! Yet by no means so impossible as that real offer
   which they misunderstood. A man might rear a temple in three days, but,
   apart from Christ Jesus, self-resurrection is unknown to history.] 21
   But he spake of the temple of his body [John differs from the other
   three Evangelists, in that he frequently comments upon the facts which
   he records. Both history and commentary are inspired.] 22 When
   therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he
   spake this [It was three years before they understood this saying. Thus
   truth often lies dormant for years before it springs up in the heart
   and bears fruit--I. Cor. xv. 58; Eccles. xi. 1]; and they believed the
   scripture [several passages foretell the resurrection--Ps. xvi. 9, 10;
   lxviii. 18], and the word which Jesus had said. [They believed that
   Jesus had meant to predict that the Jews would kill him, and that he
   would rise again on the third day.] 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at
   the passover, during the feast [the seven days' feast of unleavened
   bread--Lev. xxiii. 5, 6], many believed on his name, beholding his
   signs which he did. [We have no description of the miracles wrought at
   this time. See John iv. 45; xx. 30.] 24 But Jesus did not trust himself
   unto them, for that he knew all men [The word here translated "trust"
   is the same as that translated "believe" in the preceding verse. They
   trusted him, but he did not trust them, for he knew them. He did not
   tell them anything of his plans and purposes, and the conversation with
   Nicodemus which follows is a sample of this reticence], 25 and because
   he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he
   himself knew what was in man. [John gives us many examples of this
   supernatural knowledge which Jesus possessed. See i. 42, 47, 48; iii.
   3; iv. 29; vi. 61, 64; xi. 4, 14; xiii. 11; xxi. 17. This chapter
   itself gives us a faithful picture of "what was in man." We find in it
   temple, profaners, money-makers, sign-seekers, opposers of reform,
   false and weak professors of faith, etc., but none to whom Jesus could
   trust himself.]

Jesus Attends the First Passover of His Ministry.

(Jerusalem, April 9, a.d. 27.)

Subdivision B. Jesus Talks with Nicodemus.

^D John III. 1-21.

   ^d 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
   the Jews. [Nicodemus is mentioned only by John. His character is marked
   by a prudence amounting almost to timidity. At John vii. 50-52 he
   defends Jesus, but without committing himself as in any way interested
   in him: at John xix. 38, 39 he brought spices for the body of Jesus,
   but only after Joseph of Arimathæa had secured the body. Nicodemus was
   a ruler, or a member of the Sanhedrin]: 2 the same came unto him by
   night [Thus avoiding the hostility of his colleagues, and also
   obtaining a more personal and uninterrupted interview with Jesus. That
   his coming by night revealed his character is shown by the fact that
   John repeats the expression when describing him at ch. xix. 39. But, in
   justice, it should be said that Nicodemus was the only one of his order
   who came at all during our Lord's life], and said to him, Rabbi, we
   [Nicodemus uses the plural, to avoid committing himself too much.
   Nicodemus would assert nothing but that which was commonly admitted by
   many. We learn from John xii. 42, 43 that late in the ministry of
   Christ, when hostility towards him was most bitter, many of the rulers
   still believed in him. No doubt, then, when Nicodemus said "we" he used
   the word advisedly and conscientiously] know that thou art a teacher
   come from God [The rulers knew that Jesus was not the product of any of
   the rabbinical schools, and his miracles marked him as a prophet and
   distinguished him from all who were guided merely by reason, no matter
   how learned]; for no one can do these signs that thou doest [John ii.
   25], except God be with him. [These words show the effect of Christ's
   miracles. Miracles arrest attention and challenge investigation, and
   prove that he who works them is from God--Acts x. 38.] 3 Jesus answered
   [Not the words, but the thoughts of Nicodemus. The answers of Jesus
   often look rather to the thoughts of the questioner than to the form of
   the question. Nicodemus came seeking to know something about the
   kingdom of God, and Jesus opened at once upon the subject] and said
   unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he
   cannot see the kingdom of God. [The word translated "anew" may also
   mean "from above," and some commentators seek to so translate it here,
   but it is rightly translated "anew," for Nicodemus understood it to
   mean a second birth. As to the import of the passage, Luther's words
   are pertinent: "My doctrine is not of doing, and of leaving undone, but
   of being and becoming; so that it is not a new work to be done, but the
   being new created--not the living otherwise, but the being new-born."
   To "see" the kingdom means to possess or enjoy it--Ps. xvi. 10; xc. 15;
   John viii. 51; Luke ii. 26.] 4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man
   be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's
   womb, and be born? [Knowing that a man can not be literally born a
   second time, Nicodemus states to Jesus the literal import of his words,
   hoping thereby to draw from him an explanation of this new, strange
   metaphor which he was using. So far as he did grasp the meaning of
   Jesus, Nicodemus saw himself barred forever from the kingdom by an
   impossible requirement. Many, like him, need to learn that God asks of
   us nothing that is impossible; that, on the contrary, the yoke is easy
   and the burden is light.] 5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto
   thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into
   the kingdom of God. [By far the vast majority of scholars consider the
   word "water" in this verse as a reference to Christian baptism. The
   Cambridge Bible says "the outward sign and inward grace of Christian
   baptism are here clearly given, and an unbiased mind can scarcely avoid
   seeing this plain fact. This becomes still clearer when we compare John
   i. 26, 33, where the Baptist declares, 'I baptize in water', the
   Messiah 'baptizeth in the Holy Spirit'. The fathers, both Greek and
   Latin, thus interpret the passage with singular unanimity." Men would
   have no difficulty in understanding this passage were it not that its
   terms apparently exclude "the pious unimmersed" from Christ's kingdom.
   But difficulties, however distressing, will justify no man in wrestling
   the Scriptures of God (II. Pet. iii. 16; Rom. iii. 4). Water and Spirit
   are joined at Matt. xxviii. 19; Acts ii. 38; xix. 1-7; Tit. iii. 5.] 6
   That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
   Spirit is spirit. [Jesus here draws the distinction between fleshly
   birth and spiritual birth. He did this to prepare Nicodemus to
   understand that it is the spirit and not the flesh which undergoes the
   change called the new birth. Regeneration is no slight, superficial
   change, but a radical one, and one which we can not work for
   ourselves.] 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.
   [Jesus here plainly declares that none are exempt from this gospel
   requirement. Man must obtain more than his fleshly nature if he would
   inherit eternal life.] 8 The wind bloweth where it will, and thou
   hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and
   whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. [In this
   sentence we have the word pneuma translated by the two words "wind" and
   "spirit." There can be no justification in rendering pneuma "wind,"
   when in the last clause of the same sentence, and three times in the
   immediate context, it is rendered "spirit." There can be no doubt that
   it means the same in both clauses of this verse, and if we render it
   wind in the first clause, we must say "born of the wind" in the last
   clause. Whatever is the meaning of this verse, it must be extracted
   from the rendering which the Revisers have strangely placed in the
   margin, viz.: "The Spirit breathes where it will, and thou hearest,"
   etc. It teaches that a man is born of the Spirit, breathing as he wills
   through inspired men. It is equivalent to Paul's maxim that faith comes
   by hearing the word of God. [3] ] 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto
   him, How can these things be? 10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art
   thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? [The
   Jewish teachers or doctors of the law made very arrogant claims to
   knowledge, but it often happens that the professedly learned are
   remarkably unacquainted with the first principles of their religion. It
   was so with the Jewish teachers (Matt. xv. 14). Nicodemus should have
   understood that such a change as Jesus was speaking of would be
   necessary, for, 1. It was foreshadowed in the Old Testament (Deut. x.
   16; I. Sam. x. 9; xvi. 13; Ps. li. 10; Ezek. xviii. 31; Jer. iv. 4). 2.
   John the Baptist suggested the need of some such change when he
   attacked the Jewish trust in their descent from Abraham.] 11 Verily,
   verily, I say unto thee, We [a rhetorical plural--Mark iv. 30] speak
   that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen. [his
   words were not founded upon reasonings, speculations, and guesses, but
   were the plain testimony of an eye-witness, who was able to see and had
   seen things which to us are invisible]; and ye receive not our witness.
   [Ye teachers of Israel, who, above all men, should receive our
   guidance, are the very last to follow us. As the Jewish rulers would
   not receive Christ's testimony, let us not be surprised if many of our
   day refuse to listen to the gospel which we preach.] 12 If I have told
   you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
   you heavenly things? [Jesus here divides religious phenomena into two
   divisions--earthly and heavenly. The earthly phenomena are those which
   have their sphere in this world. In this sense regeneration is an
   earthly thing; for though it has a heavenly origin, its manifestations
   are among the daily sights and experiences of our earthly life.
   Religion has also its heavenly phenomena, such as the ordering of God's
   celestial household; the experiences of those who pass into the divine
   presence; the propitiation, or the changes wrought in the attitude of
   God toward man by the sacrifice of Christ; the powers and limitations
   of Christ's priestly intercession, etc. These things have their sphere
   far removed from earth, and transcended the comprehension of Nicodemus.
   Now, if Nicodemus would not believe Jesus when he told him of things
   which he himself partially knew, how would he believe when Jesus spoke
   of that which was utterly unknown to him?] 13 And no one hath ascended
   into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, even the Son of man,
   who is in heaven. [Nicodemus is here informed that Christ alone can
   teach concerning heavenly things. Jesus can so teach, for he did not
   begin on earth and ascend to heaven, but he came from heaven to earth,
   and returned thence (afterwards) to heaven. Jesus speaks of himself as
   being present in heaven, because his divine nature was in constant
   communication with the powers of heaven. If we conceive of heaven as a
   locality (a proper conception), Jesus was upon the earth; but if we
   conceive of it as a present communion with the presence of God (also a
   proper conception), then Christ was in heaven as he talked with
   Nicodemus--John viii. 29.] 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; 15 that whosoever
   believeth may in him have eternal life. [Jesus here indicates the
   prophetical character of the Old Testament. The extent of Christ's
   indorsement of the Old Testament becomes apparent when we consider on
   how many occasions he revealed himself under the same symbolism which
   the Old Testament used to reveal him. At John ii. 19 he revealed his
   resurrection under the symbolism of the destroyed and restored temple.
   At Matt. xii. 40 the same event is revealed under the symbolism of
   Jonah and the whale. And here his crucifixion is likewise partially
   veiled and partially disclosed under a symbolic reference to the brazen
   serpent. The account of the brazen serpent will be found at Num. xxi.
   4-9. The lesson of the brazen serpent will be found in its main points
   of resemblance to the crucifixion of Christ. When the people were
   bitten by fiery serpents, something made to resemble a serpent was hung
   upon a pole, and the people who looked to it in faith through it
   healing and life. Such is the epitome of Christ's gospel. When the
   world was perishing because of sin, Jesus, made to resemble sin (Rom.
   viii. 3; II. Cor. v. 21) was hung upon the cross, that those who look
   unto him in faith (Isa. xlv. 22) may find life through him--I. John v.
   11-13.] 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
   eternal life. [Luther calls this verse "the Bible in miniature." It is
   a lesson as to God's love: 1. Its magnitude--he gave his only begotten
   Son. 2. Its reach--he gave it to a sinful world (Rom. v. 8). 3. Its
   impartiality--he gives it to whomsoever; that is, to all alike (Matt.
   v. 45; Rev. xxii. 17). 4. Its beneficial richness--it blesses with life
   eternal. 5. Its limitations--it is nowhere said that God so loves that
   he will save unbelievers. Love is the mutual and binding grace between
   God and man; it may almost be said that in Christ it made God human and
   man divine. John uses the word "eternal" seventeen times in his Gospel
   and six times in his first Epistle. He always applies it to life. The
   synoptists use it eight times, applying it to life, and also to fire,
   punishment, damnation, and habitation.] 17 For God sent not the Son
   into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved
   through him. [Christ's first mission to the world was for salvation
   rather than for judgment. His second mission will be for judgment, but
   a judgment-hour wherein he will be able to save those who have accepted
   the means of grace which he established by his first coming. But the
   first coming of Christ incidentally involved judgment (John ix. 39),
   and John the Baptist emphasized the judgment of Christ. This judgment,
   however, was not the principal object of Christ's coming, but was an
   inevitable result of it. Jesus here speaks of it as a self-executed
   judgment. It was a necessary result of the revealed presence of Christ
   (Luke ii. 35). That Christ is at present a Saviour, and not a judge, is
   a truth which needs to be emphasized. Catholics are taught to fear
   Christ and flee to the Virgin; and many ignorant Protestants are
   disposed to look upon him as a prosecutor rather than as an advocate.]
   18 He that believeth on him is not judged; he that believeth not hath
   been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the
   only begotten Son of God. [The name "Jesus" means Saviour; to
   disbelieve this name is to reject Christ as Saviour. Verses 14 and 15
   require belief in Jesus as the Son of man. This verse requires belief
   in him as the Son of God. Belief in this dual nature of Jesus is
   essential to salvation. Unbelief is the world's crowning sin; and
   belief is, humanly speaking, the source of its justification. The verse
   teaches that God's judgments are in a state of perpetually present
   enactment. The believer is saved now (Acts xiii. 39), and the
   unbeliever rests already under that condemnation which he fears the Son
   of God may some day pronounce against him.] 19 And this is the
   judgment, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
   rather than the light; for their works were evil. 20 For every one that
   doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his
   works should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth the truth cometh to the
   light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought
   in God. [These verses show that when God judges a man by his faith, the
   judgment is not arbitrary and irrational. Men believe according to the
   secret aspirations and desires of their nature. Christ, as the example
   and model of life, shines out as the light of the world; those who
   approve and love such a life are drawn to him and constrained to
   believe in him. Spiritually, they abide in his presence, that they may
   compare their lives with his, and that they may be assured that their
   works are wrought under the renewing and sanctifying influence of the
   Holy Spirit, who is sent of Christ. But one whose desires are evil
   shrinks from Christ, and struggles to disbelieve in him: he seeks to
   know as little of Christ as possible, because such knowledge exposes
   the wickedness and depravity of his own sinful nature.]

First Ministry in JudÆa--John's Second Testimony.

(Judæa and Ænon.)

^D John III. 22-36.

   ^d 22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
   Judæa [That is, he left Jerusalem, the capital of Judæa, and went into
   the rural districts thereof. We find him there again in John xi. and
   Luke xiii.-xviii. He gained disciples there, but of them we know but
   few, such as Mary, Martha, Lazarus, Simeon, and Judas Iscariot]; and
   there he tarried with them [It is not stated how long he tarried, but
   it may have been from April to December, for the passover was in April,
   and December was "yet four months" before the harvest--John iv. 35],
   and baptized. [This baptism was not into the three names of God (John
   vii. 39), into which the apostles were afterwards directed to baptize
   (Matt. xxviii. 19). It was a continuation of John's baptism,
   preparatory to the organization of the church--a preparation for the
   kingdom. Some think that Jesus, at this time, baptized in his own name,
   and afterwards gave the full baptismal formula into the other two
   names--Father and Spirit. But there is no evidence of this, and
   Christian baptism is a baptism into the death of Christ (Rom. vi. 3).
   Christ would hardly have ordered baptism into his death before his
   crucifixion. Such a proceeding would have wrought confusion.] 23 And
   John also was baptizing [The fact that John also was baptizing is a
   further indication that the baptism administered by Jesus was
   preparatory. There would hardly be two kinds of baptism administered by
   divine consent at one time] in Aenon [This name means "springs"] near
   to Salim, because there was much water there [If one starts at Sychar,
   at the foot of Mount Ebal, and follows the Damascus road northward for
   seven miles, he comes upon the valley called Wady Farah. In this
   beautiful wady the stream flows eastward, having Salim three miles to
   its south and 'Ainun four miles to its north. For the most part the
   valley is narrow, and hemmed in by rocky cliffs. But if one follows the
   course seven miles eastward from the Damascus road, he comes upon a
   beautiful valley, about one mile wide and three miles broad--a place
   every way suitable for the gathering of multitudes to hear the
   preaching of John. A perennial stream, with copious springs all along
   its course, furnishes, even in the longest, driest summers, the "much
   water" required for baptism]: and they came, and were baptized. ["Here,
   then," says Lieutenant Conder, "in the wild, desert valley, beneath the
   red precipices, where the hawk and kite find nests in 'the stairs of
   the rocks', or by the banks of the shingly stream, with its beautiful
   oleander blossoms shining in the dusky foliage of luxuriant shrubs, we
   may picture the dark figure of the Baptist, in his robe of camel's
   hair, with the broad leather Bedawi belt around his loins, preaching to
   the Judæan multitude of pale citizens--portly, gray-bearded rabbis,
   Roman soldiers in leathern armor and shining helmets, sharp-faced
   publicans, and, above all, to the great mass of oppressed peasantry,
   the 'beasts of the people', uncared for, stricken with palsy, with
   blindness, with fever, with leprosy, but eagerly looking forward to the
   appearance of that Messiah who came to preach the gospel to the poor."]
   24 For John was not yet cast into prison. [John's Gospel shows that the
   ministry of Christ was well under way before that of the Baptist
   ceased: a fact which the synoptists do not reveal.] 25 There arose
   therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew
   about purifying. [What this questioning was we are not told. The word
   "therefore" doubtless refers to the baptisms just mentioned, so that
   the dispute probably related to the necessity or purifying effects of
   that ordinance. But whatever the dispute was about, it brought to
   notice the fact that Jesus was baptizing more than John, a fact which
   some of the disciples of John quickly resented.] 26 And they came unto
   John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to
   whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men
   come to him [This verse shows that John's disciples looked upon Jesus
   as one who owed all his position and popularity to the Baptist's
   testimony, and were, therefore, surprised to find that Jesus was
   surpassing John. They looked upon this conduct as a species of
   ingratitude on the part of Jesus. This verse also shows us that the
   witness of John did not pass unheeded. His witness was public and
   notorious, and men remembered it, though they did not always profit by
   it. That these friends of John felt unkindly toward Jesus is shown by
   their exaggerated statement that "all men come to him."] 27 John
   answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given
   him from heaven. [Some take this to mean that Jesus could not have had
   this great success unless Heaven gave it to him; but it is more likely
   that John used the words with entire reference to himself. A man can
   only take what is given to him; the Son of God takes what he chooses.
   The friend receives only what hospitality extends to him, but the heir
   takes what he will, as the owner of the house.] 28 Ye yourselves bear
   me witness, that I said [In stating that John had borne witness (ver.
   26) John's disciple had already committed themselves to the fact that
   John disclaimed to be the Messiah, and that Jesus was the Messiah; for
   it was concerning these two things that John had given his testimony],
   I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him. 29 He that hath
   the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that
   standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's
   voice: this my joy therefore is made full. [John looks upon the body of
   disciples as the Lord's bride, and prophetically anticipates the very
   title which was subsequently applied to the church. It was the duty of
   "the friend of the bridegroom" to arrange the preliminaries of the
   wedding, and to promote the mutual interests of the bride and
   bridegroom. His duties and responsibilities greatly exceeded those of
   our "best man," for it was his place to demand the hand of the bride,
   and to prepare everything for the reception of the bride and
   bridegroom. Joy at the sound of the bridegroom's voice is part of the
   drapery of John's figure. Voices of bride and bridegroom are a Biblical
   symbol of festivity and joy (Jer. vii. 34; xxv. 10; xxxiii. 11). The
   Song of Solomon is the only book in the Bible which dwells upon the
   relationship of bride and bridegroom, and in it the voice of the
   bridegroom is mentioned with joy (Song ii. 8). If John meant anything
   more by the phrase than mere drapery, he used it to express his
   pleasure that the Messiah was directing his own affairs and speaking
   his wishes with his own voice, instead of using his friend as a
   mouthpiece.] 30 He must increase, but I must decrease. [Noble words!
   "He must increase"--because the divine law has ordered it, and prophecy
   has foretold it (Isa. lii. 13 ), and because the very divinity of his
   nature absolutely requires it. "I must decrease"--in popularity, in
   power, in following. The Christian minister finds the increase of his
   work the same as the increase of Christ's kingdom; but with the Baptist
   the case was different. He was a Jewish prophet, and as the power of
   the New Dispensation, under Christ, gained headway, the Old
   Dispensation, of which he was a part, waxed old, and was ready to
   vanish away.] 31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of
   the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh
   from heaven is above all. [Some think that the testimony of the Baptist
   closes with the thirtieth verse, and that the rest of the chapter is
   the comment of the apostle John, but there is certainly no sufficient
   ground for such a view.] 32 What he hath seen and heard, of that he
   beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness. [In verses 31 and 32
   the Baptist draws a contrast between his testimony and that of the
   Messiah. The Baptist's testimony was largely of a negative character.
   He testified that he was not the Christ (ver. 28), and while he pointed
   Jesus out as the Christ, the worthy one, the spiritual baptizer, he
   nowhere undertook to elaborate as to the character or nature of Jesus.
   He looked upon Jesus as being so far above all earthly prophets that no
   prophet could reveal him. The task of such revelation devolved upon
   Jesus himself. God must be self-revealed. It was no heavy
   disappointment to John that his disciples had failed to grasp his
   testimony concerning himself, and yet so few were persuaded by the
   testimony of Jesus that John hyperbolically says "no man receiveth his
   witness."] 33 He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to
   this, that God is true. [We have here a metaphor, taken from the
   sealing of a document, as an expression of trust in or adherence to it.
   Compare John vi. 27; I. Cor. ix. 2. To receive Christ's witness was to
   publicly confess a conviction that God was true--true to his promise
   that he would send a Messiah, a Saviour (Rom. iii. 4). To believe
   Christ is to believe God; to make Christ a liar is to make the Father
   one also, for he speaks concerning Christ (I. John v. 10) and through
   Christ--John vii. 16; xvi. 24.] 34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh
   the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure. [To give
   anything by measure indicates a partial, scanty bestowal (Ezek. iv.
   16). The Spirit of God, even in inspired prophets, was but a partial
   and intermittent gift (I. Cor. vii. 25; xiii. 9; I. Pet. i. 11; Heb. i.
   1 ), but in Jesus, the Son of God, the Spirit of God dwelt fully and
   uninterruptedly (Col. i. 19). The present tense, "giveth," points to a
   continuous communication of the Spirit. If Christ had received the
   Spirit "by measure," then his gift of the Spirit might be exhausted.]
   35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
   [This fact was afterwards asserted by Jesus (Matt. xxviii. 18). Jesus
   is indeed King of kings--Ps. ii. 6-8; Matt. xi. 27; Acts ii. 33; x. 36;
   Eph. i. 22.] 36 He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life [the New
   Testament represents everlasting life as a present possession obtained
   by belief]; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the
   wrath of God abideth on him. [In the second clause of this verse
   "obeyeth" stands in contrast with "believeth" in the first clause. No
   mental assent, however strong, is reckoned by the Scriptures as faith
   unless it results in obedience (Jas. ii. 20; Rom. i. 5). "Wrath of God"
   is a strong phrase, and is not to be lightly explained away. The
   unconverted sinner rests under this wrath. His study should be not only
   to avert a sentence to be pronounced at some future day, but to be
   freed from one already resting upon him. This verse shows conclusively
   that Christ's atoning work had its divine as well as its human side;
   that God had to be propitiated as truly as man had to be reconciled.
   The Baptist had already repeatedly warned the Jewish people of wrath to
   come if they rejected the Messiah, and in this, his last recorded
   utterance, he boldly reiterates that warning.]

Jesus Sets Out from JudÆa for Galilee.

Subdivision A. Reasons for Retiring to Galilee.

^A Matt. IV. 12; ^B Mark I. 14; ^C Luke III. 19, 20; ^D John IV. 1-4.

   ^c 19 but Herod the tetrarch [son of Herod the Great, and tetrarch, or
   governor, of Galilee], being reproved by him [that is, by John the
   Baptist] for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evil things
   which Herod had done [A full account of the sin of Herod and
   persecution of John will be found at Matt. xiv. 1-12 and Mark vi.
   14-29. John had spoken the truth to Herod as fearlessly as to the
   Pharisees, publicans and soldiers], 20 added this also to them all [the
   sins of Herod, as a ruler, already outweighed his virtues; (comp. Dan.
   v. 27); but, with reckless abandon, Herod went on, adding to the
   weighty reasons which justified his condemnation], that he shut up John
   in prison. [In the fortress at Machærus, east of the Dead Sea, as we
   learn from Josephus. The duration of the ministry of John the Baptist
   is variously estimated at from fourteen to eighteen months.] ^b 14 Now
   after John was delivered up [either delivered up by the people to Herod
   (Matt. xvii. 12), or delivered up by Herod himself to the warden of the
   castle of Machærus (Luke xii. 58), or by Providence to Herod
   himself--Acts ii. 23], ^a when he [Jesus] heard [he was in Judæa when
   he heard it] that John was delivered up [and], ^d 1 When therefore the
   Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and
   baptizing more disciples than John [We saw at John iii. 26 how the
   Baptist heard about the number of Jesus' baptisms, being informed by
   his jealous friends. Like jealous friends, no doubt, informed the
   Pharisees. Jesus may have known of this information being given by
   reason of his supernatural powers, but it is more likely that he heard
   of it in a natural way] 2 (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his
   disciples) [Jesus, as divine Lawgiver, instituted baptism, and his
   disciples administered it. We nowhere hear of the disciples of John
   administering baptism. In fact, the Baptist, like the disciples of
   Jesus, baptized under a divine commission, and could not delegate the
   power to others. It was the office of Jesus to commission others to
   this work, not to perform it himself. Had he done so, those baptized by
   him might have foolishly claimed for themselves some peculiar honor by
   reason thereof ( I. Cor. i. 14, 15). Jesus was the spiritual baptizer,
   in which baptism the efficacy lies in the administrant; but water
   baptism, the efficacy of which lies rather in the spirit of the one
   baptized than in the virtues of the administrant, Jesus left to his
   disciples], 3 he left Judæa, and departed again { ^a withdrew ^b came}
   ^d into Galilee. [We have in these verses two reasons assigned for the
   withdrawal of Jesus into Galilee, namely: 1. The imprisonment of John
   the Baptist 2. Knowledge of the Pharisees that Jesus was baptizing more
   disciples than John. The first gives us the reason why he went to
   Galilee, the second the reason why he left Judæa. Jesus did not go into
   Galilee through fear of Herod, for Herod was tetrarch of Galilee. The
   truth is, the absence of John called for the presence of Jesus. The
   northern part of Palestine was the most fruitful soil for the gospel.
   During the last six or eight months of John's ministry we find him in
   this northern field, preparing it for Christ's kingdom. While we can
   not say definitely that John was in Galilee (Bethabara and Ænon being
   the only two geographical names given), yet he certainly drew his
   audiences largely from the towns and cities of Galilee. While John
   occupied the northern, Jesus worked in the southern district of
   Palestine; but when John was removed, then Jesus turned northward, that
   he might sow the seed of the kingdom in its most fruitful soil. But if
   there was a reason why he should go to Galilee, there was an equal
   reason why he should depart from Judæa. His popularity, manifesting
   itself in the number of his baptisms, was exciting that envy and
   opposition which caused the rulers of Judæa eventually to take the life
   of Jesus (Matt. xxvii. 18). The Pharisees loved to make proselytes
   themselves ( Matt. xxiii. 15). They no doubt envied John's popularity,
   and much more, therefore, would they be disposed to envy Christ. The
   influence of the Pharisees was far greater in Judæa than in Galilee,
   and the Sanhedrin would readily have arrested Jesus had he remained in
   Judæa (John vii. 1; x. 39), and arrest at this time would have marred
   the work of Jesus. Therefore, since it is neither sinful nor unbecoming
   to avoid persecution, Jesus retired to Galilee, when he remained until
   his second passover. By birth a prophet of Judæa, he became, in public
   estimation, by this retirement, a prophet of Galilee. Though Jesus
   first taught in Judæa, the ministry in Galilee so far eclipsed the work
   in Judæa that it was spoken of as the place of beginning (Luke xxiii.
   5; Acts x. 37), and prophetically designated as the scene of the divine
   manifestation--Matt. iv. 14.] 4 And he must needs pass through Samaria.
   [The province which took its name from the city of Samaria, and which
   lay between Judæa and Galilee. Owing to the hatred which existed
   between Jews and Samaritans, many of the Jews went from Jerusalem to
   Galilee by turning eastward, crossing the Jordan, and passing northward
   through Peræa. This journey required about seven days, while the more
   direct route, through Samaria, only took three days. Galilæans often
   passed through Samaria on their way to and from the Jerusalem feast
   (Josephus' Ant. xx. 6, 1). The arrest of John would scatter his flock
   of disciples (Mark xiv. 27), and Jesus, as chief shepherd (I. Pet. v.
   1-4), hastened to Galilee, to gather together those which might else go
   astray and be lost.]

XXVI.

Jesus Sets Out from JudÆa for Galilee.

Subdivision B. At Jacob's Well, and at Sychar.

^D John IV. 5-42.

   ^d 5 So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the
   parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 and Jacob's well
   was there. [Commentators long made the mistake of supposing that
   Shechem, now called Nablous, was the town here called Sychar. Sheckem
   lies a mile and a half west of Jacob's well, while the real Sychar, now
   called 'Askar, lies scarcely half a mile north of the well. It was a
   small town, loosely called a city, and adjoined the land which Jacob
   gave to Joseph (Gen. xxxiii. 19; xlvii. 22; Josh. xxiv. 32), Joseph's
   tomb being about one hundred yards east of it. The mummy of Joseph,
   carried out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus, was buried in this
   parcel of ground, and there is but little doubt that it really rests in
   the place indicated by the tomb; and though the name Sychar may be
   derived from the words "liar" or "drunkard," it is more likely that it
   means "town of the sepulchre," referring to this tomb. The Old
   Testament is silent as to when or why Jacob dug this well. It lies on
   the southern side of the valley of Shechem, where it opens upon the
   plain of Moreh (now called el-Mukhnah), about a hundred yards south of
   the foot of Mt. Gerizim. It is one of the few Biblical sites about
   which there is no dispute, and probably the only place on earth where
   one can draw a circle of a few feet, and say confidently that the feet
   of Christ have stood within the circumference. Maundrell, who visited
   it in 1697, said that it was 105 feet deep, and had in it fifteen feet
   of water. But travelers have thrown stones into it to sound its depth,
   until at present it is only sixty-six feet deep, and has no water in it
   except in very wet winters. It is seven and half feet in diameter, and
   is walled with masonry to a depth of about ten feet, below which it is
   cut through the solid rock. It lies 400 nearly due south from Joseph's
   tomb. As the neighborhood abounds in springs, the well would hardly
   have been dug save by one who wished to be independent of his
   neighbors--as Jacob did.] Jesus therefore, being wearied with his
   journey, sat thus by the well. [John gives us important items as to the
   humanity of Jesus. He tells us how he sat as a wayworn traveler, hungry
   and thirsty, at Jacob's well; and he alone records the words, "I
   thirst," spoken on the cross (John xix. 28). The top of the well is
   arched over like a cistern, and a round opening is left about twenty
   inches in diameter. On this arch or curbing Jesus sat. We should note
   the perpetuity of blessings which springs from a good deed. Gutenberg
   did not foresee the newspaper when he invented printing; Columbus did
   not anticipate the land of the free when he led discoverers to our
   shore, nor is it likely that the prophetic eye of Jacob ever saw the
   wearied Christ resting upon the well-curb which he was building.] It
   was about the sixth hour. [That is, twelve o'clock, if we reckon by
   Jewish time, or six o'clock in the evening, if we reckon by the Roman
   method. We prefer the latter method.] 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria
   to draw water [She was not of the city of Samaria (which was then
   called Sebaste--the Greek word for Augustus--in honor of Augustus
   Cæsar, who had given it to Herod the Great), but a woman of the
   province of Samaria, which lay between Judæa and Galilee, and reached
   from the Jordan on the east to the Mediterranean on the west,
   comprising the country formerly occupied by the tribe of Ephraim and
   the half tribe of Manasseh]: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 8
   For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. [Had the
   disciples been present they would have bargained with the woman for the
   use of her rope and pitcher; but in their absence Jesus himself asked
   her for a drink. He met her on the ground of a common humanity, and
   conceded to her the power of conferring a favor. Women have been
   immemorially the water-carriers in the East (Gen. xxiv. 13, 14; Ex. ii.
   16). Palestine is in summer a parched land, inducing intense thirst,
   and the people usually comply cheerfully with the request for water; it
   was probably so in Jesus' day (Matt. x. 42). Mohammed commanded that
   water should never be refused.] 9 The Samaritan woman therefore saith
   unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew [as his language and dress
   declared], askest drink of me, whom am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews
   have no dealings with Samaritans.) [It is not likely that she meant to
   refuse his request, but she yielded to the temptation to banter one who
   she thought despised her, and whose necessities now caused him for a
   moment to forget his pride. The ancestors of the Samaritans were
   introduced into the land of Israel by the king of Assyria, after he led
   the ten tribes into captivity (II. Kings xvii. 24-41). When the Jews
   returned from their captivity in Babylon and began to rebuild their
   temple, the Samaritans asked permission to build with them, and when
   this was refused, an enmity arose between the two people which never
   died out (Ez. iv. 1-5; Neh. ii. 10, 19; iv. 1-3). We must, however,
   restrict the word "dealings" to social intercourse. Race antipathy did
   not ordinarily interfere with trade or other matters involving money,
   as is shown by verse 8 above. According to later tradition, a Jew
   accepted no hospitality from a Samaritan, and to eat his bread as a
   guest was as polluting as to eat swine's flesh, but such social
   courtesy was the very thing which Jesus here asked. There are to-day
   between one and two hundred Samaritans dwelling in Shechem at the foot
   of Mt. Gerizim, and Dr. Robinson says of them that they "neither eat,
   nor drink, nor marry with the Jews, but only trade with them."] 10
   Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and
   who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have
   asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. [Jesus is
   himself the Gift of God (John iii. 16; II. Cor. ix. 15). But she knew
   not that God had bestowed a special Gift, and much less that the one to
   whom she spoke was that Gift. Had she known she would have understood
   that though physically Jesus was the object of her charity, spiritually
   their cases were reversed, and she was the needy one, as Jesus
   intimates. Living water would mean literally "running" or "spring
   water," as contrasted with still or cistern water (Gen. xxvi. 19; Lev.
   xiv. 5). Jesus here uses it in the spiritual sense. He fills us with
   his grace and truth (John i. 14) and grants unto us continual, untold
   refreshing (Rev. vii. 17). The reviving and regenerating effects of the
   Holy Spirit are likewise called living water (John vii. 37-39).] 11 The
   woman saith unto him, Sir [the word "Sir" is elsewhere translated
   "Lord"], thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence
   then hast thou that living water? [She understood his words literally,
   and was puzzled by them; but, won by the courtesy which suggested an
   exchange of gifts, she answered respectfully, though incredulously.] 12
   Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank
   thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? [We should note three
   points in this verse: 1. The greatness of Jesus. The woman had just
   called him "Lord." The man at Bethesda, though he knew not Jesus,
   afterwards did the same (John v. 7). People felt the majesty and
   dignity of Jesus. When he offered to give a greater blessing than that
   given by Jacob, the woman at once contrasted him with Jacob--Jacob with
   sons and cattle and wealth--and wondered if this lonely stranger could
   really imagine himself greater than the illustrious patriarch. 2. She
   claimed descent from Jacob; it was a false claim. Jesus classed the
   Samaritans with Gentiles (Matt. x. 5), and spoke of them as strangers
   or aliens (Luke xvii. 18). 3. She spoke of the well as given by Jacob.
   She meant that it had been given to Joseph (Gen. xlviii. 22), and that
   her people had inherited it as descendants of Joseph.] 13 Jesus
   answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall
   thirst again: 14 but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
   him shall never thirst [Jesus here draws a contrast between earthly and
   heavenly blessings. No worldly joy gives lasting satisfaction, but
   Jesus is the bread and water of life to his disciples (John vi. 35)
   their unfailing satisfaction]; but the water that I shall give him
   shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. [A
   beautiful figure of the joy in Christ. In heat, in cold; in drought, in
   shower; in prosperity, in adversity; it still springs up, cheering and
   refreshing the soul, and this unto all eternity--Rev. vii. 17; xxi. 6
   .] 15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
   not, neither come all the way hither to draw. [She but dimly
   comprehended the nature of Christ's offer, but was persuaded of two
   things: 1. The wonderful water was to be desired. 2. Jesus was able and
   willing to give it. When she spoke of coming "to draw" her words
   suggested the household to which it was her duty to minister, and
   prepared the way for the command of Jesus to bring the head of the
   household.] 16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come
   hither. [She had asked Jesus for the water of God's grace, but she
   needed to be made conscious of how much she needed it--conscious (if we
   follow the figure) of her dormant thirst. Jesus, therefore, gave
   command to call her husband, that by so doing he might reveal her life
   and waken her to repentance.] 17 The woman answered and said unto him,
   I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no
   husband: 18 for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now has
   is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. [The divine wisdom of
   Jesus brought to light a sad state of affairs. During the period of
   five marriages the woman's life had at least some outward show of
   respectability, but now it was professedly unclean. The number of
   marriages reflects somewhat upon the character of the woman, and hints
   that some of them may have been dissolved by her own fault, though the
   loose divorce law of that age permitted a man to dissolve the marriage
   ties on very slight provocation. Among the Jews the great Hillel is
   reported to have said that a man might properly divorce his wife if she
   burnt his dinner while cooking. It is not likely that any higher ideals
   of matrimony obtained among the Samaritans.] 19 The woman saith unto
   him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. [She had heard of the
   miraculous knowledge of the Jewish prophets, and this evidence given
   her by Jesus persuaded her that he was one of them, as a like evidence
   had persuaded Nathanael (John i. 48, 49 ). By thus calling him a
   prophet she virtually confessed the truth as to all the things
   concerning which he had accused her.] 20 Our fathers worshipped in this
   mountain [i. e., Mt. Gerizim]; and ye [ye Jews] say, that in Jerusalem
   is the place where men ought to worship. [Though a desire to divert the
   conversation from her own sins may have, in some slight measure,
   prompted the woman to bring up this question about places of worship,
   yet her main motive must have been far higher. If we ourselves stood in
   the presence of one whom we felt assured to be fully inspired of God,
   how hastily would we propound to him some of the vexed questions which
   befog the religion of our time! Prompted by such a feeling, this woman
   sought to have the great dispute between Jew and Samaritan decided.
   Solomon's temple in Jerusalem was soon after its erection confronted by
   those who denied its claims to be exclusively the place set apart for
   divine worship. Jeroboam, the rebellious servant of Solomon, taught the
   people that Bethel and Dan were as acceptable for worship as Jerusalem.
   But Jerusalem, as the site of the first great temple, held precedence
   above all rivals until its claims were discredited in popular
   estimation by the fact that it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. When,
   after many years, the returning captives rebuilt its walls, it lacked
   the sanction of age, and it had lost many of the features of divine
   recognition, which contributed to the sacredness and grandeur of the
   first structure. Soon after its erection in the days of Nehemiah,
   Manasseh, son of the high priest Joiada, and brother of the high priest
   Jonathan (Neh. xii. 10, 11; xiii. 28), married to the daughter of
   Sanballat, Persian governor of Samaria. Refusing to dissolve this
   marriage at the decree of the governor of Jerusalem, Manasseh was
   chased by Nehemiah from Jerusalem, and his father-in-law made him high
   priest of the Samaritans, and undertook to build for him the temple
   which afterwards crowned the summit of Mt. Gerizim. Manasseh left
   Jerusalem about b.c. 332. The temple built for him was destroyed by
   John Hyrcanus about b.c. 129, but the place where it stood was still
   the sacred center of Samaritan worship, as it is to this day. Mt.
   Gerizim, and its supporting city of Shechem, had many grounds on which
   to base their claims to be a sacred locality: 1, Here God appeared to
   Abraham for the first time after his entering Canaan (Gen. xii. 6, 7);
   2, here Jacob first dwelt (Gen. xxxiii. 18); 3, here Joseph came
   seeking his brethren (Gen. xxxvii. 12, 13); 4, here was a city of
   refuge ( Josh. xx. 7-9); 5, here Joshua read the blessings and cursings
   (Josh. viii. 33); 6, here also he gave his last address (Josh. xxiv.
   1); 7, here were buried the bones of Joseph (Josh. xxiv. 32), and the
   neighborhood was prominent at the time of the division of the ten
   tribes (I. Kings xii. 1, 25 ). If we may consider Samaritan traditions
   of that day as similar to those of the present, they had added greatly
   to the real importance of the neighborhood, for they now contend that
   1, Paradise was on the summit of Gerizim; 2, Adam was formed of the
   dust of Gerizim; 3, on Gerizim Adam reared his first altar; 4, Seth
   here reared his first altar; 5, Gerizim was the Ararat on which the Ark
   rested, and the only spot which the flood did not overflow; and
   therefore the only place which escaped the defilement of dead bodies;
   6, on it Noah reared his altar; 7, here Abraham attempted to offer
   Isaac; 8, here he met Melchizedek; 9, here was the real Bethel, where
   Jacob slept and saw his ladder vision. Backed by such high claims, the
   woman deemed it possible that this prophet might decide in favor of
   Samaria's holy place. We should note that the Samaritans worshiped in
   Mt. Gerizim because they could say, "Our fathers did so." Thus many
   errors are perpetuated to-day because our fathers practiced them; but
   our fathers had no more authority to alter or amend God's word than we
   have. The Jews worshiped in Jerusalem because it had been prophesied
   that God would select a spot as the peculiar place for his worship
   (Deut. xii. 5-11), and because according to this prophecy God had
   selected Mt. Moriah in Jerusalem--I. Kings ix. 3; II. Chron. iii. 1,
   2.] 21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
   neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the
   Father. [Jesus uses the word "hour" to indicate that the time was near
   at hand when all religious distinctions as to places would be
   abolished, and when every spot might be used for purposes of
   worship--I. Tim. ii. 8.] 22 Ye worship that which ye know not: we
   worship that which we know. For salvation is from the Jews. [Jesus here
   speaks as a Jew, and draws a comparison between the intelligent worship
   of his people and the ignorant worship of the Samaritans. Though the
   Samaritans possessed the Pentateuch, they were without the revelation
   of God which the prophets of Israel had developed, and their worship
   was neither authorized nor accredited by God. Moreover, it led toward
   nothing; for salvation was evolved from the Jewish religion, and not
   from that of Samaria. Salvation proceeded from the Jews. From them,
   according to the flesh, Christ came, and from them came also the
   prophets, apostles, and inspired writers who have given us that full
   knowledge of salvation which we possess to-day. We must take the words
   of Jesus as referring rather to the two religions than to the two
   peoples. Though as a body the Jews did not know whom they worshiped,
   and though their teachers were blind leaders of the blind, yet the
   fault was in their unbelief, and not in the revelation or religion in
   which they refused to believe. On the contrary, if the Samaritans had
   believed his religion to the full, it would hardly have been sufficient
   to have enabled him to know what he worshiped. Samaria was, in the days
   of idolatry of Israel, a chief seat of Baal worship, and in later days
   it was the home of magicians and sorcerers.] 23 But the hour cometh,
   and now is [the hour is really here, but the knowledge of it is not yet
   comprehended], When the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
   spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.
   [Jesus draws the mind of the woman from the place of worship to the
   Person or Being worshiped, and from the form to the spirit of worship.
   God seeks for genuine and not formal worshipers, and for those who
   worship him in truth; i. e., those who render him the obedience of
   faith with a filial spirit, and not those who render him the empty
   service of types and shadows, ceremonies and rites, which, through
   disbelief, have lost their meaning.] 24 God is a Spirit [These words
   contain one of the most simple, yet most profound, truths which ever
   fell upon mortal ear. Their truth is one of the great glories of
   revelation, and corrects the mistaken conclusion of human reason. They
   show that 1, God is absolutely free from all limitations of space and
   time, and is therefore not to be localized in temples (Acts vii. 48);
   2, that God is not material, as idolaters contend; 3, that he is not an
   abstract force, as scientists think, but a Being; 4, that he is lifted
   above all need of temples, sacrifices, etc., which are a benefit to
   man, but not to God (Acts xvii. 25). Spiritual excellence raises man
   above the beast, and spiritual excellence in turn raises God above
   man--Isa. xxxi. 3]: and they that worship him must worship in spirit
   and truth. [That is, men must offer a worship corresponding with the
   nature and attributes of God.] 25 The woman saith unto him, I know that
   Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will
   declare unto us all things. [The breadth and largeness of Jesus'
   teaching suggested to her the great Teacher who was to come, and caused
   her to yearn for him who could tell, as she thought, perhaps even
   larger things. The Samaritans justified their idea of a coming
   Benefactor by passages found in the Pentateuch, and got their name for
   him from the Jews. Relying on the prophecy found at Deut. xviii. 18,
   modern Samaritans regard the Messiah as a returning Moses, calling him
   El-Mudy --the Guide. They contend that his name will begin with M, and
   that he will live to be 120 years old. This woman's idea of the Messiah
   was probably also very crude, but it was in part an improvement on the
   general Jewish conception, for it regarded him as a teacher rather than
   a world-conquering, earthly prince.] 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that
   speak to thee am he. [This is the first recorded declaration of his
   Messiahship made by Jesus. He was not confessed to be Messiah by Simon
   Peter (Matt. xvi. 16) till the last year of his ministry. Jesus spoke
   more freely as to his office in Samaria than in Judæa or Galilee; for,
   1, the Samaritans would make no effort to take him by force and make
   him a king ( John vi. 15); 2, his short stay in Samaria justified an
   explicit and brief revelation.] 27 And upon this came his disciples;
   and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman. [The spirit of
   the Rabbis is shown by their later precept; viz.: "Let no one talk with
   a woman in the street, no, not with his own wife." The estate of woman
   was then, and had been for a long time previous, very low. Socrates
   thanked the gods daily that he was born neither a slave nor a woman.
   Roman law gave the husband absolute authority over the wife, even to
   put her to death; and Jewish contempt for women is made apparent by the
   readiness with which the Jews divorced them]; yet no man said, What
   seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? [So deep was their
   reverence and respect that they did not question, though they did not
   understand.] 28 So the woman left her waterpot [in the forgetfulness of
   great joy, and as the unconscious pledge of her return], and went away
   into the city [Sychar], and saith to the people, 29 Come, see a man,
   who told me all things that ever I did [To publish Christ is one of the
   first impulses of those who feel Christ's gracious power. Her
   invitation is like that given by Philip (John i. 46). On second thought
   her statement is not so much of an exaggeration as it at first appears.
   Her five marriages and present state covered the whole period of her
   maturer life, and the way in which Jesus had disclosed it all convinced
   her that every detail of it was spread out before him]: can this be the
   Christ? [Her question does not imply that she herself had any doubts
   about the matter. She uses the interrogative form because she does not
   wish to be dogmatic, but prefers to let the people judge for
   themselves. Observe the woman's change of mind concerning Jesus. She
   first called him "Jew" (ver. 9), then "Sir" (ver. 11), then "prophet"
   (ver. 19), and now she invites her city to come forth and see "the
   Christ."] 30 They went out of the city, and were coming to him. 31 In
   the meanwhile [the time between the departure of the woman and the
   arrival of her fellow-townsmen] the disciples prayed him, saying,
   Rabbi, eat. 32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know
   not of. 33 The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man
   brought him aught to eat? [They understood his words literally, as a
   declaration that he had dined.] 34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to
   do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. [His
   delight at the woman's conversion, as a part of the work which his
   Father had given him to do, overcame for a time his desire for food.
   Food has several characteristics: 1. enjoyment; 2. satisfaction of
   desire; 3. refreshment and strength. God's work had these
   characteristics to Jesus, whose life fulfilled the principle that man
   shall not live by bread alone.] 35 Say not ye, There are yet four
   months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up
   your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto
   harvest. [Jacob's well overlooked the luxuriant grainfields of the
   plain of Moreh. As the disciples looked abroad over its patches of
   varying green, they would say that it would yet be four months before
   these patches could be harvested. The harvests in the natural world are
   slow. But turning their eyes toward Sychar, the disciples could see the
   citizens of the town in their white garments pouring forth to see
   Jesus, and to be gathered by him as a harvest of disciples which had
   sprung up and ripened from the seeds of truth sown by the woman but a
   few moments before. Spiritual sowing brings speedy harvests. Some
   commentators look upon the words of Jesus as proverbial, but there is
   no proverb extant which places only four months between sowing and
   reaping. In Palestine this period covers six months. We must,
   therefore, take the words of Jesus as a plain statement as to the
   length of time between the date of his speaking and the date of
   harvest. Harvest begins about the middle of April, and counting back
   four months from that date we find that this visit to Sychar occurred
   somewhere about the middle of December.] 36 He that reapeth receiveth
   wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that he that soweth and
   he that reapeth may rejoice together. [Harvest times were seasons of
   great joy (Deut. xvi. 13-15; Ps. cxxvi. 6; Isa. ix. 3). But the joy of
   joys shall come when God gathers his redeemed into the heavenly garner.
   In this present the humble teacher sows and the evangelist, or more
   gifted brother, reaps; but in that glad hour it shall matter little
   whether we have been a sower or a reaper, for we shall all rejoice
   together. Sower and reaper alike shall receive wages, a part of which
   shall be the "fruit" gathered--the souls saved. Jesus regarded gaining
   a brother as a large compensation, a great gain--Matt. xviii. 15.] 37
   For herein is the saying true [see Isa. lxv. 21, 22; Lev. xxvi. 16; Job
   xxxi. 8; Mic. vi. 15], One soweth, and another reapeth. 38 I sent you
   to reap [Christ, as Lord of the harvest, sent both sowers and reapers]
   that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are
   entered into their labor. [In earlier days many prophets and holy men
   had labored to prepare the people of Palestine, that they might be
   gathered of Christ as disciples. Later John the Baptist had wrought a
   mighty work toward this same end. Into a field thus sown and cultivated
   Jesus was now leading his apostles, that they might reap for him the
   ripened harvest. He bids them observe the speedy and easy reaping on
   this occasion as an encouraging example to them, that they may go forth
   with strong assurance and confidence. Even the minds of the Samaritans
   were prepared to receive him, and a quick harvest could be gathered
   among them.] 39 And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on
   him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all
   things that ever I did. [The Jews rejected the testimony of the
   prophets and holy men of God as recorded in the Scripture (John v. 46,
   47), but the Samaritans accepted the testimony of this woman, and she
   was a sinner.] 40 So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought
   him to abide with them: and he abode there two days. ["His own"
   received him not, but these "strangers" welcomed him. The stay was
   brief, but long enough to prepare the way for a future church among the
   Samaritans in the neighboring city of Samaria (Acts viii. 5-8). From
   the nearer town of Shechem came Justin Martyr, one of the greatest
   Christian writers of the second century.] 41 And many more believed
   because of his word: 42 and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not
   because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that
   this is indeed the Saviour of the world. [Only such ready hearers could
   arrive at so great a truth in so short a time. Wealth of revelation and
   blessing had made the Jews selfish, and their conception of the Messiah
   was so perverted by this selfishness that they could not conceive of
   him as being a world Saviour. Thus wealth often dwarfs where it should
   rather enlarge the heart. The incident comprised in this section
   presents the expansiveness of Christianity in a threefold aspect; viz.:
   1, we see it breaking down the walls of racial prejudice; 2, we observe
   it elevating woman, and certifying her fitness to receive the very
   highest spiritual instruction; 3, we behold it lifting up the degraded
   and sinful, and supplying them from the fountains of grace. Such is
   real Christianity--the Christianity of Christ.]

   the Spirit here means its manifest use to perform miracles, rather than
   its presence, influence or direction. Jesus was always under the
   influence and direction of the Spirit, but did not previously perform
   miracles]: ^d 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no
   honor in his own country. [Galilee was Jesus' "own country" (John i.
   46; ii. 1; vii. 3, 41, 52; Luke xxiii. 5-7). In Judæa he had begun to
   receive so much honor as to bring him into danger at the hands of the
   Pharisees: he would receive less in Galilee. Verse 43 resumes the
   itinerary of verses 1, 2, after the interlude which tells of the woman
   at Sychar.] 45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received
   him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast:
   for they also went unto the feast. [The works which Jesus had done in
   Jerusalem were for the most part fruitless as to its inhabitants, but
   they bore the fruit of faith in far-off Galilee. Of "the many who
   believed on him" in Jerusalem (John ii. 23), it is highly probable that
   a large number were Galilæan pilgrims who were then there attending the
   passover.]

General Account of Jesus' Teaching.

^A Matt. IV. 17; ^B Mark I. 14, 15; ^C Luke IV. 14, 15.

   ^a 17 From that time Jesus began to preach [The time here indicated is
   that of John the Baptist's imprisonment and Jesus' return to Galilee.
   This time marked a new period in the public ministry of Jesus. Hitherto
   he had taught, but he now began to preach. When the voice of his
   messenger, John, was silenced, the King became his own herald. Paul
   quoted the Greeks as saying that preaching was "foolishness," but
   following the example here set by Christ, he used it as the appointed
   means for saving souls. While Matthew gives us many of the earlier
   incidents of Christ's life, he enters upon the account of his ministry
   at the time when Jesus returned to Galilee. From that time forward he
   was probably an eye-witness of the events which he records], ^b
   preaching the gospel of God, 15 And saying, { ^a and to say,} Repent
   ye; for ^b the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God { ^a of
   Heaven} ^b is at hand. [Jesus preached the gospel or good news of his
   own advent and of the setting up of the unending kingdom which should
   convert the world to righteousness and save the souls of men. We should
   note that Jesus himself declares that the prophesied time for the
   setting up of his kingdom was at hand. There were many general
   prophecies as to this kingdom, but one which especially fixed the time
   of its coming; viz.: Dan. ix. 24-27. This prophecy tells of seventy
   weeks in which each day is reckoned as a year, so that the seventy
   weeks equal four hundred and ninety years. They are to be counted from
   the date of the decree which ordered the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The
   Messiah, or Prince, was to come at the beginning of the seventieth
   week, or four hundred and eighty-three years from the date of the
   decree. Some take the decree referred to as to be that mentioned in
   Nehemiah ii. Jahn and Hales fix the date of this decree in the year 444
   b.c. According to this, Jesus would have begun his ministry in the year
   a.d. 39. Others take the decree to be mentioned in Ezra vii., which was
   thirteen years earlier, and which would bring the beginning of the
   ministry of Jesus to the year a.d. 26. But there is much uncertainty
   about all ancient chronology. Suffice it to say that Daniel told in
   round numbers how long it would be until Messiah should come, and that
   Jesus said that this time had been fulfilled. It would have been easy
   to ascertain the correct chronology at the time when Jesus spoke, and
   we have no record that any presumed to dispute his statement. Jesus
   announced the coming of a new dispensation. The King had already come,
   but the kingdom in its organization and administration was as yet only
   "at hand." Until the crucifixion of Christ and the descent of the Holy
   Spirit at Pentecost the kingdom could not be fully organized, for the
   blood shed upon the cross furnished the means for purification which
   precedes a proper entrance into the kingdom, and the coming of the Holy
   Spirit afforded that indwelling strength by which those entering are
   enabled to abide therein]: repent ye, and believe in the gospel. [That
   is, prepare for the kingdom by repenting of sin, and by believing the
   glad news that the kingdom was approaching, for the King had come (John
   i. 49). The preaching of Jesus at this time did not differ materially
   from that of John the Baptist, for John preached repentance and the
   approaching kingdom ( Matt. iii. 2), and the gospel (Luke iii. 18), and
   belief in the King (John i. 29, 36; iii. 36). The fact that repentance
   comes before belief in this passage is by some taken as an indication
   that repentance precedes faith in the process of conversion, but it
   should be remembered that the preaching here is addressed to the Jewish
   people, who already believed in God, and in the Scripture as the
   revelation of God. They were, therefore, required to bring forth fruit
   worthy of the old faith and the old revelation as preparatory to their
   reception of the new faith and the new revelation. Thus repentance and
   faith appears to be the established order for Hebrews (Heb. vi. 1), and
   their proselytes (Acts xx. 21), because of the spiritual standpoint or
   condition in which the gospel found them. But those who have no faith
   in God can surely have no repentance toward him, for belief precedes
   every call upon God, whether for mercy, pardon, or any other
   blessing--Rom. x. 13, 14], ^c and a fame went out concerning him
   through all the region round about. [The miracles of Jesus and the
   manner in which he taught caused the people to glorify his name.] 15
   And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. [If we may
   trust later tradition (and the New Testament corroborates it),
   synagogues were very plentiful in that day, there being at least one in
   each town. In the synagogue the people met on Sabbath and feast days.
   The temple at Jerusalem was used for ceremonial worship, but the
   services in the synagogue were of far different order, the study and
   application of the Scripture being the principal feature.]

XXVIII.

The Second Miracle at Cana.

^D John IV. 46-54.

   ^d 46 He came therefore again [that is, in consequence of the welcome
   which awaited him] Unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine
   [see page 114]. And there was a certain nobleman [literally, "king's
   man:" a word which Josephus uses to designate a soldier, courtier, or
   officer of the king. He was doubtless an officer of Herod Antipas,
   tetrarch of Galilee. That it was Chuzas (Luke viii. 3) or Manaen (Acts
   xiii. 1) is mere conjecture], whose son was sick at Capernaum. [The
   nouns in this verse are suggestive. We have a "nobleman," yet neither
   riches nor office lifted him above affliction; a "son," yet approaching
   an untimely death before his father; and both these parties came to
   sorrow in "Capernaum," the city of consolation. Neither circumstance,
   nor age, nor situation can guarantee joy. We must still be seeking
   Jesus.] 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee
   [and was therefore within not very easy reach of his sick child's
   bedside], he went unto him [literally, "he went away unto him." The
   verb contains a delicate suggestion that the father was reluctant to
   leave the son, even to seek aid] , and besought him that he would come
   down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. [Many, like
   this father, only seek divine aid when in the utmost extremity.] 48
   Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will
   in no wise believe. [Though Jesus spoke these words to the nobleman,
   yet he also intended them for those who stood by, for he used the
   plural "ye." That the Galilæans in general deserved reproof for their
   lack of faith, is shown by the upbraiding words which he spoke
   concerning their cities (Matt. xi. 20-24 ). Jesus wanted men to believe
   in him because of his self-evidencing character and words (John x. 38;
   xiv. 11; xv. 22-24; xx. 29). But the people required to have their
   faith buttressed by miracles. There is a vast difference between
   believing in a man, and believing his credentials. Miracles were our
   Lord's credentials; his ministry among men can not be thought of
   without them; and when the Baptist's faith in Christ himself wavered,
   Jesus referred him to them (Matt. xi. 4, 5). See also John x. 37. The
   two words, "signs" and "wonders," indicate the two aspects of miracles.
   To the thoughtful they were signs or attestations that the one who
   performed them acted under the authority and approval of God; to all
   others they were mere wonders, which startled by their strangeness.
   Jesus was fresh from Sychar, where many required no other sign than his
   words.] 49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child
   die. [The father felt that the case was too urgent to admit of delay
   for argument. It seemed to him that he raced with death. His faith
   differed from that of the centurion in that he felt that the presence
   of Jesus was required to perform the miracle. He also regarded the
   powers of Jesus as limited to the living; but we must not censure his
   faith as particularly weak, for in both these respects it resembled
   that possessed by Mary and Martha--John xi. 21, 22, 32, 39.] 50 Jesus
   saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. [Jesus enlarges the
   nobleman's conception of his divine power by showing him that his words
   take effect without regard to distance.] The man believed the word that
   Jesus had spake unto him, and he went his way. 51 And as he was now
   going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. 52 So he
   inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. [More correctly,
   "began to get better." The father expected that the fever would depart
   slowly, as it usually does; but the reply of the servants shows that he
   was mistaken.] They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh
   hour the fever left him. [Though for harmonistic reasons we are
   persuaded that John himself uses the Roman method of computing the
   hours, which would make the phrase here mean 7 P. M., yet since the
   phraseology here is not his, but that of the Galilæan servants, we take
   it to mean 1 P. M., for they would use the Jewish method of computing
   from sunset to sunset. If both parties had started at once, they would
   have met before sundown, as each had but eleven miles to traverse. But
   it is more reasonable to suppose that the wearied but now believing
   father sought some refreshment and a brief rest before returning, and
   that the servants tarried awhile to see if the child's recovery was
   permanent. This would lead to their meeting after sundown, at which
   time, according to the invariable custom, they would call the previous
   period of daylight "yesterday."] 53 So the father knew that it was at
   that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself
   believed, and his whole house. [We note here a growth in the faith of
   the nobleman. He first believed in the power of Jesus' presence, then
   in the power of Jesus' word, and finally he believed generally in
   Jesus, and his household shared his belief. This is the first mention
   of a believing household; for others see Acts xvi. 14, 15, 34; xviii.
   8.] 54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of
   Judæa into Galilee. [One small sign and many converted in Samaria; two
   great miracles and one household converted in Galilee. Such is the
   record. Jesus doubtless had many other converts in Galilee, but it is
   often true that the greater labor brings the lesser harvest.]

Jesus' Temporary Residence at Capernaum.

^A Matt. IV. 13-16.

   ^a 13 And leaving Nazareth [This expression means that Jesus now ceased
   to make Nazareth his home. For description of Nazareth, see page 60],
   he came and dwelt in Capernaum [See page 119. Capernaum means city of
   Nahum, or village of consolation. Its modern name, "Tel-Hum," means
   hill of Nahum. The word "dwelt" means that Jesus made this town his
   headquarters. He owned no house there (Matt. viii. 20). He may have
   dwelt with some of his disciples--for instance, Simon Peter--Matt.
   viii. 14-16], which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and
   Naphtali [Capernaum was in Naphtali, and the border of the tribe of
   Zebulun was three or four miles south of it. This part of the country
   was densely populated, and had in it many choice spirits such as Jesus
   chose for his apostles]: 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
   through Isaiah the prophet [ Isa. viii. 21, 22; ix. 1, 2], saying, 15
   The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond
   the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. [This land or region was the first
   to suffer in the beginning of those wars which finally resulted in the
   captivity of the ten tribes. The people of this district were smitten
   by Benhadad (I. Kings xv. 20), and afterwards by Tiglath-pileser (II.
   Kings xv. 29; I. Chron. v. 26), some time before the general captivity
   of the ten tribes (II. Kings xvii. 6). It is called Galilee of the
   Gentiles, because it was, according to Strabo and others, inhabited by
   Egyptians, Arabians, and Phoenicians, as well as by Hebrews.] 16 The
   people that sat in darkness saw great light, And to them that sat in
   the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring up. [Those who
   by reason of their ignorance and depravity suffered the torments of
   war, and sat as it were under the shadow of the wing of death, were
   designated by prophecies as the class among whom the light of the
   gospel would spring up in the fullness and richness of its blessing.
   Jesus, the "Light of the world," fulfilled this prophecy, and apart
   from him there can be no pretense of its fulfillment. Galilee had its
   prophets, but the enemies of Jesus themselves bear witness that none of
   them were great enough "lights" to fulfill this prophecy--John vii.
   52.]

Jesus Calls Four Fishermen to Follow Him.

(Sea of Galilee, Near Capernaum.)

^A Matt. IV. 18-22; ^B Mark I. 16-20; ^C Luke V. 1-11.

   ^a 18 And walking ^b 16 And passing along by the sea of Galilee [This
   lake is a pear-shaped body of water, about twelve and a half miles long
   and about seven miles across at its widest place. It is 682 feet below
   sea level; its waters are fresh, clear and abounding in fish, and it is
   surrounded by hills and mountains, which rise from 600 to 1,000 feet
   above it. Its greatest depth is about 165 feet], he [Jesus] saw ^a two
   brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, { ^b the
   brother of Simon} casting a net in { ^a into} the sea [The New
   Testament speaks of three kinds of nets, viz.: the amphiblestron, which
   is only mentioned here; the sagene, mentioned only at Matt. xiii. 47;
   and the dictua, which is mentioned in all other places. The dictua was
   a casting-net; the sagene, a seine or dragnet; and the amphiblestron
   was a drawnet, a circular bell-shaped affair, which was thrown upon the
   water, so that it spread out and caught, by sinking, whatever was below
   it]; for they were fishers. [Though Simon and Andrew had been
   companions of Jesus on at least one journey, they did not as yet
   understand that his service would require all their time. The facts
   that Jesus now temporarily resided at Capernaum afforded them an
   opportunity to return to their old occupation, which they readily
   embraced. Fishing was then a prosperous trade on the lake of Galilee.]
   ^b 17 And Jesus said { ^a he saith} ^b unto them, Come ye after me, and
   I will make you to become fishers of men. [It was an invitation to
   follow, that they might be instructed by hearing his teaching and
   beholding his work. Jesus called them from a lower to a similar but
   higher labor. He calls all honest tradesmen in this manner. He invites
   carpenters to build his temple, servants to serve the great King,
   physicians to heal immortal souls, merchants to invest in pearls of
   great price, etc. The fisherman found many points of resemblance
   between the old and new calling, such as, 1, daily hardships and
   dangers; 2, earnest desires for the objects sought; 3, skill and wisdom
   in the use of means, etc. Disciples are fishers, human souls are fish,
   the world is the sea, the gospel is the net, and eternal life is the
   shore whither the catch is drawn.] ^a 21 And going on from thence ^b a
   little further, ^a he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee,
   and John his brother, ^b who also were in the boat ^a with Zebedee
   their father, mending their { ^b the} nets. [They also, like Peter and
   Andrew, were at work when Jesus found them. God calls the busy to his
   business. For instances where God had called the busy, see cases of
   Moses ( Ex. iii. 1, 2), Gideon (Judg. vi. 11), Saul (I. Sam. x. 1-3),
   David (I. Sam. xvi. 11-15), Elisha (I. Kings xix. 19-21), Matthew
   (Matt. ix. 9), Saul (Acts ix. 1-6 ). Moreover most of these were called
   from lowly work, for such is God's method (I. Cor. i. 26-29). We should
   note two reasons why God chose the lowly and unlearned: 1, their minds
   being free from prejudice were more ready to entertain new truth; 2,
   the strength of the gospel was made more apparent by the weakness of
   its ministers (I. Cor. ii. 3-5; II. Cor. iv. 7; Zech. iv. 6). Of these
   two brothers, James was the first apostolic martyr and John the last
   survivor of the twelve. James was beheaded about a.d. 44 ( Acts xii. 1,
   2); and John, after upwards of seventy years of Christian service, died
   at Ephesus about a.d. 100.] 20 And straightway he called them [From
   Matthew and Mark we would suppose that Jesus was alone when he called
   the two sets of brothers, and that with them he immediately left the
   lake. But we learn from Luke that he taught and worked a miracle before
   leaving the lake]: ^c 1 Now it came to pass, while the multitude
   pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the
   lake of Gennesaret [This body of water bore many names. It was
   anciently called Chinnereth (Num. xxxiv. 11), or Chinneroth (Judg. xii.
   3), from a fortified town (Josh. xix. 35) and district (I. Kings xv.
   20) in Naphtali bearing that name. It is here called Gennesaret, from a
   plain of that name upon its northwestern shore (which may be a
   corruption of the old name Chinnereth.) It received its name, Galilee,
   from the district to which it belongs, and in later times it bore the
   name Tiberias (John vi. 1), from the city of that name on its western
   shore]; 2 and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen
   had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. [We may conceive of
   the fishermen, in answer to Jesus' call, drawing their boats together
   to the point where he stood upon the shore. Then, as Jesus stood
   teaching, they occupied themselves in the shallow water behind by
   washing their nets while they listened to him.] 3 And he entered into
   one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little
   from the land. [He did this that he might avoid the press, and that the
   people might be better able both to see and to hear.] And he sat down
   [the usual attitude or posture of a teacher] and taught the multitudes
   out of the boat. 4 And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon,
   Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. ["Put out"
   is in the singular, being addressed to Simon alone; "let down" is
   plural, being addressed generally to those in the boat.] 5 And Simon
   answered and said, Master, we have toiled all the night, and took
   nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets. ["Master" is a
   broader word than "Rabbi"; it indicates a superior, but does not
   confine his superiority to matters of instruction. The words of Peter
   show a willingness to oblige or honor Jesus, but are devoid of hope as
   to the thing proposed. Night was the time for fishing (John xxi. 3);
   and the proper place to cast the net was near the shore; but if Jesus
   wished to fish by daylight in the middle of the lake, Simon was not too
   weary to humor the wish.] 6 And when they had done this, they inclosed
   a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking [that is, the
   nets began to snap when they tried to lift them out of the water] ; 7
   and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they
   should come and help them. [This indicates that they were well out into
   the lake, where it was easier to beckon than to shout explanations.
   Some think the marvel wrought by Jesus made them speechless, but they
   were so engrossed in the magnitude and value of the catch that the full
   glory of the miracle had not yet come upon them.] And they came, and
   filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [They probably ran a
   second net under the one which enclosed the fishes, and by thus
   doubling the strength of the net were able to draw the fish up between
   the boats. A great load thus suddenly dumped in the side of a boat will
   cause it to list, dip water and threaten to sink. Such appears to have
   been the case here until the loads were so distributed as to right the
   ships.] 8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees,
   saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 9 For he was
   amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which
   they had taken [This miracle came home to the soul of Peter because it
   was wrought in his own boat, with his own nets, and concerned his own
   business. Religion is only powerful as it becomes personal. Peter's
   request shows how deeply the miracle impressed him. It gave him that
   sense of the divine presence which never fails to overwhelm the hearts
   of men. No man can behold God in his glory and live (Ex. xxxiii. 20-23;
   xx. 18, 19); and though there have been exceptions where men have seen
   God or his representatives and lived (Ex. xxiv. 9-11; Judg. vi. 21-23;
   xiii. 22, 23; Isa. vi. 1-5; Dan. x. 16-19; Gen. xxxii. 30); yet no man,
   not even the purest, has ever stood in the presence of God or his
   ministers without feeling such a sense of weakness and sinfulness as to
   almost extinguish life--Rev. i. 17; Job xlii. 5, 6] ; 10 and so were
   also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And
   Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
   [Jesus here shows the purpose for which this miracle had been wrought.
   It was a prophetic type or picture which foreshadowed the triumphs of
   the day of Pentecost and other seasons when the apostles had great
   ingatherings of souls through the preaching of the gospel.] 11 And when
   they had brought their boats to land, they ^a straightway ^c left all
   [that is to say, Peter and Andrew], ^b left the nets [but James and
   John], ^a left the boat and their father, ^b Zebedee in the boat with
   the hired servants, and went after him. { ^c followed him} [The four
   partners, boats, different kinds of nets, hired servants, etc., and the
   fact that Salome, the wife of Zebedee, was one of those who ministered
   to Christ out of her substance ( Matt. xxvii. 55, 56; Luke viii. 3),
   all indicate a business of respectable proportions: a fact which
   suggests that the church of Christ would catch more souls if all its
   parts were in partnership. Evidently when the four men left the boats
   and nets Zebedee took charge of them. While the four rightly recognized
   that the divine call was superior to their earthly obligations, there
   is nothing which leads us to imply that their sudden departure
   discomfited Zebedee. The call of Christ here marks a change in their
   relationship to him. Hitherto discipleship had not materially
   interfered with business, but this present call separated them from
   their occupation, and prepared them for the call to be apostles which
   came later, and which required them to be his constant companions--Mark
   iii. 14.]

Healing a Demoniac in a Synagogue.

(at Capernaum.)

^B Mark I. 21-28; ^C Luke . IV. 31-37.

   ^b 21 And they [Jesus and the four fishermen whom he called] go into {
   ^c he came down to} Capernaum, a city of Galilee. [Luke has just spoken
   of Nazareth, and he uses the expression "down to Capernaum" because the
   latter was on the lake shore while Nazareth was up in the mountains.]
   And ^b straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and
   taught. { ^c was teaching them} ^b 22 And they were astonished at his
   teaching: for he taught them as having { ^c his word was with} ^b
   authority, and not as the scribes. [Mark uses the adverb "straightway"
   and the particle "again" (which has a similar meaning) to depict the
   rapid movement of Jesus. As used by him in this connection it probably
   indicates that this was the next Sabbath after the calling of the four
   fishermen. The astonishment of the people was natural. Not yet
   recognizing Jesus' divinity, they could not understand how one so
   humble could speak with such authority. They contrasted his teaching
   with that of the scribes. The scribes were learned men who preserved,
   copied and expounded the law and the tradition (Ez. vii. 6, 12; Neh.
   viii. 1; Matt. xv. 1-6; xxiii. 2-4; Mark xii. 35; Luke xi. 52 ). They
   were also called "lawyers" ( Mark xii. 28; Matt. xxii. 35), and
   "doctors of the law" (Luke v. 17-21). Though the teaching of Jesus
   differed from the teaching of the scribes as to matter, the contrast
   drawn is as to manner. They spoke on the authority of Moses or the
   elders, but Jesus taught by his own authority. Their way was to quote
   minute precedents supported by endless authorities. A passage taken
   from later rabbinical writings starts thus: "Rabbi Zeira says, on the
   authority of Rabbi Jose bar Rabbi Chanina, and Rabbi Ba or Rabbi Chija
   on the authority of Rabbi Jochanan," etc. Contrast this with the
   oft-repeated "I say to you" of Jesus--Matt. v. 18, 20, 22, 26, 28, 34.]
   23 And straightway there was in their { ^c the} ^b synagogue a man with
   { ^c that had} ^b an unclean spirit { ^c a spirit of an unclean demon}
   [Matthew, Luke and Mark all concur in pronouncing demons unclean; that
   is, wicked. They thus corrected the prevailing Greek notion that some
   of the demons were good. The word "demon," as used in our Saviour's
   time by both Jews and Greeks, meant the spirits of the departed or the
   ghosts of dead men, and the teaching of that and prior ages was that
   such spirits often took possession of living men and controlled them.
   But whatever these demons were, the Scripture, both by its treatment of
   them and its words concerning them, clearly indicates that they were
   immaterial, intelligent beings, which are neither to be confused with
   maladies and diseases of the body, nor with tropes, metaphors, or other
   figures of speech. In proof of this we adduce the following Scripture
   facts: 1, the legislation of the Old Testament proceeded upon the
   assumption that there was such a thing as a "familiar spirit" (Lev.
   xix. 31); 2, in the New Testament they are spoken of as personalities
   (Jas. ii. 19; Rev. xvi. 14), Jesus even founding a parable upon their
   habits (Luke xi. 24-26); 3, Jesus distinguished between them and
   diseases, and so did his disciples (Matt. x. 8; Luke x. 17-20); 4,
   Jesus addressed them as persons, and they answered as such (Mark v. 8;
   ix. 25); 5, they manifested desires and passions (Mark v. 12, 13); 6,
   they showed a superhuman knowledge of Jesus (Matt. viii. 29). It would
   be impossible to regard demon possession as a mere disease without
   doing violence to the language used in every instance of the expulsion
   of a demon. The frequency of demoniacal possession in the time of Jesus
   is probably due to the fact that his advent formed a great crisis in
   the spiritual order of things. For fuller treatment of the subject, see
   Millennial Harbinger, 1841, pp. @457, @580; 1842, pp. @65, @124] ; and
   he cried out, ^c with a loud voice [The man cried, the unclean spirit
   determined what he should cry. The silence and decorum of the synagogue
   made the outcry more noticeable, and the demon betrayed his excitement
   and alarm in speaking before he was spoken to], ^b 24 saying, ^c 34 Ah!
   what have we to do with thee [for explanation of this idiom see page
   116], Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? [Jesus came to
   destroy the works of the devil (I. John iii. 8). At his second coming
   the workers themselves shall suffer (Matt. xxv. 41). We find that they
   recognized that the time of this "torment" had not yet come--Matt.
   viii. 29.] I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. [It is
   impossible that fever or disease, mental or physical, could give such
   supernatural knowledge. The demon called Jesus the Holy One, 1, because
   it was one of his proper Scriptural names (Ps. xvi. 10; Acts iii. 14);
   2, because holiness was that characteristic which involved the ruin of
   demons as unholy ones--just as light destroys darkness. We should note
   here the unfruitful knowledge, faith, and confession of demons. They
   lacked neither knowledge (Matt. viii. 29), nor faith (Jas. ii. 19), nor
   did they withhold confession; but Jesus received them not. Repentance
   and willing obedience are as necessary as faith or confession.] 35
   Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. [We
   have in this phrase two personages indicated by the personal pronoun
   "him"; one of whom is commanded to come out of the other; one of whom
   is now rebuked and hereafter to be destroyed, the other of whom is
   delivered. In commanding silence Jesus refused to receive the demon's
   testimony. We can see at least three reasons for this: 1, it was not
   fitting that the fate of the people should rest upon the testimony of
   liars; 2, because receiving such testimony might have been taken as an
   indication that Jesus sustained friendly relations to demons--something
   which the enemies of Christ actually alleged (Matt. xii. 24); 3, the
   Messiahship of Jesus was to be gradually unfolded, and the time for its
   public proclamation had not yet come.] And when the demon { ^b unclean
   spirit} ^c had thrown him down in the midst, ^b tearing him and crying
   with a loud voice, ^c he came out of him, having done him no hurt. [The
   demon first racked the body of the man with a convulsion, and then,
   with a cry of rage, came out. All this was permitted that, 1, there
   might be clear evidence of demoniacal possession; 2, the demon's
   malignity might be shown; 3, it might be manifested that the spirit
   came not out of its own accord, but because compelled thereto by the
   command of Christ. The cry was, however, a mere impotent expression of
   anger, for Luke, "the beloved physician," notes that it did the man no
   hurt.] ^b 27 And they were all amazed, { ^a amazement came upon all},
   ^b insomuch that they questioned among themselves, ^c and they spake
   together, one with another, saying, ^b What thing is this? ^c What is
   this word? ^b a new teaching! ^c for with authority and power he
   commandeth ^b even the unclean spirits, ^c and they come out. ^b and
   they obey him. [The power to command disembodied spirits thus amazed
   the people, because it was more mysterious than the power to work
   physical miracles. By this miracle Jesus demonstrated his actual
   possession of the authority which he had just assumed in his teaching.]
   28 And the report of him went out straightway { ^c 37 And there went
   forth a rumor concerning him} ^b everywhere into all { ^c every place
   of} ^b the region of Galilee roundabout. [This fame was occasioned both
   by the miracle and the teaching. The benevolence and publicity of the
   miracle, and its power--the power of one mightier than Satan--would
   cause excitement in any community, in any age. Though this is the first
   miracle recorded by either Mark or Luke, yet neither asserts that it
   was the first miracle Jesus wrought, so there is no conflict with John
   ii. 11.]

Healing Peter's Mother-in-Law and Many Others.

(at Capernaum.)

^A Matt. VIII. 14-17; ^B Mark I. 29-34; ^C Luke IV. 38-41.

   ^c 38 And he arose out of the synagogue [where he had just healed the
   demoniac], ^b 29 And straightway, when they were come out of the
   synagogue, they came { ^c entered} ^b into the house of Simon and
   Andrew, with James and John. [Peter and Andrew had dwelt at Bethsaida
   (John i. 44). They may have removed to Capernaum, or Bethsaida, being
   near by, may be here counted as a part, or suburb, of Capernaum. Its
   name does not contradict this view, for it means "house of fishing" or
   "fishery."] 30 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of { ^c was holden
   with} a great fever. [The Papists, who claim that Peter was the first
   pope, must confess that he was married at this time, and continued to
   be so for years afterwards (I. Cor. ix. 5). Celibacy is unauthorized by
   Scripture (Heb. xiii. 4 ). God says it is not good (Gen. ii. 18 ). Luke
   speaks as a physician; for Galen, the father of medicine, divided
   fevers into little and great.] ^a 14 And when Jesus was come into
   Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever. ^b and
   straightway they tell him of her: ^c and they besought him for her.
   [Their interest in her shows the spirit of love and kindness which
   pervaded the home.] ^b 31 and he came ^c 39 And he stood over her, and
   rebuked the fever [Though it was an inanimate force, it was still
   subject to rebuke, as were the winds and waves of Galilee--Matt. viii.
   26]; ^a 15 And he touched her hand, ^b and took her by the hand, and
   raised her up [thus showing the miracle came from him, and that he felt
   a tender interest in the sufferer]; ^c and it { ^b the fever} ^c left
   her: and immediately she rose up { ^a arose,} ^b and she ministered
   unto them. { ^a him.} [Her complete recovery emphasized the miracle.
   Such fevers invariably leave the patient weak, and the period of
   convalescence is long and trying, and often full of danger. She showed
   her gratitude by her ministry.] ^b 32 And at even, ^a when even was
   come, ^c when the sun was setting, { ^b did set,} ^c all they that had
   any sick with divers diseases, brought them unto him; ^b they brought
   unto him all that were sick, and them { ^a many} ^b that were possessed
   with demons. [Their delay till sundown was unquestionably caused by the
   traditional law of the Sabbath which forbade men to carry any burden on
   that day (John v. 10). The Sabbath closed at sundown ( Lev. xxiii. 32).
   The distinction is drawn between the sick and the demon-possessed.
   Lightfoot gives two reasons why demoniacal possession was so common at
   that time, viz.: 1, the intense wickedness of the nation; 2, the
   addiction of the nation to magic, whereby the people invited evil
   spirits to be familiar with them.] ^c and he laid his hands on every
   one of them, ^a and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all
   ^c them ^a that were sick: 17 that it might be fulfilled which was
   spoken through Isaiah the prophet [Isa. liii. 4] , saying, Himself took
   our infirmities, and bare our diseases. [Isaiah's vision is
   progressive; he sees, first, a man of sorrows; second, a man sorrowful
   because he bore the sickness and sorrows of others; third, a man who
   also bore sin, and healed the souls of others by so doing. Such was the
   order of Christ's life. His early years were spent in poverty and
   obscurity; his days of ministry in bearing, by sympathy and compassion,
   the sicknesses and sorrows of others (John xi. 35; Mark xiv. 34); and
   in the hour of his crucifixion, he became the world's sin-bearer--John
   i. 29; I. Pet. ii. 24.] ^b 33 And all the city was gathered together at
   the door. 34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and
   cast out many demons; ^c 41 And demons also came out from many, crying
   out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he
   suffered them { ^b the demons} ^c not to speak, ^b because they knew
   him. ^c that he was Christ. [Those who are disposed to frequent
   spiritual seances and to seek information from mediums should remember
   that the Son of God permitted his disciples to receive no information
   from such sources. He forbade demons to speak in the presence of his
   own, even on the most important of all topics.]

Jesus Makes a Preaching Tour Through Galilee.

^A Matt. IV. 23-25; ^B Mark I. 35-39; ^C Luke IV. 42-44.

   ^b 35 And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up went out
   [i. e., from the house of Simon Peter], and departed into a desert
   place, and there prayed. [Though Palestine was densely populated, its
   people were all gathered into towns, so that it was usually easy to
   find solitude outside the city limits. A ravine near Capernaum, called
   the Vale of Doves, would afford such solitude. Jesus taught (Matt. vi.
   6) and practiced solitary prayer. We can commune with God better when
   alone than when in the company of even our dearest friends. It is a
   mistaken notion that one can pray equally well at all times and in all
   places. Jesus being in all things like men, except that he was sinless
   (Heb. ii. 17), must have found prayer a real necessity. He prayed as a
   human being. Several reasons for this season of prayer are suggested,
   from which we select two: 1. It was a safeguard against the temptation
   to vainglory induced by the unbounded admiration and praise of the
   multitude whom he had just healed. 2. It was a fitting preparation on
   the eve of his departure on his first missionary tour.] ^c 42 And when
   it was day, he came out and went into a desert place. [Mark has in mind
   the season when Jesus sought the Father in prayer, and so he tells us
   it was "a great while before day." Luke has in mind the hour when Jesus
   faced and spoke to the multitude, so he says, "When it was day."] ^b 36
   And Simon. [As head of the house which Jesus had just left, Simon
   naturally acted as leader and guide to the party which sought Jesus]
   and they that were with him [they who were stopping in Simon's house;
   viz.: Andrew, James, and John] followed after him [literally, "pursued
   after him." Xenophon uses this word to signify the close pursuit of an
   enemy in war. Simon had no hesitancy in obtruding on the retirement of
   the Master. This rushing after Jesus in hot haste accorded with his
   impulsive nature. The excited interest of the people seemed to the
   disciples of Jesus to offer golden opportunities, and they could not
   comprehend his apparent indifference to it] ; 37 and they found him,
   and say unto him, All are seeking thee. [The disciples saw a multitude
   seeking Jesus for various causes: some to hear, some for excitement,
   some for curiosity. To satisfy the people seemed to them to be Christ's
   first duty. Jesus understood his work better than they. He never
   encouraged those who sought through mere curiosity or admiration (John
   vi. 27). Capernaum accepted the benefit of his miracles, but rejected
   his call to repentance--Matt. xi. 23.] 38 And he saith unto them, Let
   us go elsewhere into the next towns [the other villages of Galilee],
   that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth. [I. e., I
   came forth from the Father (John xvi. 28) to make and preach a gospel.
   His disciples failed to understand his mission. Afterwards preaching
   was with the apostles the all-important duty--Acts vi. 2; I. Cor. i.
   17.] ^c and the multitudes sought him after him, and came unto him, and
   would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. [They would
   have selfishly kept his blessed ministries for their own exclusive
   enjoyment.] 43 But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of
   the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.
   [Jesus sought to arouse the entire nation. That which the disciples
   regarded as a large work in Capernaum was consequently in his sight a
   very small one. Those who understand that it is God's will and wish to
   save every man that lives upon the earth will not be overelated by a
   successful revival in some small corner of the great field of labor.]
   ^b 39 And he ^a Jesus went about in all Gailiee [The extreme length of
   Galilee was about sixty-three miles, and its extreme width about
   thirty-three miles. Its average dimensions were about fifty by
   twenty-five miles. It contained, according to Josephus, two hundred and
   forty towns and villages. Its population at that time is estimated at
   about three millions. Lewin calculates that this circuit of Galilee
   must have occupied four or five months. The verses of this paragraph
   are, therefore, a summary of the work and influence of Jesus during the
   earlier part of his ministry. They are a general statement, the details
   of which are given in the subsequent chapters of the Gospels of
   Matthew, Mark, and Luke--the Gospel of John dealing more particularly
   with the work in Judæa], ^b into their synagogues throughout all
   Galilee, ^a teaching in their synagogues [The word "synagogue" is
   compounded of the two Greek words "sun, " together, and "ago," to
   collect. It is, therefore, equivalent to our English word
   "meeting-house." Tradition and the Targums say that these Jewish houses
   of worship existed from the earliest times. In proof of this assertion
   Deut. xxxi. 11 and Ps. lxxiv. 8 are cited. But the citations are
   insufficient, that in Deuteronomy not being in point, and the
   seventy-fourth Psalm being probably written after the Babylonian
   captivity. It better accords with history to believe that the synagogue
   originated during the Babylonian captivity, and was brought into the
   motherland by the returning exiles. Certain it is that the synagogue
   only came into historic prominence after the books of the Old Testament
   were written. At the time of our Saviour's ministry synagogues were
   scattered all over Palestine, and also over all quarters of the earth
   whither the Jews had been dispersed. Synagogues were found in very
   small villages, for wherever ten "men of leisure," willing and able to
   devote themselves to the service of the synagogue, were found, a
   synagogue might be erected. In the synagogues the people met together
   on the Sabbaths to pray, and to listen to the reading of the portions
   of the Old Testament, and also to hear such instruction or exhortation
   as might be furnished. With the permission of the president of the
   synagogue any one who was fitted might deliver an address. Thus the
   synagogues furnished Jesus (and in later times his disciples also) with
   a congregation and a suitable place for preaching. We find that on week
   days Jesus often preached in the open air. But the synagogues are thus
   particularly mentioned, probably, because in them were held the most
   important services, because they were necessary during the rainy and
   cold season, and because their use shows that as yet the Jewish rulers
   had not so prejudiced the public mind as to exclude Jesus from the
   houses of worship] , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, ^b and
   casting out demons [Mark singles out this kind of miracle as most
   striking and wonderful], ^a and healing all manner of disease and all
   manner of sickness among the people. 24 And the report of him went
   forth into all Syria [caravans passing through Galilee back and forth
   between the Mediterranean seaports on the west and the Persian cities
   on the east, and between Damascus on the north and Egypt on the south,
   would carry the reports concerning Jesus far and wide]: and they
   brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and
   torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he
   healed them. [Thus, by his actions, Jesus showed that the kingdom of
   God had come. The wonders of Moses were mostly miracles of judgment,
   those of Jesus were acts of compassion. The diseases here enumerated
   are still among the most difficult for physicians to handle. The term
   "palsy" included all forms of paralysis, catalepsy, and cramps.] 25 And
   there followed him great multitudes [these popular demonstration, no
   doubt, intensified the erroneous notion of his disciples that the
   kingdom of Jesus was to be one of worldly grandeur] from Galilee and
   Decapolis [Decapolis is formed from the two Greek words "deka," ten,
   and "polis," city. As a geographical term, Decapolis refers to that
   part of Syria lying east, southeast, and south of the Lake of Galilee.
   There is some doubt as to which were the ten cities named, for there
   seem at times to have been fourteen of them. Those commonly reckoned
   are 1. Damascus. 2. Philadelphia. 3. Raphana. 4. Sycthopolis. 5.
   Gadara. 6. Hyppos. 7. Dion. 8. Pella. 9. Galas. 10. Kanatha. The other
   four are Abila and Kanata (distinct from Kanatha), Cæsarea Philippi,
   and Gergesa. None of these were in Galilee save Sycthopolis. According
   to Ritter, these cities were colonized principally by veterans from the
   army of Alexander the Great. A reminiscence of their Macedonian origin
   is found in the fact that there was a city named Pella in Macedonia.
   These cities are said to have been formed into a confederacy by Pompey
   the Great. In the time of Jesus they were chiefly inhabited by Greeks
   or heathens, and not by Jews. Josephus expressly calls Gadara and
   Hyppos Greek cities] and Jerusalem and Judæa and from beyond the
   Jordan. [The land beyond Jordan was called Peræa, which means "beyond."
   According to Josephus, it included territory between the cities of
   Pella on the north and Machærus on the south. That is to say, its
   northern boundary began on the Jordan opposite the southern line of
   Galilee, and its southern boundary was at Moab, about the middle of the
   east shore of the Dead Sea.] ^c 44 And he was preaching in the
   synagogues of Galilee.

Jesus Heals a Leper and Creates Much Excitement.

^A Matt.VIII. 2-4; ^B Mark I. 40-45; ^C Luke V. 12-16.

   ^c 12 And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities [it was a
   city of Galilee, but as it was not named, it is idle to conjecture
   which city it was], behold, ^b there cometh { ^a came} ^b to him a
   leper [There is much discussion as to what is here meant by leprosy.
   Two diseases now go by that name; viz., psoriasis and elephantiasis.
   There are also three varieties of psoriasis, namely, white, black and
   red. There are also three varieties or modifications of elephantiasis,
   namely, tubercular, spotted or streaked, and anæsthetic. Elephantiasis
   is the leprosy found in modern times in Syria, Greece, Spain, Norway
   and Africa. Now, since Lev. xiii., in determining leprosy, lays great
   stress on a white or reddish-white depression of the skin, the hairs in
   which are turned white or yellow, and since it also provides that the
   leper who is white all over shall be declared clean, and since in the
   only two cases where lepers are described--Num. xii. 10; II. Kings v.
   27--they are spoken of as "white as snow," scholars have been led to
   think that the Biblical leprosy was the white form of psoriasis. But
   the facts hardly warrant us in excluding the other forms of psoriasis,
   or even elephantiasis; for 1. Leviticus xiii. also declares that any
   bright spot or scale shall be pronounced leprosy, if it be found to
   spread abroad over the body; and this indefinite language would let in
   elephantiasis, cancer and many other skin diseases. In fact, the law
   deals with the initial symptoms rather than with the ultimate phases of
   the fully developed disease. 2. Elephantiasis was a common disease in
   our Saviour's time, and has been ever since, and would hardly be called
   leprosy now, if it had not been popularly so called then. The word
   "leprosy" comes from "lepo," which means to peel off in scales. It is
   hereditary for generations, though modern medical authorities hold that
   it is not contagious. However, the returning Crusaders spread it all
   over Europe in the tenth and eleventh centuries, so that according to
   Matthew Paris there was no less than nine thousand hospitals set apart
   for its victims. The facts that the priests had to handle and examine
   lepers, and that any one who was white all over with leprosy was
   declared clean, led scholars to think that the laws of Moses, which
   forbade any one to approach or touch a leper, were not enacted to
   prevent the spread of a contagion, but for typical and symbolic
   purposes. It is thought that God chose the leprosy as the symbol of sin
   and its consequences, and that the Mosaic legislation was given to
   carry out this conception. Being the most loathsome and incurable of
   all diseases, it fitly represents in bodily form the ravages of sin in
   the soul of a man. But there must also have been a sanitary principle
   in God's laws, since we still deem it wise to separate lepers, and
   since other people besides the Hebrews (as the Persians) prohibited
   lepers from mingling with other citizens. Elephantiasis is the most
   awful disease known. The body of its victim disintegrates joint by
   joint, until the whole frame crumbles to pieces. Psoriasis is milder,
   but is very distressing. Mead thus describes a case: The "skin was
   shining as covered with flakes of snow. And as the furfuraceous or
   bran-like, scales were daily rubbed off, the flesh appeared quick or
   raw underneath." In addition to the scaly symptoms, the skin becomes
   hard and cracks open, and from the cracks an ichorous humor oozes. The
   disease spreads inwardly, and ends in consumption, dropsy, suffocation,
   and death], ^c a man full of leprosy [Some have thought that Luke meant
   to indicate one so completely covered with leprosy as to be clean (Lev.
   xiii. 12-17). But the fact that Jesus sent him to the priest, shows
   that he was not such a clean leper. Luke meant to describe a leper in
   the last stages of the disease--a leper past all hope]: and when he saw
   Jesus, ^b beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him,
   ^c he fell on his face, ^a and worshipped him, ^c and besought him,
   saying, ^b unto him, ^c Lord [The Jews, in addressing any distinguished
   person, usually employed the title "Lord." They were also accustomed to
   kneel before prophets and kings. It is not likely that the leper knew
   enough of Jesus to address him as the Son of God. He evidently took
   Jesus for some great prophet; but he must have had great faith, for he
   was full of confidence that Jesus had power to heal him, although there
   was but one case of leper-cleansing in the Scriptures--II. Kings v.
   1-19; Luke iv. 27], if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. [The leper
   believed in the power of Jesus, but doubted his willingness to expend
   it on one so unworthy and so unclean. In temporal matters we can not
   always be as sure of God's willingness as we can be of his power. We
   should note that the man asked rather for the blessing of cleanness
   than for health. To the Jew uncleanness was more horrible than disease.
   It meant to be an outcast from Israel, and to be classed with swine,
   dogs and other odious and abhorrent creatures. The leper, therefore,
   prayed that the Lord would remove his shame and pollution.] ^b 41 And
   being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched
   him [Mark habitually notes the feelings, and hence also the gestures of
   Jesus. It was not an accidental, but an intentional, touch. Popular
   belief so confused and confounded leprosy with the uncleanness and
   corruption of sin, as to make the leper feel that Jesus might also
   compromise his purity if he concerned himself to relieve it. The touch
   of Jesus, therefore, gave the leper a new conception of divine
   compassion. It is argued that Jesus, by this touch, was made legally
   unclean until the evening (Lev. xiii. 46; xi. 40). But we should note
   the spirit and purpose of this law. Touch was prohibited because it
   defiled the person touching, and aided not the person touched. In
   Jesus' case the reasons for the law were absent, the conditions being
   reversed. Touching defiled not the toucher, and healed the touched. In
   all things Jesus touches and shares our human state, but he so shares
   it that instead of his being defiled by our uncleanness, we are
   purified by his righteousness. Moreover, Jesus, as a priest after the
   order of Melchizedek (Heb. v. 6), possessed the priestly right to touch
   the leper without defilement-- Heb. iv. 15], and saith unto him, { ^c
   saying,} I will; be thou made clean. [The Lord's answer is an echo of
   the man's prayer. The words, "I will," express the high authority of
   Jesus.] ^b 42 And straightway the { ^a his} ^c leprosy departed from
   him, { ^a was cleansed.} ^b and he was made clean. ["Luke says,
   'departed', giving the merely physical view of the event. Matthew says,
   'was cleansed', using ceremonial language. Mark combines the two
   forms"--Godet.] 43 And he strictly charged him, ^c to tell no man [The
   language used indicates that Jesus sternly forbade the man to tell what
   had been done. The man's conduct, present and future, shows that he
   needed severe speech. In his uncontrollable eagerness to be healed he
   had overstepped his privileges, for he was not legally permitted to
   thus enter cities and draw near to people (Num. v. 2, 3); he was to
   keep at a distance from them, and covering his mouth, was to cry,
   "Tame, tame--unclean, unclean" (Lev. xiii. 45, 46; Luke xvii. 12, 13).
   The man evinced a like recklessness in disregarding the command of
   Jesus]: ^b and straightway sent him out, ^a 4 And Jesus saith unto him,
   See thou tell no man; { ^b say nothing to any man:} [Several reasons
   are suggested why the Lord thus commanded silence: 1. It may have been
   better for the man not to mention his cure (John ix. 34). 2. He
   required the decision of the priest to make him legally clean; and too
   much talk might so prejudice the priests as to lead them to refuse to
   admit his cure. 3. But the best reason is that it accorded with our
   Lord's general course, which was to suppress excitement, and thus
   prevent too great crowds from gathering about him and hindering his
   work. To take this view is to say that Jesus meant to prevent exactly
   what happened] ^c but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for
   thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, ^b the things which { ^a
   the gift that} Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. [Though
   healed of his leprosy, the man was not legally clean until declared so
   by the priest. The priest alone could readmit him to the congregation.
   The local priest inspected the healed leper, and if he was found clean
   or cured, he was purified by the use of two birds, cedar wood, scarlet
   and hyssop, razor and bath. After seven days he was again inspected,
   and if still cured the priest repaired with him to the temple, where he
   offered the gift for his cleansing, which was three lambs, with flour
   and oil; or if the leper was poor, one lamb and two doves or pigeons,
   with flour and oil (Lev. xiv.). The healed leper was a testimony that
   Messiah, the great Physician, had come, and that he respected the law
   of Moses. This testimony was given both to priests and people.] 45 But
   he went out [from the presence of Jesus and from the city], and began
   to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, { ^c 15 But so
   much the more went abroad the report concerning him:}. [The leper was
   so elated that he could scarcely refrain from publishing his cure, and
   he must also have thought that this was what Jesus really wanted--that
   in commanding him not to publish it he did not mean what he said] and
   great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of
   their infirmities. ^b insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter
   into a city [Not a natural or physical inability, but the inability of
   impropriety. Jesus could not do what he judged not best to do. The
   excitement cause by such an entry was injurious in several ways: 1. It
   gave such an emphasis to the miracles of Jesus as to make them
   overshadow his teaching. 2. It threatened to arouse the jealousy of the
   government. 3. It rendered the people incapable of calm thought. Two
   things constantly threatened the ministry of Jesus, namely, impatience
   in the multitude, and envious malice in the priests and Pharisees.
   Jesus wished to add to neither of these elements of opposition. Thus
   the disobedience of the leper interrupted Jesus, and thwarted him in
   his purpose to visit the villages. Disobedience, no matter how
   well-meaning, always hinders the work of Christ], ^c 16 But he withdrew
   himself in the deserts, { ^b was without in desert places:} [That is,
   the the remote grazing-lands like that desert in which he afterwards
   fed the five thousand. Such was our Lord's unexampled meekness that he
   preferred the silent deserts to the applause of multitudes. His
   meekness was as high above the capacity of a merely human being as were
   his miracles] ^c and prayed. [Luke's gospel is pre-eminently the gospel
   of prayer and thanksgiving] ^b and they came to him from every quarter.

Jesus Heals a Paralytic at Capernaum.

^A Matt. IX. 2-8; ^B Mark II. 1-12; ^C Luke V. 17-26.

   ^c 17 And it came to pass on one of those days, ^b when he entered
   again into Capernaum after some days, ^c that he was teaching; ^b it
   was noised that he was in the house. [Luke uses the general expression
   "those days," referring to the early portion of our Lord's ministry in
   Galilee. Mark says, "some days," which implies the lapse of a
   considerable interval. The healing of the leper created such excitement
   that for some time, several weeks, Jesus kept out of the cities. He
   now, after the excitement has subsided, quietly enters Capernaum, and
   probably goes to the house of Simon Peter, now looked upon as his head
   quarters in Capernaum (Mark i. 29). His entrance into Capernaum marks
   the end of his first missionary tour through Galilee.] 2 And many were
   gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not
   even about the door: and he spake the word unto them. [Oriental houses
   are one or two storied structures, built in the form of a square, or
   rectangle, with an open space in the center called the court. They have
   one door which opens from the street into an open space called the
   porch, and this porch in turn opens upon the court. In this porch there
   is usually a stairway leading to the roof. The roofs are invariably
   flat, and are surrounded by a breastwork or parapet to keep those on
   them from falling off. Roofs or housetops are used as we use yards,
   only they are somewhat private. Some think that this house was a
   two-storied structure, and that Jesus was teaching in the upper room or
   second story. If this were so, there would have been little profit to
   the people who clung about the street door, for they could neither see
   nor hear. Besides, a two-storied house would probably have been beyond
   the means of Simon Peter. It is more likely that Jesus was in the room
   opposite the porch across the court. If so, the crowd at the door might
   catch an occasional word, or by tiptoing obtain a momentary glance; and
   thus fan the hope of some ultimate satisfaction. The gospel is here
   called "the word," for it is the Word among words, as the Bible is the
   Book among books.] ^c and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law
   sitting by [the fact that they were sitting, shows that they were
   honored above the rest: Jesus did not increase their ill-will by any
   needless disrespect], who were come out of every village of Galilee and
   Judaea and Jerusalem [It is not likely that such a gathering came
   together by accident. Capernaum was known to be the headquarters of
   Jesus, and these leaders of the people had doubtless gathered there to
   wait for some opportunity to see or hear Jesus. They recognized the
   necessity of coming to some definite judgment regarding him. We shall
   see in this scene the beginning of their hostility to Jesus, which
   developed into four objections: 1. Alleged blasphemy; 2. Intercourse
   with publicans and sinners; 3. Supposed neglect of ascetic duties, such
   as washings, fastings, etc.; 4. Alleged violation of the sabbath]: and
   the power of the Lord was with him to heal. [That is to say, the power
   of God the Father was then working in Jesus to perform miracles (John
   xiv. 10). Some take this as implying that other miracles had been
   wrought that day, before the arrival of the paralytic. But the words
   are more likely a preface for what follows; in which case the meaning
   is that the cold disbelief of the Pharisees did not prevent Jesus from
   working miracles, as disbelief usually did--Matt. xiii. 58; xvi. 1-4.]
   18 And behold, men bring { ^a they brought ^b they come, bringing} unto
   him a man sick of the palsy, { ^c that was palsied:} ^a lying on a bed:
   ^b borne of four [Palsy is an abbreviation of the word "paralysis." It
   is caused by a cessation of the nervous activities. See page 175. In
   the East bedsteads were practically unknown. An Oriental bed is a thin
   mattress, or pallet, just large enough for a man to lie upon; and those
   generally used by the poor to-day are made of sheepskin with the wool
   on it. Such a bed could be easily carried by four men, if each took
   hold of a corner.] ^c and they sought to bring him in [i. e., into the
   house], and to lay him before him. 19 And not finding by what way they
   might bring him in because of the multitude, ^b 4 And when they could
   not come nigh unto him for the crowd [To these four who sought Jesus it
   seemed a case of now or never. If they waited till another season,
   Jesus might withdraw himself again for "some days," or the palsied man
   might die. "Now" is always the day of salvation], ^c they went up to
   the housetop [They went up by means of the stairs in the porch, or by
   ascending to the roof of an adjoining house, and stepping across to the
   roof of Simon's house. Many commentators assert that they went up by an
   outside stairway, erroneously believing that such stairs are common in
   Palestine; but they are almost unknown there, and their presence would
   only expose the inmates of the house to violence and pillage], ^b they
   uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they
   let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. ^c and let him down
   through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus. [Some
   have thought that removing the roof merely means that they took away
   the awning over the court, and also that the removal of the tile merely
   means that they took down the parapet or wall which prevented people
   from falling from the roof into the court. But the language is strongly
   against such a construction. An awning is not a roof, and it is rolled
   up, not "broken up." Moreover, the man was let down "through the
   tiles," which seems to indicate that the remaining tiles encased an
   opening through which he was lowered. The tiles were plates of burnt
   clay, suitable for roofing rather than for building walls or parapets.
   We are not told in what part of the house Jesus stood, but evidently an
   opening was made in the flat roof above him, and the man was lowered to
   the floor in front of Jesus by means of short straps or pieces of rope
   fastened to the four corners of the bed. A stout parapet would have
   aided rather than hindered, if the body had been lowered into the
   court.] ^b 5 And Jesus seeing their faith [The four friends of the sick
   man showed their faith by those bold and persistent efforts which took
   liberties with the house of a neighbor; and the palsied man showed his
   faith by consenting to the extraordinary means employed in his behalf]
   saith { ^a said} unto the sick of the palsy, Son, { ^c Man,} ^a be of
   good cheer; ^c thy sins are forgiven thee. [The affectionate address,
   "Son," might have ordinarily surprised the Jewish doctors, who held
   themselves too far removed from sinners to speak thus familiarly with
   them. But the smaller surprise was swallowed up in the greater, when
   they heard Jesus pronounce the forgiveness of the man's sins. Since man
   had trod the globe, sin against God had never been pardoned by the
   direct, authoritative utterance of fleshly lips. Such power resides in
   Jesus alone. Since then, and even in modern times, mistaken priests
   have presumed to speak forgiveness; but the apostles claimed no such
   power (Acts viii. 22). So far as the church forgives sins (John xx. 23
   ), it does it merely as the organ of God, and must do so according to
   the methods and ordinances laid down by God. Those who profess to
   forgive sin by word of mouth, should be able to make good their claim
   to this boasted power by healing diseases or otherwise removing the
   consequences of sin. Failing to do this, they must forever rest under
   justified suspicion that they are, wittingly or unwittingly, guilty of
   blasphemy.] ^b 6 But there were certain of the scribes ^c and the
   Pharisees ^b sitting there, ^a 3 And behold, [they] ^c began to reason,
   ^b and reasoning in their hearts, ^a said within themselves, ^c saying,
   ^a This man blasphemeth. ^b 7 Why doth this that man thus speak? [A
   scornful expression, shown by the repetition, houtos houtoo, which
   means, literally, "this one these things."] ^c Who is this that
   speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, ^b but one, even God? ^c
   alone? [In classic Greek to blaspheme means to speak evil or, or to
   slander a person, and it is used in this sense in the New Testament
   (Tit. iii. 2; II. Pet. ii. 2; Jude 8). Its ordinary New Testament use,
   however, is quite different, since it is employed to designate
   something which reflects evil on the character and nature of God. This
   use is peculiar to monotheistic writers, and was unknown to the Greeks.
   Such blasphemies may be divided into three general heads, thus: 1. To
   attribute the unworthy to God. 2. To deny the worthy to God. 3. To
   arrogate or claim any attribute, power, authority, etc., which belongs
   to exclusively to God. It was under this third head that Jesus seemed
   to lay himself open to accusation--an accusation entirely just if he
   had not been the Son of God. The Pharisees were not faulty in their
   logic, but were mistaken in their premises; hence Jesus does not deny
   their doctrine; he merely corrects their mistaken application of it to
   himself. As to this pronounced forgiveness of Jesus, two questions
   arise: 1. Why did he forgive the man's sins? The haste with which the
   man was brought to Jesus suggests that his condition was critical; in
   which case the torment of sin would be the greater. As a searcher of
   hearts, Jesus saw the unuttered desire of the sick man, and at once
   responded to it. If his words meant nothing to the conscience of the
   man, they were wasted; but Jesus knew what was in man. 2. Why did he
   pronounce the forgiveness so publicly? As the terms of pardon
   prescribed in the law were yet in full force, this open speech of Jesus
   was a surprising assertion of authority. In fact, such assertions were
   exceptional in his ministry; for only on three recorded occasions did
   he thus forgive sins (Luke vii. 48; xxiii. 43). Being the exceptional
   and not the established method of pardon, and being thus employed in
   the presence of so representative an audience, it was evidently used
   for a special purpose; and that purpose was to show that Jesus had such
   power, that men seeing this power might believe him to be the Son of
   God. He was vindicating an eternal law of the universe, in which all
   human beings throughout all generations would be interested; viz.: that
   humanity has a Ruler who can present it spotless before the throne of
   God (Jude 24). Jesus propounded his law in the presence of those most
   interested in exposing it if false, and most able to explode it had it
   not been true. Whether his words were truth or blasphemy, was the
   controversy between Christ and the rulers from that day to the end of
   his ministry--Matt. xxvi. 65.] ^b 8 And straightway Jesus, perceiving
   in his spirit that they so reasoned { ^c their reasonings,} ^b within
   themselves, ^a 4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts [Jesus read their
   thoughts by his divine insight, and not because of any recognized habit
   or tendency on their part to criticise him, for this is the first
   recorded indication of hostility on the part of the Pharisees, though
   it is hinted at, at John iv. 1. Such discernment of the thought was to
   be a characteristic mark of the expected Messiah ( Isa. xi. 2, 3), and
   Jesus had it (John ii. 25). It also is an attribute peculiar to God--I.
   Chron. xxviii. 9; Jer. xvii. 10; Rom. viii. 27; Rev. ii. 23] ^c
   answered and said { ^b saith} unto them, ^a Wherefore think ye evil in
   your hearts? [Jesus could see invisible sin, and could forgive it or
   condemn it, as the conditions moved him. The powers of discernment,
   forgiveness and condemnation make him the perfect Judge.] ^b Why reason
   ye in your hearts? ^a 5 For which is easier, ^b to say to the sick of
   the palsy, ^c Thy sins are forgiven thee; ^b or to say, Arise, and take
   up thy bed, and walk? [To understand this sentence we should place the
   emphasis upon the word "say," because the question at issue was the
   power or effect of his speech. The rabbis, after their first shock of
   surprise, thought that Jesus feared to attempt the fraud of a so-called
   miracle in the presence of learned men, lest he should be detected and
   exposed; and hence looked upon his present action as an attempt to bear
   himself safely off before the public, and to maintain his standing by
   the use of high-sounding words. They felt that he used words of unseen
   effect, because he dared not use those of seen effect. This was
   precisely the view that Jesus knew they would take, and that he wished
   them to take; for by showing his ability to work in the realms of sight
   that which is impossible; viz.: the healing of the sick man, he could
   place before them proof suited to their own reasoning that he had a
   like ability to work the impossible in the realms of the unseen; viz.:
   the forgiveness of the man's sins. By thus demonstrating his authority
   in the eternal and physical world, Jesus assures us of his dominion
   over the internal and spiritual.] 10 But that ye may know that the Son
   of man [Daniel's name for the Messiah--Dan. vii. 10-13] hath authority
   on earth to forgive sins [The words "on earth" are taken by some to
   indicate the then existing contrast between Christ's present
   humiliation or ministry on earth, and his future glorification or
   enthronement in heaven; in which case they would mean that Jesus could
   grant now that which some might think could only be exercised
   hereafter. Others take them to mean the same as if Jesus had said, "You
   think that forgiveness can only be granted by the Father in heaven, but
   it can also be granted by the Son upon earth. That which you have
   heretofore sought from the Father you may now seek from me." The latter
   is probably the correct view. As to the test of power or authority, the
   miracle of Jesus was very convincing; for in the popular opinion sin
   was a cause of which disease was the effect. We are told, on the
   authority of later rabbis, that it was a maxim among the Jews that no
   diseased person could be healed till his sins were blotted out. We also
   recognize a correlation between sins and diseases, which the Saviour's
   use of this miracle justifies. A mere miracle, such as swallowing fire
   or causing iron to float, would not prove his ability to forgive sins.
   The proof consisted in the relation which disease bears to sin, and the
   consequent relation which healing bears to forgiveness. The connection
   between disease and sin is a real and necessary one. The Jews were
   right in seeing this connection, but they erred in thinking that they
   were warranted in personally criminating every one whom they found
   afflicted, and in judging that the weight of the affliction indicated
   the quantity of the sin. The Book of Job should have corrected this
   error. Such unrighteous judgments are condemned by Christ (John ix. 3;
   Luke xiii. 2-5). Paralysis is, however, to-day looked upon as
   ordinarily the punishment of some personal sin, usually that of
   intemperance or sensuality], ^a (then saith he to the sick of the
   palsy), { ^c (he said unto him that was palsied),} I say unto thee,
   Arise, and take up thy couch, { ^b bed,} ^c and go up unto thy house.
   [What command could be more pleasant than that which bade this sick man
   go home forgiven and healed?] 25 And immediately he rose up { ^a
   arose,} ^c before them, ^b and straightway took up the bed, ^c that
   whereon he lay ["A sweet saying! The bed had borne the man; now the man
   bore the bed"--Bengel], ^b and went forth before them all ^a and
   departed to his house. ^c glorifying God. ^b insomuch that they were
   all amazed, 8 But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, ^c 26
   And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God [The "all" of
   this passage hardly includes the scribes and Pharisees, or, if it does,
   their admiration of Jesus was but a momentary enthusiasm, which quickly
   passed away]; ^a who had given such authority unto men. [Some take the
   word "men" as the plural of category, and apply it to Christ. Others
   think that they regarded Jesus as a mere man among other men, and that
   they therefore looked upon his power as a gift given to men generally,
   and not as something peculiar to himself. If this latter view is
   correct, it is likely that they took the words "Son of man" as
   referring to men generally, and not as a reference to the Messiah, such
   as Jesus meant it to be.] ^b saying, We never saw it on this fashion,
   ^c and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things
   to-day. [Literally, seen paradoxes: things contrary to common thought
   and ordinary experience. They had seen a threefold miracle: sins
   forgiven, thoughts read and palsy healed.]

The Call of Matthew.

(at or Near Capernaum.)

^A Matt. IX. 9; ^B Mark II. 13, 14; ^C Luke V. 27, 28.

   ^c 27 And after these thingsa [after the healing of the paralytic] he
   went forth, ^a again by the seaside [i. e., he left Capernaum, and
   sought the shore of the sea, which formed a convenient auditorium for
   him, and which was hence a favorite scene for his teaching]; and all
   the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 14 And as he ^a
   Jesus passed by from thence, he saw ^c and beheld ^a a man, ^c a
   publican, named { ^c called} Matthew, ^c Levi, ^b the son of Alphaeus
   [It will be observed that Matthew, in his account of his call, does not
   make himself prominent. All the evangelists keep themselves in the
   background. Because Mark and Luke give us the name Levi, it has been
   thought by some that they describe the call of a different person from
   the one mentioned by Matthew--an opinion which seems to have started
   with Origen. But the difference in name is not an important divergence,
   for many in that day had two names; as, for example, Lebbæus, who was
   called Thaddæus; Silas, who was called Sylvanus; John, who was called
   Mark; etc. Moreover, it was then common to change the name; as is shown
   by the cases of Simon, who became Peter; Joseph, who became Barnabas;
   Saul, who became Paul, etc. Therefore, as we have previously suggested
   (p. 111), that Nathanael was also known as Bartholomew, so here we are
   satisfied that Levi is called Matthew; for the narratives which
   describe the calls are almost verbatim, and they agree chronologically,
   being placed by all three Evangelists between the healing of the
   paralytic and the feast where Jesus ate with publicans. Mark involves
   us in another difficulty by calling Levi the son of Alphæus; for a man
   named Alphæus was the father of James the younger (Matt. x. 3 ). It is
   not likely, however, that Matthew and James were brothers, for Alphæus
   was a very common Jewish name, and brothers are usually mentioned in
   pairs in the apostolic lists, and these two are not so mentioned. Pool
   takes the extreme view here, contending that James, Matthew, Thaddæus,
   and Simon Zelotes were four brethren], sitting at the place of toll
   [Wherever it is at all practicable, Orientals sit at their work. The
   place of toil was usually a booth or a small hut. Whether Matthew's
   booth was by the lake, to collect duties on goods and people ferried
   across; or whether it was by the roadside on the great highway leading
   from Damascus to Acco, to collect taxes on all produce brought into
   Capernaum, is not material. The revenues which Rome derived from
   conquered nations consisted of tolls, tithes, harbor duties, taxes for
   use of public pasture lands, and duties for the use of mines and salt
   works], and he saith { ^c said} unto him, Follow me. 28 And he forsook
   all, And he arose { ^c rose up} and followed him. [Such obedience was
   not, of course, performed in ignorance; it indicates that Matthew was
   already a disciple, as were the four fisherman when they also received
   a like call. Matthew was now called to become a personal attendant of
   Jesus, preparatory to being chosen an apostle. Nor are we to conclude
   from the abruptness of his movements that he went off without settling
   accounts with the head of his office. Though it may be more dramatic to
   thus picture him as departing at once, yet the settlement of accounts
   was indispensable to his good name in the future, and in no way
   diminishes the reality and beauty of his sacrifice--a beauty which
   Matthew himself forbears to mention, as became him (Prov. xxvii. 2).
   But Matthew certainly neither delayed nor sought counsel (Gal. i. 15,
   16). By thus calling a publican, Jesus reproved the religious
   narrowness of his times.]

Jesus Heals on the Sabbath Day and Defends His Act.

(at Feast-Time at Jerusalem, Probably the Passover.)

^D John V. 1-47.

   ^d 1 After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went
   up to Jerusalem. [Though every feast in the Jewish calendar has found
   some one to advocate its claim to be this unnamed feast, yet the vast
   majority of commentators choose either the feast of Purim, which came
   in March, or the Passover, which came in April. Older commentators
   pretty unanimously regarded it as the Passover, while the later school
   favor the feast of Purim. John iv. 35 locates Jesus in Samaria in
   December, and John vi. 4 finds him on the shores of Galilee just before
   a Passover. If, then, this was the feast of Purim, the Passover of John
   vi. 4 was the second in Jesus' ministry, and that ministry lasted but
   two years and a fraction. But if the feast here mentioned was a
   Passover, then the one at John vi. 4 would be the third Passover, and
   the ministry of Jesus lasted three years and a fraction. Since, then,
   the length of Jesus' ministry is largely to be determined by what the
   feast was, it becomes important for us to fix the feast, if possible.
   That it was not Purim the following arguments may be urged. 1. Purim
   was not a Mosaic feast, but one established by human laws; hence Jesus
   would not be likely to observe it. True, we find him at the feast of
   Dedication, which was also of human origin, but he did not "go up" to
   attend it; he appears to have attended because he was already in
   Jerusalem (John x. 22). 2. Here the pregnant juxtaposition of "feast"
   and "went up" indicates that Jesus was drawn to Jerusalem by this
   feast, but Purim was celebrated by the Jews everywhere, and did not
   require that any one should go to Jerusalem, as did the three great
   festivals--Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles. 3. It was kept in a
   boisterous, riotous manner, and was therefore not such a feast as Jesus
   would honor. 4. It came early in the year, when the weather was too
   rigorous and inclement for sick people to frequent porticos. 5. It did
   not include a Sabbath Day. 6. As Purim was just a month before the
   Passover, Jesus would hardly have returned to Galilee before the
   Passover (John vi. 4) unless he intended to miss the Passover, which he
   would hardly do for the sake of attending Purim in Jerusalem. Those
   contending that it was not the Passover, present several arguments,
   which we note and answer as follows: 1. Since John gives the name of
   other Passovers, he would have named this also, had it been one. But
   the conclusion is inferential, and not logical; and the answer is to be
   twofold: first, perhaps John did give the name by prefixing the article
   to it, and calling it "the feast," for being the oldest--older than the
   law and the Sabbath--and most important of all feasts, it was rightly
   called by pre-eminence "the feast." Since the Sinaitic manuscript gives
   the article, and calls it "the feast," the manuscript authority for and
   against this reading is pretty evenly balanced. Second, if John did not
   name it, there is probably this reason for his silence. Where he names
   the feast elsewhere it is thought that the incidents narrated take
   color from, or have some references to, the particular festal occasion
   which is named; but here there is no such local color, and failure to
   name the feast prevents mistaken attempts to find such local color. 2.
   Again it is objected that if this is a different Passover from John vi.
   4, then John skips a year in the life of Jesus. He probably does so
   skip, and this is not strange when the supplemental nature of his
   Gospel is considered. In favor of its being the Passover we submit two
   points: 1. Daniel seems to forecast the ministry of the Messiah as
   lasting one-half of a week of years ( Dan. ix. 27). 2. It fits better
   in the chronological arrangement, for in the next scene we find the
   disciples plucking grain, and the Sabbath question is still at full
   heat. But the harvest season opens with the Passover.] 2 Now there is
   [the present tense is used, for while the city was destroyed, the pool
   evidently still existed.] in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which
   is called in Hebrew [i. e., in Aramaic, a dialect of the classic
   Hebrew, in which the Old Testament was written, and the language then
   in use in Palestine] Bethesda, having five porches [It had five covered
   porticos, probably erected for the accommodation of the sick, whence it
   is called Bethesda, i. e., "house of mercy." Dr. Barclay thinks that
   this pool is buried in the rubbish of the Kedron valley. Dr. Robinson
   suggested that it might be the Fountain of the Virgin, which is found
   in a cavern under the east side of Ophel, a little north of midway
   between the southeast corner of the temple wall and the Pool of Siloam.
   Though this pool's claim has been objected to because of its
   inaccessibility--for it lies thirty feet below the surface of the
   valley and forty feet back under the mountain, and is approached by two
   flights of steps numbering in all twenty-six--yet it has three distinct
   features which make its claim exceed those of any other known pool in
   the temple neighborhood: 1. It is fed by an intermittent spring, whose
   ebbing and flowing at intervals of several hours, would cause the
   troubled waters called for in verse 7. 2. It has a superstition
   connected with it kindred to that which crept into the text at verse 4,
   but the Mohammedans have changed the angel into a dragon; when the
   dragon is awake he swallows or stops the water, but when he sleeps the
   water flows! 3. The modern Jerusalem Jews believe in the special
   healing properties of this fountain. "Every day," says Conder, "crowds
   of both sexes go down to the spring, and, entering the dark archway,
   descend the steps, and await the fitful troubling of the waters, which
   rise suddenly and immerse them, fully clothed, nearly up to the neck."
   But Nehemiah's description of the walls seems to locate the sheep gate
   near the middle or northern portion of the temple area, and too far
   north for the Virgin's fountain to be described as near it, unless
   John's sheep gate differs from that of Nehemiah.] 3 In these lay a
   great multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered. [The
   rest of verse 3 and all of verse 4, as given in the King James version,
   were probably added as a marginal explanatory gloss early in the second
   century, and from thence gradually became incorporated in the text.
   John's failure to mention that the pool was thought to have medicinal
   qualities tempted transcribers to add a few marginal words in the
   nature of comments.] 5 And a certain man was there, who had been thirty
   and eight years in his infirmity. [It is not said that he had spent all
   these years beside the pool, nor is it likely that he had. The time is
   given to mark the inveteracy of the disease, and to show the pathos of
   his situation. The facts that he had a bed, and that his healing was
   demonstrated by his walking, argue that his disease was either
   rheumatism, or some form of paralysis.] 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and
   knew [By divine intuition, just as he also knew the lives of Nathanael
   and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well] that he had been now a long
   time in that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole? [By
   this question Jesus aroused the man from the apathy of despair,
   awakening him to hope and effort. Moreover, Jesus only healed as men
   consented to his healing.] 7 The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no
   man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I
   am coming, another steppeth down before me. [The man's lack of healing
   was not due to want of interest, but to want of means. The lower flight
   of ten steps leading to the Virgin's pool is only four and half feet
   wide, and the pool itself is but twenty-one feet and nine inches by
   nine feet in breadth at its widest part. A half-dozen selfish men
   rushing down this narrow passage, and filling the small space in the
   pool, would easily crowd out one who was friendless and more than
   usually helpless.] 8 Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and
   walk. [The bed was the light mattress or pallet of the poor elsewhere
   noted, which could be easily rolled up and carried under the arm.] 9
   And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.
   [Christ spoke, the man obeyed, and by the obedience of faith was made
   whole.] Now it was the sabbath on that day. [There was apparently
   nothing urgent in the sick man's condition which made an immediate cure
   necessary; but Jesus healed because it was the Sabbath, that he might
   thereby draw such an issue between himself and the Jewish rulers as
   would afford opportunity for him to present his divine claims to them
   in the clearest and most forceful manner. He healed on the sabbath,
   that he might assert divine relations to the Sabbath, and by so doing
   bring about a disputation which would enable him to develop before them
   his divine relations to the Father.] 10 So the Jews [That is, the
   Jewish rulers. John frequently uses the term with this restricted
   meaning (John i. 19; vii. 13; ix. 22; xviii. 12, 14). The man was
   officially stopped and questioned] said unto him that was cured, It is
   the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. [They
   would have cited in proof of their assertion Ex. xxxi. 13; Num. xv. 35;
   Jer. xvii. 21-23; Neh. xiii. 19. Alford and Schaff both assert that the
   man broke the Mosaic law; but this position is not well taken. Jesus
   would not have ordered the sabbath to be broken, for he came to fulfill
   and not to break the law. At no time did he break the sabbath or
   countenance its violation, as some able thinkers are erroneously led to
   suppose. In this case a man lying on his bed, away from home, is
   suddenly healed. Under such circumstances Jewish tradition said that he
   must either spend the rest of the day watching his bed, or else he must
   go off and leave it to be stolen. But He who rightfully interpreted the
   law of his own devising, and who knew that "the sabbath was made for
   man, and not man for the sabbath," ordered the healed one to carry his
   bed along home with him. The modern notions that this constituted a
   breach of the Mosaic sabbath doubtless arose from the nature of the
   accompanying justification given by Jesus, which fails to assert that
   the law has not been broken, but seems almost to admit that it has.
   Nothing, however, can be argued against Jesus on this score. A man may
   be able to justify an act in a dozen different ways, and may choose to
   rest content in justifying himself in only one way. Such is the case
   here. Elsewhere we shall find that Jesus was careful to show that his
   sabbatic actions were strictly legal; but in this case, that he might
   bring his divine claims plainly before the rulers, he ignored the
   question as to the human legality of his act that he might present
   without confusion its divine legality. Hence he used only one order or
   method of justification; viz.: an appeal to his divine rights as
   exhibited in the habits of his Father. It was the divine and not the
   human in Jesus which wrought this miracle, so Jesus causes the whole
   controversy to turn on the divine rights, that he may use the occasion
   for an elaborate discussion of his divine claims and the proofs by
   which they are sustained.] 11 But he answered them, He that made me
   whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. [The man very
   naturally shifts the burden of responsibility. If he was violating the
   sabbath, he had been ordered to do it by one who had alone empowered
   him to do it. Of himself he would not and could not have done it.] 12
   They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed,
   and walk? [By using the word "man" they suggest the contrast between
   human authority and divine law. They were more concerned about the law
   than about mercy.] 13 But he that was healed knew not who it was: for
   Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.
   [Jesus, not wishing to unduly excite the multitude by his presence, had
   passed on.] 14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple [possibly he
   was there offering sacrifices in thanksgiving for his recovery, in the
   spirit of Ps. lxvi. 13, 14, but it is as likely that he was there
   merely enjoying the sights and privileges from which he had so long
   been excluded], and siad unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no
   more, lest a worse thing befall thee. [Many human ills are directly
   traceable to sin, and this one appears to have been so; for death is
   the wages of sin, and sickness is partial payment. It is a solemn
   thought that sin can produce worse conditions than even this case,
   where it found its victim in youth, and left him a withered old man,
   bed-ridden, helpless, and friendless.] 15 The man went away, and told
   the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. [There was evidently
   no unworthy motive in his action; for, as Chrysostom observes, he did
   not report it that it was Jesus who made him break the sabbath to
   condemn Jesus; on the contrary, he said it was Jesus who made him
   whole, so honoring Christ. Feeling (as any Jew would have felt) that he
   ought to clear himself before the rulers of his people, the man, no
   doubt, honestly thought that the name and authority of the great
   Prophet of Nazareth would end all question as to the conduct of both
   Healer and healed. If so, he was sadly mistaken.] 16 And for this cause
   the Jews persecuted Jesus [Literally, pursued, or hunted Jesus. This is
   John's first plain declaration of open hostility to Jesus, though he
   has already implied it. From this point the blood red line of
   conspiracy against the life of Jesus runs through this Gospel], because
   he did these things on the sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, My
   Father worketh even until now, and I work. [The dual nature of Jesus
   permitted both a divine and human attitude toward the sabbath. We have
   shown that Jesus chose to assert his divine attitude, for in no other
   matter did these Jews have clearer distinction as to the difference
   between divine and human right than in this matter of sabbath
   observance. If Jesus was a mere man, their ideas of law clearly
   condemned him; but if Jesus were indeed God, their knowledge of divine
   conduct in the whole realm of nature clearly justified him, and the
   miracle asserted his divine control in nature's realm. While God rested
   from creation on the sabbath, nothing can be clearer than that in works
   of sustenance, reproduction, healing and providence, God has never
   rested, and never made distinctions between the days of our week. In
   the light of the gospel we find also that his redemptive work has never
   ceased and, considering the part which Jesus was even then
   accomplishing in this field of labor, his words, "and I work," are full
   of meaning.] 18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to
   kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath [Not only violated, but
   denied its authority over his divine nature], but also called God his
   own Father, making himself equal with God. [They rightly interpreted
   Jesus as asserting relationship to God differing from that sustained by
   others, as expressed in some few passages in the Old Testament, where
   God is spoken of as a Father to the people generally; i. e., their
   Creator. No man could claim such unity of nature as would exempt him
   from the obligation of the fourth commandment. Had they misunderstood
   Jesus in this all-important point, how quickly would he have corrected
   them, for he could not have been less righteous than Paul and
   Barnabas--Acts xiv. 11-15 .] 19 Jesus therefore answered and said unto
   them. [His answer is a connected address, the theme being his own
   character, mission, authority, and credentials as the Son of God. It is
   the Christology of Jesus, and instead of being a retraction of the
   claim to divinity which the Jews accused him of making, it is a
   complete and amplified reassertion of it, so that Luther fitly called
   it "a sublime apology, which makes the matter worse." Jesus first
   declares his relations to the Father (vs. 19-23), which are set forth
   in four divisions, each of which is introduced by the word "for;" viz.:
   1. Unity of action. 2. Unity of love, counsel, and plan. 3. Unity in
   life-impartation. 4. Unity in judgment, resulting in unity of honor.
   This last division formed a turning-point in the discourse. Since there
   is there unity of honor, it is important that men should honor Jesus,
   and also otherwise sustain right relationships to him, and Jesus
   therefore, to enlighten the Jews as to their duty toward him, proceeds
   to set forth his relations to men (vs. 23-30), which he also gives in
   four divisions, closely correlative to his four statements as to the
   Father, thus: 1. Right to receive divine honor from men. 2. Authority
   to execute life and death judgment over men. 3. Power of
   life-impartation as to men, and that both spiritually and literally. 4.
   All Jesus' relationships to man to be sustained and executed according
   to the will and plan or mission of God. But since all these various
   relationships grow out of his divine nature, Jesus next submits the
   credentials which establish his claim to such a nature (vs. 31-39).
   These also are given in four divisions; namely: 1. Testimony of the
   Baptist. 2. Testimony of the Father. 3. Jesus' own works and ministry.
   4. Testimony of Scripture. Or we may regard Jesus as asserting that the
   Father testifies to the Son's divinity in four different ways; that is,
   "God is properly the sole and original testifier, and all others are
   his signatures and seals." The discourse then closes with an
   application of its truth to the Jewish auditors (vs. 40-47). They are
   told that all this truth is lost on them because of their own fourfold
   sinful condition, which is thus stated: 1. Want of will to come to
   Christ. 2. Want of real love toward God, or desire for his honor. 3.
   Love for the honor of men, rather than the honor of God. 4. Want of
   real faith in the Mosaic writings], Verily, verily, I say unto you, The
   Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for
   what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.
   [The Jews regarded Jesus as claiming equality with God in a
   vain-glorious, honor-seeking spirit; but Jesus restates himself, so as
   to show that the claim is really a renunciation or abdication of all
   independent greatness--as having an equality exercised in absolute
   subservience (Isa. xlii. 1; Phil. iii. 6-9). They had accused him as a
   human being acting contrary to the law of the Father. But he declares
   himself to be a divine being, so united to the Father as to have no
   will or action apart from the Father, a condition the resultant of
   which is not weakness and insufficiency, but the strength and
   perfection arising from an absolute and indissoluble union with the
   Father--the glory of divinity. Chrysostom remarks, "Just as when we
   say, it is impossible for God to do wrong, we do not impute to him any
   weakness, but confess in him an unutterable power, so also when Christ
   saith, 'I can of mine own self do nothing,' the meaning is that it is
   impossible--my nature admits not--that I should do anything contrary to
   the Father." Jesus asserts his equality with the Father in such a way
   as not to depreciate the dignity and glory of the Father.] 20 For the
   Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth:
   and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel. [The
   words here indicate that the love of the Father towards the Son was
   source of revelation, and that the revelation was progressive. Love
   constrained the Father to reveal, and love in turn constrained the Son
   to act according to the revelation. Moreover, this unity of love would
   be evidenced by greater works in the future, of which two are
   enumerated; namely, resurrection and judgment, the former being at
   first spiritually and afterwards literally outlined. The Father would
   show these works to the Son by causing him to do them; there would be
   no separate act of the Father so that the works would be twice
   performed. These works would produce faith in those of right spirit.
   But among such hardened hearts as those whom Jesus addressed they would
   only produce wonder and consternation. Those who withheld the tribute
   of faith should pay that of amazement. Putting the statements of verses
   19 and 20 together, we find that the Son knows all that the Father
   does, and likewise does all that the Father does, and in like manner.
   There could be no higher assertion or equality than this; in fact, it
   asserts identity rather than equality. But the equality is not the
   result of conquest, nor was it one of power opposed to power, but is
   freely given and accorded by reason of love.] 21 For as the Father
   raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life
   to whom he will. [Since the verbs in this verse are in the present
   tense, and since Jesus is not known to have raised the physically dead
   before this time, it is rightly taken that he her speaks only of
   raising the spiritually dead, our miserable existence in sin being
   often spoken of in Scripture as a death from which we must be revived
   (Eph. ii. 1, 5; Col. ii. 13; Rev. iii. 1). The use of the word "will"
   likewise indicates a spiritual resurrection, for Christ exercised a
   discrimination in such resurrections; but the final, literal
   resurrection is without discrimination. See the word "all" in verse 28.
   The meaning, therefore, is that as the Father performs physical
   resurrections, so the Son (for the present) performs spiritual
   resurrections (to be followed by physical resurrections). Jesus later
   gave those at Jerusalem a sign of his power to literally raise the dead
   by the resurrection of Lazarus. Resurrection is bestowed or withheld
   according to Jesus' will, but his will is not arbitrarily exercised. He
   visits those who receive him, and revives those who believe him. If the
   Son possessed right of concurrent action on these lofty planes,
   concurrent use of the sabbath was a small matter indeed.] 22 For
   neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment
   unto the Son. [That is to say, the Father does not act in judgment
   without the Son, nor the Son without the Father, for in no work is
   either isolated from the other. Resurrection is nearly always
   associated with judgment, and in this instance it is in reviving that
   the judgment is manifested or executed. (See verse 29 also.) Note that
   judgment begins in this world--John ix. 39]; 23 that all may honor the
   Son, even as they honor the Father. ["Even as" means in the same manner
   and in equal degrees. The prerogative of judgment was committed unto
   Jesus that men might behold his true majesty. If this verse does not
   teach us to worship Jesus as God, language can not teach it, for God
   gives not his glory unto another (Isa. xlii. 8), nor could he, by
   reason of his very nature, arbitrarily will such honor to one whose
   character and nature were unworthy of it. In these words Jesus exposed
   the ruinous attitude assumed by the Jews in seeking to slay him.] He
   that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him. [Honor
   paid to the Father pertains or belongs to his nature and character. But
   the Son is the manifestation of that nature and character (John xiv.
   7-11; Heb. i. 3). Therefore to fail to honor the Son is to fail to
   honor the Father. Experience shows it to be the rule that only those
   who honor Jesus take pains to honor the Father.] 24 Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me,
   hath eternal life. And cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of
   death into life. [Eternal life is a present gift, just as condemnation
   is a present condition (John iii. 18). To "hear" means in this case to
   receive and obey, so that eternal life is conditioned upon a knowledge
   of the revelation of the Father and Son, and a right use of that
   knowledge. Those who have learned of and obey Jesus have already
   escaped or avoided the judgment--Rom. viii. 1.] 25 Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
   voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. [The "hath
   passed" of verse 24 and the "now is" of this verse show that Jesus is,
   thus far, primarily speaking of a present and hence a spiritual
   resurrection, or regeneration. Christianity, or the dispensation of
   regeneration, was to formally begin at Pentecost, but it was already
   present in a preliminary form in the teaching of Jesus, for those who
   hearkened to it were counted as already redeemed. Yet the spiritual
   condition of even the apostles was at that time such that the hour of
   grace is spoken of as more future than present--more "coming" than "at
   hand."] 26 For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to
   the Son also to have life in himself [Not only an independent life,
   such as man does not possess (Acts ii. 27, 28), but a life which is a
   source of life to others. This regenerating power completed Jesus'
   official status as judge, so that wherever he awarded life, he could at
   the same time bestow it]; 27 and he gave him authority to execute
   judgment, because he is a son of man. [We can see several reasons,
   humanly speaking, why the humanity of Jesus should be made a ground for
   committing the judgment of the races of men to him: 1. Jesus having
   experienced our infirmities and temptations, we can feel sure of his
   sympathy (Heb. iv. 15, 16). 2. Jesus, partaking of the nature of both
   God and man, is, because of his unique nature, the only fit daysman or
   umpire between them (Job ix. 33). Possibly we may regard it as a reward
   of humility--Phil. ii. 8, 9.] 28 Marvel not at this [Jesus seems to
   here answer the surprised expression of their faces by enlarging his
   statements]: for the hour cometh, in the which all that are in the
   tombs shall hear his voice, 29 and shall come forth; they that have
   done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil,
   unto the resurrection of judgment. [We have here the future, literal,
   and final resurrection (Dan. xii. 2); a scene of such stupendous
   grandeur as to overshadow all the marvelous in all that Christ shall
   have previously done.] 30 I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I
   judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will,
   but the will of him that sent me. [Jesus here reasserts his dependence
   upon the Father, not as a bare repetition of his relationship to the
   Father, but for the purpose of developing his relationship to men as
   based on or growing out of this relationship to the Father. The Jews,
   as they listened to him, were conscious that he was even then judging
   and passing sentence of condemnation upon them. Jesus does not deny the
   correctness of this view, but shows that, because of his relationship
   or dependence upon the Father, they are getting perfect justice, for:
   1. His judgment was free from all personal bias and selfish
   retaliation, and was, 2. Positively perfect, being wholly inspired by
   the Father's will.] 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not
   true. 32 It is another [i. e., the Father; for similar reference, see
   John viii. 50-54] that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
   witness which he witnesseth of me is true. [These two verses form, as
   noted, a transition in the discourse. In them Jesus passes from
   discussing himself and the divine and human phases of his nature and
   office to take up the evidences which attest him, first asserting that
   the truth of what he has said does not rest solely on his own veracity.
   There is here an indirect reference to that clause of the Jewish law
   which required two witnesses. See John viii. 14-18. But the saying is
   deeply spiritual. Since Jesus did nothing of himself, his very
   testimony was not his own, but was the Father's who sent him, and was
   therefore absolutely true in the consciousness of Jesus. If Jesus had
   testified independently of the Father--had it been possible--it would
   have been in the nature of the case contrary to that consensus of the
   divine will which forms the truth.] 33 Ye have sent unto John [this
   shows that Jesus was addressing the rulers--John i. 19 ], and he hath
   borne witness unto the truth. [John had witnessed the truth concerning
   the Messiahship of Jesus. Some think that the pronoun "another" in
   verse 32 refers to John also, but by the present tense "witnesseth" of
   that verse, and the past tense "hath borne witness" of this verse, the
   ever-abiding testimony of the Father is contrasted with the finished
   testimony of John, who is now silenced by imprisonment.] 34 But the
   witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things,
   that ye may be saved. [In the light of John i. 6, 7, it sounds strange
   to hear Jesus thus renounce the testimony of the Baptist. But the
   phrase, "is not from man," is the Hebrew negative, meaning not from man
   alone. Jesus therefore meant to accept it, as he in the next breath did
   that of Moses, as prophetic--as the testimony of the Father spoken
   through a human medium; but meant to reject it as a merely human
   testimony, such as it was in the view of these Jews who denied in their
   hearts that John was a prophet. This mission of Jesus was not to be
   proved by uninspired testimony, for uninspired man can not testify of
   God from lack of full and adequate knowledge (Matt. xi. 27; xvi. 17).
   And yet if the Jews were willing to accept such testimony, Jesus in
   kindness would permit it, that by any fair means they might believe and
   be saved.] 35 He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were
   willing to rejoice for a season in his light. [They were willing, like
   children, to play in John's light without stopping to seriously
   consider its meaning, but when he bore testimony to Christ they
   blasphemed him--Luke vii. 33.] 36 But the witness which I have is
   greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me
   to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
   Father hath sent me. [By "greater witness" Jesus means testimony which
   is more convincing. All divine testimony is of equal veracity, but some
   it is more obviously convincing. The less the testimony savors of
   humanity, and the more purely divine it appears, the more convincing it
   is (I. John v. 9). The term "works" is not to be confined to miracles,
   for the word "accomplish" indicates a wider meaning. The entire
   Messianic mission or redemptive work which ended with our Lord's words,
   "It is finished" (John xvii. 4; xix. 30), and which is indicated in
   this very discourse in verse 20, and outlined by referring to spiritual
   judgment and regeneration, should be included. Christ's transforming
   grace still witnesses to Jew and Gentile that the Father sent him, for
   it it manifests the love of God (John iii. 16 ). The Father did not
   send the Son to merely work miracles, but to redeem the world.] 37 And
   the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither
   heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. 38 And ye have not his
   word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. [The
   testimony of the Father was given in three forms: 1. By direct or
   audible voice and the visible sending of the Spirit--as at Jesus'
   baptism. 2. By revelations, through the medium of prophets and angels
   gathered and preserved in the Old Testament Scriptures. 3. Through the
   Son and his works. Jesus here asserts that all testimony of the first
   kind had failed to reach the Jewish rulers; that the testimony of the
   second kind has been utterly lost upon them, for they failed to see its
   accordance with the testimony of the third kind which he was even then
   exhibiting to them, neither had it taught them to expect a personal
   Saviour.] 39 Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye
   have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me; 40 and
   ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. ["Hillel used to say,
   More law, more life. . . . He who has gotten himself words of law has
   gotten himself the life of the world to come" (Talmud). In their zeal
   for the Scriptures the Jews had counted every letter of them, expecting
   to find life in the laws and precepts, but failed to find Him of whom
   the Scriptures spoke in figure, type and prophecy. In their reverence
   for the Book they failed to see that it was a mere means intended to
   acquaint them with him through whom life was to come. Hence, as Canon
   Cook suggests, there is deep pathos in the co-ordination "and--and."
   The verses give us three points worthy of deepest reflection: 1.
   Protestantism may love the Book and show a martyr's loyalty to it, and
   yet fail utterly to render any acceptable love or loyalty toward the
   Being revealed in the Book. 2. Criticism, both higher and lower, may
   submit every text to microscopic investigation, and yet be as blind as
   the ancient Pharisees to its true meaning. It is profoundly true that
   the things of the Spirit are spiritually discerned (I. Cor. ii. 14),
   and that pride of literary culture, and the self-worship of
   intellectualism tend to spiritual blindness. It seems to come upon such
   a visitation from God, as in the case of Elymas ( Matt. xi. 25; xv. 14;
   Luke viii. 10; Eph. iv. 17, 18; Isa. v. 21). 3. Though free will is
   meant to be man's crowning glory, yet it may result in his shame and
   ruin.] 41 I receive not glory from men. [Jesus here shows that his
   rebuke of their disbelief does not spring from personal pique or
   disappointed ambition. He came seeking faith that he might save, not
   honor that he might be glorified, and honor paid to him is by him
   transferred to God (Phil. ii. 10, 11), just as honor paid to the true
   Christian is transferred to Christ.] 42 But I know you, that ye have
   not the love of God in yourselves. [He speaks as the Searcher of hearts
   (John i. 47-50; ii. 24, 25). Knowing them absolutely, he found them to
   be self-worshipers, devoid of that love Godward which begets belief,
   and lacking in their natures that which would enable them to understand
   him and his spirit, no matter what evidence was submitted to them.] 43
   I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall
   come in his own name, him ye will receive. [Some think that this is
   spoken primarily of a pre-eminently great antichrist who is yet to come
   and deceive many of the Jews, and who, as Stier thinks, shall be such
   an incarnation of Satan as Jesus was of God (Rev. xiii. 1-9). But they
   have already received many false christs with joy. According to Schudt,
   as quoted by Bengel, there have been sixty-four antichrists who have
   misled the Jews. Among them Bar Cocheba led 24,000 to ruin, including
   Akiba, the President of the Sanhedrim. False christs come in their own
   name--for their own honor--and make no war on bosom sins, but upon
   earthly enemies; but Jesus came not to manifest himself, but his
   Father.] 44 How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and
   the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not? [The question was
   as to their believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Expecting one who would
   bring great honor to themselves by his triumphs over his foes, and
   seeing nothing of this kind to be expected from Jesus, they could not
   believe him to be the Messiah.] 45 Think not that I will accuse you to
   the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have
   set your hope. [Jesus here assumes that the Jews gave enough credence
   to his words to fear that he might hereafter appear as their accuser.
   But Jesus designs to appear rather as Advocate than as Prosecutor (I.
   John ii. 1). It was their fault that he was not their Advocate.] 46 For
   if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. 47 But
   if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? [In
   these verses Jesus explicitly endorses the Mosaic authorship and
   authenticity of the Pentateuch, and sets forth one purpose for which
   Moses wrote it. Jesus was the essential subject of the law and prophets
   (Luke xxiv. 27, 44-46 Rom. xvi. 25, 26). The emphasis is on "his
   writings" and "my words." They professed to reverence Moses and to
   receive his writings, while they openly despised Jesus and repudiated
   his words as fast as he spoke them. The phrase "wrote concerning me" is
   not to be restricted to Deut. xviii. 15-18. Moses wrote symbolically of
   Jesus through his entire work, as Bengel tersely puts it, "Everywhere!"
   The Epistle to the Hebrews is a partial elaboration of the Christology
   of Moses. But there is doubtless a depth of meaning in the Pentateuch
   which has never yet been fully fathomed, for there is a fullness in
   Scripture greatly exceeding the popular conception. Moreover, the Old
   and New Testaments are so linked together that to reject one is
   eventually to reject the other, or to read it with veiled eyes-- II.
   Cor. iii. 15.]

XXXVIII.

Jesus Defends Disciples Who Pluck Grain on the Sabbath.

(Probably While on the Way from Jerusalem to Galilee.)

^A Matt. XII. 1-8; ^B Mark II. 23-28; ^C Luke VI. 1-5.

   ^b 23 And ^c 1 Now it came to pass ^a 1 At that season ^b that he ^a
   Jesus went { ^b was going} on the { ^c a} ^b sabbath day through the
   grainfields; ^a and his disciples were hungry and began ^b as they
   went, to pluck the ears. ^a and to eat, ^c and his disciples plucked
   the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. [This lesson fits
   in chronological order with the last, if the Bethesda events took place
   at Passover. The paschal lamb was eaten on the fourteenth Nisan, or
   about the first of April. Clark fixes the exact date as the 29th of
   March, in a.d. 28, which is the beginning of the harvest season. Barley
   ripens in the Jordan valley about the 1st of April, but on the uplands
   it is reaped as late as May. Wheat ripens from one to three weeks later
   than barley, and upland wheat (and Palestine has many mountain
   plateaus) is often harvested in June. If Scaliger is right, as most
   critics think he is, in fixing this sabbath as the first after the
   Passover, it is probable that it was barley which the disciples ate.
   Barley bread was and is a common food, and it is common to chew the
   grains of both it and wheat.] ^c 2 But { ^b 24 And} ^c certain of the
   Pharisees ^a when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do
   that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath. ^b why do they on the
   sabbath day that which is not lawful? ^c Why do ye that which it is not
   lawful to do on the sabbath day? [The Pharisees did not object to the
   act of taking the grain. Such plucking of the grain was allowed by the
   law (Deut. xxiii. 25) and is still practiced by hungry travelers in
   Palestine, which is, and has always been, an unfenced land, the roads,
   or rather narrow paths, of which lead through the grainfields, so that
   the grain is in easy reach of the passer-by. The Pharisees objected to
   the plucking of grain because they considered it a kind of reaping, and
   therefore working on the sabbath day. The scene shows the sinlessness
   of Jesus in strong light. Every slightest act of his was submitted to a
   microscopic scrutiny.] ^a 3 But { ^b 25 And} ^c Jesus answering them ^a
   said unto them, Have ye not read { ^b Did ye never read} ^c even this
   [There is a touch of irony here. The Pharisees prided themselves upon
   their knowledge of Scriptures, but they had not read (so as to
   understand them) even its most common incidents], what David did, ^b
   when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him? 26
   How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, ^c
   and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with
   him; which it is not lawful to eat { ^a which it was not lawful for him
   to eat,} neither for them that were with him, but only { ^c save} for
   the priests alone? [Jesus here refers to the incident recorded at I.
   Sam. xxi. 1-6. Ahimelech and Abiathar have been confused by
   transcribers. It should read Ahimelech. However, we are not referred to
   the actions of Abiathar, but to those of David. He went with his
   followers to the tabernacle at Nob near Jerusalem, and being hungry,
   asked bread of the priests. There was no bread at hand save the
   showbread. This bread was called showbread because it was "set out" or
   "exhibited" before Jehovah. It consisted of twelve loaves, which were
   baked upon the sabbath, and were placed, hot, in two rows upon the
   showbread table every sabbath day. The twelve old loaves which were
   then removed were to be eaten by the priests and no one else (Lev.
   xxiv. 5-9). It was these twelve old loaves which were given to David
   (I. Sam. xxi. 6). Since the showbread was baked on the sabbath, the law
   itself ordered work on that day. The vast majority of commentators look
   upon this passage as teaching that necessity abrogates what they are
   pleased to call the ceremonial laws of God. Disregarding the so-called
   ceremonial laws of God is a very dangerous business, as is witnessed by
   the case of Uzzah (II. Sam. vi. 6, 7), and Uzziah (II. Chron. xxvi.
   16-23). Christ never did it, and strenuously warned those who followed
   the example of the scribes and Pharisees in teaching such a doctrine
   (Matt. v. 17-20 ). The law of necessity was not urged by him as a
   justifiable excuse for making bread during the forty days' fast of the
   temptation. Life is not higher than law. "All that a man hath will he
   give for his life," is Satan's doctrine, not Christ's (Job ii. 4). The
   real meaning, as we understand it, will be developed below in our
   treatment of verse 7, which verse refers both to this incident and to
   the discussion in progress.] ^a 5 Or have ye not read in the law, that
   on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane [i. e., degrade
   and put to common use] the sabbath, and are guiltless? [Having cited a
   passage from the prophets, Jesus now turns to the law--the final
   authority. He also turns from a parallel argument concerning sacred
   food to a direct argument concerning the sacred day. The Sabbath was
   the busiest day in the week for the priests. They baked and changed the
   showbread; they performed sabbatical sacrifices (Num. xxviii. 9), and
   two lambs were killed on the sabbath in addition to the daily
   sacrifice. This involved the killing, skinning, and cleaning of the
   animals, and the building of the fire to consume the sacrifice. They
   also trimmed the gold lamps, burned incense, and performed various
   other duties. The profanation of the Sabbath, however, was not real,
   but merely apparent. Jesus cites this priestly work to prove that the
   Sabbath prohibition was not universal, and hence might not include what
   the disciples had done. The fourth commandment did not forbid work
   absolutely, but labor for worldly gain. Activity in the work of God was
   both allowed and commanded.] 6 But I say [asserting his own authority]
   unto you, that one greater than the temple is here. [The word "greater"
   is in the neuter gender, and the literal meaning is therefore "a
   greater thing than the temple." The contrast may be between the service
   of the temple and the service of Christ, or it may be a contrast
   between the divinity, sacredness, or divine atmosphere which hallowed
   the temple, and the divinity or Godhead of Christ. But, however we take
   it, the meaning is ultimately a contrast between Christ and the temple,
   similar to the contrast between himself and Solomon, etc. (Matt. xii.
   41, 42). It was a startling saying as it fell on Jewish ears, for to
   them the temple at Jerusalem was the place honored by the very Shekinah
   of the unseen God, and the only place of effective worship and
   atonement. If the temple service justified the priests in working upon
   the Sabbath day, much more did the service of Jesus, who was not only
   the God of the temple, but was himself the true temple, of which the
   other was merely the symbol, justify these disciples in doing that
   which was not legally, but merely traditionally, unlawful. Jesus here
   indirectly anticipates the priesthood of his disciples--I. Pet. ii. 5.]
   7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not
   sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. [This passage is
   quoted from Hos. vi. 6, and is reiterated at Matt. ix. 13. It is an
   assertion of the superiority of inward life over outward form, for the
   form is nothing if the heart is wrong. The saying is first suggested by
   David himself (Ps. li. 16, 17), after which it is stated by Hosea and
   amplified by Paul (I. Cor. xiii. 3). The quotation has a double
   reference both to David and the disciples as above indicated. Having
   given the incident in the life of David, Jesus passes on from it
   without comment, that he may lay down by another example the principle
   which justified it. This principle we have just treated, and we may
   state it thus: A higher law, where it conflicts with a lower one,
   suspends or limits the lower one at the point of conflict. Thus the
   higher laws of worship in the temple suspended the lower law of sabbath
   observance, and thus also the higher law of mercy suspended the lower
   law as to the showbread when David took it and mercifully gave it to
   his hungry followers, and when God in mercy permitted this to be done.
   And thus, had they done what was otherwise unlawful, the disciples
   would have been justified in eating by the higher law of Christ's
   service. And thus also would Christ have been justified in permitting
   them to eat by the law of mercy, which was superior to that which
   rendered the seventh day to God as a sacrifice.] 8 For the Son of man
   is Lord of the sabbath. ^b 27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was
   made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 28 so that the Son of man is
   Lord even of the sabbath. [The expression "Son of man" is used
   eighty-eight times in the New Testament, and always means the Messiah,
   and not man generally. The Sabbath was made for man's convenience and
   blessing, and so Jesus, who was complete and perfect manhood, was Lord
   of it. But men who were incomplete and imperfect in their manhood, can
   not trust their fallible judgment to tamper with it. Though the day was
   made for man, this fact would not entitle man to use it contrary to the
   laws under which it was granted. As Lord of the day Jesus had a right
   to interpret it and to apply it, and to substitute the Lord's day for
   it. In asserting his Lordship over it, Jesus takes the question outside
   the range of argument and brings it within the range of authority.]

XXXIX.

Jesus Defends Healing a Withered Hand on the Sabbath.

(Probably Galilee.)

^A Matt. XII. 9-14; ^B Mark III. 1-6; ^C Luke VI. 6-11.

   ^a 9 And he departed thence. [The word here points to a journey as in
   Matt. xi. 1 and xv. 29, which are the only places where Matthew uses
   this expression. Greswell may be right in thinking that it indicates
   the return back to Galilee from the Passover, since a cognate
   expression used by John expresses such a journey from Galilee to Judæa.
   See John vii. 3 ], ^c 6 And it came to pass on another sabbath [another
   sabbath than that on which the disciples plucked the grain], that he
   entered ^b again ^a and went into their { ^c the} synagogue and taught
   [The use of the pronoun "their" indicates that the synagogue in
   question was under the control of the same Pharisee who had caviled
   about plucking grain on the Sabbath. Where the synagogue was is not
   known. Some argue that from the presence of Herodians it was at
   Sepphoris, which was then capital of Herod Antipas. But Herodians were
   likely to be found everywhere.]: ^a 10 and behold, ^b there was a man
   who had { ^a having} a { ^b his} hand withered. ^c and his right hand
   was withered. [The hand had dried up from insufficient absorption of
   nutriment, until its power was gone, and there was no remedy known by
   which it could be restored.] ^b 2 And they ^c the scribes and the
   Pharisees watched him, ^b whether he would heal him on the sabbath day;
   ^c that they might find how to accuse him. [They sought to accuse him
   before the local judges or officers of the synagogue; i. e., before a
   body of which they themselves were members. Jesus gave them abundant
   opportunity for such accusation, for we have seven recorded instances
   of cures on the sabbath day; viz.: Mark i. 21 and 29; John v. 9; ix.
   14; Luke xiii. 14; xiv. 2, and this case.] ^a And they asked him,
   saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? [They were afraid that
   Jesus might not notice the man, so they spoke about him. But, taught by
   their experience in the grainfield, they changed their bold assertion,
   "It is not lawful," and approached the subject with a guarded question,
   hoping to get an answer that could be used as a ground for accusation.]
   ^c 8 But he knew their thoughts [omnisciently]; and he said to { ^b
   saith unto} the man that had his hand withered, ^c Rise up, and stand
   forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. [Jesus thus placed
   the man openly before all the people, as though he stood on trial as to
   his right to be healed on the sabbath day.] ^a 11 And he said unto
   them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if
   it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and
   lift it out? 12 How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! [A
   man who had but one sheep would set a high value upon it. But the most
   valuable sheep is not to be weighed in the balance against a man. The
   fact that Jesus used this illustration shows clearly that such an
   action was allowed at that time, though the rabbins forbade it
   afterward.] Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day. ^c 9
   And Jesus aid { ^b saith} unto them, ^c I ask you, Is it lawful on the
   sabbath ^b day to do good, or to do harm? to save life, or to kill? {
   ^c destroy it?} [The rules of the Pharisees made the Sabbath question
   wholly a matter of doing or of not doing. But Jesus made it a question
   of doing good, and his question implies that a failure to do good, when
   one is able, is harmful and sinful. "The ability," says Cotton Mather,
   "to do good imposes an obligation to do it." To refrain from healing in
   such an instance would have been to abstain from using a power given
   him for that very purpose. The Jews held it lawful to defend themselves
   on the Sabbath, and considered themselves justified in killing their
   enemies if they attacked on that day (I Macc. ii. 41; Josephus Ant.
   XII. vi. 2]. ^b But they held their peace. [afraid to say that Jesus
   was wrong and stubbornly unwilling to admit that he was right.] 5 And
   when he had looked round about on them ^c all, ^b with anger, being
   grieved at the hardening of their heart [The anger of Jesus was not a
   spiteful, revengeful passion, but a just indignation (Eph. iv. 26). God
   may love the sinner, but he is angry at sin. Anger is not sin, but it
   is apt to run into it: hence it is a dangerous passion. Righteous anger
   rises from the love of God and man, but that which rises from self-love
   is sinful], he saith { ^c said} ^a 13 Then ^c unto him, ^b the man,
   Stretch forth thy hand. ^c And he did so: ^a he stretched it forth; and
   it ^b his hand was restored. ^a whole, as the other. [As Jesus here
   healed without any word or action of healing, merely ordering the man
   to stretch forth his hand, the Pharisees could find no legal ground for
   accusation. God can not be tried by man, because his ways are hidden
   from the senses of man save as he chooses to reveal them.] ^c 11 But
   they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they
   might do to Jesus. ^b 6 And the Pharisees went out, and straightway
   with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy
   him. [Here the three Synoptists first tell of the counsel to put Jesus
   to death, and we should note that, like John, they described the anger
   of the Jewish rulers as arising because of this Sabbath question. Their
   real motive was envious hatred, but their pretext was a zeal for the
   law. That it was not genuine zeal for the law is shown by the fact that
   they consulted with the Herodians or the adherents of Herod Antipas, as
   they also did afterwards (Matt. xxii. 16; Mark xii. 13). They needed
   the secular power of the Herodians to secure the death of Jesus. Its
   efficiency for such ends had just been shown in the imprisonment of
   John the Baptist. But the Herodians were no friends of the Jewish law;
   in fact, they were real perverters of that law which Jesus merely
   correctly interpreted. This party and its predecessors had flatteringly
   tried to make a Messiah of Herod the Great, and had been friends of
   Rome and patrons of Gentile influence. They favored the erection of
   temples for idolatrous ends, and pagan theaters and games, and Gentile
   customs generally. Unlike Jesus, the Pharisees grew angry and sinned,
   for it was against their conscience to consort with the Herodians.]

XL.

Jesus Heals Multitudes Beside the Sea of Galilee.

^A Matt. XII. 15-21; ^B Mark III. 7-12.

   ^a 15 And Jesus perceiving it withdrew ^b with his disciples ^a from
   thence: ^b to the sea [This was the first withdrawal of Jesus for the
   avowed purpose of self-preservation. After this we find Jesus
   constantly retiring to avoid the plots of his enemies. The Sea of
   Galilee, with its boats and its shores touching different
   jurisdictions, formed a convenient and fairly safe retreat]: ^a and
   many followed him; ^b and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and
   from Judæa, 8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the
   Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great
   things he did, came unto him. [Idumæa was the land formerly inhabited
   by the Edomites. It is a Greek word from "Edom," which was another word
   for Esau (Gen. xxv. 30), and means red. This land was originally the
   narrow strip reaching from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea, lying between
   the Arabah on the west, and the desert on the east, being about one
   hundred miles long and fifteen or twenty broad. During the Babylonian
   captivity, however, the Edomites took possession of the southern
   portion of Judæa, and Strabo says that they encroached as far as to the
   city of Hebron. They were conquered by John Hyrcanus, one of the
   Asmonæan princes about 120 b.c., and were by him made subservient to
   the law and incorporated with the Jewish people. As before noted, Herod
   the Great sprang from this people. Tyre and Sidon were Phoenician
   cities on the Mediterranean seacoast, westward from the Lake of
   Galilee.] ^a and he healed them all, 16 and charged them that they
   should not make him known: 17 that it might be fulfilled which was
   spoken through Isaiah the prophet [Isa. xlii. 1-4. Partly taken from
   the LXX and part an original translation], saying, 18 Behold, my
   servant whom I have chosen; My beloved, in whom my soul is well
   pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment
   to the Gentiles. [The word translated "servant," means also son, but it
   is rightly translated "servant" here, for the Father uses another word
   when he would designate Jesus as specifically his Son ( Matt. iii. 17;
   xvii. 5). Jesus was a servant in form (Phil. ii. 7), and in obedience
   (Heb. x. 9). The word "judgment," as used in the Old Testament, from
   which it is here translated, means rule, doctrine, truth. It is usually
   here understood as meaning that Jesus would reveal the gospel or the
   full truth of the new dispensation to the Gentiles.] 19 He shall not
   strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the
   streets. 20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall
   he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory. [These two
   verses find their fulfillment in the events of this paragraph. Jesus
   did not strive nor quarrel with the Pharisees, but having victoriously
   put them to silence, he meekly and quietly withdrew from their
   presence, and the healing of the multitudes which followed him as aptly
   fulfilled the prediction about the reed and the flax, for these two
   words, symbolic of weakness (Isa. xxxvi. 6) and patience-trying
   annoyance (Prov. x. 26), fitly represented the sick and lame and
   blind--sinners who, by affliction, had been made contrite and poor in
   spirit, remorseful and repentant, and who were brought to Jesus to be
   healed. If the hollow cylinder of the reed is bruised, its strength is
   gone, and it is no longer able to stand erect. Flax was then used where
   we now use cotton, as wicking for lamps. Imperfection in the fiber of
   it would cause it to smoke. A violent man, irritated by the fumes of
   the smoking wick, would put it out, and cast it from him. But the
   Lord's servant would patiently fan it to flames. The statement that he
   would not break these bruised reeds, nor quench this smoking flax, was
   an emphatic declaration, by contrast, that he would heal their bruises
   and fan their dying energies and resolutions into a flame, until he
   sent forth judgment unto victory; i. e., until the gospel--the
   authoritative announcement of the divine purpose or will--shall be sent
   forth and advanced to its final triumph. Christ shall show patient
   mercy and forbearance until the gospel shall practically exclude the
   need of it, by triumphing over Jewish opposition and Gentile impiety so
   as to bring about universal righteousness.] 21 And in his name shall
   the Gentiles hope. [This verse sets forth the breadth of Christ's
   conquest over all nations. It reaches beyond our times into a future
   which is yet to be. But it was partially fulfilled by the presence of
   Idumæans and citizens of Tyre and Sidon in the multitudes which Jesus
   healed--unless we say that only Jews from these quarters are meant,
   which is not likely.] ^b 9 And he spake to his disciples, that a little
   boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng
   him: 10 for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as plagues
   pressed upon him that they might touch him. [Literally, they "fell upon
   him;" such was their eagerness to be healed by touching him.] 11 And
   unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and
   cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 12 And he charged them much
   that they should not make him known. [Because this was not the right
   time, nor were they the right witnesses to make him known.]

XLI.

After Prayer Jesus Selects Twelve Apostles.

(Near Capernaum.)

^A Matt. X. 2-4; ^B Mark III. 13-19; ^C Luke VI. 12-16.

   ^c 12 And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the
   mountain ^b 13 And he goeth up into the mountain, ^c to pray; and he
   continued all night in prayer to God. [It was a momentous occasion. He
   was about to choose those to whom he was to entrust the planting,
   organizing, and training of that church which was to be the purchase of
   his own blood. Jesus used such important crises, not as occasions for
   anxiety and worry, but as fitting times to seek and obtain the Father's
   grace and blessing.] 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples:
   ^b and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.
   ^c and he chose from them twelve [We can not think that the number
   twelve was adopted carelessly. It unquestionably had reference to the
   twelve tribes of Israel, over whom the apostles were to be tribal
   judges or viceroys (Luke xxii. 30), and we find the tribes and apostles
   associated together in the structure of the New Jerusalem (Rev. xxi.
   12-14). Moreover, Paul seems to regard the twelve as ministers to the
   twelve tribes, or to the circumcision, rather than as ministers to the
   Gentiles or the world in general (Gal. ii. 7-9). See also Jas. i. 1; I.
   Pet. i. 1. The tribal reference was doubtless preserved to indicate
   that the church would be God's new Israel] , ^b 14 And he appointed
   twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth
   to preach, 15 and to have authority to cast out demons: ^c whom also he
   named apostles [The word apostle means "one sent." Its meaning was
   kindred to the word ambassador ( II. Cor. v. 20), the messenger whom a
   king sent to foreign powers, and also to our modern word missionary,
   which also means "one sent." Christ himself was an apostle (Heb. iii.
   1), and so sent them (John xx. 21). The word apostle is translated
   "messenger" at II. Cor. viii. 23 and Phil. ii. 25. The apostles were to
   be with Jesus, that they might be taught by his words, and that they
   might become teachers of that word and witnesses as to the life and
   actions of Jesus. A necessary condition, therefore, to their
   apostleship was this seeing of Jesus and the consequent ability to
   testify as to his actions, especially as to his resurrection (Acts i.
   8, 21; I. Cor. ix. 1; xxii. 14, 15). They could therefore have no
   successors. All the apostles were from Galilee save Judas Iscariot]: ^a
   2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these [4] [Mark and Luke
   give the names of the apostles at the time when they were chosen, but
   Matthew gives them at the time when they were sent out]: The first,
   Simon, who is called Peter, ^c whom he also named { ^b surnamed} Peter
   [For the surnaming of Simon, see John i. 41, 42. Peter, by reason of
   his early prominence, is named first in the four lists. His natural
   gifts gave him a personal but not an ecclesiastical pre-eminence over
   his fellows. As a reward for his being first to confess Christ, he was
   honored by being permitted to first use the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven; i. e., to preach the first gospel sermon both to the Jews and
   Gentiles. But after these two sermons the right of preaching to the
   Jews and Gentiles became common to all alike. That Peter had supremacy
   or authority over his brethren is nowhere stated by Christ, or claimed
   by Peter, or owned by the rest of the twelve. On the contrary, the
   statement of Jesus places the apostles upon a level (Matt. xxiii.
   8-11). See also Matt. xviii. 18; xix. 27, 28; xx. 25-27; John xx. 21;
   Acts i. 8. And Peter himself claims no more than an equal position with
   other officers in the church (I. Pet. v. 1, 4), and the apostles in the
   subsequent history of the church acted with perfect independence. Paul
   withstood Peter to his face and (if we may judge by the order of naming
   which is made so much of in the apostolic lists), he ranks Peter as
   second in importance to James, the Lord's brother (Gal. ii. 11-14, 9).
   See also Acts xii. 17; xxi. 18. Again, James, in summing up the decree
   which was to be sent to the church at Antioch, gave no precedence to
   Peter, who was then present, but said, "Brethren, hearken unto me . . .
   my judgment is"--words which would be invaluable to those who advocate
   the supremacy of Peter, if only it had been Peter who spoke them. So
   much for the supremacy of Peter, which, even if it could be
   established, would still leave the papacy without a good title to its
   honors, for it would still have to prove that it was heir to the rights
   and honors of Peter, which is something it has never yet done. The
   papal claim rests not upon facts, but upon a threefold assumption: 1.
   That Peter had supreme authority. 2. That he was the first bishop of
   Rome. 3. That the peculiar powers and privileges of Peter (if he had
   any) passed at the time of his death from his own person, to which they
   belonged, to the chair or office which he vacated]; ^a and Andrew his
   brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; { ^b the
   brother of James;} and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of
   thunder [This selection of brothers suggests that the bonds of nature
   may strengthen those of grace. Why James and John were called sons of
   thunder is not stated, but it was probably because of their stormy and
   destructive temper (Luke ix. 51-56; Mark ix. 38). The vigor of the two
   brothers is apparent, for it marked James as a fit object for Herod's
   spleen (Acts xii. 2), and it sustained John to extreme old age, for
   Epiphanius says that he died at Ephesus at the age of ninety-four, but
   Jerome places his age at a hundred. No change is noted in the nature of
   James during the brief time which he survived his Lord. But the
   gracious and loving character of the aged John showed the transforming
   power of the Holy Spirit. But even to the last this son of thunder
   muttered in portentous strains against Diotrephes (III. John 9, 10),
   and his denunciations of sins and sinners is very forceful, including
   such epithets as "liar," "antichrist," "deceiver," "children of the
   devil" (I. John i. 6; ii. 4, 22; iii. 15; II. John 3-11). It is also
   worthy of note that except in this verse in Mark, which applies the
   name "Son of thunder" to John, neither the word "thunder," nor any of
   its derivatives is found anywhere in the New Testament save in the
   writings of John, by whom it and its derivatives are used eleven times,
   a fact which causes Bengel to remark, "A son of thunder is a fit person
   for hearing voices of thunder."] ^a 3 Philip, and Bartholomew [as noted
   on page 111, Bartholomew is usually identified with the man whom John
   calls Nathanael, in which case his full name would be Nathanael Bar
   Tolmai]; Thomas, and Matthew the publican [Thomas is also called
   Didymus, the first being the Aramaic and the second the Greek word for
   twin. Matthew calls himself the publican. None of the others apply that
   term of reproach to him. Matthew doubtless assumes it in remembrance of
   the riches of Christ's grace toward loving him while he was yet a
   sinner. Exposing the sin of his own past life, he is silent as to the
   past lives of the others, not even noting that the first four were
   humble "fishermen"]; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; { ^c
   Judas the son of James,} [Matthew's father was also named Alphæus, but
   it was another Alphæus. This was a very common name. In its Hebrew form
   it may be pronounced Alphi or Clephi. In its Arimæan form it is
   Chalphai. So in the New Testament we sometimes find it Alphæus, and
   again Cleopas, or Clopas. The apostle James is thought by some to be
   our Lord's brother, and by others to be his cousin; but he is probably
   neither. [5] This apostle was also called James the Less (Mark xv. 40);
   probably because he was younger than the son of Zebedee. He must not be
   confounded with James the Lord's brother, who, though called an apostle
   by Paul, was not one of the twelve apostles (nor was Barnabas--Acts
   xiv. 14). James the Lord's brother is mentioned at Matt. xiii. 55; I.
   Cor. xv. 5-7; Gal. i. 19; ii. 9, 12; Acts xv. 6-9 and xxi. 18. He wrote
   the epistle which bears his name, and his brother Jude (who also must
   not be confounded with Judas Thaddæus, the apostle) wrote the epistle
   which bears his name. We do not know the James who was the father of
   Judas, and of Judas himself we know very little. He seems to have been
   known at first by his name Thaddæus, possibly to distinguish him from
   Iscariot, but later (for Luke and John wrote later than Matthew and
   Mark) by the name Judas--John xiv. 22.] ^a 4 Simon the Cananaean, ^c
   who was called the Zealot [Cananæan means the same as zealot. It comes
   from the Hebrew word kana, which means zealous. The Zealots were a sect
   or order of men much like our modern "Regulators," or "Black Caps."
   They were zealous for the Jewish law, and citing Phinehas (Num. xxv. 7,
   8) and Elijah (I. Kings xviii. 40) as their examples, they took justice
   in their own hands and punished offenders much after the manner
   lynchers. It is thought that they derived their name from the dying
   charge of the Asmonæan Mattathias when he said, "Be ye zealous for the
   law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers" (I. Macc.
   ii. 50). Whatever they were at first, it is certain that their later
   course was marked by frightful excesses, and they are charged with
   having been the human instrument which brought about the destruction of
   Jerusalem. See Josephus, Wars, IV., iii. 9, v. 1-4; vi. 3; VII., viii.
   1. Simon is the least known of all the apostles, being nowhere
   individually mentioned outside the catalogues], ^a and Judas Iscariot,
   ^c who became a traitor; ^a who also betrayed him. [Judas is named last
   in all the three lists, and the same note of infamy attaches to him in
   each case. He is omitted from the list in Acts, for he was then dead.
   As he was treasurer of the apostolic group, he was probably chosen for
   office because of his executive ability. He was called Iscariot from
   his native city Kerioth, which pertained to Judah--Josh. xv. 25.]

   [4] {*} NOTE.--To avoid making the text too complex and confusing, we
   have followed the order in which Matthew gives the names of the twelve.
   The names of the apostles are recorded four times in the following
   different arrangements and orders. Some think that Matthew divides them
   into groups of two, so that he may show us who went together when Jesus
   sent them out in pairs (Mark vi. 7). But it is idle to speculate as to
   the differences in arrangement. We note, however, that the twelve are
   divided into three quaternions, or groups of four, and that each has a
   fixed leader. TABLE OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.

   also betrayed him. and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

   [5] {*} NOTE.--To aid the reader, we submit the following table of the
   women who watched the crucifixion of Jesus, for it is from their names
   and descriptions that we get our Scriptural light by which we
   distinguish the kindred of our Lord.
   Matt. xxvii. 56. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and John,
   and mother of the sons of Zebedee.

   Mark xv. 40. Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and
   of Joses, and Salome.
   John xix. 25. his mother and Mary Magdalene, Mary the wife of Clopas,
   the sister of Jesus' mother.
   Matthew and Mark each name three women, whence it is thought that
   Salome was the name of the mother of James and John. But the solution
   of the problem depends on our rendering of John xix. 25, which is
   translated thus: "But there were standing by the cross of Jesus, his
   mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
   Magdalene." Now, was Mary, the wife of Clopas, named and also
   additionally described as sister to our Lord's mother, or was it the
   unnamed Salome who was her sister? Does John mention three or four
   women? The best modern scholarship says that there were four women, and
   that therefore James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were cousins of our
   Lord. In support of this it is argued: 1. That it is unlikely that two
   sisters would bear the same name, a fact which, as Meyer says, is
   "established by no instance." 2. John gives two pairs of women, each
   pair coupled by an "and." The first pair is kindred to Jesus, and is
   unnamed and is paralleled by the other pair, which is not kindred and
   of which the names are given. Hebrew writers often used such
   parallelism. 3. It accords with John's custom to withhold the names of
   himself and all kindred, so that in his Gospel he nowhere gives his
   own, his mother's, or his brother's name, nor does he even give the
   name of our Lord's mother, who was his aunt. 4. The relationship
   explains in part why Jesus, when dying, left the care of his mother to
   John. It was not an unnatural thing to impose such a burden upon a
   kinsman.

Subdivision A.

Introductory Statements.

^A Matt. V. 1, 2; ^C Luke VI. 17-20.

   ^c 17 and he came down with them [the twelve apostles whom he had just
   chosen], and stood on a level place [Harmonists who wish to make this
   sermon in Luke identical with the sermon on the mount recorded by
   Matthew, say that Jesus stood during the healing of the multitude, and
   that he afterwards went a little way up the mountain-side and sat down
   when he taught (Matt. v. 1). The "level place" is meant by our
   translators to indicate a plateau on the side of the mountain, and not
   the plain at its base. In this translation they were influenced
   somewhat by a desire to make the two sermons one. It is more likely
   that the sermons were not identical, yet they were probably delivered
   about the same time, for in each Evangelist the sermon is followed by
   an account of the healing of the centurion's servant. As it is a matter
   of no great importance whether there was one sermon or two, and as they
   contain many things in common, we have taken the liberty of combining
   them to save time and space. The sermon is an announcement of certain
   distinctive features of the kingdom of heaven, which was said to be at
   hand], and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of
   people from all Judæa and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and
   Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 18 and
   they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. 19 And all
   the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and
   healed them all. [By comparing this with the foregoing section, we
   shall find that Mark had described this same crowd; the only difference
   between him and Luke being that he tells about it the day before Jesus
   chose the twelve apostles, while Luke describes its presence on the day
   after the event. Thus one substantiates the other.] ^a 1 And seeing the
   multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his
   disciples came unto him [In sitting he followed the custom of Jewish
   teachers. The instruction of Jesus was at no time embellished with
   oratorical action. He relied upon the truth contained in his words, not
   upon the manner in which he uttered it.]: ^c 20 And he lifted up his
   eyes on his disciples [Luke notes the eloquent look of Jesus here and
   elsewhere (Luke xxii. 61). While spoken to all, the sermon was
   addressed to the disciples, revealing to them the nature of the
   kingdom, and contrasting with it: 1. Popular expectation; 2. The Mosaic
   system; 3. Pharisaic hypocrisy] , ^a 2 and he opened his mouth, and
   taught them, ^c and said, { ^a saying,} [Jesus spoke with the
   full-toned voice of power--with open mouth.]

Beatitudes: Promises to Messiah's Subjects.

^A Matt. V. 3-12; ^C Luke VI. 20-26.

   ^a 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven. [The sayings in this subdivision are called beatitudes from the
   word "beati (meaning blessed), with which they begin in the Vulgate, or
   Latin Bible. According to Matthew, these beatitudes are nine in number
   and seven in character, for the last two, which concern persecution, do
   not relate to traits of character, but to certain external
   circumstances which lead to blessings. Luke gives us beatitudes not
   recorded in Matthew. Most of the beatitudes are paradoxical, being the
   very reverse of the world's view, but Christians who have put them to
   the test have learned to realize their unquestionable truth. The poor
   in spirit are those who feel a deep sense of spiritual destitution and
   comprehend their nothingness before God. The kingdom of heaven is
   theirs, because they seek it, and therefore find and abide in it. To
   this virtue is opposed the pride of the Pharisee, which caused him to
   thank God that he was not as other men, and to despise and reject the
   kingdom of heaven. There must be emptiness before there can be
   fullness, and so poverty of spirit precedes riches and grace in the
   kingdom of God.] 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be
   comforted. [Isa. xlii. 2, 3; Luke ii. 25; Rom. viii. 18; John xvi. 20,
   21. The blessing is not upon all that mourn (II. Cor. vii. 10); but
   upon those who mourn in reference to sin. They shall be comforted by
   the discovery and appropriation of God's pardon. But all mourning is
   traced directly or indirectly to sin. We may take it, therefore, that
   in its widest sense the beatitude covers all those who are led by
   mourning to a discerning of sin, and who so deplore its effects and
   consequences in the world as to yearn for and seek the deliverance
   which is in Christ. Those to whom Christ spoke the beatitude bore a
   double sorrow. Not only did their own sins afflict their consciences,
   but the hatred and opposition of other sinners added many additional
   sighs and tears. Joy springs from such sorrow so naturally that it is
   likened to harvest gathered from the seed (Ps. cxxvi. 6). But sorrows,
   even apart from a sense of sin, often prove blessings to us by drawing
   us near unto God.] 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
   earth. [His hearers were full of hopes that, as Messiah, he would glut
   their martial spirit, and lead them to world-wide conquest. But the
   earth was not to be subjugated to him by force. Those who were meek and
   forbearing should receive what the arrogant and selfish grasp after and
   can not get. "Man the animal has hitherto possessed the globe. Man the
   divine is yet to take it. The struggle is going on. But in every cycle
   more and more does the world feel the superior authority of truth,
   purity, justice, kindness, love, and faith. They shall yet possess the
   earth" (Beecher). The meek shall inherit it in two ways: 1. They shall
   enjoy it more fully while in it. 2. They shall finally, as part of the
   triumphant church, possess and enjoy it. Doubtless there is also here a
   reference to complete possession to be fulfilled in the new earth--Dan.
   vii. 27; Rev. iii. 21; v. 10.] 6 Blessed are they who hunger and thirst
   after righteousness: for they shall be filled. [Our Lord here declares
   that those who feel a most intense desire for righteousness shall
   obtain it. Under no other religion had such a promise ever been given.
   Under Christianity the promise is clear and definite. Compare Rom.
   viii. 3, 4; Heb. vii. 11, 19, 25. This promise is realized in part by
   the attainment of a higher degree of righteous living, and in part by
   the perfect forgiveness of our sins. But the joy of this individual
   righteousness, blessed as it is, shall be surpassed by that of the
   universal righteousness of the new creation--II. Pet. iii. 13.] 7
   Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. [As meekness is
   rather a passive virtue, so mercy is an active one. The meek bear, and
   the merciful forbear, and for so doing they shall obtain mercy both
   from God and man. This beatitude, like the rest, has a subordinate,
   temporal application; for God rules the world in spite of its sin. This
   beatitude has primary reference to the forgiveness of offences. The
   forgiving are forgiven--Matt. vi. 14, 15.] 8 Blessed are the pure in
   heart: for they shall see God. [The pure in heart are those who are
   free from evil desires and purposes. They have that similarity of life
   to the divine life which excludes all uncleanness, and which enables
   them to comprehend, after a sympathetic fashion, the motives and
   actions of God. Such see God by faith now, that is, by the spiritual
   vision of a regenerate heart (Eph. i. 17, 18), and shall see him face
   to face hereafter (I. Cor. xiii. 12; I. John iii. 2, 3). The Jews to
   whom Christ spoke, having their hearts defiled with carnal hopes and
   self-righteous pride, failed to see God, as he was then revealing
   himself in the person of his Son, thus forming a sad contrast to the
   gracious promise of the beatitude. "They only can understand God who
   have in themselves some moral resemblance to him; and they will enter
   most largely into the knowledge of him who are most in sympathy with
   the divine life"--Beecher.] 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they
   shall be called sons of God. [The term includes all who make peace
   between men, whether as individuals or as communities. It includes even
   those who worthily endeavor to make peace, though they fail of success.
   They shall be called God's children, because he is the God of peace
   (Rom. xv. 33; xvi. 20; II. Cor. xiii. 11); whose supreme purpose is to
   secure peace (Luke ii. 14); and who gave his Son to be born into this
   world as the Prince of Peace (Isa. ix. 6). Here again Jesus varies from
   human ideas. In worldly kingdoms the makers of war stand highest, but
   in his kingdom peacemakers outrank them, for the King himself is a
   great Peacemaker--Col. i. 20; Eph. ii. 14.] 10 Blessed are they that
   have been persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom
   of heaven. [Those who suffer because of their loyalty to the kingdom of
   heaven are blessed by being bound more closely to that kingdom for
   which they suffer.] ^c Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of
   God. 21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
   are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. [These three beatitudes given
   by Luke, like the two closing beatitudes of Matthew are pronounced not
   upon character, but upon those in certain trying conditions. They are
   addressed to the disciples (Luke vi. 17), and are meant to strengthen
   and encourage them to continue in the life of sacrifice when
   discipleship demanded. For light upon the meaning of these beatitudes,
   see such passages as these: Matt. x. 37-39; xvi. 24-26; Mark x. 28-30
   Matt. x. 22-25. The service to which Jesus called meant poverty,
   hunger, and tears, but it led to rich reward--I. Cor. xi. 23-33; xii.
   1-5.] 22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
   separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your
   name as evil, ^a and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against
   you falsely, for my ^c the Son of man's sake. [The Master here presents
   the various forms of suffering which would come upon the disciples by
   reason of their loyalty to him. We shall find several like statements
   as we proceed with the gospel story. They would first be conscious of
   the coldness of their brethren before the secret hate became outspoken
   and active. Later they should find themselves excommunicated from the
   synagogue (John xvi. 2). This act in turn would be followed by bitter
   reproaches and blasphemy of the sacred name by which they were
   called--the name Christian (Jas. ii. 7; I. Pet. iv. 4). "'Malefic' or
   'execrable superstition' was the favorite description of Christianity
   among Pagans (Tac., Ann. xv. 44; Suet. Nero, xvi.), and Christians were
   charged with incendiarism, cannibalism and every infamy" (Farrar). All
   this would finally culminate in bloody-handed persecution, and procure
   the death of Christ's followers by forms of law; all manner of false
   and evil accusations would be brought against them.] 23 Rejoice ye in
   that day, ^b and be exceeding glad: ^c and leap for joy: for behold,
   your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their
   fathers unto the prophets. ^a for so persecuted they the prophets that
   were before you. [In commanding rejoicing under such circumstances
   Jesus seemed to make a heavy demand upon his disciples, but it is a
   demand which very many have responded to (Acts v. 41; xvi. 25).
   Anticipations of the glorious future are a great tonic. For instances
   of persecution of the prophets, see I. Kings xix. 10; II. Chron. xvi.
   10; I. Kings xxii. 27; II. Chron. xxiv. 20, 21; Jer. xxvi. 23 and
   xxxii. and xxxvii; Heb. xi. 36-38.] ^c 24 But woe unto you that are
   rich! for ye have received your consolation. [Luke xvi. 25.] 25 Woe
   unto you that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you, ye that
   laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. [These three woes are
   respectively the converse of the three beatitudes recorded by Luke.
   This converse is to be expected, for as long as sin lasts woes stand
   over against beatitudes as Ebal against Gerizim. But the woe here
   expressed by the Saviour is more of a cry of compassion than a
   denunciation, and may be translated, "Alas for you!" The first woe
   applies to those who love and trust in riches (Mark x. 24). Jesus does
   not clearly define the line beyond which the possession of riches
   becomes a danger, lest any, fancying himself to be on the safe side of
   the line, should lull himself to repose and be taken off his guard.
   Riches are always dangerous, and we must be ever watchful against their
   seduction. The second woe is kindred to the first. Righteousness is the
   soul's true food. Those who feast upon it shall be satisfied, but those
   who satiate themselves with this world shall waken some day to a sense
   of emptiness, since they have filled themselves with vanity (Eccl. ii.
   1-11; Jas. v. 1-6). The third woe is not pronounced upon those who make
   merriment an occasional relief (Prov. xvii. 22; xv. 13, 15); but upon
   those who, through lack of earnestness, make it a constant aim. Half
   the world has no higher object in life than to be amused (Prov. xiii.
   14; Eccl. vii. 6). Those who sow folly shall reap a harvest of tears.
   The truth of this saying was abundantly fulfilled in the Jewish wars,
   which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem about forty years
   later.] 26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for in
   the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets. [This is the
   converse to the beatitudes pronounced upon those who are reviled, etc.
   A righteous life rebukes an evil one, and the general tendency of evil
   is to deride that which rebukes it. This tendency caused the wicked of
   Christ's times to say that he had a demon, and that he cast out demons
   by the power of Beelzebub. If our lives draw to themselves no reproach,
   they can not be right in the sight of God. A good name is more to be
   desired than great riches; but we must not sacrifice our fidelity to
   Christ in order to attain it. If we adhere strictly to the virtues
   which Christ enjoined, we shall find that the world has an evil name
   for every one of them. Earnest contention for his truth is called
   bigotry; loyalty to his ordinances is dubbed narrowness; strict
   conformity to the laws of purity is named puritanism; liberality is
   looked upon as an effort to court praise; piety is scorned as
   hypocrisy, and faith is regarded as fanaticism.]

Influence and Duties of Messiah's Subjects.

^A Matt. V. 13-16.

   ^a 13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
   savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
   nothing, but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of men. [Salt has
   been used from time immemorial as an agent in the preservation of
   meats. The multitudes which heard Jesus were familiar with its use in
   curing fish. "The pickled fish of Galilee were known throughout the
   Roman world" (G. A. Smith). It is worthy of note that the salt of
   Palestine gathered from the marshes is not pure. Because of the foreign
   substances in it, it loses its savor and becomes insipid and useless,
   when exposed to the sun and air, or when permitted for any considerable
   time to come in contact with the ground; but pure salt does not lose
   its savor. The verse teaches that God's people keep the world from
   putrefaction and corruption. There was not salt enough in the
   antediluvian world to save it from the flood, in Sodom to save it from
   fire, nor in Canaan to preserve its people from destruction. It also
   teaches--as does experience--that a disciple may lose those qualities
   which make him salt.] 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a
   hill cannot be hid. [As light dispels darkness and enables a man to see
   his way, so the Christian, by his teaching and example, removes
   ignorance and prejudice, and discloses the way of life. The church,
   reflecting the light of Christ, is of necessity a conspicuous body, so
   that neither its blemishes nor its beauty can be concealed. For air and
   for protection cities were frequently built upon hills. Jerusalem and
   Samaria were both hill cities.] 15 Neither do men light a candle, and
   put it under a bushel [a common measure, found in every Jewish house,
   and containing about a peck], but on the stand; and it shineth unto all
   that are in the house. [Lamps were then crude affairs without chimneys,
   in which, for the most part, olive oil was burned. Candles were not
   then known. The word candle, where used in the King James version, is a
   mistranslation.] 16 Even so let your light shine before men; that they
   may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. [The
   light of the Christian is to shine not ostentatiously, but naturally
   and unavoidably. It is to shine not only in his teaching or profession,
   but in such works and actions as unprejudiced men must acknowledge to
   be real excellencies. Moreover, it must so shine that it shall not win
   praise for itself, but for him who kindled it. Men do not praise the
   street lamps which protect them from robbery and assault, but they
   praise the municipal administration which furnishes the lamps.]

The Sermon on the Mount.

(a Mountain Plateau Not Far from Capernaum.)

Subdivision D.

Relation of Messianic Teaching to

Old Testament and Traditional Teaching.

^A Matt. V. 17-48; ^C Luke VI. 27-30, 32-36.

   ^a 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am
   not come to destroy, but to fulfil. [This verse constitutes a preface
   to the section of the sermon which follows it. It is intended to
   prevent a misconstruction of what he was about to say. Destroy is here
   used in antithesis, not with perpetuate, but with fulfill. To destroy
   the law would be more than to abrogate it, for it was both a system of
   statutes designed for the ends of government, and a system of types
   foreshadowing the kingdom of Christ. To destroy it, therefore, would be
   both to abrogate its statutes and prevent the fulfillment of its types.
   The former, Jesus eventually did; the latter, he did not. As regards
   the prophets, the only way to destroy them would be to prevent the
   fulfillment of the predictions contained in them. Instead of coming to
   destroy either the law or the prophets, Jesus came to fulfill all the
   types of the former, and (eventually) all the unfulfilled predictions
   of the latter. He fulfills them partly in his own person, and partly by
   his administration of the affairs of his kingdom. The latter part of
   the process is still going on, and will be until the end of the world.]
   18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot
   or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things be
   accomplished. [The jot or yod answering to our letter i was the
   smallest of the Hebrew letters. The tittle was a little stroke of the
   pen, by which alone some of the Hebrew letters were distinguished from
   others like them. To put it in English, we distinguish the letter c
   from the letter e by the tittle inside of the latter. This passage not
   only teaches that the law was to remain in full force until fulfilled,
   but it shows the precise accuracy with which the law was given by God.]
   19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and
   shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but
   whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the
   kingdom of heaven. [Disobedience is a habit, and it is not easily laid
   aside. Hence he that is unfaithful in that which is little will also be
   unfaithful in that which is great. So also those who were disobedient
   and reckless under the Jewish dispensation would be inclined to act in
   like manner in the new, or Christian, dispensation: hence the warning.
   Not only shall God call such least, but men also shall eventually do
   likewise. Those who by a false system of interpretation, or an undue
   regard for the traditions of men, enervate or annul the obligations of
   Christ's laws or ordinances, and teach others to do the same, shall be
   held in low esteem or contempt by the church or kingdom of God as fast
   as it comes to a knowledge of the truth. Greatness in the kingdom of
   heaven is measured by conscientiousness in reference to its least
   commandments. Small Christians obey the great commandments, but only
   the large are careful about the least.] 20 For I say unto you, that
   except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes
   and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
   [Since the scribes and Pharisees were models of righteousness in their
   own sight and in that of the people, Jesus here laid down a very high
   ideal. Though one may now enter the kingdom of heaven having of himself
   far less righteousness than that of the Pharisees, yet he must attain
   righteousness superior to theirs, or he can not abide in the kingdom. A
   large portion of the sermon from this point on is a development of the
   righteousness of the kingdom of heaven in contrast with old
   dispensation righteousness and Pharisaic interpretation of it. The laws
   of Moses regulated civil conduct, and being state laws, they could only
   have regard to overt acts. But the laws of the kingdom of Christ are
   given to the individual, and regulate his inner spiritual condition,
   and the very initial motives of conduct; in it the spirit-feelings are
   all acts--I. John iii. 15.] 21 Ye have heard [Ex. xx. 13; Deut. v. 17.
   The common people, for the most part, knew the law only by its public
   reading, and hence the exposition of the scribes which accompanied the
   readings shared in their estimation the very authority of Scripture
   itself.] that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and
   whosoever shall kill shall be in danger [shall be liable to] of the
   judgment; 22 but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his
   brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to
   his brother, Raca [an expression of contempt frequently used in
   rabbinical writings, but of uncertain derivation, so that it may mean
   "empty head" or "spit out;" i. e., heretic], shall be in danger of the
   council: and whosoever shall say, Thou fool ["'Thou impious wretch;'
   folly and impiety being equivalent with the Hebrews"-- Bloomfield],
   shall be in danger of hell fire. [We have here three degrees of
   criminality or offence as to the sin of anger: 1. Silent rage; 2.
   Railing speech; 3. Bitter reproach (Ps. xiv. 1). With these are
   associated respectively three different degrees of punishment. The law
   of Moses provided for the appointment of judges (Deut. xvi. 18), and
   Josephus informs us that in each city there were seven judges appointed
   (Ant. iv. 8, 14). This tribunal was known as the judgment, and by it
   the case of the manslayer was determined. Compare Num. xxxv. 15, 24, 25
   with Josh. xx. 4. And in determining his case this court might certify
   it for decision to the Sanhedrin, or they might themselves confine the
   man in of the cities of refuge, or order him to be stoned to death. The
   second punishment would be the result of a trial before the Sanhedrin
   or council. This chief court of the Jews sat at Jerusalem (Deut. xvii.
   8-13), and common men stood in great awe of it. The third punishment
   passes beyond the pale of human jurisdiction. It is the final
   punishment--being cast into hell. The Scripture word for hell is
   derived from the name of a place in the neighborhood of Jerusalem,
   called the valley of Hinnom. It was a deep, narrow valley, lying
   southeast of Jerusalem. The Greek word Gehenna (which we translate
   hell) is first found applied to it in the Septuagint translation of
   Josh. xviii. 16. (For the history of the valley, see the following
   passages of Scripture: Josh. xv. 8; II. Chron. xxviii. 3; xxxiii. 6;
   Jer. vii. 31; xix. 1-5; II. Kings xxiii. 1-14; II. Chron. xxxiv. 4, 5.)
   The only fire certainly known to have been kindled there was the fire
   in which children were sacrificed to the god Moloch. This worship was
   entirely destroyed by King Josiah, who polluted the entire valley so as
   to make it an unfit place even for heathen worship. Some commentators
   endeavor to make this third punishment a temporal one, and assert that
   fires were kept burning in the valley of Hinnom, and that as an extreme
   punishment the bodies of criminals were cast into those fires. But
   there is not the slightest authentic evidence that any fire was kept
   burning there; nor is there any evidence at all that casting a criminal
   into the fire was ever employed by the Jews as a punishment. It was the
   fire of idolatrous worship in the offering of human sacrifice which had
   given the valley its bad name. This caused it to be associated in the
   mind of the Jews with sin and suffering, and led to the application of
   its name, in the Greek form of it, to the place of final and eternal
   punishment. When the conception of such a place as hell was formed, it
   was necessary to give it a name, and there was no word in the Jewish
   language more appropriate for the purpose than the name of this hideous
   valley. It is often used in the New Testament, and always denotes the
   place of final punishment (Matt. x. 28; xviii. 9; xxiii. 33; Mark ix.
   43). We should note that while sin has stages, God takes note of it
   from its very first germination in the heart, and that a man's soul is
   imperiled long before his feelings bear their fruitage of violence and
   murder.] 23 If therefore [having forbidden anger, Jesus now proceeds to
   lay down the course for reconciliation] thou art offering thy gift at
   the altar [that which was popularly esteemed the very highest act of
   worship], and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against
   thee, 24; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first
   be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
   [Reconciliation takes precedence of all other duties, even of offerings
   made to God. A very important teaching in these days, when men, by
   corrupt practices, by extortionate combinations, and by grinding the
   face of the poor, accumulate millions of dollars and then attempt to
   placate God by bestowing a little of their pocket change upon colleges
   and missionary societies. God hears and heeds the voice of the
   unreconciled brethren, and the gift is bestowed upon the altar in vain.
   The offering of unclean hands is an abomination. The lesson teaches us
   to be reconciled with all who bear grudges against us, and says nothing
   as to whether their reasons are sufficient or insufficient, just or
   unjust. "It is enough to say, I have naught against him, and so justify
   myself"--Stier.] 25 Agree with thine adversary [opponent in a lawsuit]
   quickly, while thou art with him in the way [on the road to the judge];
   lest haply thy adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
   deliver thee to the officer [one answering somewhat to our sheriff],
   and thou be cast into prison. ["In this brief allegory one is supposed
   to have an adversary at law who has just cause against him, and who
   will certainly gain a verdict when the case comes into court. The
   plaintiff himself used to apprehend the defendant" (Bengel). The
   defendant is, therefore, advised to agree with this adversary while the
   two are alone on the way to the judge, and thus prevent a trial. Jesus
   still has in mind the preceding case of one who has given offence to
   his brother. Every such one is going to the final judgment, and will
   there be condemned unless he now becomes reconciled to his brother.] 26
   Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
   thou have paid the last farthing. [This is the text on which the Roman
   Catholic Church has built its doctrine of purgatory, and one of those
   on which the Universalists build theirs of final restoration. But
   neither "prison" nor "till" necessarily point to ultimate deliverance.
   Compare II. Pet. ii. 4 and Jude 6. The allusion here is of course to
   imprisonment for debt. In such a case the debtor was held until the
   debt was paid, either by himself or some friend. If it were not paid at
   all, he remained in prison until he died. In the case which this is
   made to represent, the offender would have let pass all opportunity to
   make reparation and no friend can make it for him; therefore, the last
   farthing will never be paid, and he must remain a prisoner forever. So
   far, therefore, from being a picture of hope, it is one which sets
   forth the inexorable rigor of divine justice against the hardened and
   impenitent sinner. It is intended to teach that men can not pay their
   debts to God, and therefore they had better obtain his forgiveness
   through faith during these days of grace. It exposes the vain hope of
   those who think that God will only lightly exact his debts. God knows
   only complete forgiveness or complete exaction. This is an action
   founded upon the perfection of his nature. The Greek word translated
   "farthing," is derived from the Latin "quadrans," which equals the
   fourth part of a Roman As, a small copper or bronze coin which had
   become common in Palestine. The farthing was worth about one-fifth part
   of a cent.] 27 Ye have heard that it was said [Ex. xx. 14; Deut. v.
   18], Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28 but I say unto you, that every
   one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
   with her already in his heart. [Here, as in reference to murder, Jesus
   legislates against the thought which lies back of the act. He cuts off
   sin at its lowest root. The essence of all vice is intention. Those who
   indulge in unchaste imaginations, desires and intentions are guilty
   before God-- II. Pet. ii. 14.] 29 And if thy right eye [the organ of
   reception] causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee
   [these words indicate decision and determination, and suggest the
   conduct of a surgeon, who, to protect the rest of the body,
   unflinchingly severs the gangrened members]: for it is profitable for
   thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be
   cast into hell. 30 And if thy right hand [the instrument of outward
   action] causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for
   it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and
   not thy whole body go into hell. [Jesus here emphasizes the earnestness
   with which men should seek a sinless life. To this the whole Scripture
   constrains us by the terrors of hell, and encourages us by the joys of
   heaven. The right eye and hand and foot were regarded as the most
   precious (Zech. xi. 17; Ex. xxix. 20), but it is better to lose the
   dearest thing in life than to lose one's self. To be deprived of all
   earthly advantage than to be cast into hell. Of course the Saviour does
   not mean that we should apply this precept literally, since bodily
   mutilation will not cure sin which resides in the will and not in the
   organ of sense or action. A literal exaction of the demands of this
   precept would turn the church into a hospital. We should blind
   ourselves by taking care not to look with evil eyes; we should maim
   ourselves by absolutely refusing to go to forbidden resorts, etc.
   "'Mortify' (Col. iii. 5) is a similar expression"--Bengel.] 31 It is
   said also [Deut. xxiv. 1, 3], Whosoever shall put away his wife, let
   him give her a writing of divorcement: 32 but I say unto you, that
   every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of
   fornication, maketh her an adulteress [the mere fact of divorce did not
   make her an adulteress, but it brought her into a state of disgrace
   from which she invariably sought to free herself by contracting another
   marriage, and this other marriage to which her humiliating situation
   drove her made her an adulteress]: and whosoever shall marry her when
   she is put away committeth adultery. [The law of divorce will be found
   at Deut. xxiv. 1-4. Jesus explains that this law was given by Moses on
   account of the hardness of the people's heart; i. e., to prevent
   greater evils ( Matt. xix. 8). The law permitted the husband to put
   away the wife when he found "some unseemly thing in her." But Jesus
   here limits the right of divorce to cases of unchastity, and if there
   be a divorce on any other ground, neither the man nor the woman can
   marry again without committing adultery (Matt. xix. 9). Such is Jesus'
   modification of the Old Testament law, and in no part of the New
   Testament is there any relaxation as to the law here set forth. It is
   implied that divorce for unchastity breaks the marriage bond, and it is
   therefore held almost universally, both by commentators and moralists,
   that the innocent party to such a divorce can marry again. Of course
   the guilty part could not, for no one is allowed by law to reap the
   benefits of his own wrong. For further light on the subject, see Rom.
   vii. 1-3; I. Cor. vii. 10-16, 39. It is much to be regretted that in
   many Protestant countries the civil authorities have practically set
   aside this law of Christ by allowing divorce and remarriage for a
   variety of causes. No man who respects the authority of Christ can take
   advantage of such legislation.] 33 Again, ye have heard that it hath
   been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but
   shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths [Lev. xix. 12; Num. xxx. 2;
   Deut. xxiii. 21]: 34 but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by
   heaven; for it is the throne of God; 35 nor by the earth, for it is the
   footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
   great King. [Ps. xlviii. 2.] 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head,
   because thou canst not make one hair white or black. 37 But let your
   speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of
   the evil one. [It will be seen from the quotation given by Jesus that
   the law permitted oaths made unto the Lord. It was not the intention of
   Jesus to repeal this law. But the Jews, looking upon this law,
   construed it as giving them exemption from the binding effect of all
   other oaths. According to the their construction no oath was binding in
   which the sacred name of God did not directly occur. They therefore
   coined many other oaths to suit their purposes, which would add weight
   to their statements or promises, which, however, would not leave them
   guilty of being forsworn if they spoke untruthfully. But Jesus showed
   that all oaths were ultimately referable to God, and that those who
   made them would be forsworn if they did not keep them. To prevent this
   evil practice of loose swearing Jesus lays down the prohibition, "Swear
   not at all;" but the universality of this prohibition is distributed by
   the specifications of these four forms of oaths, and is, therefore,
   most strictly interpreted as including only such oaths. Jesus surely
   did not intend to abolish now, in advance of the general abrogation of
   the law, those statutes of Moses which allowed, and in some instances
   required, the administration of an oath. See Ex. xxii. 11; Num. v. 19.
   What we style the judicial oaths of the law of Moses then were not
   included in the prohibition. This conclusion is also reached when we
   interpret the prohibition in the light of authoritative examples; for
   we find that God swore by himself (Gen. xxii. 16, 17; Heb. vi. 13; vii.
   21). Jesus answered under oath before the Sanhedrin (Matt. xxvi. 63),
   and Paul also made oath to the Corinthian church (II. Cor. i. 23). See
   also Rom. i. 9; Gal. i. 20; Phil. i. 8 I. Cor. xv. 31; Rev. x. 5, 6. We
   conclude, then, that judicial oaths, and oaths taken in the name of God
   on occasions of solemn religious importance, are not included in the
   prohibition. But as these are the only exceptions found in Scriptures,
   we conclude that all other oaths are forbidden. Looking at the details
   of the paragraph, we find that oaths by heaven and by the earth, by
   Jerusalem and by the head, are utterly meaningless save as they have
   reference to God. "Swearing is a sin whereunto neither profit incites,
   nor pleasure allures, nor necessity compels, nor inclination of nature
   persuades"--Quarles.] 38 Ye have heard that it was said [Ex. xxi. 24;
   Lev. xxiv. 20; Deut. xix. 21], An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
   tooth: 39 but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil [The lex
   talionis, or law of like for like, was the best possible rule in a rude
   state of society, its object being not to sacrifice the second eye, but
   to save both, by causing a man when in a passion to realize that every
   injury which he inflicted upon his adversary he would in the end
   inflict upon himself. From this rule the scribes drew the false
   inference that revenge was proper, and that a man was entitled to
   exercise it. Thus a law intended to prevent revenge was so perverted
   that it was used as a warrant for it. This command which enjoins
   non-resistance, like most of the other precepts of this sermon, does
   not demand of us absolute, unqualified pacivity at all times and under
   all circumstances. In fact, we may say generally of the whole sermon on
   the mount that it is not a code for slaves, but an assertion of
   principles which are to be interpreted and applied by the children of
   freedom. We are to submit to evil for principle's sake and to
   accomplish spiritual victories, and not in an abject, servile spirit as
   blind followers of a harsh and exacting law. On the contrary, taking
   the principle, we judge when and how to apply it as best we can.
   Absolute non-resistance may so far encourage crime as to become a sin.
   As in the case of the precept about swearing just above, Jesus
   distributes the universal prohibition by the specification of certain
   examples, which in this case are three in number]: but whosoever
   smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. [This
   first example is taken from the realm of physical violence. The example
   given, a slap in the face, has been regarded as a gross insult in all
   ages, but it is not an assault which imperils life. We find this
   precept illustrated by the conduct of the Master himself. He did not
   literally turn the other cheek to be smitten, but he breathed forth a
   mild and gentle reproof where he might have avenged himself by the
   sudden death of his adversary (John xviii. 22, 23). The example of Paul
   also is given, but it is not so perfect as that of the Master (Acts
   xxiii. 2-5). Self-preservation is a law of God giving rights which,
   under most circumstances, a Christian can claim. He may resist the
   robber, the assassin and all men of that ilk, and may protect his
   person and his possessions against the assaults of the violent and
   lawless (Acts xvi. 35-39). But when the honor of Christ and the
   salvation of man demands it, he should observe this commandment even
   unto the very letter.] 40 And if any man would go to law with thee, and
   take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. [This second case is
   one of judicial injustice, and teaches that the most annoying exactions
   are to be endured without revenge. The coat was the inner garment, and
   the cloak was the outer or more costly one. The creditor was not
   allowed to retain it over night, even when it was given to him as a
   pledge from the poor, because it was used for a bed-covering (Ex. xxii.
   26, 27). The idea therefore is, "Be ready to give up even that which by
   law can not be taken" (Mansel). This case, as the one just above, is
   also an instance of petty persecution, and shows that the command does
   not forbid a righteous appeal to the law in cases where large and
   important interests are involved.] 41 And whosoever shall compel thee
   to go one mile [the Roman mile; it was 142 yards short of the English
   mile], go with him two. [This third instance is a case of governmental
   oppression. It supposes a man to be impressed by government officials
   to go a mile. The custom alluded to is said to have originated with
   Cyrus, king of Persia, and it empowered a government courier to impress
   both men and horses to help him forward. For an example of governmental
   impress, see Luke xxiii. 26. The exercise of this power by the Romans
   was exceedingly distasteful to Jews, and this circumstance gave a
   special pertinency to the Saviour's mention of it. (See Herodotus viii.
   98; Xen. Cyrop. viii. 6, 7; Jos. Ant. xiii. 2, 3.) The command, "Go
   with him two," requires a cheerful compliance with the demands of a
   tyrannical government--a doubling of the hardship or duty required
   rather than a resistance to the demand. But here again the oppression
   is not an insupportable one. A man might go two miles and yet not lose
   his whole day's labor. The Saviour chooses these lesser evils because
   they bring out more distinctly the motives of conduct. If we resist the
   smaller evils of life, we thereby manifest a spirit of pride seeking
   revenge; but when the larger evils come upon us, they waken other
   motives. A man may strive for self-protection when life is threatened
   without any spirit of revenge. He may appeal to the law to protect his
   property without any bitterness toward the one who seeks to wrest it
   from him, and he may set himself against the oppression of his
   government from the loftiest motives of patriotism. If revenge slumbers
   in our breast, little injuries will waken it as quickly as big ones.]
   42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
   turn not thou away. [Jesus here turns from the negative to the positive
   side of life. Our conduct, instead of being selfish and revengeful,
   should be generous and liberal. A benevolent disposition casts out
   revenge as light does darkness. No lending was provided for by the law
   of Moses except for benevolent purposes, for no interest was allowed,
   and all debts were canceled every seventh year. The giving and lending
   referred to, then, are limited to cases of real want, and the amount
   given or loaned is to be regulated accordingly. Giving or lending to
   the encouragement of vice or indolence can not, of course, be here
   included. Good actions are marred if they bear evil fruit.] 43 Ye have
   heard that it was said [Lev. xix. 18], Thou shalt love thy neighbor,
   and hate thine enemy: 44 but I say unto you, ^c that hear, Love your
   enemies, do good to them that hate you 28 bless them that curse you [I.
   Cor. iv. 12], ^a and pray for them that persecute you; ^c that
   despitefully use you. [The law commanding love will be found at Lev.
   xix. 18, while the sentiment "hate thy enemy" is not found in the law
   as a precept. But the Jews were forbidden by law to make peace with the
   Canaanites (Ex. xxxiv. 11-16; Deut. vii. 2; xxiii. 6), and the bloody
   wars which were waged by God's own command inevitably taught them to
   hate them. This was the feeling of their most pious men (I. Chron. xx.
   3; II. Kings xiii. 19), and it found utterance even in their devotional
   hymns; e. g., Ps. cxxxvii. 8, 9; cxxxix. 21, 22. It is a true
   representation of the law, therefore, in its practical working, that it
   taught hatred of one's enemies. This is one of the defects of the
   Jewish dispensation, which, like the privilege of divorce at will, was
   to endure but for a time. To love an enemy has appeared to many persons
   impossible, because they understand the word "love" as here expressing
   the same feeling in all respects which are entertained toward a friend
   or a near kinsman. But love has many shades and degrees. The exact
   phase of it which is here enjoined is best understood in the light of
   examples. The parable of the good Samaritan is given by Jesus for the
   express purpose of exemplifying it (Luke x. 35-37); his own example in
   praying on the cross for those who crucified him serves the same
   purpose, as does also the prayer of Stephen made in imitation of it
   (Luke xxiii. 34; Acts vii. 60). The feeling which enables us to deal
   with an enemy after the manner of the Samaritan, or Jesus, or Stephen,
   is the love for our enemies which is here enjoined. It is by no means
   an impossible feeling. Prayer, too, can always express it, for as
   Hooker says, "Prayer is that which we always have in our power to
   bestow, and they never in theirs to refuse."] ^a 45 that ye may be sons
   of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the
   evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. [Jesus
   here gives two reasons why we should obey this precept: 1. That we may
   be like God; 2. That we may be unlike publicans and sinners. Of course
   right action towards our enemies does not make us sons of God, but it
   proves us such by showing our resemblance to him. We are made children
   of God by regeneration. God, in his daily conduct toward the children
   of this earth, does not carry his discrimination to any great length.
   Needful blessings are bestowed lavishly upon all.] ^c 29 To him that
   smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that
   taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also. 30 Give to every man
   that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not
   again. [The teaching of this passage has been explained above. It is
   repeated because of its difference in verbiage, and because its
   position here illustrates the spirit of the verses which precede it.]
   ^a 46 For { ^c 32 And} if ye love them that love you, what thank { ^a
   reward} have ye? do not even the publicans the same? ^c for even
   sinners love those that love them. 33 And if ye do good to them that do
   good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do the same? [The
   Roman publican proper was a wealthy man of the knightly order, who
   purchased from the state the privilege of collecting the taxes, but the
   publicans mentioned in the Scripture were their servants--the men who
   actually collected the taxes, and the official name for them was
   portitores. These latter were sometimes freedmen or slaves, and
   sometimes natives of the province in which the tax was collected. The
   fact that the Jews were a conquered people, paying tax to a foreign
   power, made the tax itself odious, and hence the men through whom it
   was extorted from them were equally odious. These men were regarded in
   the double aspect of oppressors and traitors. The odium thus attached
   to the office prevented men who had any regard for the good opinion of
   their countrymen from accepting it, and left it in the hands of those
   who had no self-respect and no reputation. Jesus teaches that our
   religion is worth little if it begets in us no higher love than that
   which is shown by natural, worldly men. "Christianity is more than
   humanity"--M. Henry.] 34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to
   receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive
   as much again. 35 But love your enemies, and do them good [Ex. xxiii.
   4; Prov. xxiv. 17; Rom. xii. 17, 19-21], and lend, never despairing;
   and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High:
   for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. ["To make our neighbor
   purchase, in any way, the assistance which we give him is to profit by
   his misery; and, by laying him under obligations which we expect him in
   some way or other to discharge, we increase his wretchedness under the
   pretense of relieving him"-- Clarke.] ^a 47 And if ye salute your
   brethren only, what do ye more than others ? do not even the Gentiles
   the same? [The Jews despised the Gentiles, so that they did not usually
   salute them. This was especially true of the Pharisees. The morality,
   therefore, of this sect proved to be, in this respect, no better than
   that of the heathen. Salutation has always been an important feature in
   Eastern social life. The salutation, with all its accompaniments,
   recognized the one saluted as a friend.] ^c 36 Be ye merciful, even as
   your Father is merciful. ^a 48 Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your
   heavenly Father is perfect. [Luke emphasizes the particular
   characteristic of God's perfection which Jesus has been discussing;
   namely, mercy; but Matthew records the broader assertion which bids us
   resemble God's perfections in all their fullness and universality. God
   is our model. Everything short of that is short of what we ought to be.
   God can not be satisfied with that which is imperfect. This requirement
   keeps us in mind of our infirmities, and keeps us at work. Like Paul,
   we must be ever striving (Phil. iii. 12). Our standard is not the
   perfection of great and heroic men, but of the infinite Creator
   himself.]

Almsgiving, Prayer, and Fasting to Be

Performed Sincerely, Not Ostentatiously.

^A Matt. VI. 1-18.

   ^a 1 Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen
   of them: else ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
   [This verse refers back to verse 20 of the previous chapter, where the
   disciple is told that his righteousness must exceed that of the scribes
   and Pharisees. Matthew's fifth chapter deals with the actions
   themselves, but this sixth chapter treats of the motives and manners of
   our actions.] 2 When therefore when thou doest alms, sound not a
   trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
   streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They
   have received their reward. [Trumpets were sounded as signals to large
   bodies. This fact gave to the word trumpet a symbolic significance.
   Anything which is noised or blazoned abroad is spoken of as being
   trumpeted. The figure also conveys the idea of pompous self-laudation.
   Hence we still speak of an egotistical man as one who "blows his own
   trumpet." The hypocrites of that day did not blow a literal trumpet to
   call attention to their gifts any more than the hypocrites of this day
   do. But they used methods to call attention to their generosity as
   those of our time do when they publish an account of their munificence
   in the newspapers. Almsgiving was a prominent feature of Jewish life.
   Transplanted from Judaism, almsgiving became one of the characteristic
   features of the early church (Acts ix. 36; x. 2; Gal. ii. 10). Christ
   corrected the error as to it in what he said about the widow's mites.
   As these hypocrites sought the praise of men, they had their reward
   when they received it.] 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
   hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4 that thine alms may be in
   secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
   [Jesus here recommends secret and noiseless giving, by the
   never-to-be-forgotten metaphor of the left and right hand. Our
   generosity is to come so spontaneously, and with so little thought,
   that the liberality of one part of the body shall not be communicated
   to the other. The command does not forbid publicity, but that spirit
   which desires publicity. "The true Christian cares not how much men
   hear of his public charities, nor how little they hear of his private
   ones" (Toplady). Good deeds may be published by others to stimulate
   good in others; but care should be taken lest they be stimulated to
   give for the sake of like notoriety (Mark xii. 41-44; Acts iv. 36, 37).
   Salvation is a matter of favor, and not of merit. But there is,
   nevertheless, a recompense attendant upon it. The joys of the world
   come, and the blessings in this world are included in that
   recompense--Matt. xxv. 34-40.] 5 And when ye pray, ye shall not be as
   the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and
   in the corners of the street. that they may be seen of men. Verily I
   say unto you, They have received their reward. [Jesus deals with our
   conduct toward God as well as toward man. However perfectly we may act
   toward man, our life is one-sided and imperfect if we omit or
   improperly perform our duties toward God. The Pharisaical habit of
   standing in a prayerful attitude, to be seen of men, was certainly not
   prayer. In their case public opinion, and not the praise of God, "was
   the wind that set the wind-mill a-work" (Trapp). As Pharisees loved the
   standing and not the praying, so Christians should love the praying and
   not the standing. Yet prayer for the edification or comfort of others
   is not here condemned. Prayer itself is nowhere condemned. It is the
   ostentatious prayer-attitude which Jesus stamps with his displeasure.
   Needless attitudes of private prayer in pulpit and pew are here
   condemned.] 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner
   chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret,
   and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee. [The inner
   chamber was properly a little room in the interior of the house or on
   the housetop, but it is here used to indicate any place of privacy, and
   the shut door emphasizes the strictness of the privacy, for in all
   personal prayer we should strive to be alone with God. Jesus found a
   prayer-chamber upon the mountain-top and in the garden.] 7 And in
   praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think
   that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 8 Be not ye therefore
   like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of,
   before ye ask him. [For samples of repetitions, see I. Kings xviii. 26;
   Acts xix. 34. Strictly speaking, Jesus does not here forbid either a
   long prayer, or the use of the same words in a prayer when the heart
   sincerely prompts the utterance. He himself prayed at great length,
   even continuing in prayer all night (Luke vi. 12), and in the garden he
   thrice repeated the same words. What he does forbid is making the
   number and length of prayers an object of consideration or a source of
   trust. This command is especially violated by the repetitions of the
   Roman Catholic rosary. Speech to God can not be ordered too carefully
   (Eccl. v. 2). In stating that God knows our desires before we ask,
   Jesus gives the reason against vain repetitions. God does not need
   elaborate explanations, and prayer is not uttered to inform him, but to
   put ourselves in such communion with him as to make us fit to receive.
   Moreover, prayer is a matter of asking and receiving, and not a
   meritorious service, as Mohammedans and Catholics still hold, and as
   the Pharisees held. With them, as public prayers were to gain credit
   with men, so long and repeated prayers were to obtain merit before God.
   Christ teaches contrary to all this.] 9 After this manner therefore
   pray ye [having pointed out the errors which then characterized prayer,
   Jesus proceeds to give a brief outline as a model in matter,
   arrangement, and expression]: Our Father who art in heaven. [The common
   Jewish invocation was, "O Lord God of our fathers." Jesus, as the
   brother of man, introduced this new and precious invocation, which puts
   us in prayer's proper attitude], Hallowed be thy name. 10 Thy kingdom
   come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. [This is the first
   section of the prayer.] 11 Give us this day our daily bread. [So long
   as it is "this day" we do not need to-morrow's bread.] 12 And forgive
   us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. [God can not
   forgive the temper that is unforgiving, for it can only exist in a
   heart blind as to the amount of its debt. Forgiveness, too, must be a
   completed act before we begin to pray. Our Lord lays stress on this one
   point in the prayer, returning to it after he had closed the form, that
   he may assure us that the divine procedure will, in this respect, be
   fashioned to our own. Debt is a mild word for our sin, and is broader
   than trespass. Trespass indicates a misstep, a wrong-doing, but debt an
   unfulfilled obligation of any kind. We must not be hard in exacting our
   rights, when to do so would be oppressive.] 13 And bring us not into
   temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. [This petition, to be
   effective, must be followed by an earnest effort on our part to fulfill
   it. We prefer to read "the evil," rather than "the evil one," for the
   neuter is more comprehensive (II. Tim. iv. 18), and includes
   deliverance from the evil thoughts of man's own heart, and from evils
   from without as well as temptations of Satan. As to the prayer
   generally, we note the following: It is divided into two sections, and
   each section is subdivided into three heads. Of these the first three
   are invocations for the glory of God; thus: 1. That God may be
   glorified in his name, so that it shall be universally reverenced; 2.
   That God may be glorified in his kingdom--that kingdom before which
   every power of evil shall eventually fall; 3. That God may be glorified
   in the hearts of humanity by all men becoming obedient unto his will.
   These petitions come first, for it is of first importance to us that
   God should be honored in his person, in his authority and in his
   desires. The three petitions represent three stages of spiritual growth
   in the communion and fellowship with God. We first know and revere his
   name as God. From that we advance to the full recognition of his royal
   and divine authority. And from this in turn we again advance until we
   know him fully as Father, and, forgetting his authority, perform his
   wishes through the joyous constraint of love, as do the angels in
   heaven. The second three petitions are for humanity; thus: 1. For their
   bodies, that they may have sustenance. It is not a petition for milk
   and honey, symbols of luxury, but for bread, life's staff and
   necessity, and for bread in moderation--bestowed day by day, like the
   manna. 2. For their souls in things concerning the past--that past
   trespasses may be forgiven. This is the one thing needful to the soul
   in regard to the past. Since a certain soul condition is necessary
   (viz.: the spirit of forgiveness), as a condition precedent to
   obtaining this petition, that condition is plainly stated in the
   petition itself. 3. For their souls as to the future, that they may be
   enabled to avoid temptation, and that they may be finally delivered
   from evil. God does not tempt us (Jas. i. 13), but he can permit us to
   be led into temptation, or he can shield us from it, only permitting us
   to enter so far into it as to come off victorious over it (I. Cor. x.
   13; II. Pet. ii. 9); so that it shall prove unto us a blessing instead
   of a curse--Jas. i. 12; v. 11.] 14 For if ye forgive men their
   trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if ye
   forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
   trespasses. [Forgiveness may be difficult, but it is essential: we
   should realize that as we pray. Jesus presents this truth positively
   and negatively, that we may make no mistake about it. Those who are
   accustomed to repeat the Lord's Prayer will notice that the doxology
   with which it closes is omitted. It was probably inserted from some
   early liturgy. It is absent from the oldest manuscripts, and interrupts
   the connection of the thought about forgiveness. All textual editors
   omit it.] 16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
   countenance: for they disfigure their faces. [by omitting to wash their
   faces and neglecting to dress or anoint their beards], that they may
   appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received
   their reward. 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and
   wash thy face; 18 that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy
   Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall
   recompense thee. [Fasting, as an aid to meditation and prayer, is a
   wholesome practice, but stated fasts lead to hollow formality, and
   fasts which are endured for public praise are an abomination. Christ
   admonishes us to conceal the fast, and so avoid the temptation to be
   hypocritically ostentatious, for fasting is intended for
   self-abasement, and not to cultivate pride. His words allude to the
   practice of anointing. Rich Jews were accustomed to anoint their bodies
   daily with olive or sweet oil. This was refreshing, and prevented many
   of the disease which the dry, hot air of Palestine made prevalent. The
   custom still prevails among Eastern nations.]

Security of Heavenly Treasures Contrasted

With Earthly Anxieties.

^A Matt. VI. 19-34.

   ^a 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth
   and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal. [In our
   Lord's time banks, such as we have, were unknown, and in order to keep
   money its possessor frequently buried it, thus subjecting it to rust
   and corrosion. The havoc caused by moths is too familiar to need
   comment (Jas. v. 2). Costly and ornamental apparel was reckoned among a
   man's chief treasures in olden times. See Josh. vii. 21; II. Kings v.
   5; Luke xvi. 19. Oriental houses were frequently made of loose stone or
   sun-dried bricks, so that the thief found it easier to enter by digging
   through the wall than by opening the barred door. A too literal
   compliance with this negative precept would discourage thrift. The
   precept is not intended to discourage the possession of property in
   moderation, but it forbids us to hoard for selfish purposes, or to look
   upon our possessions as permanent and abiding. The lives of many men of
   our day seem to be employed to no other purpose than that of amassing
   an abundance of earthly treasure. But no true Christian can envy them,
   or follow their example]: 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in
   heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do
   not break through nor steal [As the impossibility of hoarding earthly
   treasures is in the preceding verse urged as a reason against it, so in
   this verse the possibility of amassing perpetual possessions in heaven
   is set forth as the reason why we should do it. Thus the striking
   contrast between the two kinds of treasures is brought to our notice,
   so that it is the height of folly not to make a proper choice between
   them]: 21 for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.
   [Having contrasted the two treasures, Jesus here suggests the contrast
   between the two places where they are stored up. Since the heart
   follows the treasure, that it may dwell with the object of its love, we
   should place our treasures in heaven, even if the treasures there were
   no better than the treasures on earth; for it is better that our hearts
   should abide in the city of God than on this sinful earth.] 22 The lamp
   of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
   body shall be full of light. 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole
   body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee
   be darkness, how great is the darkness! [In these two verses there is a
   brief allegory, the meaning of which is to be ascertained from the
   context. The subject under consideration is the propriety of laying up
   treasures, not on earth, but in heaven, and the effect which treasures
   have upon the heart. Now, the heart or affection is to the soul much
   the same as the eye is to the body. If we do not set our affections
   upon spiritual things, the time quickly comes when we can not see them
   (I. Cor. ii. 14; John iii. 19-21). Jesus therefore represents our
   affections as if they were an eye. If the eye is single--i. e., if it
   sees nothing with a double or confused vision--then the man receives
   through it clear views of the outside world, and his inner man is, so
   to speak, full of light. But if his eye is diseased or blinded, then
   his inner man is likewise darkened. Applying the allegory to the
   spiritual man, if his heart is single in its love toward God and the
   things of God, then he has clear views as to the relative importance
   and value of things temporal and eternal, things earthly and things
   heavenly. But if the heart looks with a double interest upon both
   earthly and heavenly treasure, it makes the man double-minded (Jas. i.
   6-8), and so spoils his life. God does not permit a double affection
   any more than he does a double service, and a man who seeks to continue
   in it will soon be visited with great darkness as to the things of God,
   and will become blind in heart and conscience--Rom. i. 21-25 .] 24 No
   man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love
   the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye
   cannot serve God and mammon. [Mammon was a common Chaldee word used in
   the East to express material riches. It is here personified as a kind
   of god of this world. Jesus here assumes that we are framed to serve
   (Gen. ii. 15); and hence that we must choose our master, for it is
   impossible to serve two masters whose interests are different and
   conflicting. They conflict here, for it is mammon's interest to be
   hoarded and loved, but it is God's interest that mammon be distributed
   to the needy and be lightly esteemed. God claims our supreme love and
   our undivided service.] 25 Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for
   your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your
   body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the
   body than the raiment? [The word "anxious" is derived from a word which
   indicates a state of doubt or double-mindedness. It therefore indicates
   that sense of suspense or worry which comes from a mind in doubt.
   Compare Luke xii. 29. Hence we may say that Jesus is here continuing
   the contrasts of the preceding verses, and that, having warned against
   a double vision and a double service, he now warns against a double
   mind as to the comparative value of the benefits to be derived from the
   service of God or the service of mammom. Mammon can only supply food,
   but God gives the life; mammon can only furnish clothing, but God gives
   the body. By single-mindedness we can find peace, for God is to be
   relied upon. By double-mindedness we fall to worrying, for mammon may
   fail to supply those things which we feel we need.] 26 Behold the birds
   of the heaven they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
   barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more
   value then they? [Literally, do ye not greatly excel them. The birds do
   not serve mammon at all, yet God feeds them. Surely, then, man who
   excels the birds both in his intrinsic value and in his capacity for
   temporal and eternal service, can expect to receive from God his
   sufficient food.] 27 And which of you by being anxious can add one
   cubit unto the measure of his life? [Peace and trust characterize the
   service of God. The rewards of mammon, on the contrary, are won by
   anxiety. But the rewards of mammon can not lengthen life as can God.
   Therefore we should not hesitate to choose God's service.] 28 And why
   are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
   how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 yet I say unto
   you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
   these. [The magnificence of Solomon and of his court is proverbial in
   the East unto this day. To the Jew he was the highest representative of
   earthly grandeur, yet he was surpassed by the common lily of the field.
   Which lily is here meant can not be determined. Calcott thinks it was
   the fragrant white lily which grows profusely all over Palestine. Smith
   favors the scarlet martagon; Tristam, the anemone coronaria; and
   Thomson, the Huleh lily, a species of iris. It is likely, however, that
   scholars are trying to draw distinctions where Jesus himself drew none.
   It is highly probable that in popular speech many of the common spring
   flowers were loosely classes together under the name lily.] 30 But if
   God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and
   to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O
   ye of little faith? ["This is the only term of reproach Jesus applied
   to his disciples" (Bengel). As to the grass and oven we may say that
   the forests of Palestine had been cleared off centuries earlier, and
   the people were accustomed to use the dried grass, mingled with wild
   flowers and weeds, for fuel. The oven was a large, round pot of
   earthenware, or other material, two or three feet high, and narrowing
   toward the top. This was first heated by fire within, after which the
   fire was raked out, and the dough put inside. Such is still the
   universal practice.] 31 Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we
   eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
   [God's care for the grass which lasts but for a day should teach us to
   expect that he will show more interest in providing for those who have
   been fashioned for eternity.] 32 For after all these things do the
   Gentiles seek. [Christians having a heavenly Father to supply their
   wants, should not live like the Gentiles, who have no consciousness of
   such a Father. Of what use is all our religious knowledge if we are
   still as careworn and distrustful as the benighted heathen?]; for your
   heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. [Here is
   the panacea for anxiety. Being God, the Supreme One knows; being a
   Father, he feels. Many repose with confidence upon the regularity and
   beneficence of his providential laws; but far sweeter is that assurance
   which arises from a sense of God's personal interest in our individual
   welfare--an interest manifested by the gift of his Son.] 33 But seek ye
   first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be
   added unto you. [The kingdom of heaven is the real object of our
   search. It must be sought first both in point of time and of interest,
   and it must be kept ever first in our thoughts after it is found. That
   Christian faith and obedience leads to worldly prosperity is proved by
   countless instances which are multiplied with each succeeding day. The
   security of Christ's kingdom leads to that cheerfulness which renews
   the strength, and to that undistracted industry which brings success.]
   34 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be
   anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. [Each
   day has trouble enough without adding to it by borrowing somewhat from
   the morrow. Serve God to-day with the strength you used to expend in
   carrying troubles which you borrowed from the future, and God will
   order the affairs of to-morrow.]

Law Concerning Judging.

^A Matt. VII. 1-6; ^C Luke VI. 37-42.

   ^a 1 Judge not, that ye be not judged. ^c 37 And judge not, and ye
   shall not be judged [Here again Jesus lays down a general principle in
   the form of universal prohibition. The principle is, of course, to be
   limited by other Scriptural laws concerning judgment. It does not
   prohibit: 1. Judgment by civil courts, which is apostolically approved
   (II. Pet. ii. 13-15; Heb. xiii. 17; Tit. iii. 1). 2. Judgment of the
   church on those who walk disorderly; for this also was ordered by
   Christ and his apostles (Matt. xviii. 16, 17; Tit. iii. 10; II. Thess.
   iii. 6, 14; II. John 10; I. Tim. i. 20; vi. 5). 3. Private judgment as
   to wrong-doers. This is also ordered by Christ and his apostles (Matt.
   vii. 15, 16; Rom. xvi. 17; I. John iv. 1; I. Cor. v. 11). The
   commandment is leveled at rash, censorious and uncharitable judgments,
   and the fault-finding spirit or disposition which condemns upon surmise
   without examination of the charges, forgetful that we also shall stand
   in the judgment and shall need mercy (Rom. xiv. 10; Jas. ii. 13). Our
   judgment of Christians must be charitable, (John vii. 24; I. Cor. xiii.
   5, 6) in remembrance of the fact that they are God's servants (Rom.
   xiv. 4); and that he reserves to himself the ultimate right of judging
   both them and us--Rom. xiv. 4; I. Cor. iv. 3, 4; II. Cor. v. 10]: ^a 2
   For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
   measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you. ^c and condemn not, and
   ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released [Though
   God shall judge us with absolute justice, yet justice often requires
   that we receive even in the same measure in which we have given it, so
   in a sense the merciful receive mercy, and the censorious receive
   censure (Jas. ii. 12, 13). But from men we receive judgment in the
   measure in which we give it. Applying the teaching here given locally,
   we find that Jesus, having condemned the Pharisees in their manner of
   praying, now turns to reprove them for their manner of judging. Their
   censorious judgments of Christ himself darken many pages of the gospel.
   But with a bitter spirit they condemned as sinners beyond the pale of
   mercy whole classes of their countrymen, such as publicans, Samaritans,
   and the like, besides their wholesale rejection of all heathen. These
   bitter judgments swiftly returned upon the heads of the judges and
   caused the victorious Roman to wipe out the Jewish leaders without
   mercy. It is a great moral principle of God's government that we reap
   as we sow. Censorious judgment and its harvest are merely one form of
   culture which comes under this general law]: 38 give, and it shall be
   given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running
   over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it
   shall be measured to you again. [This is not necessarily a promise of
   the return of our gift in kind. It rather means that we shall receive
   an equivalent in joy and in that blessedness which Jesus meant when he
   said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." The figurative
   language is borrowed from the market where the salesman, grateful for
   past kindnesses, endeavors, by pressing, shaking, and piling up, to put
   more grain into the measure for us than it will contain. Pockets were
   unknown to the ancients, and what they wished to take with them was
   carried in the fold in the bosom of the coat, the girdle below holding
   it up. Ruth bore this a heavy burden in her mantle which, in the King
   James Version is mistakenly called the veil-- Ruth iii. 15.] 39 And he
   spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall
   they not both fall into a pit? [Whoso lacks the knowledge of divine
   truth can not so lead others that they shall find it. They shall both
   fall into the pitfalls of moral error and confusion.] 40 The disciple
   is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be
   as his teacher. [Pupils do not surpass their teachers, or, if they do,
   they are self-taught, and hence do not owe to their teachers that
   wherein they rise superior to them. All that the scholar can hope from
   his teacher is that when he is perfectly instructed he shall be as his
   teacher. But if the teacher is a blind man floundering in a ditch, he
   affords but a dismal prospect for his pupils. The perfection of such
   teaching is certainly not desirable.] ^a 3 And why beholdest thou the
   mote [chip or speck of wood dust] that is in thy brother's eye, but
   considerest not the beam [heavy house timber] that is in thine own eye?
   4 Or how wilt { ^c canst} thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast
   out the mote ^a out of thine eye; ^c that is in thine eye, when thou
   thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? { ^a and lo,
   the beam is in thine own eye?} 5 Thou hypocrite, cast out first the
   beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out
   the mote out of thy brother's eye. ^c that is in thy brother's eye. [In
   Matthew and Luke Jesus gives slightly varying applications to this
   allegorical passage by setting it in different connections. In Luke, as
   we see, he places it after the words which describe the disastrous
   effect of being blind leaders of the blind. It therefore signifies in
   this connection that we ourselves should first see if we would teach
   others to see. In Matthew he places it after the words about censorious
   judgment, where it means that we must judge ourselves before we can be
   fit judges of others. The thought is practically the same, for there is
   little difference between correcting others as their teachers or as
   their self-appointed judges. Jesus graphically and grotesquely
   represents a man with a log, or rafter, in his eye trying to take a
   chip or splinter out of his neighbor's eye. Both parties have the same
   trouble or fault, but the one having the greater seeks to correct the
   one having the less. The application is that he who would successfully
   teach or admonish must first be instructed or admonished himself (Gal.
   vi. 1). In moral movements men can not be pushed; they must be led.
   Hence those who would teach must lead the way. Those who have reformed
   their own faults can "see clearly" how to help others. But so long as
   we continue in sin, we are blind leaders of the blind.] ^a 6 Give not
   that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the
   swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend
   you. [The connection here is not obvious. This saying, however, appears
   to be a limitation of the law against judging. The Christian must not
   be censoriously judicial, but he should be discriminatingly judicious.
   He must know dogs and swine when he sees them, and must not treat them
   as priests and kings, the fit objects for the bestowal of holy food and
   goodly ornaments. Dogs and swine were unclean animals. The former were
   usually undomesticated and were often fierce. In the East they are
   still the self-appointed scavengers of the street. The latter were
   undomesticated among the Jews, and hence are spoken of as wild and
   liable to attack man. Meats connected with the sacrificial service of
   the altar were holy. Even unclean men were not permitted to eat of
   them, much less unclean brutes. What was left after the priests and
   clean persons had eaten was to be burned with fire (Lev. vi. 24-30;
   vii. 15-21). To give holy things to dogs was to profane them. We are
   here forbidden, then, to use any religious office, work, or ordinance,
   in such a manner as to degrade or profane it. Saloons ought not to be
   opened with prayer, nor ought adulterous marriages to be performed by a
   man of God. To give pearls to swine is to press the claims of the
   gospel upon those who despise it until they persecute you for annoying
   them with it. When such men are known, they are to be avoided. Jesus
   acted on this principle in refusing to answer the Pharisees, and the
   apostles did the same in turning to the Gentiles when their Jewish
   hearers would begin to contradict and blaspheme. Compare Matt. xv. 2,
   3; xxi. 23-27; Acts xiii. 46; xix. 9.]

Concerning Prayer.

^A Matt. VII. 7-11.

   ^a 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
   and it shall be opened unto you [The words here are slightly
   climacteric. Asking is a simple use of voice, seeking is a motion of
   the body, and knocking is an effort to open and pass through
   obstacles]: 8 for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
   findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. [Jesus here uses
   the universal "every one," but he means every one of a class, for the
   term is modified by the prescribed conditions of acceptable prayer
   (Matt. vi. 14, 15; Jas. i. 6, 7; iv. 3; I. John v. 14). We see also by
   the next verse that it means every one who is recognized by God as a
   son. All God's children who pray rightly are heard.] 9 Or what man is
   there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a
   stone; 10 or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent? [Fish
   and bread were the common food of the peasants of Galilee. A stone
   might resemble a cake, but if given it would deceive the child. A
   serpent might resemble an eel or a perch, but if given it would be both
   deceptive and injurious. We often misunderstand God's answer thus. But
   our sense of sonship should teach us better.] 11 If ye then, being
   evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
   shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask
   him? [Here is an argument from analogy. It is assumed that the paternal
   feeling which prompts us to give good things to our children, is still
   a higher degree in God with reference to his children; and hence it is
   argued that he will much more give good things to those who ask him.
   Since it is Jesus who assumes the likeness on which the argument rests,
   we may rely on the correctness of the reasoning; but we must be
   cautious how we derive arguments of our own from the analogy between
   God's attributes and the corresponding characteristics of man. For
   example, this attribute of paternal feeling has been employed to
   disprove the reality of the eternal punishment with which God himself
   threatens the sinner, because the paternal feeling in man would prevent
   him from so punishing his own children. The fallacy in the argument
   consists in assuming that the feeling in question must work the same
   results in every particular in God that it does in man. But Revelation
   teaches that such is not the case.]

The Golden Rule.

^A Matt. VII. 12; ^C Luke VI. 31.

   ^a 12 All things therefore whatsoever ye would { ^c 31 and as ye would}
   that men should do to { ^a unto} you, even so do ye also unto { ^c to}
   them likewise. ^a for this is the law and the prophets. [Jesus connects
   the Golden Rule with what precedes with the word "therefore." We are to
   practice the Golden Rule because God's divine judgment teaches
   forbearance, and his goodness teaches kindness. This precept is fitly
   called the Golden Rule, for it embraces in its few words the underlying
   and governing principle of all morality. It contains all the precepts
   of the law with regard to man, and all the amplifications of those
   precepts given by the prophets. It teaches us to put ourselves in our
   neighbor's place, and direct our conduct accordingly. It assumes, of
   course, that when we put ourselves in our neighbor's place, we are wise
   enough not to make any foolish wishes, and good enough not to make any
   evil ones. The great sages Socrates, Buddha, Confucius and Hillel each
   groped after this truth, but they stated it thus: "Do not do to others
   what you would not have done to you;" thus making it a rule of not
   doing rather than of doing. But the striking difference between these
   teachers and Christ lies not in the statements so much as in the
   exemplification. Jesus lived the Golden Rule in his conduct toward men,
   and maintained perfect righteousness before God in addition thereto.]

The Two Ways and the False Prophets.

^A Matt. VII. 13-23; ^C Luke VI.. 43-45.

   ^a 13 Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
   is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many are they that enter
   in thereby. 14 For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that
   leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it. [The Master here
   presents two cities before us. One has a wide gateway opening onto the
   broad street, and other a narrow gate opening onto a straitened street
   or alley. The first city is Destruction, the second is Life.] 15 Beware
   of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
   are ravening wolves. [From the two ways Jesus turns to warn his
   disciples against those who lead into the wrong path--the road to
   destruction. Prophets are those who lay claim to teach men correctly
   the life which God would have us live. The scribes and Pharisees were
   such, and Christ predicted the coming of others (Matt. xxiv. 5, 24),
   and so did Paul (Acts xx. 29). Their fate is shown in verses 21 and 22.
   By sheep's clothing we are to understand that they shall bear a gentle,
   meek, and inoffensive outward demeanor; but they use this demeanor as a
   cloak to hide their real wickedness, and so effectually does it hide it
   that the false prophets often deceive even themselves.] 16 By their
   fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
   thistles? 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the
   corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. ^c 43 For there is no good tree
   that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that
   bringeth forth good fruit. ^a 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil
   fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ^c 44 For
   each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather
   figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. ^a 19 Every tree that
   bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. [It
   is a law of universal application that whatever is useless and evil
   shall eventually be swept away.] 20 Therefore by their fruits ye shall
   know them. ^c 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart
   bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil
   treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of
   the heart his mouth speaketh. [Teachers are to be judged by their
   conduct as men, and also by the effect of their teaching. If either be
   predominantly bad, the man must be avoided. But we must not judge
   hastily, nor by slight and trivial actions, for some specimens of bad
   fruit grown on good trees.] ^a 21 Not every one that saith unto me,
   Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
   the will of my Father who is in heaven. [To say, "Lord, Lord," is to
   call on the Lord in prayer. While it is almost impossible to
   overestimate the value of prayer when associated with a consistent
   life, it has been too common to attribute to it a virtue which it does
   not possess. The Pharisees were excessively devoted to prayer, and they
   led the people to believe that every prayerful man would be saved. The
   Mohammedans and Romanists are subject to the same delusion, as may be
   seen in their punctilious observance of the forms of prayer, while
   habitually neglecting many of the common rules of morality. It is here
   taught that prayer, unattended by doing the will of the Father in
   heaven, can not save us. Doing the will of God must be understood, not
   in the sense of sinless obedience, but as including a compliance with
   the conditions on which sins are forgiven. Whether under the old
   covenant or the new, sinless obedience is an impossibility; but
   obedience to the extent of our possibility amid the weaknesses of the
   flesh, accompanied by daily compliance with the conditions of pardon
   for our daily sin, has ever secured the favor of God.] 22 Many will say
   to me in that day [the final judgment day], Lord, Lord, did we not
   prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name
   do many mighty works? [Jesus here prophetically forecasts those future
   times wherein it would be worth while to assume to be a Christian.
   Times when hypocrisy would find it a source of profit and of honor to
   be attached to Christ's service. In these days we may well question the
   motives which induce us to serve Christ. High place in the visible
   kingdom is no proof of one's acceptance with God. Neither are mighty
   works, though successfully wrought in his name. Judas was an apostle
   and miracle-worker, and Balaam was a prophet, yet they lacked that
   condition of the heart which truly allies one with God (I. Cor. xiii.
   1-3). Jesus says the number of false teachers is large. We must not
   carelessly ignore the assertion of that important fact. We should also
   note that Christ will not lightly pass over their errors on the
   judgment day, though they seem to have discovered them for the first
   time. Such truths should make us extremely cautious both as teachers
   and learners.] 23 And then will I profess [better, confess] unto them,
   I never knew you [never approved or recognized you]: depart from me [
   Matt. xxv. 41], ye that work iniquity. [This indicates that false
   teachers filled with a patronizing spirit toward the Lord, and with a
   sense of power as to his work, will be deceived by a show of success.
   Through life Christ appeared to them to be accepting them and approving
   their lives, but he now confesses that this appearance was not real. It
   arose from a misconception on their part and on that of others. Many
   works which men judge to be religious really undermine religion. The
   world esteems him great whose ministry begets Pharisees, but in
   Christ's eyes such a one is a worker of iniquity.]

Conclusion and Application: Two Builders.

^A Matt. VII. 24-29; ^C Luke VI. 46-49.

   ^c 46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
   say? [Why do ye give me the title, but withhold the service which
   should go with it?--Mal. i. 6 .] ^a 24 Every one therefore that ^c
   cometh unto me, and heareth my words { ^a these words of mine,} and
   doeth them [John xiii. 17; Jas. i. 22], ^c I will show you whom he is
   like: 48 he is like { ^a shall be likened unto} ^c a man building a
   house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock:
   ^a a wise man who built his house upon the rock [The word "rock"
   suggests Christ himself. No life can be founded upon Christ's teaching
   unless it be founded also upon faith and trust in his personality. For
   this we must dig deep, for as St. Gregory says, "God is not to be found
   on the surface"]: 25 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and
   the winds blew, and beat upon that house; ^c and when a flood arose,
   the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: ^a and it
   fell not: ^c because it had been well builded. ^a for it was founded
   upon the rock. [The imagery of this passage would be impressive
   anywhere, but is especially so when used before an audience accustomed
   to the fierceness of an Eastern tempest. Rains, floods, etc., represent
   collectively the trials, the temptations and persecutions which come
   upon us from without. There comes a time to every life when these
   things throng together and test the resources of our strength.] 26 And
   every one { ^c 49 But he} ^a that heareth these words of mine, and
   doeth them not shall be likened unto { ^c is like} ^a a foolish man,
   who { ^c that} built a { ^a his} house upon the sand: { ^c earth}
   without a foundation; ^a 27 and the rain descended, and the floods
   came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; { ^c against which
   the stream brake,} and straightway it fell in; ^a and great was the
   fall thereof. ^c and the ruin of that house was great. [We do not need
   to go to Palestine to witness the picture portrayed here. Whole towns
   on the Missouri and the lower Mississippi have been undermined and
   swept away because built upon the sand. Jesus here limits the tragedy
   to a single house. "A single soul is a great ruin in the eyes of God"
   (Godet). Jesus did not end his sermon with a strain of consolation. It
   is not always best to do so.] ^a 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had
   finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
   29 for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their
   scribes. [See page 166.]

Healing the Centurion's Servant.

(at Capernaum.)

^A Matt. VIII. 1, 5-13; ^C Luke VII. 1-10.

   ^c 1 After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, ^a 1
   And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
   him. ^c he entered into Capernaum. [Jesus proceeded from the mountain
   to Capernaum, which was now his home, or headquarters. The multitudes
   which are now mentioned for the third time were not wearied by his
   sermon, and so continued to follow him. Their presence showed the
   popularity of Jesus, and also emphasized the fact that the miracles
   which followed the sermon were wrought in the presence of the vast
   throngs of people.] ^a 5 And when he was entered into Capernaum, there
   came unto him a centurion [The context shows that this centurion or
   captain of a hundred men was a Gentile, but whether he was in the
   employ of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, or an officer in the
   Roman army, is not clear, neither is very important. The army of
   Antipas, like that of other petty kings, was modeled after that of
   Rome], ^c 2 And a certain centurion's servant [slave boy], who was dear
   unto him, was sick, and at the point of death. 3 And when he heard
   concerning Jesus [The sequel shows that the centurion had probably
   heard how Jesus had healed the son of his fellow-townsman--John iv.
   46-54], he sent unto him elders of the Jews [To reconcile Matthew and
   Luke, we have only to conceive of the centurion as coming to the edge
   of the crowd about Jesus, but modestly refraining from coming into the
   Lord's immediate presence.] asking him that he would come and save his
   servant. ^a beseeching him, 6 and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the
   house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. [Because palsy is not
   usually accompanied with suffering, some think that in this case it was
   combined with tetanus or lockjaw, a combination not infrequent in hot
   climates. But Sir R. Bennet, M.D., speaks thus: "In this instance we
   have probably a case of progressive paralysis, attended by muscular
   spasms, and involving the respiratory movements, where death is
   manifestly imminent and inevitable. In such a case there would be
   symptoms indicative of great distress, as well as immediate danger to
   life." As to palsy generally, see pp. 175, 183.] ^c 4 And they, when
   they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that
   thou shouldest do this for him; 5 for he loveth our nation, and himself
   built us our synagogue. [The centurion evidently believed in and
   worshiped God, but, influenced probably by his profession, did not
   become a proselyte by being circumcised and conforming entirely to the
   Mosaic law. He was what later Jews would have termed a Proselyte at the
   Gate, and not a full-fledged Proselyte of Righteousness. The ruins of
   Capernaum show the ruins of a synagogue. It was a beautiful structure,
   built of white limestone, shows by its architectural features that it
   was built in the time of the Herods, and there is little doubt that it
   is the one which this pious Gentile erected, and in which Jesus taught
   and healed.] ^a 7 And he saith to him [i. e., answering him as
   represented by his friends], I will come and heal him. ^c 6 And Jesus
   went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the
   centurion sent friends to him, ^a 8 And the centurion answered and
   said, { ^c saying unto him,} Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not
   worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof [not because his house
   was a poor one, for he was evidently well to do]: 7 wherefore neither
   thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: ^a but only say the word,
   and my servant shall be healed. [The centurion, well knowing that it
   was unlawful for Jews to go into the houses of the Gentiles, lest they
   should sully the sanctity which they desired to maintain, wished to
   spare Jesus any embarrassment. Whatever he may have thought of this
   custom with regard to the Pharisees, he attributed to Jesus so high a
   degree of sanctity that he accepted the doctrine as true in reference
   to him. The centurion showed his great faith partly by believing that
   Jesus could heal by a word, but chiefly in his lofty conception of
   Jesus as compared with himself. The less faith we have, the less we
   esteem Jesus, and the more faith we have, the less we esteem ourselves.
   As Jesus rises, we sink in the scale of our estimation. The centurion's
   faith would have been wonderful enough in an Israelite, but it was all
   the more wonderful when found in the bosom of a Gentile. The word
   "found" suggests that Jesus came seeking faith: he will come seeking it
   again (Luke xviii. 8). The elders, little knowing the wideness of our
   Lord's vision and sympathy, supposed that Jesus would look upon the
   splendid synagogue erected for the Jewish people as a sufficient motive
   for granting their request. Even the apostles were slow to learn that
   at heart Jesus knew neither Jew nor Gentile.] ^c 8 For I also am a man
   set under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say unto one,
   Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
   servant [not a soldier, but a household slave], Do this, and he doeth
   it. [Having those over him, he knew how to obey, and having those under
   him, he knew how to be obeyed. He was familiar, therefore, with all the
   principles of obedience. Knowing from the healing of the nobleman's
   son, or from other reports concerning Jesus, that the realm of nature
   obeyed Jesus, he judged from his knowledge of earthly obedience that
   Jesus had those who could come and go for him, and who could carry his
   messages and enforce obedience to them. He felt that the presence of
   Jesus was not at all necessary to the healing.] ^a 10 And when Jesus
   heard it, { ^c these things,} he marvelled at him, and turned and said
   unto ^a them ^c the multitude that followed him, ^a Verily I say unto
   you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. [To some it
   seems strange that Jesus could marvel, but he had all the actual
   feelings of a man. However, we should note that Jesus is never said to
   have marveled but twice. In this case it was because of belief, and in
   the other ( Mark vi. 6), it was because of unbelief. Those who think
   that Jesus gave or gives faith should note this fact. If Jesus had
   given the centurion faith, he could not have been surprised to find
   that he had it; and, if he failed to bestow it upon the people of
   Nazareth, it would have been inconsistent in him to express surprise at
   their lack of it. It would seem, however, irreconcilable with the
   character and affectionate nature of Christ, to bestow faith in such
   profusion upon this Gentile stranger, and withhold every spark of it
   from his near kinsmen and fellow-townsmen. Faith is no miraculous gift.
   Faith means no more nor less than belief; and a man believes the
   Scripture facts in the same manner and by the same processes that he
   believes any other facts.] 11 And I say unto you, that many shall come
   from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac,
   and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven [Jesus here predicts the conversion
   of the Gentiles, since that fact is suggested to him by the faith of
   this centurion. The east and the west represent the extreme points of
   the compass in the directions in which the world was most thickly
   inhabited. But Jesus refers rather to spiritual separation than to
   geographical distances--Mal. i. 11; Isa. xlix. 19; Jer. xvi. 19; Zech.
   viii. 22.] 12 but the sons of the kingdom [The child of anything in
   Hebrew phraseology expressed the idea of special property which one has
   in the thing specified, as, for instance, children of disobedience
   (Eph. ii. 2). Jesus here means, then, the Jews, to whom the kingdom
   belonged by hereditary descent--Rom. ix. 4] shall be cast forth into
   the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of
   teeth. [In this paragraph Christ's kingdom is set forth under the
   simile of a great feast, a familiar simile with Jesus ( Matt. xxvi. 29;
   Luke xxii. 30). The Jews were accustomed to speak of the delights of
   the Messianic kingdom as a feast with the patriarchs (Luke xiv. 15),
   but lost sight of the fact that Gentiles should share in its cheer and
   fellowship ( Isa. xxv. 6). Marriage feasts and other great feasts of
   the Jews were usually held in the evening. Inside, therefore, there
   would be joy and light and gladness, but outside there would be
   darkness and disappointment, tears and bitter self-reproach (Matt. xxv.
   10-13). The despised outcasts should be brought in and placed at the
   festal board, while the long-invited guests--the natural and fleshly
   heirs of Abraham's invitation--would be excluded (Matt. xxi. 43). Hell
   is absence from spiritual light, separation from the company of the
   saved, lamentation and impotent rage.] 13 And Jesus said unto the
   centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.
   And the servant was healed in that hour. [In the moment when Jesus
   spoke, the servant was healed--not relieved, but healed.] ^c 10 And
   they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
   [The centurion, long before this when he was building the synagogue,
   had doubtless heard with delight concerning the wonderful works wrought
   by the mighty prophets in the olden time; he little dreamed that his
   own eyes should see them all surpassed.]

Jesus Raises the Widow's Son.

(at Nain in Galilee.)

^C Luke VII. 11-17.

   ^c 11 And it came to pass soon afterwards [many ancient authorities
   read on the next day], that he went into a city called Nain; and his
   disciples went with him, and a great multitude. [We find that Jesus had
   been thronged with multitudes pretty continuously since the choosing of
   his twelve apostles. Nain lies on the northern slope of the mountain,
   which the Crusaders called Little Hermon, between twenty and
   twenty-five miles south of Capernaum, and about two miles west of
   Endor. At present it is a small place with about a dozen mud hovels,
   but still bears its old name, which the Arabs have modified into Nein.
   It is situated on a bench in the mountain about sixty feet above the
   plain.] 12 Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there
   was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she
   was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. [Places of
   sepulture were outside the towns, that ceremonial pollution must be
   avoided. To this rule there was an exception. The kings of Judah were
   buried in the city of David (II. Kings xvi. 20; xxi. 18, 26). The Jews
   were careful to give public expression to their sympathy for those who
   were bereaved (John xi. 19). The death of an only child represented to
   them as to us the extreme of sorrow (Jer. vi. 26; Zech. xii. 10; Amos
   viii. 10). But in this case the sorrow was heightened by the fact that
   the mother was a widow, and hence evidently dependent upon her son for
   support. Her son had comforted her in her first loss of a husband, but
   now that her son was dead, there was none left to comfort.] 13 And when
   the Lord saw her [Some take this use of the phrase "the Lord," as an
   evidence of the late date at which Luke wrote his Gospel; but the point
   is not well taken, for John used it even before Jesus ascension--John
   xxi. 7], he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. [As the
   funeral procession came out of the gate, they met Jesus with his
   company coming in. Hence there were many witnesses to what followed.
   But the miracle in this instance was not wrought so much attest our
   Lord's commission, or to show his power, as to do good. As Jesus had no
   other business in Nain but to do good, we may well believe that he went
   there for the express purpose of comforting this forlorn mother.
   Compare John xi. 1-15. Good blessings may come to us when reason speaks
   and God's wise judgment answers; but we get our best blessings when our
   afflictions cry unto him and his compassion replies.] 14 And he came
   nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. [The word here
   translated "bier" may mean a bier or coffin, and the authorities are
   about equally divided as to which it was. It was more likely a
   stretcher of boards, with the pallet or bed upon it, and the body of
   the young man wrapped in linen lying upon the bed. Coffins, which were
   common in Babylon and Egypt, were rarely used by the Jews, save in the
   burial of people of distinction; and, if we may trust the writing of
   the later rabbis, the burial of children. When they were used, the body
   was placed in them, and borne without any lid to the place of
   sepulture. We find no coffin in the burial of either Lazarus or Jesus.
   Jesus was, no doubt, known to many in Nain, and it is no wonder that
   those who bore the bier stood still when he touched it. Though we can
   not say that he had raised the dead prior to this, we can say that he
   had healed every kind of disease known among the people, and therefore
   his act would beget a reasonable expectancy that he might do something
   even here.] And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. [Here, as
   in the other instances where Jesus revived the dead, we find that he
   issues a personal call to the party whose remains are before him. It
   suggests the sublime thought that he has as full dominion and authority
   over the unseen as over the seen; and that should he issue a general
   call, all the dead would revive again as obediently and immediately as
   did the single one to whom he now spoke (John v. 28, 29). The command
   of Jesus, moreover, is spoken with the ease and consciousness of
   authority known only to Divinity. Compare the dependent tone of Simon
   Peter--Acts iii. 6.] 15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to
   speak. [Thus showing that not only life, but also health and strength,
   were restored.] And he gave him to his mother. [As the full fruitage of
   his compassion. The scene suggests that Christ will, with his own
   hands, restore kindred to kindred in the glorious morning of
   resurrection.] 16 And fear took hold on all [Because the power of God
   had been so signally manifested among them. They recognized the
   presence of God's power and mercy, yet by no means apprehended the
   nearness of his very person]: and they glorified God, saying, A great
   prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.
   [Expectation of the return of one of the prophets was at that time
   widely spread. See Luke ix. 8, 19. That they should esteem Jesus as no
   more than a prophet was no wonder, for as yet even his apostles had not
   confessed him as the Christ. In state and conduct Jesus appeared to
   them too humble to fulfill the popular ideas of Messiahship. But in
   wisdom and miracle he outshone all God's former messengers. The
   "visiting" of God refers to the long absence of the more strikingly
   miraculous powers of God as exercised through the prophets. None had
   raised the dead since the days of Elisha.] 17 And this report went
   forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round
   about. [This great miracle caused the fame of Jesus to fill all Judæa
   as well as Galilee. It seems, from what next follows, to have reached
   John the Baptist in his prison on the east of the Dead Sea.]

XLV.

The Baptist's Inquiry and Jesus' Discourse Suggested Thereby.

(Galilee.)

^A Matt. XI. 2-30; ^C Luke VII. 18-35.

   ^c 18 And the disciples of John told him of all these things. ^a 2 Now
   when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent by his
   disciples ^c 19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent
   them unto the Lord [John had been cast into prison about December, a.d.
   27, and it was now after the Passover, possibly in May or June, a.d.
   28. Herod Antipas had cast John into prison because John had reproved
   him for taking his brother's wife. According to Josephus, the place of
   John's imprisonment and death was the castle of Machærus (or Makor),
   east of the Dead Sea (Ant. xviii.; v. 1, 2). It was built by Herod the
   Great, and was not very far from that part of the Jordan in which John
   had baptized, so that it is probable that Herod resided in this castle
   when he went to hear John preach. We learn elsewhere that Herod felt
   kindly towards John, and this fact, coupled with the statement that
   John called two of his disciples to him, suggests that John must have
   been held as an honored prisoner with liberties like those accorded
   Paul at Cæsarea-- Acts xxiv. 23], ^a 3 and said unto him, { ^c saying,}
   Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? [The prophets spoke of
   the Messiah as the coming one, and John himself had done
   likewise--Matt. iii. 11.] 20 And when the men were come unto him, they
   said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that
   cometh, or look we for another? [This passage has been a puzzle to
   expositors from the very earliest times. Being unable to understand how
   the Baptist, being an inspired prophet and favored with visions of the
   supernatural, could give way to skeptical doubts, they have exhausted
   their inventive genius to explain what John meant by his question.
   Among these many explanations the best is that given by Alford, viz.:
   that John wished to get Jesus to publicly declare himself for the sake
   of quieting all rumors concerning him, his fault being kindred to that
   of Jesus' mother when she tried to hasten Jesus' hour at the wedding of
   Cana (John ii. 4). But the plain, unmistakable inference of the text is
   that John's faith wavered. The Bible does not represent the saints as
   free from imperfection. It does not say that inspiration is
   omniscience, or that visions and miracles remove doubts. It took two
   miracles to persuade Gideon; Moses harbored distrust (Ex. iii.; iv.),
   and was guilty of unbelief (Num. xx. 12); Elijah despaired of God's
   power (I. Kings xix. 4-10 ); Jeremiah was slow of belief, and in his
   despondency cursed the day of his birth (Jer. xx. 7, 14-18). But the
   most instructive parallel is that of Simon Peter. He witnessed the
   transfiguration of Jesus, beheld the glory of God, and heard the voice
   of the Father (Matt. xvii. 1-6); yet he sank below the Baptist, and
   denied the Lord with cursing; and no man has ever thought it at all
   incredible that he should do so. The trial of John's faith, though not
   so clearly depicted as that of Peter, was perhaps equally searching.
   His wild, free life was now curbed by the irksome tedium of
   confinement. His expectations were not fulfilled. The unfruitful trees
   had not been cut down, the grain had not been winnowed, nor the chaff
   burned, nor should he see any visible tendency toward these results.
   Moreover, he held no communion with the private life of Jesus, and
   entered not into the sanctuary of his Lord's thought. We must remember
   also that his inspiration passed away with the ministry, on account of
   which it was bestowed, and it was only the man John, and not the
   prophet, who made the inquiry. The inquiry itself, too, should be
   noted. It is not, Are you what I declared you to be? but, Being all of
   that, are you the one who should come, or must we look for another?
   John no doubt shared with all Jews the idea that Messiah was to set up
   an earthly kingdom, and seeing in Jesus none of the spirit of such a
   king, he seems to have questioned whether Jesus was to be the finality,
   or whether he was to be, like himself, a forerunner, preparing the way
   for the ultimate Messiah. He did not grasp the thought that Jesus was
   both Alpha and Omega; that Jesus, the lowly servant of humanity, by
   service and sacrifice is evermore preparing the way for Jesus the
   King.] 21 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil
   spirits, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. 22 And he ^a
   Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye
   hear and see: { ^c have seen and heard;} ^a 5 the blind receive their
   sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
   and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings to them.
   [John himself, when thus questioned, had answered plainly, saying, "No"
   (John i. 20, 21), and he probably expected a like categorical answer
   from Jesus. The indirect answer of Jesus, ending with a beatitude, was
   well calculated to waken in John beneficial thoughtfulness, for it
   threw his mind back upon the prophecies of God, such as Isa. xxx. 5, 6;
   xlii. 7; xli. 1-3, etc. It may be inferred that Jesus withheld
   answering the messengers and went on with his works of grace, that
   these might testify to John more potently than mere words of assertion.
   Jesus did not work miracles to gratify skeptical curiosity, but he did
   use them, as here, to strengthen wavering faith (Mark ix. 24; John xi.
   15; xiv. 11); Jesus sums up his work in the form of a climax, wherein
   preaching the gospel to the poor stands superior even to the raising of
   the dead. Attention to the poor has always been a distinctive feature
   of Christianity. To care for the poor is above miracles. Modern
   Orientals are not impressed by the miracles of the New Testament as
   such. The sacred literature of India and China abounds in wonders, and
   with the people of these lands a miracle is little more than a
   commonplace. With them Christ's love for the lowly is above the
   miracles. "Wonders and miracles might be counterfeited, but a sympathy
   with the suffering and helpless, so tender, so laborious, so long
   continued, was not likely to be simulated. Such humanity was unworldly
   and divine"--Beecher.] 6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no
   occasion of stumbling in me. [The scribes had stumbled and failed to
   believe in Jesus because he did not fulfill their ideal, or come up to
   their expectations. Jesus seeks to woo John from a like fate by the
   sweet persuasion of a beatitude. John must realize that it is better
   for the subject to fall in with the plans of the all-wise King, as he
   fulfills the predictions of God the Father, than for the King to turn
   aside and frustrate the plan of the ages to humor the passing whim of a
   despondent and finite mind.] ^c 24 And when the messengers of John were
   departed, { ^a 7 And as these went their way,} ^c he ^a Jesus began to
   say unto the multitudes concerning John [The commendation of Jesus
   which follows was not spoken in the presence of John's messengers. It
   was best that John should not hear it. We also do our work under the
   silent heavens and wait for the future plaudit, "Well done, good and
   faithful servant"], What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a
   reed shaken with the wind? 8 But what went ye out to see? ^c a man
   clothed in soft raiment? ^a Behold, they that wear soft raiment ^c they
   that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings'
   courts. { ^a houses.} [After the departure of John's messengers Jesus
   immediately clears the character of John of unjust suspicion. John, who
   had testified with such confidence as to the office and character of
   Jesus, now comes with a question betraying a doubtful mind and wavering
   faith. Was John then a vacillating man? Was he guilty of that lack of
   steadfastness which the world looks upon as intolerable in all who it
   esteems great? Was he blown about by every wind of public opinion like
   the tall reed (the Arunda donax) which skirts the Jordan, and which
   stands, bearing its beautiful blossoming top twelve feet high one
   moment, only to bow it to earth the next, the slender stem yielding
   submissively to the passing breeze? Was he a voluptuary about to
   condescend to flatter Herod and retract his reproof, that he might
   exchange his prison for a palace? Those who had gone to the wilderness
   to see John had found no such man, and John was still the John of old.
   One act does not make a character, one doubt does not unmake it. John
   was no reed, but was rather, as Lange says, "a cedar half uprooted by
   the storm."] 9 But wherefore went ye out? { ^c 26 But what went ye out
   to see?} ^a to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a
   prophet. [The next verse shows us that John was a messenger as well as
   a prophet. Prophets foretold the Messiah, but John was the herald who
   announce him. John was miraculously born, and was himself the subject
   of prophecy. Great as was John in popular estimation, that estimation
   was insufficient.] 10 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send
   my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
   [This quotation is taken from Mal. iii. 1, where it reads "my messenger
   . . . before me." But Mark (Mark i. 2) concurs with Matthew and Luke in
   the reading given here. From the change in the words it appears "that
   Christ is one with God the Father, and that the coming of Christ is the
   coming of God"--Hammond. ] 11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that
   are born of women there hath not arisen a greater { ^c there is none
   greater} ^a than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the
   kingdom of heaven { ^c of God} is greater than he. [We find from this
   passage that all true greatness arises from association, relation and
   contact with Jesus Christ. To be Christ's forerunner is to be above
   teacher and prophet, Levite and priest, lawgiver and king, and all else
   that the world estimates as great. If all greatness be thus measured by
   contact of Christ, how great must Christ be! But the least in the
   kingdom is greater then John. "This shows: 1. That John was not in the
   kingdom of God. 2. That, as none greater than John has been born of
   women, no one had yet entered the kingdom. 3. That, therefore, it had
   not yet been set up; but as John himself, Jesus, and the Twelve under
   the first commission, preached, was 'at hand'. 4. All in the kingdom,
   even the humble, have a station superior to John's" (Johnson). Farrar
   reminds us of the old legal maxim which says, "The least of the
   greatest is greater than the greatest of the least," which is as much
   as to say that the smallest diamond is of more precious substance than
   the largest flint. The least born of the Holy Spirit (John i. 12, 13
   and iii. 5) is greater than the greatest born of women. They are
   greater in station, privilege and knowledge. The dispensations rise
   like lofty steps, and the lowest that stand upon the New Testament
   dispensation are lifted above the tallest who rest upon the
   dispensation of Moses. This is perhaps prophetically suggested by
   Zechariah--Zech. xii. 8.] ^c 29 And all the people [the common peopple,
   and not the rulers] when they heard, and the publicans, justified God,
   being baptized with the baptism of John. [They justified or approved
   the wisdom of God in sending such a prophet as John and establishing
   such an ordinance as baptism.] 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers
   rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.
   [The counsel of God was that the nation should be brought to repentance
   by John, that it might be saved by Jesus; but the Pharisees frustrated
   this plan so far as they were concerned, by their proud refusal to
   repent. All who followed their example shared their unhappy success. It
   is noteworthy that Jesus emphasizes baptism as the test as to whether
   men justify or reject God's counsel.] ^a 12 From the days of John the
   Baptist until now [a period of about three years] the kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force. [Jesus here
   pictures the kingdom of heaven as a besieged city. The city is shut up,
   but the enemies which surround it storm its walls and try to force an
   entrance--an apt illustration which many fail to comprehend. The gates
   of Christ's kingdom were not opened until the day of Pentecost (Acts
   ii.), but men hearing it was about to be opened sought to enter
   prematurely, not by the gates which God would open when Simon Peter
   used the keys (Matt. xvi. 19), but by such breaches as they themselves
   sought to make in the walls. Examples of this violence will be seen in
   the following instances (John vi. 15; Matt. xx. 21; Luke xix. 11,
   36-38; xxii. 24-30; Acts i. 6.) The people were full of preconceived
   ideas with regard to the kingdom, and each one sought to hasten and
   enjoy its pleasures as one who impatiently seizes upon a bud and seeks
   with his fingers to force it to bloom. The context shows that John the
   Baptist was even then seeking to force the kingdom.] 13 For all the
   prophets and the law prophesied until John. 14 And if ye are willing
   receive it, this is Elijah, that is to come. 15 He that hath ears to
   hear, let him hear. [The Old Testament was the work of a long series of
   prophets, and this series was closed by John the Baptist. But John
   differed from all the others in the series; for they prophesied
   concerning the kingdom, while John turned from their course to preach
   that the kingdom was at hand, and thereby incidentally brought upon it
   the assaults of violence. As to John the Baptist being the prophetic
   Elijah, see p. 102.] 16 But whereunto ^c then shall I liken the men of
   this generation, and to what are they like? 32 They are { ^a It is}
   like unto children sitting { ^c that sit} in the marketplace { ^a
   marketplace} ^c and ^a who call ^c one to another; ^a unto their
   fellows 17 and ^c who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we
   wailed, and ye did not weep. { ^a mourn}. ^c 33 For John the Baptist is
   come { ^a came} neither eating nor drinking, { ^c eating no bread nor
   drinking wine;} and ye { ^a they} say, He hath a demon. 19 The Son of
   man came { ^c is come} eating and drinking; and ye { ^a they} say,
   Behold a man gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
   sinners! And wisdom is justified ^c of all her children. ^a by her
   works. [Oriental market-places were open squares where men transacted
   business and where children held their sports. Jesus here pictures two
   groups of little ones, one of which wishes to play, the other of which
   is sullen and intractable. The mirthful group first seeks to play a
   wedding game. They pipe and dance, but the sullen group sits unmoved.
   Not disheartened by failure to succeed, the mirthful ones try their
   hand again and hope for better luck by playing funeral. But this also
   fails, causing them to lift up their voices in questioning
   remonstrance. Singular enough, the authorities are about equally
   divided as to what parties this picture represents. Some say that the
   dancers and mourners are the Jewish rulers, and that Jesus and John
   refused to comply with their wishes. The grammatical construction
   rather favors this view, if we say that "men of this generation" are
   "like children who call." But such grammatical constructions are not
   reliable in interpreting Oriental imagery. Jesus means that the men of
   this generation are like the entire picture presented and does not
   intend that they shall be taken as the subjects of the leading verbs of
   the sentence. A parallel instance will be found in Matt. xiii. 24-43.
   In the twenty-fourth verse Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is
   likened unto a man who sowed good seed," but in the thirty-seventh
   verse he says "He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man," thus
   making the kingdom of heaven like the entire parabolic picture, and not
   the mere subject of its leading verb. Others say that John came
   mourning and Jesus came piping, and that the Jews were satisfied with
   neither. This was the older view, and had not expositors been confused
   by the grammatical difficulties above mentioned, it would never have
   been questioned. For the context favors it, and the whole trend of
   Scripture demands it. It was God in his messengers--his prophets and
   his Son--who came to set the world right. It was these messengers who
   took the initiative and who demanded the changes. It was the people who
   sulked and refused to comply with the divine overtures. The whole tenor
   of Christ's teaching--the parables of the supper, etc.--represents the
   Jews as being invited and refusing the invitation. It was John and
   Jesus who preached repentance, but there was no instance where any
   called on them to repent. Jerusalem never wept over an intractable
   Jesus, but Jesus wept over the people of Jerusalem because they "would
   not." Jesus and John each besought the people to prepare for the
   kingdom of God, but the people sneered at one as too strict and at the
   other as too lenient, and would be won by neither. To justify them in
   rejecting God's counsel, they asserted that John's conduct was
   demoniacal and that of Jesus was criminal, thus slandering each. But
   the lives or works of Jesus and John were both directed by the wisdom
   of God, and all those who were truly wise towards God--children of
   wisdom (see Luke, verse 29, above)--justified or approved of God's
   course in sending such messengers. We should observe that with all the
   cares of his great mission upon him, the great heart of our Lord took
   note of the sports of children.] 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities
   wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
   [That is to say, those cities which were especially favored. It does
   not mean that more miracles were worked in them than in all the other
   cities; but that more were done in each of these than in any other.] 21
   Woe [rather, "Alas for thee!" an exclamation of pity more than anger]
   unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works,
   had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have
   repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. [Jerome says that Chorazin
   was two, and Eusebius (probably through the error of his transcriber)
   says it was twelve miles from Capernaum. Its site is identified by the
   Exploration Fund with the modern Kerazeh, at the northwest end of the
   lake, two miles from Tell Hum (Capernaum). Its site is marked by
   extensive ruins, including the foundations of a synagogue, columns, and
   walls of buildings. Bethsaida was probably a suburb of Capernaum. We
   have no record of a miracle wrought at Chorazin, nor of one wrought at
   Bethsaida either, unless the miracles wrought at Simon's house--see
   Sec. xxxii, page 170 were in Bethsaida. Tyre and Sidon were neighboring
   Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean coast and were noted for their
   luxury and impiety. This comparison between the pagan cities on the
   seacoast and the Galilean cities by the lake no doubt sounded strange
   to Jesus' disciples, but in the years which followed, Tyre and Sidon
   received the gospel (Acts xxi. 3; xxvii. 3), and Tyre became a
   Christian city, while Tiberias, just south of Capernaum, became the
   seat of Jewish Talmudism. Sackcloth was a coarse fabric woven of goat's
   or camel's hair, and was worn by those who mourned. It was called
   sackcloth because, being strong and durable, it was used for making the
   large sacks in which rough articles were carried on the backs of
   camels. Such sacks are still so used. Ashes were put upon the head and
   face as additional symbols of grief. Jesus here uses these symbolic
   words to indicate that these cities would have repented thoroughly.] 22
   But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
   the day of judgment, than for you. 23 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou
   be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the
   mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would
   have remained until this day. 24 But I say unto you that it shall be
   more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for
   thee. [Several great truths are taught in this paragraph. We note the
   following: 1. Every hearer of the gospel is left either much more
   blessed or much more wretched. 2. That the miracles which Jesus wrought
   were calculated to lead men to repentance, for they demonstrated his
   authority to demand that man should repent. 3. That even among those
   who stand condemned at the judgment there is a difference, and that it
   shall be more tolerable for some than for others. 4. That God takes
   account of our opportunities when he comes to measure our guiltiness
   (Matt. v. 21, 22; x. 15; Luke xi. 47, 48; John ix. 41; xv. 22-24; Rom.
   ii. 12). Capernaum was the most favored spot on earth, for Jesus made
   it his home. He therefore speaks of it figuratively as being exalted to
   heaven. Hades means the abode of the dead. It stands in figurative
   contrast to heaven and indicates that Capernaum shall be brought to
   utter ruin. Though Jesus was not displeased with the walls and houses,
   but with those who dwelt in them, yet the uncertain sites of these
   cities are marked only by ruins, and present to the traveler who
   searches among rank weeds for their weather-worn stones the tokens of
   God's displeasure against the people who once dwelt there. In less than
   thirty years these three cities were destroyed. Sin destroys cities and
   nations, and permanent temporal prosperity depends upon righteousness.
   The history of the destruction of Sodom in the time of Abraham is well
   known. As it was one of (Num. xiii. 22) the oldest cities of any great
   importance in Palestine, this reference to its remaining is the more
   striking, showing that its destruction did not come from the mere
   operation of natural law, but as a divine punishment meted upon it for
   its sins--a punishment which might have been avoided by repentance
   (Jonah iii. 10). There is hope for the greatest sinner if Sodom might
   thus escape.] 25 At that season [while these thoughts of judgment were
   in his mind] Jesus answered [replying to the thoughts raised by this
   discouraging situation--this rejection] and said, I thank thee, O
   Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things
   from the wise and understanding [the selfish and shrewd; the scribes
   and Pharisees, wise in their own conceit--John ix. 40, 41], and didst
   reveal them unto babes [the pure and childlike; the apostles and their
   fellows who were free from prejudice and bigoted prepossession. God hid
   and revealed solely by his method of presenting the truth in Christ
   Jesus. The proud despised him, but the humble received him]: 26 yea,
   Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. [This is a
   reiteration of the sentiment just uttered. It means "I thank thee that
   it pleases thee to do thus." The Son expresses holy acquiescence and
   adoring satisfaction in the doings of Him who, as Lord of heaven and
   earth, had right to dispose of all things as it pleased him.] 27 All
   things have been delivered unto me of my Father [John iii. 35. All
   things necessary to the full execution of his office as Lord of the
   kingdom were entrusted to Jesus, but for the present only potentially.
   The actual investiture of authority did not take place until the
   glorification of Jesus (Matt. xxviii. 18; Col. i. 16-19; Heb. i. 8).
   The authority thus delivered shall be eventually returned again--I.
   Cor. xv. 28]: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth
   any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth
   to reveal him. [Here again are many important truths taught: 1. While
   we may have personal knowledge of Jesus, we can not know him
   completely. His nature is inscrutable. And yet, in direct opposition to
   our Lord's explicit assertion, creeds have been formed, defining the
   metaphysical nature of Christ, and enforcing their distinctions on the
   subject which Jesus expressly declares that no man understands, as
   necessary conditions of church membership in this world, and of
   salvation in the world to come. "It would be difficult to find a more
   audacious and presumptuous violation of the words of Jesus than the
   Athanasian Creed, with its thrice repeated curses against those who did
   not receive its doctrines" (Morison). 2. We can have no correct
   knowledge of God except through revelation. 3. Jesus begins the
   revelation of the Father in this world, and completes it in the world
   to come. 4. By this exclusive claim as to the knowledge of the Father,
   Jesus asserts his own divinity. 5. Christ's exalted power comes by
   reason of his exalted being.] 28 Come unto me, all ye that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you,
   and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
   rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
   [The preceding remarks are prefatory to this invitation. The dominion
   which Jesus exercises, the nature which he possess, and the knowledge
   which he can impart justify him in inviting men to come to him. The
   labor and the rest here spoken of are primarily those which affect
   souls. That is, the labor and the heavy burden which sin imposes, and
   the rest which follows the forgiveness of that sin. Incidentally,
   however, physical burdens are also made lighter by coming to Jesus,
   because the soul is made stronger to bear them. The meekness and
   lowliness of Jesus lend confidence to those whom he invites that no
   grievous exactions will be made of them. "Taking the yoke" is a
   symbolic expression. It means, "Submit to me and become my disciple,"
   for the yoke is symbolic of the condition of servitude--see Jer. xxvii.
   11, 12; Isa. ix. 4; Acts xv. 10; Gal. v. 1; I. Tim. vi. 1.]

Jesus' Feet Anointed in the House of a Pharisee.

(Galilee.)

^C Luke VII. 36-50.

   ^c 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
   [We learn from verse 40 that the Pharisee's name was Simon. Because the
   feast at Bethany was given in the house of Simon the leper, and because
   Jesus was anointed there also, some have been led to think that Luke is
   here describing this supper. See Matt. xxvi. 6-13; Mark xiv. 3-9; John
   xii. 1-8. But Simon the leper was not Simon the Pharisee. The name
   Simon was one of the most common among the Jewish people. It was the
   Greek form of the Hebrew Simeon. The New Testament mentions nine and
   Josephus twenty Simons, and there must have been thousands of them in
   Palestine at that time. The anointing at Bethany was therefore a
   different occasion from this.] And he entered into the Pharisee's
   house, and sat down to meat. [Literally, reclined at meat. The old
   Jewish method of eating was to sit cross-legged on the floor or on a
   divan, but the Persians, Greeks and Romans reclined on couches, and the
   Jews, after the exile, borrowed this custom. We are not told in plain
   terms why the Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. The envy and
   cunning which characterized his sect leads us to be, perhaps, unduly
   suspicious that his motives were evil. The narrative, however, shows
   that his motives were somewhat akin to those of Nicodemus. He wished to
   investigate the character and claims of Jesus, and was influenced more
   by curiosity than by hostility--for all Pharisees were not equally
   bitter (John vii. 45-52). But he desired to avoid in any way
   compromising himself, so he invited Jesus to his house, but carefully
   omitted all the ordinary courtesies and attentions which would have
   been paid to an honored guest. Jesus accepted the invitation, for it
   was his custom to dine both with Pharisees and publicans, that he might
   reach all classes.] 37 And behold, a woman who was in the city, a
   sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's
   house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment. [Because the
   definite article "the" is used before the word "city," Meyer says it
   was Capernaum, and because Nain is the last city mentioned, Wiesler
   says it was Nain, but it is not certain what city it was. Older
   commentators say it was Magdala, because they hold the unwarranted
   medieval tradition that the sinner was Mary Magdalene, i. e., Mary of
   Magdala. No trustworthy source has ever been found for this tradition,
   and there are two good reasons for saying that this was not Mary
   Magdalene: 1. She is introduced soon after (Luke viii. 2) as a new
   character and also as a woman of wealth and consequence. See also Matt.
   xxvii. 55. 2. Jesus had delivered her from the possession of seven
   demons. But there is no connection between sin and demon-possession.
   The former implies a disregard for the accepted rules of religious
   conduct, while the latter implies no sinfulness at all. This affliction
   was never spoken of as a reproach, but only as a misfortune. The cruse
   which she brought with her was called "an alabaster." Orientals are
   very fond of ointments and use them upon the face and hair with
   profusion. They were scented with sweet-smelling vegetable essence,
   especially that extracted from the myrtle. Originally the small vases,
   jars or broad-mouthed bottles, in which the ointment was stored, were
   carved from alabaster, a variety of gypsum, white, semi-transparent and
   costly. Afterwards other material was used, but the name "alabaster"
   was still applied to such cruses. That used by Mary of Bethany was
   probably the highest grade ointment in the highest priced cruse (John
   xii. 3). The context here leaves us free to suppose that both the cruse
   and the unguent were of a cheaper kind], 38 and standing behind at his
   feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them
   with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with
   the ointment. [To see this scene we must picture Jesus stretched upon
   the couch and reclining on his left elbow. The woman stood at the foot
   of the couch behind his feet. His feet were bare; for every guest on
   entering left his sandals outside the door. The woman, feeling strongly
   the contrast between the sinlessness of Jesus and her own stained life,
   could not control her emotions. "The tears," says Brom, "poured down in
   a flood upon his naked feet, as she bent down to kiss them; and deeming
   them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to wipe them off
   with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair. She thus
   placed her glory at his feet (I. Cor. xi. 15), after which she put the
   ointment upon them."] 39 Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw
   it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet,
   would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
   him, that she is a sinner. [Public opinion said that Jesus was a
   prophet (Luke vii. 16), and Simon, from the Pharisee's standpoint,
   feared that it might be so; and therefore no doubt felt great
   satisfaction in obtaining this evidence which he accepted as disproving
   the claims of Jesus. He judged that if Jesus had been a prophet he
   would have both known and repelled this woman. He would have known her
   because discerning of spirits was part of the prophetic
   office--especially the Messianic office ( Isa. xi. 2-4; I. Kings xiv.
   6; II. Kings i. 1-3; v. 26). Comp. John ii. 25. He would have repelled
   her because, according to the Pharisaic tradition, her very touch would
   have rendered him unclean. The Pharisees, according to later Jewish
   writings, forbade women to stand nearer to them than four cubits,
   despite the warning of God (Isa. lxv. 5). Thus reasoning, Simon
   concluded that Jesus had neither the knowledge nor the holiness which
   are essential to a prophet. His narrow mind did not grasp the truth
   that it was as wonderful condescension for Christ to sit at his board
   as it was to permit this sinner to touch him.] 40 And Jesus answering
   said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith,
   Teacher, say on. [Jesus heard Simon's thoughts and answered them. Simon
   called Jesus "Teacher," little thinking how fully Jesus was about to
   vindicate the justice of the title, thus given him in compliment.] 41 A
   certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings,
   and the other fifty. [The denarius or shilling was a silver coin issued
   by Rome which contained nearly seventeen cents' worth of that precious
   metal. The two debts, therefore, represented respectively about
   seventy-five dollars, and seven dollars and fifty cents. But at that
   time a denarius was a day's wages for a laboring man (Matt. xx. 2, 4,
   12, 13), so that the debt is properly translated into our language as
   if one owed five hundred and the other fifty days of labor.] 42 When
   they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. [In this brief
   parable God represents the lender, and the woman the big and Simon the
   little debtor. Simon was (in his own estimation) ten times better off
   than the woman; yet they were each in an equally hopeless case--having
   nothing with which to pay; and each in an equally favored case--being
   offered God's free forgiveness. Forgiveness is expressed in the past
   tense in the parable, but merely as part of the drapery and not for the
   purpose of declaring Simon's forgiveness. It indicates no more than
   that Jesus was equally willing to forgive both. But the Pharisee did
   not seek his forgiveness, and the absence of all love in him proved
   that he did not have it.] Which of them therefore will love him most?
   [It was Jesus' custom to thus often draw his verdicts from the very
   lips of the parties concerned--Luke x. 36, 37; Matt. xxi. 40, 41.] 43
   Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.
   [The "suppose" of Simon betrays a touch of supercilious irony, showing
   that the Pharisee thought the question very trivial. And he said unto
   him, Thou hast rightly judged. [Simon's words were more than an answer.
   They were a judgment as well. Like Nathan with David (II. Sam. xii.
   1-7), Jesus had concealed Simon's conduct under the vestments of a
   parable, and had thus led him to unwittingly pronounce sentence against
   himself. Simon, the little debtor, was a debtor still; having no acts
   of gratitude to plead in evidence of his acquittal. From this point the
   words of Jesus take up the conduct of Simon which we should here
   picture to ourselves. "We must imagine the guests arriving; Simon
   receiving them with all courtesy, and embracing each in turn; slaves
   ready to was the dust of the road from their sandaled feet, and to pour
   sweet olive oil over their heads to soften the parched skin. See Gen.
   xviii. 4; xix. 2; xxiv. 32; Ruth iii. 3; I. Sam. xxv. 41; Ps. xxiii. 5;
   cxli. 5; Eccl. ix. 8; Dan. x. 3; Amos vi. 6; Matt. vi. 17. But there is
   one of the guests not thus treated. He is but a poor man, invited as an
   act of condescending patronage. No kiss is offered him; no slave waits
   upon him; of course a mechanic can not need the luxuries others are
   accustomed to!"] 44 And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest
   thou this woman? [Simon is to look upon the woman as one whose actions
   stood in contrast to his own.] I entered into thy house, thou gavest me
   no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and
   wiped them with her hair. [Jesus here draws the first contrast. In the
   East, where the feet without stockings are placed in sandals instead of
   shoes, water becomes essential to one who would enter a house. The
   guest should be afforded an opportunity to wash the dust from his feet,
   not only for comfort's sake, but also that he might not be humiliated
   by soiling the carpets on which he walked, and the cushions on which he
   reclined. The trifling courtesy Simon had omitted; but the woman had
   amply supplied his omission, bathing the Lord's feet in what Bengel
   well calls "the most priceless of waters."] 45 Thou gavest me no kiss:
   but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. [We
   have here the second contrast. A kiss was the ordinary salutation of
   respect in the East. Sometimes the hand was kissed, and sometimes the
   cheek (II. Sam. xv. 5; xix. 39; Matt. xxvi. 49; Acts xx. 37; Rom. xvi.
   16). We may note incidentally that we have no record of a kiss upon the
   cheek of Jesus save that given by Judas. The woman had graced the feet
   of Jesus with those honors which Simon had withheld from his cheek.] 46
   My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet
   with ointment. [Anointing was a mark of honor which was usually
   bestowed upon distinguished guests (Amos vi. 6; Ps. xxiii. 5; cxli. 5).
   To anoint the feet was regarded as extreme luxury (Pliny H.N. xiii. 4).
   In this third case Jesus makes a double comparison. To anoint the feet
   was more honored than to anoint the head, and the ointment was a more
   valuable and worthy offering than the mere oil which ordinary courtesy
   would have proffered.] 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which
   are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is
   forgiven, the same loveth little. [Her love was the result, and not the
   cause, of her forgiveness. Our sins are not forgiven because we love
   God, but we love God because they are forgiven (I. John iv. 19). Such
   is the inference of the parable, and such the teaching of the entire
   New Testament. We search the story in vain for any token of love on the
   part of Simon.] 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 49 And
   they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is
   this that even forgiveth sins? [They were naturally surprised at this
   marvelous assumption of authority, but in the light of what had just
   been said they did not dare to express themselves. Ignorance of
   Christ's person and office caused them to thus question him. It is easy
   to stumble in the dark. We are not told that Simon joined in asking
   this question.] 50 And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved
   thee; go in peace. [Jesus did not rebuke his questioners, because the
   process of forgiveness was something which could not be demonstrated to
   their comprehension, and hence their error could not be made clear.
   Jesus attributed her forgiveness to her faith. "Peace" was the Hebrew
   and "grace" was the Greek salutation. It is here used as a farewell,
   and means "Go in the abiding enjoyment of peace." Several valuable
   lessons are taught by this incident. 1. That the sense of guiltiness
   may differ in degree, but nevertheless the absolute inability of man to
   atone for sin is common to all. 2. As sin is against Christ, to Christ
   belongs the right and power to forgive it. 3. That conventional
   respectability, having no such flagrant and open sins as are condemned
   by the public, is not conscious of its awful need. 4. That those who
   have wandered far enough to have felt the world's censure realize most
   fully the goodness of God in pardoning them, and hence are moved to
   greater expressions of gratitude than are given by the self-righteous.
   But we must not draw the conclusion that sin produces love, or that
   much sin produces much love, and that therefore much sin is a good
   thing. The blessing which we seek is not proportioned to the quantity
   of the sins; but is proportioned to the quantity of sinful sense which
   we feel. We all have sin enough to destroy our souls, but many of us
   fail to love God as we should, through an insufficient sense of
   sinfulness.]

Further Journeying About Galilee.

^C Luke VIII. 1-3.

   ^c 1 And it came to pass soon afterwards [ i. e.,. soon after his visit
   to the Pharisee], that he went about through cities and villages [thus
   making a thorough circuit of the region of Galilee], preaching and
   bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God [John had preached
   repentance as a preparation for the kingdom; but Jesus now appears to
   have preached the kingdom itself, which was indeed to bring good
   tidings--Rom. xiv. 17 ], and with him the twelve [We here get a glimpse
   of the tireless activities of the ministry of Christ. Journeying from
   place to place, he was constantly preaching the gospel publicly to the
   people, and as ceaselessly instructing his disciples privately. The
   twelve were now serving an apprenticeship in that work on which he
   would soon send them forth alone. From this time forth we can hardly
   look upon Capernaum as the home of Jesus. From now to the end of his
   ministry his life was a wandering journey, and he and his apostles
   sustained by the offerings of friends. The circuit of Galilee here
   mentioned is peculiar to Luke], 2 and certain women who had been healed
   of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from
   whom seven demons had gone out [What a change of service, from demoniac
   bondage to the freedom of Christ!], 3 and Joanna the wife of Chuzas
   Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them
   of their substance. [As to the vile slanders with which commentators
   have stained the good name of Mary Magdalene, see p. 291. For further
   mention of her, see John xix. 25; Mark xv. 47; xvi. 1, 9 Joh xx. 11-18.
   Mary's name indicates that she was a native of Magdala (Hebrew, Migdol,
   i. e., watch-tower). Of all the towns which dotted the shores of
   Galilee in Christ's day, but this and Tiberias remain. It is on the
   west shore of the lake, at the southeast corner of the plain of
   Gennesaret, and is to-day a small collection of mud hovels. It still
   bears the name el-Mejdel, which is probably received from the adjoining
   watch-tower that guarded the entrance to the plain, the ruins of which
   are still to be seen. We should note that Mary Magdalene is not classed
   with restored profligates, but with those who were healed of
   infirmities. Joanna is mentioned again at Luke xxiv. 10; of Susanna
   there is no other record, this being enough to immortalize her. Of
   Chuzas we know nothing more than what is stated here. There are two
   Greek words for steward, epitropos and oikonomos. The first may be
   translated administrator, superintendent or governor. It conveys the
   impression of an officer of high rank. The Jewish rabbis called Obadiah
   the epitropos of Ahab. This was the office held by Chuzas, and its
   translated treasurer in the Arabic version. The second word may be
   translated housekeeper, or domestic manager. It was an office usually
   held by some trusted slave as a reward for his fidelity. Chuzas was no
   doubt a man of means and influence. As there was no order of nobility
   in Galilee, and as such an officer might be nevertheless styled a
   nobleman, this Chuzas was very likely the nobleman of John iv. 46. If
   so, the second miracle at Cana explains the devotion of Joanna to
   Jesus. Herod's capital was at Sephoris, on an elevated tableland not
   far from Capernaum. The ministration of these women shows the poverty
   of Christ and his apostles, and explains how they were able to give
   themselves so unremittingly to the work. Some of the apostles also may
   have had means enough to contribute somewhat to the support of the
   company, but in any event the support was meager enough, for Jesus was
   among the poorest of earth (Luke ix. 58; Matt. xvii. 24; II. Cor. viii.
   9). His reaping of carnal things was as scanty as his sowing of
   spiritual things was abundant (I. Cor. ix. 11). We should note how
   Jesus began to remove the fetters of custom which bound women, and to
   bring about a condition of universal freedom (Gal. iii. 28).]

Blasphemous Accusations of the Jews.

(Galilee.)

^A Matt. XII. 22-37; ^B Mark III. 19-30; ^C Luke XI. 14-23.

   ^b 19 And he cometh into a house. [Whose house is not stated.] 20 And
   the multitude cometh together again [as on a previous occasion--Mark
   ii. 1], so that they could not so much as eat bread. [They could not
   sit down to a regular meal. A wonderful picture of the intense
   importunity of people and the corresponding eagerness of Jesus, who was
   as willing to do as they were to have done.] 21 And when his friends
   heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside
   himself. [These friends were his brothers and his mother, as appears
   from Mark iii. 31, 32. They probably came from Nazareth. To understand
   their feelings, we must bear in mind their want of faith. See John vii.
   3-9. They regarded Jesus as carried away by his religious enthusiasm
   (Acts xxvi. 24; II. Cor. v. 13), and thought that he acted with
   reckless regard for his personal safety. They foresaw the conflict with
   the military authorities and the religious leaders into which the
   present course of Jesus was leading, and were satisfied that the case
   called for their interference. Despite her knowledge as to Jesus, Mary
   sympathized with her sons in this movement, and feared for the safety
   of Jesus.] ^a 22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon,
   blind and dumb: { ^c 14 And he was casting out a demon that was dumb.}
   ^a and he healed him, insomuch that ^c it came to pass, when the demon
   was gone out, ^a the dumb man spake and saw. [The man was brought
   because he could not come alone. While Luke does not mention the
   blindness, the similarity of the narratives makes it most likely that
   he is describing the same circumstances as Matthew and Mark, so we have
   combined the three accounts.] 23 And all the multitudes ^c marvelled.
   ^a were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David? [It was a time
   for amazement, for Jesus had performed a triple if not a quadruple
   miracle, restoring liberty, hearing and sight, and granting the power
   of speech. It wakened the hope that Jesus might be the Messiah, the son
   of David, but their hope is expressed in the most cautious manner, not
   only being stated as a question, but as a question which expects a
   negative answer. The question, however, was well calculated to arouse
   the envious opposition of the Pharisees.] ^c 15 But some of them said
   [that is, some of the multitude. Who these "some" were is revealed by
   Matthew and Mark, thus:], ^a 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they
   ^b 22 and the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, ^a This man
   doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons. ^b
   He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the
   demons. [Beelzebub is a corruption of Baalzebub, the god of the fly.
   There was a tendency among the heathen to name their gods after the
   pests which they were supposed to avert. Thus Zeus was called Apomuios
   (Averter of flies), and Apollo Ipuktonos (Slayer of vermin). How
   Beelzebub became identified with Satan in the Jewish mind is not known.
   In opposing the influence of Jesus and corrupting the public mind,
   these Pharisees showed a cunning worthy of the cultivated atmosphere,
   the seat of learning whence they came. Being unable to deny that a
   miracle was wrought (for Celsus in the second century is the first
   recorded person who had the temerity to do such a thing), they sought
   to so explain it as to reverse its potency, making it an evidence of
   diabolical rather than divine power. Their explanation was cleverly
   plausible, for there were at least two powers by which demons might be
   cast out, as both were invisible, it might appear impossible to decide
   whether it was done in this instance by the power of God or of Satan.
   It was an explanation very difficult to disprove, and Jesus himself
   considered it worthy of the very thorough reply which follows.] ^c 16
   And others, trying him, sought of him a sign from heaven. [These
   probably felt that the criticisms of the Pharisees were unjust, and
   wished that Jesus might put them to silence by showing some great sign,
   such as the pillar of cloud which sanctioned the guidance of Moses, or
   the descending fire which vindicated Elijah.] ^b 23 And he called them
   unto him [thus singling out his accusers], ^a 25 And { ^c 17 But} ^a
   knowing their thoughts he said unto them, ^b in parables [We shall find
   that Jesus later replied to those who sought a sign. He here answers
   his accusers in a fourfold argument. First argument:], How can Satan
   cast out Satan? ^a Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to
   desolation; and every city or house [family] divided against itself
   shall not stand: ^b 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that
   kingdom cannot stand. ^c A house divided against a house falleth. { ^b
   25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be
   able to stand.} ^a 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided
   against himself; ^c 18 And if Satan also is divided against himself, ^a
   how then shall his kingdom stand? ^b 26 And if Satan hath risen up
   against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. ^c
   because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub. [The explanation
   given by the Pharisees represented Satan as divided against himself;
   robbing himself of his greatest achievement; namely, his triumph over
   the souls and bodies of men. Jesus argues, not that Satan could not do
   this, but that he would not, and that therefore the explanation which
   supposes him to do it is absurd. We should note that Jesus here
   definitely recognizes two important truths: 1. That the powers of evil
   are organized into a kingdom with a head (Matt. xiii. 29; xxv. 41; Mark
   iv. 15; Luke xxii. 31). 2. That division tends to destruction. His
   argument therefore, "constitutes an incidental but strong argument
   against sectarianism. See I. Cor. i. 13 " (Abbott). Second argument:]
   19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast
   them out? Therefore shall they be your judges. [The sons of the
   Pharisees were not their children, but their disciples (II. Kings ii.
   3; Acts xix. 13, 14). Josephus mentions these exorcists (Ant. viii. 2,
   5, and Wars vii. 6, 3), and there is abundant mention of them in later
   rabbinical books. Our Lord's reference to them was merely for the
   purpose of presenting an argumentum ad hominem, and in no way implies
   that they exercised any real power over the demons; nor could they have
   done so in any marked degree, else the similar work of Christ would not
   have created such an astonishment. The argument therefore is this, I
   have already shown you that it is against reason that Satan cast out
   Satan; I now show you that it is against experience. The only instances
   of dispossession which you can cite are those of your own disciples. Do
   they act by the power of Satan? They therefore shall be your judges as
   to whether you have spoken rightly in saying that Satan casts out
   Satan. Third argument:] 20 But if I with the finger { ^a by the Spirit}
   of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. [The
   finger of God signifies the power of God (Ex. viii. 19; xxxi. 18; Ps.
   viii. 3). [Jesus exercised this power in unison with the Spirit of God.
   Jesus here draws a conclusion from the two arguments presented. Since
   he does not cast out by Satan, he must cast out by the power of God,
   and therefore his actions demonstrated the potential arrival of the
   kingdom of God. The occasional accidental deliverance of exorcists
   might be evidence of the flow and ebb of a spiritual battle, but the
   steady, daily conquests of Christ over the powers of evil presented to
   the people the triumphant progress of an invading kingdom. It is an
   argument against the idea that there was a collusion between Christ and
   Satan. Fourth argument:] ^c 21 When the strong man fully armed guardeth
   his own court, his goods are in peace: 22 but when a stronger than he
   shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole
   armor wherein he trusted, and divided his spoils. ^b 27 But no one can
   { ^a 29 Or how can one} enter into the house of the strong man, and
   spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then will he
   spoil his house. [Satan is the strong man, his house the body of the
   demoniac, and his goods the evil spirit within the man. Jesus had
   entered his house, and robbed him of his goods; and this proved that,
   instead of being in league with Satan, he had overpowered Satan. Thus
   Jesus put to shame the Pharisees, and caused the divinity of his
   miracle to stand out in clearer light than ever. The power of Jesus to
   dispossess the demon was one of his most convincing credentials, and
   its meaning now stood forth in its true light.] 30 He that is not with
   me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
   [Jesus here addresses the bystanders. In the spiritual conflict between
   Jesus and Satan, neutrality is impossible. There are only two kingdoms,
   and every soul is either in one or the other, for there is no third.
   Hence one who fought Satan in the name of Christ was for Christ (Luke
   ix. 50). In the figure of gathering and scattering, the people are
   compared to a flock of sheep which Jesus would gather into the fold,
   but which Satan and all who aid him (such as the Pharisees) would
   scatter and destroy.] ^b 28 Verily ^a 31 Therefore I say unto you,
   Every sins and blasphemy { ^b all their sins} shall be forgiven unto
   the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
   blaspheme [Jesus here explains to the Pharisees the awful meaning of
   their enmity. Blasphemy is any kind of injurious speech. It is the
   worst form of sin, as we see by this passage. This does not declare
   that every man shall be forgiven all his sins, but that all kinds of
   sin committed by various men shall be forgiven. The forgiveness is
   universal as to the sin, not as to the men]: ^a but the blasphemy
   against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. 32 And whosoever shall speak
   a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever
   shall speak { ^b blaspheme} against the Holy Spirit hath never
   forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin: ^a it shall not be
   forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come. ^b
   30 because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. [Blasphemy against the
   Son may be a temporary sin, for the one who commits it may be
   subsequently convinced of his error by the testimony of the Holy Spirit
   and become a believer (I. Tim. i. 13). But blasphemy against the Holy
   Spirit is in its nature an eternal sin, for if one rejects the evidence
   given by the Holy Spirit and ascribes it to Satan, he rejects the only
   evidence upon which faith can be based; and without faith there is no
   forgiveness. The difference in the two sins is therefore in no way due
   to any difference in the Son and Spirit as to their degrees of sanctity
   or holiness. The punishment is naturally eternal because the sin is
   perpetual. The mention of the two worlds is, "just an extended way of
   saying 'never'" (Morison). Some assert that the Jews would not know
   what Jesus meant by the Holy Spirit, but the point is not so well
   taken. See Ex. xxxi. 3; Num. xi. 26; I. Sam. x. 10; xix. 20; Ps.
   cxxxix. 7; cxliii. 10; Isa. xlviii. 16; Ezek. xi. 24. We see by Mark's
   statement that blasphemy against the Spirit consisted in saying that
   Jesus had an unclean spirit, that his works were due to Satanic
   influence, and hence wrought to accomplish Satanic ends. We can not
   call God Satan, nor the Holy Spirit a demon, until our state of sin has
   passed beyond all hope of reform. One can not confound the two kingdoms
   of good and evil unless he does so maliciously and willfully.] ^a 33
   Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree
   corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.
   [The meaning and connection are: "Be honest for once; represent the
   tree as good, and its fruit as good, or the tree as evil, and its fruit
   as evil; either say that I am evil, and that my works are evil, or, if
   you admit that my works are good, admit that I am good also and not in
   league with Beelzebub"--Carr.] 34 Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye,
   being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart
   the mouth speaketh. [Realizing the hopelessness of this attempt to get
   an honest judgment out of dishonest hearts, Jesus plainly informs them
   as to the condition of their hearts. Their very souls were full of
   poison like vipers. Their sin lay not in their words, but in a
   condition of heart which made such words possible. The heart being as
   it was, the words could not be otherwise. "What is in the well will be
   in the bucket"-- Trapp.] 35 The good man out of his good treasure
   bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
   bringeth forth evil things. [We have here a summary of the contrast
   given in the two preceding verses. The good heart of Jesus brought
   forth its goodness, as the evil hearts of the Pharisees brought forth
   their evil.] 36 And I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall
   speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 37 For
   by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
   condemned. [It may have seemed to some that Jesus denounced too
   severely a saying which the Pharisees had hastily and lightly uttered.
   But it is the word inconsiderately spoken which betrays the true state
   of the heart. The hypocrite can talk like an angel if he be put on
   notice that his words are heard. Jesus here makes words the basis of
   the judgment of God. Elsewhere we find it is works (Rom. ii. 6; II.
   Cor. v. 10), and again we find it is faith (Rom. iii. 28). There is no
   confusion here. The judgment in its finality must be based upon our
   character. Our faith forms our character, and our words and works are
   indices by which we may determine what manner of character it is.]

Sign Seekers, and the Enthusiast Reproved.

(Galilee on the Same Day as the Last Section.)

^A Matt. XII. 38-45; ^C Luke XI. 24-36.

   ^c 29 And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, ^a 38
   Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying,
   Teacher, we would see a sign from thee. [Having been severely rebuked
   by Jesus, it is likely that the scribes and Pharisees asked for a sign
   that they might appear to the multitude more fair-minded and open to
   conviction than Jesus had represented them to be. Jesus had just
   wrought a miracle, so that their request shows that they wanted
   something different. We learn from Mark (Mark viii. 11) that they
   wanted a sign, not coming from him, but from heaven, such a sign as
   other prophets and leaders had given (Ex. ix. 22-24; xvi. 4; Josh. x.
   12; I. Sam. vii. 9, 10; xii. 16-18; I. Kings xviii. 36-38; II. Kings i.
   10; Isa. xxxviii. 8). "In Jewish superstition it was held that demons
   and false gods could give signs on earth, but only the true God signs
   from heaven" (Alford ). The request was the renewal of the one which
   had assailed him at the beginning of his ministry (John ii. 18 ), and
   re-echoed the wilderness temptation to advance himself by vulgar
   display rather than by the power of a life of divine holiness.] 39 But
   he answered and said unto them, { ^c he began to say,} This generation
   is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; ^a An evil and
   adulterous generation seeketh after a sign [While the Jews of that
   generation could well be accused literally of adultery, Jesus here
   evidently uses it in its symbolic sense as used by the prophets. They
   represented Israel as being married to God and as being untrue to
   him--Ex. xxxiv. 15; Jer. iii. 14, 20]; and there shall no sign be given
   to it, ^c but the sign of Jonah. ^a the prophet [They did not accept
   miracles of healing as a sign, and only one other kind of sign was
   given; viz.: that of Jonah. Jonah was shown to be a true prophet of
   God, and Nineveh received him as such because he was rescued from the
   fish's belly, and Jesus was declared to be the Son of God by the
   resurrection from the dead--Rom. i. 4]: 40 For as Jonah was three days
   and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be
   three days and three nights. [Jesus was one full day, two full nights,
   and parts of two other days in the grave. But, as the Jews reckoned a
   part of a day as a whole day when it occurred at the beginning or end
   of a series, he was correctly spoken of as being three days in the
   grave. The Jews had three phrases, viz.: "on the third day," "after
   three days," and "three days and three nights," which all meant the
   same thing; that is, three days, two of which might be fractional days.
   With them three full days and nights would be counted as four days
   unless the count began at sundown, the exact beginning of a day (Acts
   x. 1-30). For instances of Jewish computation of days, see Gen. xlii.
   17, 18; I. Kings xii. 5, 12; Esth. iv. 16; v. 1; Matt. xxvii. 63, 64.
   The Greek word here translated "whale" is "sea monster." It is called
   in Jonah "a great fish" (Jonah i. 17). Because of the supposed
   smallness of the whale's throat, many think that it was the white
   shark, which is still plentiful in the Mediterranean, and which
   sometimes measures sixty feet in length, and is large enough to swallow
   a man whole. But it is now a well-established fact that whales can
   swallow a man, and there are many instances of such swallowings on
   record. The expression "heart of the earth" does not mean its center.
   The Jews used the word "heart" to denote the interior of anything
   (Ezek. xxviii. 2). The phrase is here used as one which would
   emphatically indicate the actual burial of Christ.] ^c 30 For even as
   Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be
   to this generation. [Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire,
   situated on the Tigris River, and in its day the greatest city of the
   world. Jonah's preservation was a sign from heaven, because wrought
   without human instrumentality. The resurrection of Christ was such a
   sign to the Jews, but rejecting it, they continued to seek other
   signs--I. Cor. i. 22.] ^a 41 The men of Nineveh shall stand up in
   judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented
   at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
   [Literally, repented into the teaching of Jonah. The meaning is that
   they repented so that they followed the course of life which the
   preaching prescribed. The phrase, "stand up," refers to the Jewish and
   Roman custom which required the witness to stand up while testifying in
   a criminal case. The idea here is that the Ninevites, having improved
   the lesser advantage or privilege, would condemn the Jews for having
   neglected the greater. Nineveh's privilege may be counted thus: a
   sign-accredited prophet preaching without accompanying miracles, and a
   forty-day period of repentance. In contrast to this the Jewish
   privileges ran thus: the sign-accredited Son of God preaching,
   accompanied by miracles, in which many apostles and evangelists
   participated, a forty-year period in which to repent.] 42 The queen of
   the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall
   condemn it: { ^c with the men of this generation, and shall condemn
   them:} for she came from the ends of the earth [a Hebraism, indicating
   a great distance] to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater
   than Solomon is here. [The queen of Sheba is supposed to have been
   queen of Sabæa, or Arabia Felix, which lies in the southern part of the
   peninsula between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. But Josephus says
   she was from Ethiopia in Africa. Her testimony will also be based on
   the compared privileges, which stand thus: notwithstanding the dangers
   and inconveniences, she came a great distance to be taught of Solomon,
   but the Jews rejected the teaching of the Son of God, though he brought
   it to them. The teaching of Solomon related largely to this world, but
   Christ taught as to the world to come.] ^a 43 But the unclean spirit,
   when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places
   [places which are as cheerless to him as deserts are to man], seeking
   rest, and findeth it not. [Rest is the desire of every creature. Jesus
   here gives us a graphic description of utter wretchedness.] ^c and
   finding none, ^a 44 Then he saith, I will return into { ^c turn back
   unto} my house [he still claimed it as his property] whence I came out.
   25 And when he is come, he findeth it ^a empty, swept, and garnished.
   [It was empty, having no indwelling Spirit, swept of all righteous
   impressions and good influences, and garnished with things inviting to
   an evil spirit.] 45 Then [seeing this inviting condition] goeth he, and
   taketh with himself seven other spirits [to reinforce and entrench
   himself] more evil than himself [while all demons are wicked they are
   not equally so], and they enter in and dwell there [take up their
   permanent abode there]: and the last state of that man becometh worse
   than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation. [In
   the application of this parable, we should bear in mind that it tells
   of two states or conditions experienced by one man, and the comparison
   is between these two states or conditions and not between the condition
   of the man and other men. Such being the parable, the application of it
   is plain, for Jesus says, "Even so shall it be unto this evil
   generation." We are not, therefore, to compare that generation with any
   previous one, as many do; for such would be contrary to the terms of
   the parable. It is simply an assertion that the last state of that
   generation would be worse than the first. The reference is to the
   continually increasing wickedness of the Jews, which culminated in the
   dreadful scenes which preceded the destruction of Jerusalem. They were
   now like a man with one evil spirit; they would then be like a man with
   seven more demons added, each of which was worse than the original
   occupant.] ^c 27 And it came to pass, as he said these things, a
   certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto
   him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou
   didst suck. [This woman is the first on record to fulfill Mary's
   prediction (Luke i. 48). It is the only passage in the New Testament
   which even suggests the idolatry of Mariolatry, but it was far enough
   from it, being merely a womanly way of expressing admiration for the
   son by pronouncing blessings upon the mother who was so fortunate as to
   bear him.] 28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the
   word of God, and keep it. [Jesus does not deny the fact that Mary was
   blessed, but corrects any false idea with regard to her by pointing to
   the higher honor of being a disciple which was attainable by every one.
   Mary's blessing as a disciple was greater than her blessing as a
   mother; her moral and spiritual relation to Jesus was more precious
   than her maternal. Mary's blessings came through believing God's word
   (Luke i. 45). To know Christ after the Spirit is more blessed than to
   know him after the flesh--II. Cor. v. 15, 16; John xvi. 7.] 33 No man,
   when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under a
   bushel, but on the stand, that they which come in may see the light. 34
   The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole
   body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full
   of darkness. 35 Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not
   darkness. 36 If therefore thy whole body be full of light, as when the
   lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light. [This passage given
   in a slightly varying form is found in the Sermon on the Mount. See
   page 256. It is here addressed to the Pharisees and reproves them for
   not using the light (his miracles) which was given to them. If they had
   had an eye single to goodness, Christ's light would have enlightened
   their souls. But their eye was double; they desired wonders and
   spectacular signs.]

Christ's Teaching as to His Mother and Brethren.

(Galilee, Same Day as the Last Lesson.)

^A Matt. XII. 46-50; ^B Mark III. 31-35; ^C Luke VIII. 19-21.

   ^a 46 While he yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and
   his brethren stood without seeking to speak to him. [Jesus was in a
   house, probably at Capernaum--Mark iii. 19; Matt. xiii. 1.] ^c 19 and
   there came { ^b come} ^c to him his mother and ^b his brethren; ^c and
   they could not come at him for the crowd. ^a and, standing without,
   they sent unto him, calling him. 32 And the multitude was sitting about
   him [We learn at Mark iii. 21, that they came to lay hold of him
   because they thought that he was beside himself. It was for this reason
   that they came in a body, for their numbers would enable them to
   control him. Jesus had four brethren (Matt. xiii. 55). Finding him
   teaching with the crowd about him, they passed the word in to him that
   they wished to see him outside. To attempt to lay hold of him in the
   midst of his disciples would have been rashly inexpedient. The fact
   that they came with Mary establishes the strong presumption that they
   were the children of Mary and Joseph, and hence the literal brethren of
   the Lord. In thus seeking to take Jesus away from his enemies Mary
   yielded to a natural maternal impulse which even the revelations
   accorded to her did not quiet. The brethren, too, acted naturally, for
   they were unbelieving--John vii. 5.] ^a 47 And one said { ^b they say}
   unto him, ^c 20 And it was told him, ^a Behold, thy mother and thy
   brethren ^b seek for thee. ^c stand without, desiring to see thee. ^a
   seeking to speak to thee. [This message was at once an interruption and
   an interference. It assumed that their business with him was more
   urgent than his business with the people. It merited our Lord's rebuke,
   even if it had not behind it the even greater presumption of an attempt
   to lay hold on him.] 48 But he answered { ^b 33 And he answereth} ^a
   and said unto him that told him, ^b and saith, { ^c and said unto
   them,} ^a Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? ^b 34 And looking
   round on them that sat round about him, ^a he stretched forth his hand
   towards his disciples, and said, { ^b saith,} ^a Behold, my mother and
   my brethren! ^c My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word
   of God and do it. ^b 35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, ^a my
   Father who in heaven, he { ^b the same} is my brother, and my sister,
   and mother. [In this answer Jesus shows that he brooks no interference
   on the score of earthly relationships, and explodes the idea of his
   subserviency to his mother. To all who call on the "Mother of God," as
   Mary is blasphemously styled, Jesus answers, as he did to the Jews,
   "Who is my mother?" Jesus was then in the full course of his ministry
   as Messiah, and as such he recognized only spiritual relationships. By
   doing the will of God we become his spiritual children, and thus we
   become related to Christ. Jesus admits three human
   relationships--"brother, sister, mother"--but omits the paternal
   relationship, since he had no Father, save God. It is remarkable that
   in the only two instances in which Mary figures in the ministry of
   Jesus prior to his crucifixion, she stands forth reproved by him. This
   fact not only rebukes those who worship her, but especially corrects
   the doctrine of her immaculate conception.]

Dining with a Pharisee, Jesus Denounces that Sect.

^C Luke XI. 37-54.

   ^c 37 Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he
   went in, and sat down to meat. [The repast to which Jesus was invited
   was a morning meal, usually eaten between ten and eleven o'clock. The
   principal meal of the day was eaten in the evening. Jesus dined with
   all classes, with publicans and Pharisees, with friends and enemies.]
   38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
   bathed himself before dinner. [The Pharisee marveled at this because
   the tradition of the elders required them to wash their hands before
   eating, and, if they had been in a crowd where their bodies might have
   been touched by some unclean person, they washed their whole bodies. It
   was a custom which ministered to pride and self-righteousness.] 39 The
   Lord said to him [Our Lord's speech is unsparingly denunciatory. To
   some it seems strange that Jesus spoke thus in a house where he was an
   invited guest. But our Lord never suspended the solemn work of reproof
   out of mere compliment. He was governed by higher laws than those of
   conventional politeness], Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of
   the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and
   wickedness. 40 Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make
   the inside also? [Since God made both the inner and the outer, a true
   reverence for him requires that both parts be alike kept clean.] 41 But
   give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are
   clean unto you. [That is, give your inner life, your love, mercy,
   compassion, etc., to the blessing of mankind, and then your inner
   purity will make you proof against outward defilement--Matt. xv. 11;
   Tit. i. 15; Rom. xiv. 4.] 42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe
   mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God:
   but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
   [The Pharisees in paying the tenth part, or tithe, to God, were so
   exact that they offered the tenth part of the seed even of the
   spearmint, rue and other small garden herbs, and many contended that
   the very stalks of these plants should also be tithed. Jesus commends
   this care about little things, but nevertheless rebukes the Pharisees
   because they were as careless about big things, such as justice, and
   the love of God, as they were careful about herb seed. Rue was a small
   shrub about two feet high, and is said to have been used to flavor
   wine, and for medicinal purposes.] 43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye
   love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the
   marketplaces. [They were vainglorious, loving the honors and attentions
   given by men (John v. 44 ). They loved on week days to be saluted in
   the marketplace, and on the Sabbath to sit in the semi-circular row of
   seats which were back of the lectern, or desk of the reader, and which
   faced the congregation.] 44 Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which
   appear not, and the men that walk over them know it not. [According to
   the Mosaic law, any one who touched a grave was rendered unclean (Num.
   xix. 16). That they might not touch graves and be made unclean without
   knowing it, the Jews white-washed their graves and tombs once a year.
   But Jesus likens a Pharisee to graves which defiled men unawares. Their
   hypocrisy concealed their true nature, so that men were injured and
   corrupted by their influence without being aware of it. Jesus
   pronounces three woes upon the Pharisees for three sins, viz.: 1.
   Hypocrisy, shown in pretending to be be very careful when they were
   really extremely careless; 2. Vainglory; 3. Corruption of the public
   morals.] 45 And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher,
   in saying this thou reproachest us also. [Lightfoot supposes that a
   scribe was one who copied the law of Moses, while a lawyer expounded
   the oral law or traditions of the elders. But it is more likely that
   the terms were used interchangeably. They leaned to the Pharisee party,
   and hence this one felt the rebuke which Jesus addressed to that party.
   The scribe intimated that Jesus had spoken hastily, and his speech is a
   suggestion to Jesus to correct or modify his unguarded words. But Jesus
   made no mistakes and spoke no hasty words.] 46 And he said, Woe unto
   you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne,
   and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. [We
   have seen in the traditions with regard to the Sabbath how these Jewish
   lawyers multiplied the burdens which Moses had placed upon the people.
   They were careful to lay these burdens upon others, but equally careful
   not to bear them themselves--no, not even to keep the law of Moses
   itself--Matt. xxiii. 2, 3.] 47 Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of
   the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 48 So ye are witnesses and
   consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye
   build their tombs. [Tombs were usually dug in the rock in the sides of
   hills or cliffs. To build them therefore was to decorate or ornament
   the entrance. Though their act in building the sepulchres was a seeming
   honor to the prophets, God did not accept it as such. A prophet is only
   truly honored when his message is received and obeyed. The lawyers were
   not in fellowship with the prophets, but with those who murdered the
   prophets: hence the Saviour pictures the whole transaction from the
   killing of the prophets to the building of their sepulchres as one act
   in which all concurred, and all of which were guilty. Abbott gives the
   words a figurative meaning, thus: your fathers slew the prophets by
   violence, and you bury them by false teaching.] 49 Therefore also said
   the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and
   some of them they shall kill and persecute; 50 that the blood of all
   the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be
   required of this generation [The phrase "wisdom of God" has been very
   puzzling, for the words spoken by Jesus are not found in any Old
   Testament book. Among the explanations the best is that which
   represents Jesus as quoting the trend or tenor of several prophecies
   such as II. Chron. xxiv. 19-22; xxxvi. 14-16; Prov. i. 20-33. It may,
   however, be possible that Jesus is here publishing a new decree or
   conclusion of God, for the words specifically concerned the present
   generation. If so, Jesus assents to the decree of the Father by calling
   it "the wisdom of God," and the language is kindred to that at Matt.
   xi. 25, 26]; 51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who
   perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it
   shall be required of this generation. [Abel is accounted a prophet
   because his form of sacrifice prefigured that of Christ. His murder is
   described at Gen. iv. 1-8, the first historical book of the Bible,
   while that of Zachariah is described at II. Chron. xxiv. 20-22, in the
   last historical book of the Old Testament. From the record of one,
   therefore, to the record of the other embraces the entire catalogue of
   the Old Testament martyrs. Tradition assigns one of the four great
   sepulchral monuments at the foot of Olivet to Zachariah. That
   generation sanctioned all the sins of the past and went beyond them to
   the crucifixion of the Son of God. The best comment on this passage is
   the parable at Luke xx. 9-16. God made that generation the focus of the
   world's light and privilege, but the men of that time made it the focus
   of the world's wickedness and punishment. The punishment began about
   thirty-seven years later in the war with Rome, which lasted five years
   and culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem.] 52 Woe unto you
   lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in
   yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. [A true
   knowledge of the Scriptures was a key which opened the door to the
   glories of Christ and his kingdom. This the lawyer had given away by
   teaching not the contents of the book, but the rubbish and trifles of
   tradition. They did not open the door for themselves, and by their
   pretentious interference they confused others in their efforts to open
   it.] 53 And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the
   Pharisees began to press upon him vehemently, and to provoke him to
   speak of many things; 54; laying wait for him, to catch something out
   of his mouth. [They plied him with many questions, hoping that they
   could irritate him into making a hot or hasty answer. For methods used
   to entrap Jesus see Matt. xxii.]

LII.

Concerning Hypocrisy, Worldly Anxiety, Watchfulness, and His Approaching
Passion.

(Galilee.)

^C Luke XII. 1-59.

   ^c 1 In the meantime [that is, while these things were occurring in the
   Pharisee's house], when the many thousands of the multitude were
   gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another [in their
   eagerness to get near enough to Jesus to see and hear] , he began to
   say unto his disciples first of all [that is, as the first or most
   appropriate lesson], Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
   hypocrisy. [This admonition is the key to the understanding of the
   principal part of the sermon which follows. The spirit of Phariseeism
   was one which sought the honor of men, and feared men rather than God.
   It was a spirit which yielded to public opinion, and, though seemingly
   very religious, was really devoid of all true loyalty to God. There
   were trials and persecutions ahead of Christ's followers in which no
   Pharisaic spirit could survive. The spirit of hypocrisy works in two
   ways: it causes the bad man to hide his badness for fear of the good
   man, and the good man to hide his goodness for fear of the bad man. It
   is this latter operation against which Jesus warns, and the folly of
   which he shows.] 2 But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be
   revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 3 Wherefore whatsoever ye
   have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have
   spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the
   housetops. [Many fearing the storm of persecution which was soon to
   come upon the disciples would attempt to conceal their faith, but the
   attempt would be vain, for one could not even trust his own family
   (verses 51-53) to keep silent about what was said even in the inner
   chambers of the home. Bold speech would be best. The flat tops of
   Eastern houses were places from whence public proclamations were made.]
   4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
   body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will warn
   you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power
   to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. [It would be a time
   of fear, but the fear of God must dominate the fear of man. The fear of
   God should cause them to speak out, though the fear of man bade them be
   silent--Acts iv. 18-21.] 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pence?
   and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God? [The Roman as
   here rendered penny, was worth about four-fifths of a cent. Two
   sparrows were sold for a penny (Matt. x. 29). For two pennies, an extra
   one was thrown into the bargain, yet even it, so valueless, was not
   forgotten of God.] 7 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
   Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows. [These words assured
   them that whatever they might be called upon to undergo they would be
   at all times the objects of God's special care and providence.] 8 Also
   I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall
   the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 9 but he that
   denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of
   the angels of God. [These words were intended to strengthen those who
   loved honor or feared disgrace. If the disgrace of being cast out of
   the synagogue tempted them to deny Christ, or the honors given by their
   fellow-men seemed too precious to be sanctified for Christ's sake, they
   were to remember that the confession or denial of Jesus involved
   eternal honor or disgrace in the presence of the angelic host.] 10 And
   every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
   forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it
   shall not be forgiven. [Persecution would urge them to blasphemy (Acts
   xxvi. 11). In his hour of trial a disciple must remember the tender
   compassion of the Master against whom he is urged to speak, and the
   extreme danger of passing beyond the line of forgiveness in his
   blasphemy. For blasphemy against the Holy Spirit see page 303.] 11 And
   when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the
   authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye
   shall say: 12 for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour
   what ye ought to say. [The captive disciple planning his defense would
   be tempted to attempt hypocritical concealment or dissimulation. To
   prevent this, Jesus admonishes his hearers to rely upon the Holy Spirit
   for their utterance at such times. How fully such reliance was honored
   is shown in the apology of Stephen before the Sanhedrin, in Peter's
   defense before the tribunal, and in Paul's justification of his course,
   both before Felix and Agrippa.] 13 And one out of the multitude said
   unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. [Some
   one in the multitude, seeing the authority and justice of Jesus,
   thought it would be wise to appeal to him to assist him in getting his
   brother to rightly divide the inheritance.] 14 But he said unto him,
   Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? [Jesus laid down the
   general laws of justice and generosity, but he did not enforce these
   laws by any other power than love ( John xiv.). If love toward Jesus
   did not move this brother to rightly divide the inheritance, the
   injured party must look to the state and not to Jesus for assistance.]
   15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all
   covetousness [Jesus made the incident the text for an admonition.
   Covetousness made one brother say, "Divide," and the other one say,
   "No, I will not;" so Jesus warned against covetousness]: for a man's
   life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
   [A man's goods are no part of his life, and so they can not preserve
   it. It is lengthened or shortened, blessed or cursed, at the decree of
   God. Covetousness is an inordinate desire for earthly possession.
   Though all ages have committed it, it is the besetting sin of our time.
   A clear view of the limitations of the power of property quenches
   covetousness; and Jesus gives such a view in the following parable.] 16
   And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich
   man brought forth plentifully [This man's sin was not theft or
   extortion. His wealth came to him honestly as a blessing from God]: 17
   and he reasoned within himself, saying [his words betray his sin--his
   covetousness], What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my
   fruits? 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
   build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods. 19
   And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods [Prov. i. 32]
   laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. [It is a
   short speech, but it reveals character. The man's selfishness is shown
   in that he uses the pronoun "I" six times, and says nothing of anyone
   else. His covetous love of possessions is shown by the word "my," which
   he uses five times. Compare his words with those of Nabal at I. Sam.
   xxv. 11. In his speech to his soul he asserts his trust that his
   "abundance" is a guarantee of "many years" of happy life; but it did
   not guarantee one day. The Eastern barn is a pit or dry cistern built
   underground with an opening at the top. These the man proposed to
   enlarge by pulling down the walls or sides and extending them.] 20 But
   God said unto him [God may be represented as saying what he does], Thou
   foolish one [His folly was shown in several ways: 1. He hoarded his
   goods instead of using them for his fellow-men; 2. Ownership of goods
   deceived him into thinking that he owned time also; 3. He thought to
   satisfy the hunger of the soul with the food of the body; 4. In
   commanding his soul in such a way as to show that he forgot that God
   could command it also], this night is thy soul required of thee [the
   man said "many years," but God said "this night"]; and the things which
   thou hast prepared, whose shall they be? [Death generally scatters
   possessions broadcast (Ps. xxxix. 6; Eccl. ii. 18, 19). For an echo of
   these words see Jas. iv. 13-15 .] 21 So is he that layeth up treasure
   for himself, and is not rich toward God. [To be rich in character is to
   be rich toward God. But we may be rich towards him by making him the
   repository of our hopes and expectations.] 22 And he said unto his
   disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what
   ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. 23 For the
   life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment. 24 Consider
   the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no
   store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more value are
   ye than the birds! 25 And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit
   unto the measure of his life? 26 If then ye are not able to do even
   that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest? [If you
   can not add one little moment to your life, why should you be anxious
   about the smaller concerns of property?] 27 Consider the lilies, how
   they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I saw unto you,
   Even Solomon in all his glory [Song iii. 6-11] was not arrayed like one
   of these. 28 But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which
   to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more shall he
   clothe you, O ye of little faith? 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat,
   and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 30 For all
   these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father
   knoweth that ye have need of these things. 31 Yet seek ye his kingdom,
   and these things shall be added unto you. [This passage from verses 22
   to 31 (excepting verse 26) will be found almost verbatim at Matt. vi.
   25-33. See pages 257-259.] 32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your
   Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell that which ye
   have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a
   treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near,
   neither moth destroyeth. 34 For where your treasure is, there will your
   heart be also. [The latter part of this section will be found at Matt.
   vi. 20, 21. See page 256. The original for the words "little flock" is
   a double diminutive, indicating at once the extreme smallness of the
   band of disciples, and also the tenderness of the Master for them. They
   are exhorted to remember that they are the heirs of the heavenly
   kingdom, and that their treasures are there. They are told to sell
   their possessions and give, because their official position in the
   kingdom at that time required it. Compare I. Cor. vii. 36. Purses were
   bound to the girdles, so that if a hole wore in them, their contents
   were lost. Having discussed the folly of amassing and trusting in
   earthly riches, and the wisdom of trusting in God, and amassing
   heavenly riches, Jesus passes to a new theme; viz.: a watchful service
   and its rewards. He may have been led into this theme by some
   interruption, such as that given at verse 13 or that at verse 41, or it
   may have been suggested to him by his own words about the little flock
   and the kingdom. The kingdom was not to come in a day, and the little
   flock must watch patiently and serve faithfully before his coming--Luke
   xix. 11-13.] 35 Let your loins be girded about [the long Oriental robe
   had to be lifted up and girded at the waist before the feet could step
   quickly--I. Kings xviii. 46 ], and your lamps burning [this was
   needful; for Oriental weddings take place at night]; 36 and be ye
   yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he will return
   from the marriage feast; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may
   straightway open unto him. [Thus honoring him by a speedy welcome.] 37
   Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find
   watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make
   them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them. [The apostles had
   a foretaste of this honor on the evening of the last Passover--John
   xiii. 4, 5.] 38 And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the
   third, and find them so, blessed are those servants. [Originally the
   Jews had three watches (Lam. ii. 19; Judg. vii. 19; I. Sam. xi. 11);
   but, following the Romans, they now had four watches. The second and
   third watches lasted from 9 P. M. to 3 A. M. The first watch is not
   mentioned because the marriage took place in it, and the fourth is not
   mentioned because in the latter part of it the day dawns and the virtue
   of watching was over--Luke xiii. 35.] 39 But know this, that if the
   master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he
   would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through.
   [Jesus here illustrates watchfulness by a second figure. To some the
   coming of Jesus will be like that of a master whom they have served
   more or less faithfully. To others his coming will seem like that of a
   plunderer who comes in suddenly and deprives them of all they have. The
   Oriental houses were mostly made of mud or sun-dried bricks. Hence it
   was so easy to dig a hole in the wall than that the thief preferred to
   enter that way rather than to break open the door.] 40 Be ye also
   ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh. [These
   words of warning confront every generation.] 41 And Peter said, Lord,
   speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all? [Peter wished to
   know if the exhortation to watchfulness applied merely to the apostles
   or to all who heard.] 42 And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful
   and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give
   them their portion of food in due season? 43 Blessed is that servant,
   whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. [The answer of Jesus
   shows that he especially addressed the disciples, for a steward is
   distinct from the household. On him the whole burden and care of the
   domestic establishment rested. Thus Jesus showed that he meant the
   disciples, yet did not exclude any who heard from profiting by his
   discourse. Fidelity is the first requisite in a steward, and wisdom is
   the second. All Christians are stewards; preachers, elders,
   Sunday-school teachers, etc., are stewards of place and office. Rich
   men, fathers, etc., are stewards of influence and possessions.] 44 Of a
   truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath. [As
   Pharaoh exalted Joseph--Gen. xxxix. 4; xli. 39-41.] 45 But if that
   servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall
   begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and
   drink, and to be drunken; 46 the lord of that servant shall come in a
   day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and
   shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.
   [Cutting asunder was a punishment prevalent among ancient nations ( II.
   Sam. xii. 31; Dan. ii. 5; Heb. xi. 37). The definite punishment is part
   of the drapery of the parable, and does not necessarily indicate the
   exact nature of the punishment which will be inflicted upon the
   wicked.] 47 And that servant, who knew his lord's will, and made not
   ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
   stripes. 48 but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes,
   shall be beaten with few stripes. And to whomsoever much is given, of
   him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will
   they ask the more. [The greater the powers and opportunities entrusted
   to us, the larger the service which the Lord requires of us. Ignorance
   does not entirely excuse, for we are stewards, and it is the steward's
   duty to know his master's will. There is a guilt of ignorance as well
   as of transgression. The parable pointed to those who listened with
   delight to Jesus, but were careless about knowing his meaning. With the
   forty-ninth verse Jesus passes on to set forth the severe tests to
   which the fidelity and vigilance of his disciples would be subjected in
   the times upon which they were about to enter.] 49 I came to cast fire
   [a firebrand] upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already
   kindled? [The object of Christ's coming was to rouse men to spiritual
   conflict, to kindle a fire in the public mind which would purify the
   better part and destroy the worse. But the burning of this fire would
   excite men and stir up their passions and cause division and discord.
   The opposition of the Pharisees showed that this fire was already
   kindled. What therefore was left for Jesus to desire? His work as a
   teacher was practically accomplished. But there remained for him yet
   his duty as priest to offer himself as a sacrifice for the world's sin.
   To this work, therefore, he glances briefly forward.] 50 But I have a
   baptism to be baptized with [a flood of suffering; that is, the agony
   of the cross] ; and how am I straitened [distressed, perplexed] till it
   be accomplished! [The language here is broken, indicating the strong
   emotion of him who spoke it.] 51 Think ye that I am come to give peace
   in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: 52 for there shall
   be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and
   two against three. 53 They shall be divided, father against son, and
   son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her
   mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law
   against her mother in law. [Jesus here shows the hard plight of the
   disciple. If he were the young son he would find his father against
   him, and if he were the aged father he would be persecuted by the boy
   whom he had raised. Jesus came to conquer a peace by overcoming evil
   with good; a conflict in which the good must always suffer. His warfare
   was not, as the people supposed, a struggle against the heathen, but
   against the evil within them and around them. So long as evil abounded,
   these unhappy divisions would last.] 54 And he said to the multitudes
   also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west [the Mediterranean Sea lay
   in that quarter, and rains came from thence], straightway ye say, There
   cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass. 55 And when ye see a south
   wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to
   pass. [The south winds of Palestine blew from the equator, crossed the
   intervening deserts and wildernesses, and were distressingly hot.] 56
   Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and of
   the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?
   [That is, this period which began with the ministry of John the
   Baptist. They could at once read the signs of nature so as to declare
   what kind of storm was coming. But with the political storm arising out
   of conflict with Rome impending over them, and with the spiritual storm
   which the teaching of Christ was bringing upon them, about to burst,
   they stood still in ignorant indifference, and made no provision for
   the times of trouble.] 57 And why even of yourselves judge ye not what
   is right? [They had the warnings of both John and Jesus about matters
   and conditions which were so plain that they should have been able to
   see them without any warning whatever.] 58 For as thou art going with
   thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way, give diligence to be
   quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge
   shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into
   prison. 59 I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
   till thou have paid the very last mite. [A mite (lepton,) was their
   smallest coin, being worth about two mills. For notes on this passage,
   see Matt. v. 25, 26, pages 239, 240. The passage here is an appeal to
   the people to avert the coming disasters. The Jewish rulers looked upon
   Jesus as their adversary. Accepting their valuation of him, Jesus
   counseled them to come to terms with him before it is too late.]

LIII.

Repentance Enjoined. Parable of the Barren Fig-Tree.

^C Luke XIII. 1-9.

   ^c 1 Now there were some present at that very season [At the time when
   he preached about the signs of the times, etc. This phrase, however, is
   rather indefinite--Matt. xii. 1; xiv. 1] who told him of the
   Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And
   he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were
   sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these
   things? 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like
   manner perish. [While Jesus spoke, certain ones came to him bearing the
   news of a barbaric act of sacrilegious cruelty committed by Pilate. It
   may have been told to Jesus by enemies who hoped to ensnare him by
   drawing from him a criticism of Pilate. But it seems more likely that
   it was told to him as a sample of the corruption and iniquity of the
   times. The Jews ascribed extraordinary misfortunes to extraordinary
   criminality. Sacrifice was intended to cleanse guilt. How hopeless,
   therefore, must their guilt be who were punished at the very times when
   they should have been cleansed! But the Jews erred in this interpreting
   the event. Quantity of individual sin can not safely be inferred from
   the measure of individual misfortune. It was true that the Galilæans
   suffered because of sin, for all suffering is the result of sin. But it
   was not true that the suffering was punishment for unusual sinfulness.
   Our suffering is often due to the general sin of humanity--the sin of
   the whole associate body of which we are a part. History, of course,
   says nothing of Pilate's act here mentioned. Pilate's rule was marked
   by cruelty towards Jews, and contempt for their religious views and
   rites.] 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
   killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that
   dwell in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall
   all likewise perish. [Of this instance, also, there is no other
   historic mention. It, too was a small incident among the accidents of
   the day. The pool of Siloam lies near the southeast corner of
   Jerusalem, at the entrance of the Tyropæan village which runs up
   between Mt. Zion and Moriah. The modern village of Siloam probably did
   not exist at that time. What tower this was is not known. As the city
   wall ran through the district of that fountain, it may possibly have
   been one of the turrets of that wall. This instance presents a striking
   contrast to the slaughter of which they had told him, for it was, 1.
   Inflicted upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and 2. It came upon them
   as an act of God. And Jesus therefore concludes that all shall likewise
   perish, he pronounces upon the entire people--Jews and Galilæan
   alike--a punishment made certain by the decree of God. It is
   significant that the Jewish people did, as a nation, perish and lie
   buried under the falling walls of their cities, and the debris of their
   temple, palaces, and houses. But the word "likewise" is not to be
   pressed to cover this fact.] 6 And he spake this parable [this parable
   is closely connected with verses 3 and 5 of this chapter, and verses 58
   and 59 of the preceding chapter]; A certain man had a fig tree planted
   in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. 7
   And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come
   seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it
   also cumber the ground? [It cumbered the ground by occupying ground
   which the vines should have had, and by interfering with their light by
   its shade, which is very dense.] 8 And he answering saith unto him,
   Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung
   it [a common method of treating the fig-tree to induce fruitfulness]: 9
   and if it bear fruit henceforth, well: and if not, thou shalt cut it
   down. [In this parable Jesus likened his hearers to a fig-tree planted
   in a choice place--a vineyard, the odd corners of which are still used
   as advantageous spots for fig-trees. There is no emphasis on the number
   three, and no allusion to the national history of the Jews, as some
   suppose. It simply means that a fig-tree's failure to bear fruit for
   three years would justify its being cut down. Those to whom Jesus spoke
   had been called to repentance by the preaching both of John and of
   Jesus, and had had ample time and opportunity to bring forth the fruits
   of repentance, and deserved to be destroyed; but they would still be
   allowed further opportunity.]

   ^a 1 On that day went Jesus out of the house [It is possible that
   Matthew here refers to the house mentioned at Mark iii. 19. If so, the
   events in Sections XLVIII.-LVI. all occurred on the same day. There are
   several indications in the gospel narratives that this is so], and sat

   entered into a boat, and sat in the sea [that the multitudes might be
   better able to see and hear him]; and all the multitude ^a stood on the

   appears to have been the first occasion when he strung them together so
   as to form a discourse. Parable comes from the Greek paraballo, which
   means, "I place beside" in order to compare. It is the placing of a
   narrative describing an ordinary event in natural life beside an
   implied spiritual narrative for the purpose of illustrating the
   spiritual.]

Parable of the Sower.

^A Matt. XIII. 3-23; ^B Mark IV. 3-25; ^C Luke VIII. 5-18.

   ^a Behold, ^c 5 The sower went forth to sow his seed [Orientals live in
   cities and towns. Isolated farmhouses are practically unknown. A farmer
   may therefore live several miles from his field, in which case he
   literally "goes forth" to it]:   ^b 4 And it came to pass, as he sowed,
   some seed { ^a seeds } fell by the way side, ^c and it was trodden
   under foot, and the birds of heaven ^a came and ^c devoured it up. { ^a
   them:} [Palestine is an unfenced land, and the roads or paths lead
   through the fields. They are usually trodden hard by centuries of use.
   Grain falling on them could not take root. Its fate was either to be
   crushed by some foot, or to be carried off by some bird.] ^b 5 And
   other { ^a others} fell upon the rocky places, ^c on the rock; ^b where
   it { ^a they} ^b had not much earth; and straightway it { ^a they} ^b
   sprang up, because it { ^a they} ^b had no deepness of earth: 6 and
   when the sun was risen, it was { ^a they were} ^b scorched; and because
   it { ^a they} ^b had no root, it { ^a they} withered away. ^c and as
   soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. [This
   seed fell upon a ledge of rock covered with a very thin coating of
   soil. Its roots were prevented by the rock from striking down to the
   moisture, and so under the blazing Syrian sun it died ere it had well
   begun to live.] ^b 7 And other { ^a others} ^b fell among { ^a upon ^c
   amidst} ^b the thorns, and the thorns grew up, ^c with it, ^b and
   choked it, { ^a them:} ^b and it yielded no fruit. [Palestine abounds
   in thorns. Celsius describes sixteen varieties of thorny plants. Porter
   tells us that in the Plain of Gennesaret thistles grow so tall and rank
   that a horse can not push through them.] 8 And others { ^c other} ^b
   fell into { ^a upon} ^b the good ground, ^c and grew, and brought forth
   a hundredfold, ^b and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and
   brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. { ^a some
   a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.} [Thirty-fold is a good crop in
   Palestine, but it is asserted that a hundred-fold has been reaped in
   the Plain of Esdraelon even in recent years. These four several
   conditions of soil may be readily found lying close to each other in
   the Plain of Gennesaret. A sowing like this described may have been
   enacted before the eyes of the people even while Jesus was speaking.]
   ^c As he said these things, he cried [a method of emphasis rarely
   employed by Jesus], ^b 9 And he said, ^a 9 He that { ^b Who} hath ears
   to hear, let him hear. [A saying often used by Jesus. He intended it to
   prevent the people from regarding the parable as merely a beautiful
   description. It warned them of a meaning beneath the surface, and
   incited them to seek for it.] 10 And when he was alone [that is, after
   he had finished speaking all the parables. The explanation of the
   parable is put next to the parable to aid us in understanding it], ^a
   the disciples came, ^b they that were about him with the twelve ^c 9
   and his disciples ^b asked him of the parables. ^c what this parable
   might be. ^a and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in
   parables? [Their questions show that as yet parables were unusual.] 11
   And he answered and said unto them, Unto you is given to know the
   mysteries { ^b is given the mystery} ^a of the kingdom of heaven, { ^b
   of God:} ^a but to them ^c the rest ^a it is not given. [save] ^c in
   parables; ^b unto them that are without, all things are done in
   parables. [Jesus adapted his lessons to the condition of his pupils;
   hence his disciples might know what the multitude must not yet know (I.
   Cor. ii. 6-11). Jesus already drew a line of demarcation between
   disciples and unbelievers; which line became more marked and visible
   after the church was organized at Pentecost. The word "mystery" in
   current language means that which is not understood; but as used in the
   Scriptures it means that which is not understood because it has not
   been revealed, but which is plain as soon as revealed. Bible mysteries
   are not unraveled by science, but are unfolded by revelation--Col. i.
   26; I. Tim. iii. 16; Matt. xi. 25, 26; Rev. xvii. 5; Dan. ii. 47.] ^a
   12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
   abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even
   that which he hath. [To understand this saying, we must remember that
   it was the teaching of Jesus which was under discussion. In the
   beginning of his ministry Jesus taught plainly, and all his hearers had
   equal opportunity to know his doctrine and believe in him. But from now
   on his teaching would be largely veiled in parables. These parables
   would enrich their knowledge and understanding of the believers; but
   they would add nothing to the store of unbelievers, and their efforts
   to understand the parables would withdraw their minds from the truths
   which they had already learned, so that they would either forget them
   or fail to profit by them. If we improve our opportunities, they bring
   us to other and higher ones; but if we neglect them, even the initial
   opportunities are taken away.] 13 Therefore speak I to them in
   parables: ^b 12 that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing
   they may hear, and not understand; { ^c that seeing they may not see,
   and hearing they may not understand.} ^a because seeing they see not,
   and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. ^b lest haply
   they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them. ^a 14 And unto
   them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah [Isa. vi. 9, 10], which saith,
   By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing
   ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 15 For this people's heart
   is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing. And their eyes they
   have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear
   with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn
   again, and I should heal them. [The language here is an elaboration of
   the thoughts contained in the twelfth verse. The people saw Christ's
   miracles, but not in their true light; they heard his words, but not in
   their true meaning. Jesus could thus teach without hindrance, but,
   unfortunately for the unbelieving, they were hearing without obtaining
   any blessing. In the original passage which Matthew quotes, Isaiah is
   apparently commanded to harden the hearts of the people. If read
   superficially, it might seem that God desired to harden their hearts.
   The true meaning is that God commanded Isaiah to teach, even though the
   people, by hardening themselves against his teaching, should be made
   worse rather than better by it. Thus, though rebellious, Israel might
   not be blessed by Isaiah's teaching; they might, by their example,
   waken a wholesome fear in their posterity, and cause it to avoid like a
   sin.] 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for
   they hear. [Jesus here addresses his disciples, who were a cheering
   contrast to the unbelievers.] 17 For verily I say unto you, that many
   prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and
   saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
   [Our Lord here gives us a glance into the very hearts of the prophets,
   and reveals to us their desire to be witnesses of Messiah's ministry.
   But knowing they were not to see their visions realized, they contented
   themselves with trying to understand the full meaning of their visions,
   that they might anticipate the days which were to come--I. Pet. i.
   10-12.] ^b 13 And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how
   shall ye know all the parables? [This is a concession rather than a
   reproof. Parables could not be understood without a key; but a few
   examples of parables explained would furnish such a key.] ^a 18 Hear
   then ye the parable of the sower. ^c 11 Now the parable is this: The
   seed is the word of God. ^b 14 The sower soweth the word. 15 And these
   { ^c those} ^b by the way side, where the word is sown; ^a are they
   that have heard; ^b and when they have heard,; ^c then ^b straightway
   cometh Satan, ^c the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart,
   ^b which hath been sown in them. ^c that they may not believe and be
   saved. ^a 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
   understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that
   which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way
   side. [The four soils are four hearts into which truth is sown. The
   first heart, represented by the wayside, is one which is too hardened
   for the Word to make any impression. It represents several classes of
   people, as: 1. Those whose hearts have been made insensible by the
   routine of meaningless rites and lifeless formalities. 2. Those who had
   deadened their sensibilities by perversity and indifference. 3. Those
   whose hearts were hardened by the constant march and countermarch of
   evil thoughts. God's word lies on the surface of such hearts, and Satan
   can use any insignificant or innocent passing thoughts as a bird to
   carry out of their minds anything which they may have heard. The
   preacher's voice has scarcely died away until some idle criticism of
   him or some careless bit of gossip about a neighbor causes them to
   forget the sermon.] ^b 16 And these { ^c those} ^b in like manner are
   they that are sown upon the rocky places, { ^c rock} ^b who, when they
   have heard the word, straightway receive it { ^c the word} with joy; ^b
   17 and they { ^c these} ^b have no root in themselves, but endure { ^c
   who believe} for a while; ^b then, when affliction or persecution
   ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble. ^c and in time
   of temptation fall away. ^a 20 And he that was sown upon the rocky
   places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy
   receiveth it; 21 yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a
   while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
   straightway he stumbleth. [This shallow, rock-covered soil represents
   those who are deficient in tenacity of purpose. Those who receive the
   word, but whose impulsive, shallow nature does not retain it, and whose
   enthusiasm was as short-lived as it was vigorous. Any opposition,
   slight or severe, makes them partial or total apostates. As sunlight
   strengthens the healthy plant, but withers the sickly, ill-rooted one,
   so tribulation establishes real faith, but destroys its counterfeit.]
   ^b 18 And others are they that are sown { ^c which fell} among the
   thorns, these are they that have heard, ^b the word, ^c and as they go
   on their way ^b the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of
   riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
   it becometh unfruitful. ^c they are choked with cares and riches and
   pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. ^a 22 And he
   that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and
   the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choked the
   word, and he becometh unfruitful. [This third class represents those
   who begin well, but afterwards permit worldly cares to gain the
   mastery. These to-day outnumber all other classes, and perhaps they
   have always been so.] ^b 20 And those are they that were sown upon { ^c
   15 And that in} the good ground; these are such as in an honest and
   good heart, having heard { ^b hear} ^c the word, hold it fast, ^b and
   accept it, and bear ^c and bring forth fruit with patience. ^b
   thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. ^a 23 And he that was
   sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and
   understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a
   hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [Christianity requires three
   things: a sower, good seed or a pure gospel, and an honest hearer. All
   hearers are not equal in faithfulness. But we are not to take it that
   the diversity is limited to the three rates or proportions specified.
   Of the four hearts indicated, the first one hears, but heeds nothing;
   the second one heeds, but is checked by external influences; the third
   heeds, but is choked by internal influences; the fourth heeds and holds
   fast until the harvest. Gallio exemplifies the first (Acts xviii. 17).
   Peter and Mark for a time exemplified the second (Mark xiv. 66-72; Acts
   xii. 25; xiii. 13; xv. 37-39). The rich ruler and Demas represent the
   third (Matt. xix. 22; II. Tim. iv. 10), as does also Judas Iscariot.
   Cornelius and the Beræans (Acts x. 33; xvii. 11) show us examples of
   the fourth.] ^b 21 And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put
   under the bushel, or under a bed, and not to be put on the stand? ^c 16
   No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or
   putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they which
   enter in may see the light. [A passage similar to this is found at
   Matt. v. 15. See page 235.] ^b 22 For there is nothing hid, save that
   it should be manifested; { ^c that shall not be made manifest;} ^b
   neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light. {
   ^c that shall not be known and come to light.} ^b 23 If any man hath
   ears to hear, let him hear. [This passage is often taken to indicate
   the exposure of all things on the day of judgment. While all things
   shall be revealed at the judgment, this passage does not refer to that
   fact. Jesus did not come to put his light under a bushel; that is, to
   hide his teaching. All inner instruction and private information was
   but temporary. Our Lord's design was to reveal, not conceal. What was
   now concealed was only to keep back that in the end it might be more
   fully known. Jesus covered his light as one might shelter a candle with
   his hand until the flame has fully caught hold of the wick.] 24 And he
   said unto them, ^c Take heed therefore how { ^b what} ye hear: with
   what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be
   given unto you. ^c for whosoever { ^b he that} hath, to him shall be
   given: ^c and whosoever { ^b he that} hath not, from him shall be taken
   away even that which he hath. { ^c which he thinketh he hath.} [Most of
   this passage has been explained just above. See page 331. It warns us
   as to what we hear--things carnal or spiritual--and how we hear them,
   whether carefully or carelessly. As we measure attention unto the Lord,
   he measures back knowledge to us.]

Parable of the Seed Growing Itself.

^B Mark IV. 26-29.

   ^b 26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
   seed upon the earth; 27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and
   the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how. [In the kingdom
   of grace, as well as in the kingdom of nature, we are laborers together
   with God. As preachers, teachers, or friends we sow the seed of the
   kingdom and God brings it to perfection (I. Cor. iii. 6-9). The seed
   here spoken of, being wheat or barley, needed no cultivation, and hence
   the planter let it alone, and did not know how it grew, whether fast or
   slow, or even whether it grew at all.] 28 The earth beareth fruit of
   herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
   29 But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle,
   because the harvest is come. [Truth, spoken, lies hidden in the human
   breast, and we do not see its earliest stages of its development, but
   as it proceeds toward perfection, it becomes step by step more visible.
   In both fields the sower has little to do with the field between the
   time of sowing and reaping. In the spiritual field, however, it is well
   to keep sowing until the grain shows signs of sprouting.]

The Parable of the Tares.

^A Matt. XIII. 24-30.

   ^a 24 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
   is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: 25 but while
   men slept [while they innocently rested, not while they were
   negligent], his enemy came and sowed tares [darnel, which closely
   resembles our cheat] also among the wheat, and went away. [Though not
   common, there have been instances of such malignant mischief as is here
   indicated.] 26 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit,
   then appeared the tares also. [The difference between darnel and wheat
   does not become apparent until the two kinds of grain are nearly ripe.]
   27 And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
   didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?
   28 And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants say
   unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he
   saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the
   wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in
   the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the
   tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into
   my barn. [The roots of wheat and darnel so intertwine that they can not
   be separated without pulling up both. Jesus' explanation of this
   parable will be found below in [2]Subdivision F.]

Parables of the Mustard Seed and Leaven.

^A Matt. XIII. 31-35; ^B Mark IV. 30-34.

   ^a 31 Another parable set he before them, saying, ^b 30 And he said,
   How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set
   it forth? [These questions are intended to emphasize the superior
   excellence of the kingdom.] 31 It ^a The kingdom of heaven is like unto
   a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: ^b a
   grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though ^a
   indeed ^b it be { ^a is} ^b less than all the seeds that are upon the
   earth [that is, the smallest of all the seeds that are sown in a
   garden], ^a but ^b 32 yet when it is sown, groweth up, and ^a when it
   is grown, it is { ^b becometh} greater than all the herbs, and putteth
   out great branches; ^a and becometh a tree [in Palestine it attains the
   height of ten feet], so that the birds of the heaven come and ^b can
   lodge under the shadow thereof. ^a in the branches thereof. [This
   parable sets forth the smallness of the beginning of the kingdom, and
   the magnitude of its growth.] 33 Another parable spake he unto them;
   The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid
   in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened. [In Oriental
   housekeeping, yeast is not preserved in a separate form. A piece of
   leavened dough saved over from the last baking is added to the new
   dough to ferment it. Three measures contained the quantity usually
   taken for one baking. Leaven represents the quickness, quietness,
   thoroughness, and sureness with which gospel truth diffuses itself
   through human society. A woman is named because baking was part of her
   household duty.] 34 All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the
   multitudes; ^b 33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto
   them, as they were able to hear it [that is, as they had leisure or
   opportunity to listen]; 34 and without a parable spake he not { ^a
   nothing} unto them [that is, he used nothing but parables on that
   occasion, for both before and after this he taught without parables]:
   35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet [at
   Ps. lxxviii. 2 which is usually attributed to Asaph, who is called a
   seer (II. Chron. xxix. 30). His teaching typified that of Christ],
   saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden
   from the foundation of the world. [Jesus fulfilled this prophecy in a
   notable manner, being the only teacher in history distinguished in any
   marked degree by the use of parables.] ^b but privately to his own
   disciples he expounded all things.

The Parable of the Tares Explained.

^A Matt. XIII. 36-43.

   ^a 36 Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house [probably
   Simon Peter's house]: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain
   unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 And he answered and
   said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 38 and the field
   is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and
   the tares are the sons of the evil one; 39 and the enemy that sowed
   them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers
   are angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with
   fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall
   send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all
   things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, 42 and shall
   cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the
   gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun
   in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear. [This
   parable and its explanation are sometimes urged as an argument against
   church discipline, but such a use of them is clearly erroneous. The
   field is not the church, but the world, and the teaching of the parable
   is that we are not to attempt to exterminate evil men. Any who attempt
   to exterminate heretics in the name of Christ by physical force are
   condemned by this parable.]

Parables of Treasure, Pearl, and Net.

^A Matt. XIII. 44-53.

   ^a 44 The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in the field; the
   which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all
   that he hath, and buyeth that field. [The three parables in this
   section appear to have been addressed privately to the disciples. In
   the absence of banks and other trust repositories, the men of that day
   hid their treasures as best they could. The sudden death of the hider
   often resulted in the loss of all knowledge as to the whereabouts of
   the treasure. The parable speaks of such a lost treasure. Technically
   it belonged to the owner of the field, but practically it belonged to
   him who found it. Hence the finder conceals it again until he had made
   perfect his title to it by the purchase of the field. The gist of the
   parable does not require us to pass upon the conduct of the finder,
   which was certainly questionable.] 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is
   like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: 46 and having
   found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and
   bought it. [In the preceding parable the treasure was found by
   accident; in this, the pearl was sought. Some find without seeking, as
   did the Samaritan woman (John iv. 28, 29); some only after diligent
   search, as did the eunuch-- Acts viii. 27.] 47 Again, the kingdom of
   heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of
   every kind: 48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach;
   and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they
   cast away. 49 So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall
   come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous, 50 and shall
   cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the
   gnashing of teeth. [Like the parable of the tares, this one indicates
   the continuance of the mixture of bad and good, and points to the final
   separation. The contents of a net can not be sorted while it is being
   drawn. The tares indicate such evils as can be seen and as tempt us to
   uproot them. The net shows that in the dark and turbulent waters, and
   in the hurry-skurry of its teeming life, there are things which can not
   be seen. The judgment shall be with care, as when men, in the broad
   light of day, on the quiet beach, sit down to sort the fish. If the
   parable of the tares emphasizes the waiting, the parable of the net
   emphasizes the careful sorting.] 51 Have ye understood all these
   things? They say unto him, Yea. 52 And he said unto them, Therefore
   every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is
   like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his
   treasure things new and old. [As a householder graces his banquet with
   things already in the house, and with other things which have just been
   provided, so a religious teacher must refresh his hearers out of both
   his past and his present experiences and study. Old lessons must be
   clothed in new garments.] 53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had
   finished these parables, he departed thence. [He went from the house to
   the sea in the afternoon, and entering a boat a little later, he
   stilled the storm.]

Jesus Stills the Storm.

(Sea of Galilee; Same Day as Last Section)

^A Matt. VIII. 18-27; ^B Mark IV. 35-41; ^C Luke VIII. 22-25.

   ^b 35 And that day, { ^c one of those days,} ^b when the even was come
   [about sunset], ^a when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
   commandment to depart unto the other side. { ^b he saith unto them, Let
   us go over unto the other side.} [Wearied with a day of strenuous toil,
   Jesus sought rest from the multitude by passing to the thinly settled
   on the east side of Galilee.] ^a 19 And there came a scribe [Literally,
   one scribe. The number is emphatic; for, so far as the record shows,
   Jesus had none of this class among his disciples], and said unto him,
   Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 20 And Jesus
   saith unto him, The foxes have holes [caves, dens], and the birds of
   the heaven have nests; but the Son of man [Daniel's name for the
   Messiah-- Dan. vii. 10-13] hath not where to lay his head. [This scribe
   had heard the wonderful parables concerning the kingdom. He, like all
   others, expected an earthly kingdom and sought to have a place in it.
   Jesus so replied as to correct his false expectations.] 21 And another
   of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my
   father. [This disciple must have been one of the twelve, for these only
   were required to follow Jesus (Mark iii. 14). It may have been James or
   John, whose father, Zebedee, almost certainly died before Jesus did. He
   may have just heard of his father's death. [6] ] 22 But Jesus saith
   unto him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead. [Let
   the spiritually dead bury the naturally dead. This was a very
   exceptional prohibition, intended to show not that it was ordinarily
   wrong to stop for burying the dead, but wrong when in conflict with a
   command from Jesus. God bids us recognize the claims of filial duty,
   but rightfully insists that our duties toward him are superior to those
   due our parents.] ^c 22 Now it came to pass that he entered into a
   boat, himself and his disciples; ^a 23 And when he was entered into a
   boat, his disciples followed him. ^c and he said unto them, Let us go
   over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. ^b 36
   And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in
   the boat. [They took Jesus without any preparation for the journey. The
   crowd, doubtless, made it inconvenient to go ashore to get provisions.]
   And other boats were with him. [The owners of these boats had probably
   been using them to get near to Jesus as he preached. They are probably
   mentioned to show that a large number witnessed the miracle when Jesus
   stilled the tempest.] ^c 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep. [knowing
   his labors during the day, we can not wonder at this]: ^b 37 And there
   ariseth ^c and there came down ^b a great storm of wind, ^c on the
   lake; ^a 24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,
   insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: ^b and the waves
   beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. ^c and they
   were filling with water, and were in jeopardy. [These storms come with
   great suddenness. See McGarvey's "Lands of the Bible," page 519.] ^b 38
   And { ^a but} ^b he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion
   [The cushion was the seat-cover, which, as Smith remarks, was probably
   "a sheepskin with the fleece, which, when rolled up, served as a
   pillow." The stern was the most commodious place for passengers. The
   tossing ship has been accepted in all ages as a type of the church in
   seasons of peril]: ^a 25 And they came to him, and awoke him, { ^b they
   awake him,} and say unto him, { ^a saying,} Save, Lord; we perish. ^c
   Master, master, we perish. ^b Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
   [There was a babble of confused voices, betraying the extreme agitation
   of the disciples.] 39 And he awoke, ^a Then he arose, and rebuked the
   winds, { ^b wind,} ^a and the sea; ^c and the raging of the water; ^b
   and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. ^c and they ceased, ^b And the
   wind ceased, and there was a great calm. [In addressing the winds and
   waves Jesus personified them to give emphasis to his authority over
   them. The calm showed the perfection of the miracle, for the waves of
   such a lake continue to roll long after the winds have ceased.] ^c 25
   And he said unto them, Where is your faith? ^b Why are ye yet fearful?
   have ye not yet faith? ^a O ye of little faith? [They had little faith
   or they would not have been so frightened; but they had some faith,
   else they would not have appealed to Jesus.] ^b 41 And they feared
   exceedingly, ^c And being afraid they ^a the men marvelled, ^b and said
   one to another, ^c saying one to another, ^a What manner of man is
   this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? ^c Who then is this,
   that he commandeth even the winds, and the water, and they obey him?
   [Jesus' complete lordship over the realm of nature made his disciples
   very certain of his divinity.]

Jesus Heals Two Gergesene Demoniacs.

(Gergesa, Now Called Khersa.)

^A Matt. VIII. 28-34; IX. 1; ^B Mark V. 1-21; ^C Luke VIII. 26-40.

   ^b 1 And they came to the other side of the sea [They left in the
   "even," an elastic expression. If they left in the middle of the
   afternoon and were driven forward by the storm, they would have reached
   the far shore several hours before dark], ^c 26 And they arrived at the
   country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. ^a 28 And when
   he was come into the country of the Gadarenes. ^c 27 And when he was
   come forth ^b out of the boat, ^c upon the land [Midway between the
   north and south ends of the lake, and directly east across the lake
   from Magdala, was the little city of Gergesa. In front and somewhat to
   the south of this city Jesus landed. Some sixteen miles away and to the
   southeast, and seven miles back from the lake, was the well-known city
   of Gadara. Further on to the southeast, on the borders of Arabia, and
   at least fifty miles from Gergesa, was the city of Gerasa. The name
   Gerasenes is, therefore, probably an error of the transcribers for
   Gergesenes, as Origen suggested. The region is properly called "country
   of the Gadarenes," for Gadara was an important city, and the stamp of a
   ship on its coins suggests that its territory extended to the Lake of
   Galilee], ^b straightway there met him out of the tombs ^c a certain
   man out of the city [Gergesa], ^b with an unclean spirit, ^c who had
   demons; ^b 3 who had his dwelling in the tombs: ^c and abode not in any
   house, but in the tombs. [The sides of the mountain near the ruins of
   Gergesa are studded with natural and artificial caves which were used
   as tombs.] ^b and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;
   4 because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the
   chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces:
   and no man had strength to tame him. 5 And always, night and day, in
   the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself
   with stones. [The natural spirit of the man seeking to throw off the
   dominion of the demons would cry out in agony, and the demons
   themselves, in their own misery, would use him as a vehicle to express
   their own grief. It would be hard to imagine a more horrible state] ^c
   and for a long time he had worn no clothes, ^b 6 and when he saw Jesus
   from afar, ^c he cried out, ^b he ran ^c and fell down before him, ^b
   and worshipped him; 7 and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, { ^c
   said,} What have I to do with thee [on this phrase, see page 116],
   Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, ^b I adjure thee
   by God, torment me no. ^c 29 For he was commanding the unclean spirit
   to come out from the man. [The demons showed the supremacy of Jesus not
   only by their cries to be let alone, but by the fact that they made no
   effort to escape from him. They ran to him, knowing that it was useless
   to do otherwise.] ^b 8 For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean
   spirit, out of the man. ^c For often-times he had seized him: and he
   was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking
   the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts. ^b 9
   And he ^c Jesus asked him, What is thy name? ^b And he saith { ^c said}
   ^b unto him, My name is Legion: for we are many. ^c for many demons
   were entered into him. [It is likely that Jesus asked the sufferer his
   name wishing to assure him of sympathy, but the demons in him had the
   floor and continued to do the talking. A legion was a division of the
   Roman army containing from four to six thousand men. If Jesus asked the
   demon its name, he did so that he might disclose this fact to his
   disciples.] ^b 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them
   away out of the country. [As one mouth entreated for many, Mark uses
   both the singular and the plural.] ^c 31 And they entreated him that he
   would not command them to depart into the abyss. [The abyss or
   bottomless pit was the proper abode of the demons. It is mentioned nine
   times in Scripture: here and at Rom. x. 7; Rev. ix. 1, 2, 11; xi. 7;
   xvii. 8; xx. 1, 3. How these demons escaped from the abyss is one of
   the unsolved mysteries of the spirit world; but we have a parallel in
   the releasing of Satan--Rev. xx. 1-3.] ^a 28b And there met him two
   possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce,
   so that no man could pass by that way. [Matthew tells of two, while
   Mark and Luke describe only one. They tell of the principal one--the
   one who was the fiercer. In order to tell of two, Matthew had to omit
   the name "legion," which belonged to one; and conversely, Mark and
   Luke, to give the conversation with one, did not confuse us by telling
   of two.] 29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do
   with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before
   the time? [The judgment-day, the time of punishment and torment--Matt.
   xxv. 41; II. Pet. ii. 4; Jude 6.] ^b 11 Now there was there ^a afar off
   from them ^b on the mountain side a great herd ^a of many swine
   feeding. 31 And the demons besought him, ^c and they entreated him that
   he would give them leave to enter into them. ^a saying, If thou cast us
   out, send us away into the herd of swine. ^b that we may enter into
   them. 13 And he gave them leave. ^a 32 And he said unto them, Go. And
   they ^b the unclean spirits ^c the demons came out of the man, and
   entered ^a and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed
   down the steep into the sea, { ^c the lake,} ^b in number about two
   thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. ^a and perished in the
   waters. [About a mile south of Khersa a spur of the mountain thrusts
   itself out toward the lake so that its foot is within forty feet of the
   water line. This is the only spot on that side of the lake where the
   mountains come near the water. The slope is so steep and the ledge at
   its foot so narrow that a herd rushing down could not check itself
   before tumbling into the water. Skeptics have censured Jesus for
   permitting this loss of property. God may recognize our property rights
   as against each other, but he nowhere recognizes them in the realm of
   nature. What was done to the swine was done by the demons, and the
   owners had no more right to complain than they would have had if the
   herd had been carried off by murrain, by flood, or by any other natural
   cause. All animals have a right to die, either singly or in numbers.
   The demons evidently did not intend to destroy the swine. Their desire
   to have live bodies to dwell in shows that they did not. But the
   presence of the demons in their bodies made the hogs crazy, as it had
   the demoniac, and they ran the way their noses were pointed at the
   moment. For discussion of demoniacal possession, see page 167.] ^c 34
   And when they that fed them [there being no fences in Palestine, herds
   were invariably attended by herdsmen] saw what had come to pass, they
   fled, and told it in the city and in the country. ^a and went away into
   the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were
   possessed with demons. 34 And, behold, all the city came out to meet
   Jesus [it was about half a mile from Khersa to the seashore]: ^b And
   they came { ^c went out} ^b to see what it was that had come to pass.
   15 And they come { ^c came} ^b to Jesus, ^c and found { ^b behold} ^c
   the man, ^b that was possessed with demons ^c from whom the demons were
   gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, ^b even him that had
   the legion [a faint suggestion that there was another]: ^c at the feet
   of Jesus: and they were afraid. ^b 16 And they saw it [the herdmen]
   declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, ^c
   36 And told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.
   ^b and concerning the swine. ^a and when they saw him, ^c 37 All the
   people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him ^b 17 And
   they began to beseech { ^a besought} ^b him ^a that he would depart {
   ^b to depart} from their borders. ^c from them; for they were holden
   with great fear [The loss of the swine moved them to a fear a further
   loss of property. To them the loss of swine was more important than the
   recovery of a man. To this day, worldly interests move men more than
   acts of mercy]: and he entered into a boat. ^b 18 And { ^c 38 But} ^b
   as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with
   demons ^c the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him { ^b
   besought him} that he might be with him. [As a frightened child newly
   wakened from a horrible dream clings to its parent, so the man clung to
   Christ.] ^c but he sent him away, ^b 19 And he suffered him not, but
   saith { ^c saying,} ^b unto him, Go ^c 39 Return to thy house, ^b unto
   thy friends, and tell them ^c and declare how great things God ^b the
   Lord hath done for thee, and how he had mercy on thee. [Jesus departed,
   but left behind him a witness whose very body was a living monument
   bearing testimony to Christ's compassion and power. Jesus revisited
   this locality some months later. See Mark vii. 31-37.] ^c and he went
   his way, publishing throughout the whole city [Gergesa] how great
   things Jesus had done for him. ^b and began to publish in Decapolis how
   great things Jesus had done for him [for the cities which constituted
   Decapolis, see page 173]: and all men marvelled. 21 And when Jesus had
   crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude
   was gathered unto him: and he was by the sea. ^c 40 And as Jesus
   returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for
   him. [They could see the sail of his boat as he started back.] ^a 1 And
   he came into his own city. [Capernaum.]

Matthew's Feast. Discourse on Fasting.

(Capernaum.)

^A Matt. IX. 10-17; ^B Mark II. 15-22; ^C Luke V. 29-39.

   ^c 29 And Levi [another name for the apostle Matthew] made him a great
   feast in his house: ^b 15 And it came to pass, that he was sitting { ^a
   as he sat} at meat in the { ^b his} ^a house, ^c and there was a great
   multitude of publicans [Matthew had invited his old friends] and of
   others ^b and ^a behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down
   with Jesus and his disciples. ^b for there were many, ^c that were
   sitting at meat with them. ^b and they followed him. ^c 30 And the
   Pharisees and their scribes { ^b the scribes of the Pharisees,} [that
   is, the scribes which were of their party or sect] when they saw that
   he was eating with the sinners and publicans, ^c murmured against his
   disciples, saying, { ^a they said} unto his disciples, ^c Why do ye eat
   and drink with the publicans and sinners? ^a Why eateth your Teacher
   with the publicans and sinners? ^b How is it that he eateth and
   drinketh with publicans and sinners? [From their standpoint, the
   question was natural enough. No strict Jew could eat with a Gentile
   (Acts xi. 3; Gal. ii. 12), and Matthew's guests were classed with the
   heathen.] ^a 12 But { ^b 17 And} ^a when he ^b Jesus heard it, he ^c
   answering said { ^b saith} unto them, They that are whole { ^c in
   health} have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. ^a 13 But
   go ye and learn what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice
   [For an explanation of this passage, see page 212. To mercifully help
   sinners to repent was more precious to God than sacrifice]: for ^c 32 I
   am not come { ^a I came not} to call the righteous, but sinners. ^c to
   repentance. [Being charged with recklessly consorting with sinners, it
   was necessary for Jesus to vindicate himself, else his influence would
   be damaged; hence he presents three arguments: 1. His office being
   analogous to that of a physician, required him to visit the sin-sick.
   2. God himself commended such an act of mercy, and preferred it to
   sacrifice; 3. As he came to call sinners to repentance, he must
   therefore go to the sinners. These arguments do not justify us in
   keeping company with bad people for any other purpose than to do them
   good--that is, as their soul's physician. When he used the word
   "righteous," Jesus did not mean to admit that any were so righteous as
   to need no Saviour; he merely quoted the Pharisees at the value which
   they set upon themselves.] ^b 18 And John's disciples and the Pharisees
   were fasting: and they come { ^a 14 Then come to him the disciples of
   John,} ^c 33 And they said { ^b say} unto him, ^a saying, ^c The
   disciples of John fast often, and make supplications [single
   penitential prayers with their fasting]; likewise also the disciples of
   the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink. [As John the Baptist observed
   one almost continual fast, his diet being locusts and wild honey, his
   disciples naturally had great respect for that rite, and noted the lack
   of its observance by Jesus as an apparent defect in his character. They
   were honest inquirers, and Jesus answered them respectfully as such.]
   ^a Why do we and the Pharisees { ^b John's disciples and the disciples
   of the Pharisees} ^a fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 15 And Jesus
   said unto them, ^c Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, { ^a
   mourn}, as long as { ^c while} the bridegroom is with them? ^b as long
   as they have with bridegroom with them, the cannot fast. [The
   bridegroom's friends were called "sons of the bride-chamber." They went
   with the bridegroom to the bride's house, and escorted her to her new
   home. Arriving at the bridegroom's house, a feast usually lasting seven
   days ensued (Matt. xxii. 4; Luke xiv. 8; John ii. 8, 9). Mourning and
   fasting would therefore ill befit such an occasion.] ^c 35 But the days
   will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, ^b and
   then will they fast in that day. { ^c those days.} [Jesus here
   foretells the removal of his visible presence from his disciples by his
   ascension. His words predict but do not command a fast. He prescribed
   no stated fasts, and the apostolic church kept none. History shows that
   prescribed fasts become formal and tend to Phariseeism.] 36 And he
   spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new
   garment and putteth it upon an old garment, else he will rend the new,
   and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old. ^a 16 And
   no man putteth { ^b seweth} a piece of undressed cloth on { ^a upon} an
   old garment; for { ^b else} that which should fill it up taketh from
   it, { ^a from the garment,} ^b the new from the old, and a worse rent
   is made. [Jesus justifies the conduct of his disciples by an appeal to
   the principles of the new dispensation, by which they were governed.
   The disciples of John looked upon Jesus as a reformer of Judaism, but
   he corrects their false impressions. To tear the new dispensation to
   pieces to renovate or embellish the old would be to injure the new and
   to destroy the old. By the process of fulling or dressing, new cloth
   was cleansed and shrunk so as to become more compact. The new cloth,
   therefore, had in it, so to speak, a life-element, and in its movement
   while shrinking it would tear the weaker fiber of the old cloth to
   which it was sewed, and thus enlarge the rent. The new dispensation
   could have rites and forms of its own, but could not conform to the
   rites of the Pharisees. If the conduct of his disciples had made a rent
   in the rabbinical traditions with regard to fasting, Jesus could not so
   modify the conduct of his disciples as to patch the rent without
   injuring the moral sense of his disciples, and without making
   Phariseeism a more meaningless hypocrisy than ever.] 22 And no man
   putteth { ^a 17 Neither do men put} new wine into old wine-skins: ^c
   else the the new wine will burst the skins, ^a and the wine ^c itself
   will be { ^a is} spilled, ^b and the wine perisheth, and the skins: ^a
   burst, ^c and the skins will perish. ^a but they put new wine { ^c new
   wine must be put} ^b into fresh wine-skins. ^a and both are preserved.
   [This parable is also an illustration of the principles set forth
   above. Wine was then stored in casks of skin--usually hides of goats.
   Wine-skins, newly made, were elastic, and would expand to accommodate
   the fermentation of the new wine within. But the old wine-skins were
   stiff and of little strength, and would burst if fermenting liquid were
   confined within them.] ^c 39 And no man having drunk old wine desireth
   new; for he saith, The old is good. [The thought here is that as wine
   should be put in skins suited for it, and as, at an entertainment, the
   different kinds of wine should be served in appropriate succession; so,
   fasting should be observed on suitable occasions--not, for instance, at
   a wedding.]

Jairus' Daughter and the Invalid Woman.

(Capernaum, Same Day as Last.)

^A Matt. IX. 18-26; ^B Mark V. 22-43; ^C Luke VIII. 41-56.

   ^c 41 And ^a 18 While he spake these things unto them [while he talked
   about fasting at Matthew's table], behold, there came, { ^b cometh} ^c
   a man named Jairus, { ^b Jairus by name;} ^c and he was a ruler { ^b
   one of the rulers} of the synagogue [He was one of the board of elders
   which governed the synagogue at Capernaum. These elders were not
   necessarily old men--Matt. xix. 16-22; Luke xviii. 18-23], and seeing
   him, ^c he fell { ^b falleth} ^c down at Jesus' feet, ^a and worshipped
   him [It was a very lowly act for the ruler of a synagogue thus to bow
   before the Man of Nazareth. But the ruler was in trouble, and his needs
   were stronger than his pride] , ^c and besought him to come into his
   house; 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
   she was dying. ^b 23 and beseecheth him much, saying, My little
   daughter is at the point of death: ^a is even now dead [he left her
   dying, and so stated his fears in the very strongest way]: but ^b I
   pray thee, that thou come and lay thy hands on { ^a hand upon} her, ^b
   that she may be made whole, and live. ^a and she shall live. 19 And
   Jesus arose [From Matthew's table. Jesus did not fast for form's sake,
   but he was ever ready to leave a feast that he might confer a favor],
   and followed him, and so did his disciples. ^b 24 And he went him; and
   a great multitude followed him [The ruler, of highest social rank in
   the city, found Jesus among the lowliest, and they were naturally
   curious to see what Jesus would do for this grandee], and they { ^c But
   as he went the multitudes} thronged him. ^a 20 And, behold, a woman,
   who had { ^c having} an issue of blood twelve years, ^b 26 and had
   suffered many things of many physicians, and ^c who had spent ^b all
   that she had, ^c all her living upon physicians, ^b and was nothing
   bettered, but rather grew worse, ^c and could not be healed of any
   [Medicine was not a science in that day. Diseases were not cured by
   medicine, but were exorcised by charms. The physician of Galilee in
   that age did not differ very widely from the medicine-man of the North
   American Indians. One in easy circumstances could readily spend all
   during twelve years of doctoring with such leeches.] ^b 27 having heard
   the things concerning Jesus [her faith rested on hearing rather than on
   sight], came in the crowd behind, ^c him, and touched the border of his
   garment: ^a 21 for she said within herself, If I do but touch his
   garment, { ^b garments,} I shall be made whole. [The nature of her
   disease made her unclean (Lev. xv. 26). Her consciousness of this made
   her, therefore, timidly approach Jesus from behind.] 29 And straightway
   { ^c immediately} ^b the fountain of her blood was dried up; ^c the
   issue of her blood stanched. ^b and she felt in her body that she was
   healed of her plague. [The feeble pulse of sickness gave way to the
   glow and thrill of health.] 30 And straightway Jesus, perceiving in
   himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth, turned him
   about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? ^c Who is it
   that touched me? And when all denied, Peter and they ^b his disciples
   ^c that were with him, ^b said unto him, ^c Master, the multitude press
   thee and crush thee, ^b Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and
   sayest thou, Who touched me? ^c 46 But Jesus said, Some one did touch
   me: for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. ^b 32 And he
   looked round about to see her that had done this thing. ^c 47 And { ^b
   33 But} ^c when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came ^b fearing
   and trembling [because being unclean, any rabbi would have rebuked her
   severely for touching him], knowing what had been done to her, came and
   fell { ^c falling} down before him ^b and told him all the truth. ^c
   declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched
   him, and how she was healed immediately. [To have permitted the woman
   to depart without this exposure would have confirmed her in the
   mistaken notion that Jesus healed rather by his nature than by his
   will. Hence he questions her, not that he may obtain information, but
   rather as a means of imparting it. By his questions he reveals to her
   that no work of his is wrought without his consciousness, and that it
   was himself and not his garment which had blessed her.] ^a 22 But Jesus
   turning and seeing her said, ^c unto her, ^a Daughter, be of good cheer
   [Faith gets a sweet welcome]; thy faith hath made thee whole. ^c go in
   peace. ^b and be whole of thy plague. [Be permanently whole: an
   assurance that relief was not temporal, but final.] ^a And the woman
   was made whole from that hour. [Faith healed her by causing her to so
   act as to obtain healing. Faith thus saves; not of itself, but by that
   which it causes us to do. It causes us to so run that we obtain.] ^b 35
   While he yet spake, they come from { ^c there cometh one from} the
   ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead: ^b why
   troublest thou the Teacher any further? ^c trouble not the Teacher.
   [The delay caused by healing this woman must have sorely tried the
   ruler's patience, and the sad news which followed it must have severely
   tested his faith; but we hear no word of murmuring or bitterness from
   him.] 50 But Jesus hearing it, ^b not heeding the words spoken [not
   succumbing to the situation], ^c answered him, { ^b saith unto the
   ruler of the synagogue,} Fear not, only believe. ^c and she shall be
   made whole. [Thus, with words of confidence and cheer, Jesus revived
   the ruler's failing faith.] ^b 37 And he suffered no man to follow with
   him [into the house with him], save Peter, and James, and John the
   brother of James. [These three were honored above their fellows by
   special privileges on several occasions, because their natures better
   fitted them to understand the work of Christ.] ^c 51 And when he came
   to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter
   and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother. ^b 38
   And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; ^a 23 And
   when Jesus came into the ruler's house, ^b he beholdeth a tumult, and
   many weeping and wailing greatly. ^a and saw the flute-players, and the
   crowd making a tumult, 24 he said, Give place [Mourning began at the
   moment of death, and continued without intermission until the burial,
   which usually took place on the day of the death. Even to this day
   Oriental funerals are characterized by noisy uproar and frantic
   demonstrations of sorrow, made by real and hired mourners.
   Flute-players, then as now, mingle the plaintive strains of their
   instruments with the piercing cries of those females who made mourning
   a profession]: ^c 52 And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he
   said, { ^b saith} unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? ^c Weep
   not; she ^b the child ^a the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. [Jesus
   used this figurative language with regard to Lazarus, and explained by
   this he meant death--John xi. 14.] And they laughed him to scorn. ^c
   knowing that she was dead. [His words formed a criticism as to their
   judgment and experience as to death, and threatened to interrupt them
   in earning their funeral dues.] ^a 25 But when the crowd was put forth,
   ^b he, having put them all forth [because their tumult was unsuited to
   the solemnity and sublimity of a resurrection. They were in the outer
   room--not in the room where the dead child lay], taketh the father of
   the child and her mother and them [the three] that were with him, and
   goeth in { ^a he entered in,} ^b where the child was. [Jesus took with
   him five witnesses, because in the small space of the room few could
   see distinctly what happened, and those not seeing distinctly might
   circulate inaccurate reports and confused statements as to what
   occurred. Besides, Jesus worked his miracles as privately as possible
   in order to suppress undue excitement.] ^a and took { ^b taking} the
   child { ^c her} by the hand, called, saying, { ^b saith} unto her,
   Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, { ^c Maiden,} ^b I
   say unto thee, Arise. [Mark gives the Aramaic words which Jesus used.
   They were the simple words with which anyone would awaken a child in
   the morning.] ^c 55 And her spirit returned ^b 42 And straightway the
   damsel rose up, { ^a arose.} ^c she rose up immediately: ^b and walked
   [her restoration was complete]; for she was twelve years old. ^c and he
   commanded that something ^b should be given her to eat. [Her frame,
   emaciated by sickness, was to be invigorated by natural means.] ^c 56
   And her parents were amazed: ^b they were amazed straightway with a
   great amazement. [Faith in God's great promise is seldom so strong that
   fulfillment fails to waken astonishment.] 43 And { ^c but} ^b he
   charged them much ^c to tell no man what had been done. ^b that no man
   should know this [A command given to keep down popular excitement.
   Moreover, Jesus did not wish to be importuned to raise the dead. He
   never was so importuned] : ^a 26 And the fame hereof went forth into
   all that land.

Healing Blind Men and a Dumb Demoniac.

(Probably Capernaum.)

^A Matt. IX. 27-34.

   ^a 27 And as Jesus passed by from thence [If construed strictly, this
   phrase means, as he departed from Jairus' house. But the phrase is
   indefinite], two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have
   mercy on us, thou son of David. [This, among the Jews, was a common and
   thoroughly recognized name for the expected Messiah.] 28 And when he
   was come into the house [possibly Peter's. But the place is not
   important. The house is mentioned to show that the blind men
   persistently followed Jesus until he stopped], the blind men came to
   him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?
   They said unto him, Yea, Lord. [In the earlier stages of his ministry
   Jesus had worked his miracles with little or no solicitation; but now,
   as the evidences of his power were multiplied, Jesus demanded a fuller
   expression of faith; for faith was the fruitage for which the miracles
   were wrought.] 29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your
   faith be it unto you. 30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly
   [sternly] charged them, saying, See that no man know it. 31 But they
   went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land. [Jesus might
   well speak severely when charging his beneficiaries to be silent, for
   apparently no one of them ever obeyed him.] 32 And as they went forth,
   behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon. 33
   And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes
   marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. [Some regard this
   demoniac as being the victim of combined physical and spiritual
   maladies, but it is more likely that the dumbness was caused by the
   demon, since in some instances they deprived men of reason (Mark v.
   15), and in others they threw men into convulsions or distortions--
   Mark ix. 18; Luke xiii. 11, 16.] 34 But the Pharisees said, By the
   prince of the demons casteth he out demons. [If we are correct in our
   chronology, Jesus had already fully answered this charge. See pages
   300-302. If he repeated any part of this answer at this time, Matthew
   is silent as to it.]

LX.

Jesus Visits Nazareth and is Rejected.

^A Matt. XIII. 54-58; ^B Mark VI. 1-6; ^C Luke IV. 16-31.

   ^b 1 And he went out from thence [from Capernaum] ; and he cometh { ^a
   And coming} ^b into his own country; and his disciples follow him. ^c
   16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up [As to this
   city, see pages 14 and 55. As to the early years of Jesus at Nazareth,
   see page 60]: ^b 2 And when the sabbath was come ^c he entered, as his
   custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to
   read. [This does not mean that it had been the custom of Jesus when he
   was a young man in Nazareth to read in the synagogue. It means that
   after he entered his public ministry it was his custom to use the
   synagogue as his place of teaching on the sabbath day (Mark i. 39; iii.
   1, 2). For comment on this usage of the synagogue see pages 172 and
   173.] 17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
   Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place [Isa. lxi. 1, 2;
   but the quotation embraces other lines from Isaiah.] where it was
   written, 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed me
   to preach good tidings to the poor [Anointing was the method by which
   prophets, priests, and kings were consecrated or set apart to their
   several offices. This prophecy says that the Holy Spirit came upon
   Jesus because he was appointed to do a work of divine helpfulness]: He
   hath sent me to preach release to the captives, And recovering of sight
   to the blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised, 19 To proclaim
   the acceptable year of the Lord. [The prophecy set forth in physical
   terms what Jesus should perform in both the physical and spiritual
   realms. The prophecy closes with a reference to the jubilee year,
   which, being a time of liberation, forgiveness, and fresh starts, was a
   type of Christ's ministry and kingdom.] 20 And he closed the book, and
   gave it back to the attendant [This officer corresponded to our sexton.
   Part of this duty was to take charge of the synagogue rolls], and sat
   down [Reader and congregation both stood during the reading; then,
   usually, both sat down to hear the passage explained. They stood out of
   reverence for God's word]: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were
   fastened on him. [They had heard of his miracles, and were curious to
   see what he would say and do.] 21 And he began to say unto them, To-day
   hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. 22 And all bare him
   witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his
   mouth [The word grace refers rather to the manner than to the matter.
   The speech of Jesus flowed easily, and gracefully]: ^a 54 And he taught
   { ^b began to teach} ^a them in their { ^b the synagogue}: ^a insomuch
   that ^b many hearing him were astonished, ^a and said, { ^b saying,}
   Whence hath this man these things? ^a this wisdom, and these might
   works? ^b and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and what
   mean such mighty works wrought by his hands? [They admitted his
   marvelous teaching and miraculous works, but were at a loss to account
   for them because their extreme familiarity with his humanity made it
   hard for them to believe in his divinity, by which alone his actions
   would be rightly explained. Twice in the early part of his ministry
   Jesus had been at Cana, within a few miles of Nazareth, and turning
   away from it had gone down to Capernaum. He did not call upon his
   townsmen to believe in him or his divine mission until the evidences
   were so full that they could not deny them.] 3 Is not this the
   carpenter, ^c Joseph's son? ^a the carpenter's son? ^b the son of Mary,
   and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? ^a is not his
   mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and
   Judas? 56 And his sisters, are they not all ^b here with us? [They
   brought forth every item of trade and relationship by which they could
   confirm themselves in their conviction that he was simply a human being
   like themselves. The question as to his identity, however, suggests
   that he may have been absent from Nazareth some little time. As to
   Jesus' kindred, see pages 224-226.] ^a Whence then hath this man all
   these things? 57 And they were offended in him. [His claims were too
   high for them to admit, and too well accredited for them to despise, so
   they sought refuge from their perplexity by getting angry at Jesus.] ^c
   23 And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable,
   Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do
   also here in thine own country. [Jesus quoted a familiar proverb, the
   meaning of which is this: he was part of Nazareth, and hence the claims
   of Nazareth upon him were superior to those of Capernaum, and therefore
   Nazareth should have been blessed by his healing. But the expression
   was evidently used contemptuously, as if they said, "You can do big
   things at Capernaum, but you can not do them here. You can not deceive
   us; we know you."] ^a But { ^b And} Jesus said unto them, ^c Verily I
   say unto you, ^b a prophet is not without honor, save in his own
   country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. ^c No prophet is
   acceptable in his own country. [Jealousy forbids the countrymen of a
   prophet to honor him. Base as this passion is, it is a very common one,
   and is not easily subdued, even by the best of men. In Nazareth Jesus
   was no more than the son of a carpenter, and the brother of a certain
   very common young men and girls, while abroad he was hailed as the
   prophet of Galilee, mighty in word and deed.] 25 But of a truth I say
   unto you [Jesus now proceeds to make two close applications of the
   proverb], There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when
   the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a
   great famine over all the land; 26 and unto none of them was Elijah
   sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman [a
   Gentile] that was a widow 27 And there were many lepers in Israel in
   the time of Elisha the prophet: and none of them was cleansed, but only
   Naaman the Syrian. [Naaman also was a Gentile. The first instance cited
   by Jesus will be found at I. Kings xvii. 8-16 , and the second at II.
   Kings v. 1-14. Palestine was filled with poor people even in times of
   plenty, so there must have been large numbers of hungry people during
   the long-continued period of famine. There has always been a large
   number of lepers in the land, and surely if any disease ought to prompt
   a man to lay aside his prejudices that he might obtain healing it was
   leprosy; but as Nazareth was now rejecting Jesus, so their ancestors
   had despised the two mighty prophets. Not one of all the hungry would
   have received bread from Elijah by an act of faith, nor did one of all
   the lepers ask healing from Elisha.] 28 And they were all filled with
   wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things [The Nazarenes were
   jealous enough of the claims of Jesus when put in their most modest
   dress; but when Jesus placed himself alongside Elijah and Elisha, and
   likened his hearers to widows for want, and lepers for uncleanness,
   they were ready to dash him to pieces]; 29 and they rose up, and cast
   him forth out of the city, and led him [they evidently had hold of him]
   unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might
   throw him down headlong. [Near the eastern end of Nazareth there is a
   cavern in the rock which forms a precipice down which, if a man were
   hurled, he would be killed. At the western end there is a perpendicular
   cliff about forty feet high, with a naked floor of rock at the bottom.
   To which place they led Jesus we can not decide.] 30 But he passing
   through the midst of them went his way. [A simple statement of a
   marvelous fact. Miracles are not explained in the Bible.] ^b 5 And he
   could there do no mighty work, ^a 58 And he did not many mighty works
   there because of their unbelief. ^b save that he laid his hands upon a
   few sick folk, and healed them. 6 And he marvelled because of their
   unbelief. [As to this statement that Jesus felt surprised, see page
   273. "It should also be borne in mind," says Canon Cook, "that surprise
   at the obtuseness and unreasonableness of sin is constantly attributed
   to God by the prophets." The statement, therefore, is perfectly
   consonant with the divinity of Jesus.] ^c 31 And he came down to
   Capernaum, a city of Galilee. [We have followed the chronology of Mark,
   according to which Jesus had already been living in Capernaum for some
   time. Luke tells of the rejection early in his narrative, and adds this
   line to show that from the earlier days of his ministry Jesus made
   Capernaum his headquarters.]

LXI.

Third Circuit of Galilee. The Twelve Instructed and Sent Forth.

^A Matt. IX. 35-38; X. 1, 5-42; XI. 1; ^B Mark VI. 6-13; ^C Luke IX. 1-6.

   ^b 6 And he ^a Jesus ^b went about ^a all the cities and villages,
   teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
   and healing all manner sickness and all manner of sickness. [In the
   first circuit of Galilee some of the twelve accompanied Jesus as
   disciples (see [3]Section XXXIII.); in the second the twelve were with
   him as apostles; in the third they, too, are sent forth as evangelists
   to supplement his work.] 36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was
   moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and
   scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd. 37 Then saith he unto his
   disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
   38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
   laborers into his harvest. [These verses contain the reasons why Jesus
   separated his apostles from himself, and scattered them among the
   people. The masses of the people of Galilee had been deeply stirred by
   the teaching and miracles of Jesus, but they knew not as yet what
   direction was to be given to this popular movement. They were in a
   bewildered state, like shepherdless sheep, scattered over the hills and
   faint from running. The twelve were to assist him as undershepherds in
   gathering these sheep. In the second figure Jesus likens the people to
   a ripened harvest, and he sends the apostles among them as reapers who
   shall garner them.] 1 And he called { ^b calleth} ^c together ^a unto
   him his { ^b the} ^a twelve disciples, ^b and he gave them ^c power and
   authority over all demons, ^a over the unclean spirits, to cast them
   out, and to heal all manner of disease { ^c to cure diseases.} ^a and
   all manner of sickness. [At this point Matthew gives the names of the
   apostles, a complete list of which will be found at page 222.] 5 These
   twelve Jesus sent forth ^b and he began to send them forth by two and
   two [He sent them in pairs because: 1. Under the law it required two
   witnesses to establish the truth. 2. They could supplement each other's
   work. Different men reach different minds, and where one fails another
   may succeed. 3. They would encourage one another. When one grew
   despondent the zeal and enthusiasm of the other would quicken his
   activities]; ^c 2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God,
   and to heal the sick. ^b 8 and he charged them that they should take
   nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no
   money in their purse; 9 but to go shod with sandals; and, said he, put
   not on two coats. ^a and charged them, saying, Go not into any way of
   the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans: 6 but go
   rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [This first commission
   restricted Christ's messengers to the Jewish people, and the parts of
   Palestine which they inhabited, but his second commission impelled them
   to go everywhere and to preach to every creature (Mark xvi. 15). As
   Jesus himself was sent only to the Jews, so during his days on earth he
   sent his disciples only to them.] 7 As ye go, preach, saying, The
   kingdom of heaven is at hand. [It was set up about a year later, on the
   day of Pentecost, under the direction of the Holy Spirit--Acts ii.] 8
   Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons:
   freely ye received, freely give. [Here is the true rule of giving. Paul
   repeats it at I. Cor. xvi. 2. If we would obey this rule, we would make
   this a happy world.] ^c 3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your
   journey, ^a 9 Get you no gold, nor silver, ^c nor money; ^a nor brass
   in your purses; ^c neither staff, nor wallet, ^a for your journey, ^c
   nor bread, neither have two coats. ^a nor shoes, nor staff: for the
   workman is worthy of his food. [The prohibition is against securing
   these things before starting, and at their own expense. It is not that
   they would have no need for the articles mentioned, but that "the
   laborer is worthy of his food," and they were to depend on the people
   for whose benefit they labored, to furnish what they might need. This
   passage is alluded to by Paul (I. Cor. ix. 14). To rightly understand
   this prohibition we must remember that the apostles were to make but a
   brief tour of a few weeks, and that it was among their own countrymen,
   among a people habitually given to hospitality; moreover, that the
   apostles were imbued with powers which would win for them the respect
   of the religious and the gratitude of the well-to-do. The special and
   temporary commission was, therefore, never intended as a rule under
   which we are to act in preaching the gospel in other ages and in other
   lands.] ^b 10 And he said unto them ^a 11 And into whatsoever city or
   village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide
   till ye go forth. [The customs of the East gave rise to this rule. The
   ceremonies and forms with which a guest was received were tedious and
   time-consuming vanities, while the mission of the apostles required
   haste.] 12 And as ye enter come into an house, salute it. 13 And if the
   house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy,
   let your peace return to you. [The form of salutation on entering a
   house was, "Peace to this house." The apostles are told to salute each
   house, and are assured that the peace prayed for shall return to them
   if the house is not worthy; that is, they shall receive, in this case,
   the blessing pronounced on the house.] ^b Wheresoever ye enter into a
   house, there abide till ye depart thence. { ^c 4 And into whatsoever
   house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.} ^b 11 And whatsoever
   place shall not receive you, and they hear you not [Jesus here warns
   them that their experiences would not always be pleasant], ^a 14 And
   whosoever ^c as many as ^a shall ^c receive you not, ^a nor hear your
   words, ^b as ye go forth thence, ^a out of that house or that city [The
   word "house" indicates a partial and the word "city" a complete
   rejection], { ^c when you depart from that city,} ^b shake off the dust
   that is under your feet { ^a of your feet.} ^c from your feet ^b for a
   testimony unto them. ^c against them. [The dust of heathen lands as
   compared with the land of Israel was regarded as polluted and unholy
   (Amos ii. 7; Ezek. xxvii. 30). The Jew, therefore, considered himself
   defiled by such dust. For the apostles, therefore, to shake off the
   dust of any city of Israel from their clothes or feet was to place that
   city on a level with the cities of the heathen, and to renounce all
   further intercourse with it.] ^a 15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be
   more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
   judgment, than for that city. [For comment on similar remarks, see page
   287. God judges all men with reference to their opportunities.] 16
   Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
   therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. [At this point Jesus
   passes from the first, or temporary, to the second, or final,
   commission of the apostles, for all the persecutions enumerated were
   encountered under the latter.] 17 But beware of men: for they will
   deliver you up to the councils, and in their synagogues they will
   scourge you [Councils and synagogues were both Jewish powers.] 18 yea
   and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a
   testimony to them and to the Gentiles. [The phrase "governors and
   kings" indicates Gentile powers, for most all governors and kings were
   then appointed by Rome.] 19 But when they deliver you up, be not
   anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that
   same hour what ye shall speak. 20 For it is not ye that speak, but the
   Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you. [For comment on similar
   words, see page 318.] 21 And brother shall deliver up brother to death,
   and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents,
   and cause them to be put to death. [Jesus here foretells the intense
   religious bigotry with which his ministers should be opposed. Having
   foretold persecution, he here predicts actual martyrdom.] 22 And ye
   shall be hated of all men for my name's sake [The term "all" is used in
   its general and not in its absolute sense. The apostles had some few
   friends among the unbelievers. Jesus gives the exact cause of the
   hatred. It would not be because of any personal faults or
   peculiarities, but simply because of adherence to Christ]: but he that
   endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. [Since the persecution
   was unto death, the endurance which should meet it must be to the end
   of life.] 23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the
   next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the
   cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. [The apostles were not
   to meet obduracy with obduracy. Moving as swiftly as they could along
   the line of least resistance, they would not be able to evangelize all
   the Jewish cities before the time set for their desolation--before the
   Son of man should come in the demonstration of his judicial power and
   destroy the Jewish nationality.] 24 A disciple is not above his
   teacher, nor a servant above his lord. 25 It is enough for the disciple
   that he should be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. [Jesus
   applied similar words to the Jewish teachers. See page 262.] If they
   have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of
   his household! [Jesus here warns the apostles that they can not expect
   better treatment than he himself received--no, not so good. Nor should
   they ask exemption from what he himself suffered.] 26 Fear them not
   therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
   and hid, that shall not be known. 27 What I tell you in darkness, speak
   ye in the light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the
   house-tops. 28 And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are
   not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
   both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
   and not one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father:
   30 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not
   therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. 32 Every one
   therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess
   before my Father who is in heaven. 33 But whosoever shall deny me
   before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
   [For comment on similar remarks see page 317.] 34 Think not that I am
   come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 35
   For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
   daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother
   in law. 36 and a man's foes shall be they of his own household. [For
   comment on similar language see page 324.] 37 He that loveth father or
   mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or
   daughter more than me is not worthy of me. [Love for the old religion
   would make the members of the Jewish and pagan families persecute those
   who apostasized from it to give their hearts to Christ. But if the Jew
   and the pagan thus held their religions at a higher value than the ties
   of kindred, much more should the Christian value his religion above
   these ties.] 38 And he that doth not take his cross and follow after
   me, is not worthy of me. [This is doubtless an allusion to the manner
   of his death, and being the first of the kind it must have been very
   puzzling to his disciples, unless explained by prior words of Jesus, of
   which we have no record. As such allusion its full meaning is this: "If
   I bear for each the vicarious cross and suffer for each the full
   measure of the divine displeasure, then each should be willing
   cheerfully to follow me that he may obtain the benefits of my
   sacrifice, and if the light cross of human displeasure deter him from
   this, he is not worthy of me."] 39 He that findeth his life shall lose
   it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. [Jesus
   declares that all self-seeking is self-losing. He that makes his own
   life the chief object of his endeavor really fails the more he seems to
   succeed. He who saves and husbands his powers to expend them on those
   lower carnal joys which a sinner calls "life" shall lose those higher
   spiritual joys which God calls "life," and vice versa. 40 He that
   receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that
   sent me. [Having depicted in all their darkness the persecutions which
   awaited the apostles, Jesus here, by an easy transition, proceeds to
   declare the honor of their apostleship in that they were
   representatives directly of Christ, and indirectly of the Father.] 41
   He that receiveth a prophet in the name of [that is, because he is] a
   prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a
   righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
   man's reward. 42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these
   little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily
   I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward. [Whoever honors a
   prophet, a righteous man, or a disciple, as such recognizes that
   person's relation to God as the ground of that act; and to that extent
   honors God in the act, just as he who performs a similar act in the
   name of a friend thereby honors that friend. A prophet's reward is not
   synonymous, however, with final salvation, for salvation is a matter of
   grace and not of reward.] ^c 6 And they departed, ^b 12 And they went
   out, ^c and went throughout the villages, ^b and preached that men
   should repent. ^c preaching the gospel, ^b 13 And they cast out many
   demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. ^c
   healing everywhere. ^a 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished
   commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
   preach in their cities. [Oil was not used as a medicine. The Jews
   anointed their hair and their faces every day, especially when about to
   depart from the house to move among their fellows. This anointing was
   omitted when they were sick and when they fasted (II. Sam. xii. 20;
   Matt. vi. 16, 17). When an apostle stood over a sick man to heal him by
   a touch or a word, he was about to send him out of his sick chamber,
   and just before the word was spoken, the oil was applied. It was,
   therefore, no more than a token or symbol that the man was restored to
   his liberty, and was from that moment to be confined to his chamber no
   longer. Comp. Jas. v. 14. This practice bears about the same relation
   to the Romish practice of extreme unction as the Lord's Supper does to
   the mass, or as a true baptism does to the sprinkling of an infant.]

   son of Herod the Great. See page 63.] ^c the tetrarch heard of all that
   was done ^a heard the report concerning Jesus, ^b for his name had
   become known: ^c and he was perplexed, because that it was said by
   some, that John was risen from the dead; 8 and by some, that Elijah had
   appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
   [The work of Jesus impressed the people as prophetic rather than
   Messianic, for they associated the Messiah in their thoughts with an
   earthly kingdom of great pomp and grandeur. Jesus, therefore, did not
   appear to them to be the Messiah, but rather the prophet who should
   usher in the Messiah. Their Scriptures taught them that Elijah would be
   that prophet. But the Apocrypha indicated that it might be Isaiah or
   Jeremiah (I. Macc. xiv. 41). Hence the many opinions as to which of the
   prophets Jesus was. If he was Elijah, he could not be properly spoken
   of as risen from the dead, for Elijah had been translated.] 9 And Herod
   said, ^a unto his servants, ^c John I beheaded [For the imprisonment of
   John, see pages 138, 139. The mission of the twelve probably lasted
   several weeks, and the beheading of John the Baptist appears to have
   taken place about the time of their return. See page 374]: but who is
   this, about whom I hear such things? ^a This is John the Baptist; { ^b
   the Baptizer} ^a he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these
   powers work in him. [John had wrought no miracle while living (Matt. x.
   41), but there was a prevalent idea among the ancients that departed
   spirits were endowed with superhuman powers, and Herod therefore
   supposed that the risen John had brought these powers with him from the
   spirit world.] ^c And he sought to see him. [Jesus purposely kept out
   of the reach of Herod, knowing the treacherous cunning of his nature
   (Luke xiii. 32), and Herod's curiosity was not gratified until the day
   of Christ's crucifixion (Luke xxiii. 8-12), and then its gratification
   was without sanctification.] ^b 15 But others said, It is Elijah. And
   others said, It is a prophet, even as one of the prophets. 16 But
   Herod, when he heard thereof, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.
   [Some thought that Elijah might have returned, as the Scripture
   declared, or that Jesus might be a prophet just like the great prophets
   of old. Matthew, by introducing what follows with the word "for," gives
   us the reason why Herod clung to this singular opinion of Jesus. He did
   so because this opinion was begotten in the morbid musings of a
   conscience stained with the blood of John.] 17 For Herod himself had
   sent forth and laid hold upon John, ^a and bound him, and put him in
   prison the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. ^b for he had
   married her. [Herodias was the daughter of Aristobulus, who was the
   half-brother of Herod Philip I. and Herod Antipas, and these two last
   were in turn half-brothers to each other. Herodias, therefore, had
   married her uncle Herod Philip I, who was disinherited by Herod the
   Great, and who lived as a private citizen in Rome. When Herod Antipas
   went to Rome about the affairs of his tetrarchy, he became the guest of
   his brother Herod Philip I., and repaid the hospitality which he
   received by carrying off the wife of his host.] 18 For John said unto
   Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. [The
   marriage was unlawful of three reasons: 1. The husband of Herodias was
   still living; 2. The lawful wife of Antipas (the daughter of Aretas,
   king or emir of Arabia) was still living; 3. Antipas and Herodias,
   being nephew and niece, were related to each other within the forbidden
   degrees of consanguinity.] 19 And Herodias set herself against him, and
   desired to kill him; but she could not: 20 for Herod feared John,
   knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And
   when he heard him, he was much perplexed, and he heard him gladly. ^a 5
   And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
   because they counted him as a prophet. [Herod feared both John and his
   influence. His fear of the man as a prophet caused him to shelter John
   against any attempts which his angry wife might make to put him to
   death, and led him to listen to John with enough respect to become
   perplexed as to whether it were better to continue in his course or
   repent. At other times, when the influence of Herodias moved him most
   strongly, and he forgot his personal fear of John, he was yet
   restrained by fear of John's influence over the people.] 6 But when
   Herod's birthday came, ^b 21 And when a convenient day was come [A day
   suited to the purposes of Herodias. The phrase refers to verse 19],
   that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high
   captains, and the chief men of Galilee; 22 and when the daughter of
   Herodias herself [the language seems to indicate that others had first
   come in and danced] came in and danced, ^a in the midst, ^b she pleased
   Herod and them that sat at meat with him [This dancer was Salome,
   daughter of Herod Philip and niece of Herod Antipas. The dancing of the
   East was then, as now, voluptuous and indecent, and nothing but utter
   shamelessness or inveterate malice could have induced a princess to
   thus make a public show of herself at such a carousal]; ^a 7 Whereupon
   he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. ^b and
   the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I
   will give it thee. 23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask
   of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. [The rashness
   of the king's promise is characteristic of the folly of sin. Riches,
   honors, kingdoms, souls are given for a bauble in the devil's market.]
   24 And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? [She
   may have known beforehand what to ask. If so, she retired and asked her
   mother that the brunt of the king's displeasure might fall upon her
   mother.] And she said, The head of John the Baptist. ^a 8 And she,
   being put forward by her mother, ^b came in straightway with haste unto
   the king [she wished to make her request known before the king had time
   to put limitations upon her asking], and asked, saying, { ^a saith} ^b
   I will that thou forthwith give me ^a here on a platter the head of
   John the Baptist. [She asked for the prophet's head that she and her
   mother might have the witness of their own eyes to the fact that he was
   dead, and that they might not be deceived about it.] 9 And the king was
   grieved; ^b was exceeding sorry [because the deed went against his
   conscience and his sense of policy as above stated]; but for the sake
   of his oaths, and of them that { ^a which} sat at meat, ^b he would not
   reject her. ^a he commanded it to be given [The oath alone would not
   have constrained Herod to grant Salome's request, for if left alone he
   would rightly have construed the request as not coming within the scope
   of the oath. The terms of his oath looked to and anticipated a
   pecuniary present, and not the commission of a crime. But Herod's
   companions, being evil men, joined with the evil women against the man
   of God, and shamed Herod into an act which committed him forever to a
   course of guilt. Thus, a bad man's impulses are constantly broken down
   by his evil companions]; ^b 27 And straightway the king forth a soldier
   of his guard, ^a and beheaded John in the prison. ^b and commanded to
   bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 28 and
   brought his head { ^a his head was brought} ^b on a platter, and gave
   it { ^a and given} ^b to the damsel: and the damsel ^a brought it ^b
   gave it to her mother. [To the anxious, unrestful soul of Herodias this
   seemed a great gift, since it assured her that the voice of her most
   dangerous enemy was now silent. But as Herod was soon filled with
   superstitious fears that John had risen in the person of Christ, her
   sense of security was very short-lived. The crime stamped Herod and
   Herodias with greater infamy than that for which John had rebuked
   them.] 29 And when his disciples heard thereof, they came and took up
   his { ^a the} corpse, ^b and laid it in a tomb. ^a and buried him; and
   went and told Jesus. [Herod had feared that the death of John would
   bring about a popular uprising, and his fears were not mistaken. As
   soon as they had decently buried the body of the great preacher, John's
   disciples go to Jesus, expecting to find in him a leader to redress the
   Baptist's wrongs. They knew the friendship of John for Jesus, and,
   knowing that the latter intended to set up a kingdom, they believed
   that this would involve the overthrow of Herod's power. They were ready
   now to revolt and make Jesus a king. See Matt. xii. 13; John vi. 1, 2,
   15. But Jesus would not aid them to seek the bitter fruits of revenge,
   nor did he intend to set up such a kingdom as they imagined.]

   things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught. [They
   had fulfilled the mission on which Jesus had sent them, and on

   saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place [an
   uninhabited place], and rest a while. For there were many coming and

   reason for retiring to the thinly settled shores east of the lake.

Feeding the Five Thousand.

^A Matt. XIV. 13-21; ^B Mark VI. 33-44; ^C Luke IX. 11-17; ^D John VI. 2-14.

   ^c 11 But { ^a and} the multitudes heard thereof [heard of Jesus and
   his disciples crossing the lake], ^b 33 And they saw them going, and ^c
   perceiving it, ^b many knew them, ^d 2 And a great multitude followed
   him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.
   ^b and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent
   them. ^a 14 And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and had
   compassion on them, ^b because they were as sheep not having a shepherd
   ^c and he welcomed them, ^b and he began to teach them many things. ^c
   and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, ^a and healed their sick. ^c
   and them that had need of healing he cured. [Jesus probably set sail
   from near Capernaum, and from thence across the lake to the narrow,
   secluded plain of El Batihah, where he landed is less than five miles.
   Seeing him start, the people followed him by running along the northern
   shore, and, though having a little farther to go, they traveled faster
   than the sailboat, and were waiting for him on the shore when he
   arrived.] ^d 3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat
   with his disciples. [The level plain did not afford a good platform
   from which to address the people.] 4 Now the passover, the feast of the
   Jews, was at hand. [This passover is computed to have been held on
   April 16, a.d. 29. This statement as to the time of year prepares us
   for his further statement that there was much grass in the plain. It
   also explains in part the gathering of a multitude in this secluded
   region. Pilgrims on their way to the passover would gladly go several
   miles out of their way to see the great Prophet perform a miracle. The
   excitement, due to the mission of the twelve and the death of the
   Baptist, also tended to swell the crowd.] ^c 12 And the day began to
   wear away; ^b 35 And when the day was now far spent, ^a 15 And when
   even was come, ^b his disciples ^c the twelve ^b came unto him ^c and
   said unto him, { ^a saying,} ^b The place is desert, and the day is now
   far spent; ^a and the time is already past [the time to seek lodging
   and provisions had gone by, and therefore the multitude must act
   quickly]; ^b 36 send them ^a the multitudes { ^c multitude} away, that
   they may go into the villages and country around, and lodge, and get
   provisions: ^a and buy themselves food. ^b something to eat. ^c for we
   are here in a desert place. [The apostles were the first to think of
   eating, and naturally enough, for they had started on empty stomachs,
   and their own discomfort made them anticipate the sad plight in which
   the multitude would soon find itself.] ^a 16 But Jesus said unto them,
   They have no need to go away; ^d 5 Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes,
   and seeing that a great multitude cometh to him, saith unto Philip,
   Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat? 6 And this he said to
   prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 7 Philip answered him,
   Two hundred shillings' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
   every one may take a little. [Jesus tested Philip to see which way he
   would turn in his weakness. Jesus asked where the bread might be
   bought, knowing that power to feed the multitude resided in himself
   (Isa. lv. 1), but Philip wondered where the money was to be had to buy
   it.] ^b 37 But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And
   they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of
   bread, and give them to eat? [The word translated shilling is the Roman
   denarius, worth about seventeen cents. The sum was not large, as we
   reckon money, but, considering the purchasing power of money in those
   days, it was an imposing sum, and it is to be doubted if the
   treasury-bag of Judas ever contained the fourth part of it. For a
   denarius was the regular price for a day's labor.] 38 And he saith unto
   them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. ^d 8 One of his disciples,
   Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 9 There is a lad here,
   who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are they among so
   many? ^b And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. ^a 17 And
   they say unto him, { ^c said,} ^a We have here but ^c no more than five
   loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this
   people. 14 For they were about five thousand men. [When sent to see
   what was in their larder, it appears that they had nothing at all.
   Andrew reports the finding of the boy's lunch while it was as yet the
   boy's property. Some of the others, having secured it from the boy,
   report it now at the disposal of Jesus, but comment on its
   insufficiency. Eastern loaves were thin and small, like good-sized
   crackers, and around the Sea of Galilee, the salting and preserving of
   small fish was an especial industry. These fish, therefore, were about
   the size of sardines. The whole supply, therefore, was no more than
   enough for one hungry boy. But each loaf had to be divided between a
   thousand, and each fish between twenty-five hundred men.] ^a 18 And he
   said, Bring them hither to me. 19 And he commanded the multitude to sit
   down ^c And ^d 10 Jesus said, ^c unto his disciples, Make them ^d the
   people sit down. ^c in companies, about fifty each. 15 And they did so,
   and made them all sit down. ^b 40 And they sat down in ranks, by
   hundreds, and by fifties. ^d Now there was much grass in the place. So
   the men sat down, in number about five thousand. [By thus arranging
   them in orderly companies, Jesus accomplished several things. He saved
   his apostles much time and labor in distributing the food. He insured
   that each one should be fed, and that the reality of the miracle could
   not be questioned, and he ascertained definitely how many men were
   fed.] ^c 16 And ^d 11 Jesus therefore took ^a the five loaves, and the
   two fishes, and looking up to heaven, ^c he blessed and brake them, ^b
   and brake the loaves; ^d and having given thanks, he distributed to
   them that were set down; ^a and gave the loaves to the disciples, and
   the disciples to the multitudes. { ^c and gave to the disciples to set
   before the multitude.} ^d likewise also of the fishes as much as they
   would. ^b and the two fishes divided he among them all. 42 And they all
   ate, ^c and were all filled. [He blessed the loaves and fishes by
   returning thanks for them. This and similar acts of Jesus are our
   precedents for giving thanks, or, "asking the blessing," at our
   tables]: ^d 12 And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples,
   Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.
   [Christ is the economist of the universe. This command was in keeping
   with his laws which permit nothing to suffer annihilation. Ruin and
   destruction have no other effect than merely to change the form of
   things. Every atom of the material world which was here at the
   beginning of creation is here to-day, though it may have changed its
   form a million times in the progress of events.] So they gathered them
   up, ^c and there was taken { ^a they took} ^c up that which remained
   over to them of ^a the broken pieces, ^d and filled ^a twelve baskets
   full. { ^b basketfuls,} ^d with broken pieces from the five barley
   loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten. ^b and also of
   the fishes. ^a 21 And they that did eat { ^b ate} the loaves were ^a
   about five thousand men, besides women and children. [Considering the
   distance from any town, the women and children would not likely be
   numerous. They form no part of the count, for Eastern usage did not
   permit the women to sit with the men. They, with the little ones, would
   stand apart.] ^d 14 When therefore the people saw the sign which he
   did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the
   world. [That is to say, this is the Messiah, the prophet promised at
   Deut. xviii. 15. Their desire to avenge the death of John made them
   feverishly anxious for the appearance of the Messiah, but this faith
   was inconstant.]

The Twelve Try to Row Back. Jesus Walks Upon the Water.

^A Matt. XIV. 22-36; ^B Mark VI. 45-56; ^D John VI. 15-21.

   ^d 15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take
   him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain
   himself alone. [Jesus had descended to the plain to feed the multitude,
   but, perceiving this mistaken desire of the people, he frustrated it by
   dismissing his disciples and retiring by himself into the mountain.] ^a
   22 And straightway he constrained the { ^b his} ^a disciples to enter
   into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, ^b to
   Bethsaida [the suburb of Capernaum] ^a till he should send the
   multitudes { ^b while he himself sendeth the multitude} away. [The
   obedience of the disciples in leaving him helped to persuade the
   multitude to do likewise.] 46 And when he had taken leave of them, ^a
   23 And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up { ^b departed}
   ^a into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was
   there alone. [The news of John's assassination was calculated to
   exasperate him in the highest degree, and also to deeply distress him.
   He needed the benefits of prayer to keep down resentment, and to
   prevent despondency. For this he started away as soon as he heard the
   news, but the people prevented him till night.] ^d 16 And when evening
   came, his disciples went down unto the sea; 17 and they entered into a
   boat, and were over the sea unto Capernaum. ^b 47 And when even was
   come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
   ^d and it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. [They
   evidently expected that he would follow. Possibly they skirted the
   shore, hoping that he would hail them and come on board.] 18 And the
   sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. ^a 24 But the boat
   was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind
   was contrary. [That is, it blew from the west, the direction toward
   which the disciples were rowing.] ^b 48 And seeing them distressed in
   rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about { ^a in} ^b the
   fourth watch of the night [from 3 to 6 A. M.] he cometh { ^a came} ^b
   unto them, ^a walking upon the sea. [The disciples of Jesus can rest
   assured that the eyes of the Lord will behold their distresses, and
   that sooner or later the Lord himself will arise and draw near for
   their deliverance.] ^d 19 When therefore they had rowed about five and
   twenty or thirty furlongs [that is, about three and a half miles, or
   about half way across the sea], they behold Jesus walking on the sea,
   and drawing nigh unto the boat: ^b and would have passed by them: ^a 26
   And { ^b 49 but} ^a when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they
   were troubled, ^d and they were afraid. ^b they supposed that it was a
   ghost, and cried out; ^a saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for
   fear. ^b 50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. [Their fears would
   probably have been greater if Jesus had approached the boat, for they
   were severe enough to make them cry out, even when he was seen to be
   passing by them.] ^a 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto { ^b with}
   them, and saith unto them, { ^a saying,} Be of good cheer; it is I; be
   not afraid. [There was no mistaking that voice. If Isaac knew the voice
   of Jacob (Gen. xxvii. 22), Saul the voice of David (I. Sam. xxvi. 17),
   and Rhoda the voice of Peter (Acts xii. 13), much more did the apostles
   know the voice of the great Master.] ^d 21 They were willing therefore
   to receive him into the boat. [Superstitious fears are not always so
   soon allayed. His voice brought great assurance.] ^a 28 And Peter
   answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon
   the waters. 29 And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat,
   and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. [This scene comports with
   the character of Peter, who had always a rash willingness to go into
   danger, and a lack of steadfastness to hold out through it.] 30 But
   when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried
   out, saying, Lord, save me. [So long as the attention of Peter was
   fixed upon the Lord's command he succeeded in his venture; but so soon
   as he let the power of the tempest distract his thoughts, his faith
   failed and he began to sink.] 31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth
   his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little
   faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? [Fear is a source of doubt and an
   enemy of faith. Those who would achieve the victories of faith must
   overcome their fears.] ^b 51 And he went up unto them into the boat; ^a
   32 And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased. ^b and
   they were sore amazed in themselves; 52 for they understood not
   concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened. ^d and straightway
   the boat was at the land whither they were going. ^a 33 And they that
   were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of
   God. [The disciples showed the hardness of their hearts in that the
   working of one miracle did not prepare them either to expect or to
   comprehend any other miracle which followed. They ought to have
   worshipped Jesus as the Son of God when they saw the five thousand fed,
   but they did not. But when he had done that, and had walked upon the
   water, and quieted the wind, and transported the boat to the land, they
   were overcome by the iteration of his miraculous power, and confessed
   his divinity.] 34 And when they had crossed over, they came to the
   land, unto Gennesaret. ^b and moored to the shore. [The land of
   Gennesaret was a plain at the western end of the lake of Galilee.
   Josephus describes it as about thirty furlongs in length by twenty in
   average width, and bounded on the west by a semicircular line of
   hills.] 54 And when they were come out of the boat, straightway the
   people knew him, ^a 35 And when the men of that place knew him, they
   sent into ^b and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry
   about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. ^a
   and brought unto him all that were sick; ^b 56 And wheresoever he
   entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid
   the sick in the marketplaces, ^a 36 and they besought him that they
   might only touch ^b if it were but the border of his garment: and as
   many as touched him were made whole. [Though the apostles had started
   their boat toward Capernaum, the storm appears to have deflected their
   course, and the language of the text suggests that they probably came
   to land at the south end of the plain, somewhere near Magdala, and made
   a circuit of the cities in the plain of Gennesaret on their way to
   Capernaum. As he did not stop in these cities, the sick were laid in
   the street that they might touch him in passing through. Moreover, as
   they knew the course that he was taking, by running ahead they could
   anticipate his arrivals and have the sick gathered to take advantage of
   his presence. The story of the woman who touched the hem of his garment
   had evidently spread far and wide, and deeply impressed the popular
   mind.]

Discourse on Spiritual Food and True Discipleship. Peter's Confession.

(at the Synagogue in Capernaum.)

^D John VI. 22-71.

   ^d 22 On the morrow [the morrow after Jesus fed the five thousand] the
   multitude that stood on the other side of the sea [on the east side,
   opposite Capernaum] saw that there was no other boat there, save one,
   and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his
   disciples went away alone 23 (howbeit there came boats from Tiberias
   nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after that the Lord had
   given thanks): 24 when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not
   there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and
   came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. [This sentence is a complicated one,
   because it contains much in a condensed form. On the evening of the
   miracle the multitude had seen that there was but one boat, and that
   the disciples had gone away in it, leaving Jesus in the mountain. Jesus
   had dispersed the multitude, but many of them had not gone very far. On
   the morrow they came again to the scene of the miracle, and were
   perplexed at not finding Jesus. After some time they became convinced
   that he was not there, because if he had been, his disciples would have
   returned to seek him. In the meantime the keen-eyed boatmen about
   Tiberias, then the largest city on the lake, seeing the multitude on
   the farther shore, saw in their presence there an opportunity to earn a
   ferry fee, so they soon crossed the lake to accommodate the people. As
   Capernaum was the well-known headquarters of Jesus, the boatmen were
   directed to proceed thither that the multitude might find him.] 25 And
   when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto
   him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? [They found him at Capernaum in
   the synagogue, having but lately arrived from the land of Gennesaret.
   Though their question relates only to the time when Jesus crossed, it
   implies and includes a desire to know the manner also.] 26 Jesus
   answered them and said, Verily, verily [his answer was as serious as
   their question was flippant], I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because
   ye saw signs [Jesus includes the healing of the sick as well as the
   feeding of the multitude], but because ye ate of the loaves, and were
   filled. [They did not seek Jesus because they saw in him a divine
   Friend who could satisfy the deep needs of the soul, but as a
   wonder-worker who could fill their bodies with food when occasion
   required.] 27 Work not for the food which perisheth [bodily food], but
   for the food which abideth unto eternal life [spiritual food], which
   the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath
   sealed. [In our land a man consents to and makes a written instrument
   his own--an expression of his will--by signing it; but in the East he
   did this by affixing his seal to it (I. Kings xxi. 8; Esth. iii. 12;
   viii. 10; Jer. xxxii. 10). The meaning of Jesus' words, therefore, is
   that God the Father had commissioned him as Messiah, and had
   authenticated his mission as such by the works which he had given him
   to do--John v. 36.] 28 They said therefore unto him, What must we do,
   that we may work the works of God? [They wished to know what to do in
   order to earn the abiding food; that is, by what works they might so
   please God as to obtain it. Humanity, in seeking to answer this
   question, has invented pilgrimages, penances, fasts, mutilations and
   many other methods of self-punishment; not heeding the plain and
   decisive answer of Jesus.] 29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This
   is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. [Belief
   in Jesus as the Son of God is the one all-comprehensive work which
   pleases God (Heb. xi. 6). Jesus reiterates this important truth several
   times in this discourse; see verses 35, 36, 40, 47, etc., and the
   doctrine contained in it is elaborated in the epistles of Paul.] 30
   They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we
   may see, and believe thee? what workest thou? 31 Our fathers ate the
   manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of
   heaven to eat. [The trend of questions and answers in this discourse
   forms a close parallel to that at John iv., but with a different
   conclusion. There Jesus discoursed of life under the figure of water,
   and here under the figure of bread. There the woman vacillated between
   her good and evil impulses until her better nature triumphed. Here
   there was a like vacillation, terminating in opposite result. There the
   woman compared Jesus with Jacob, the well-digger (John iv. 12 ); here
   the people compare him with Moses, the manna-giver--each comparing him
   unfavorably.] 32 Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but
   my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. 33 For the bread of
   God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the
   world. [In testing the claims of Jesus the Jews proceeded upon the
   hypothesis that the Messiah must be greater than all the prophets, and
   that this greatness must be authenticated or sealed by greater signs
   than those wrought by others. Proceeding under this method, they
   compared the miracle just wrought by Jesus with the fall of manna in
   the days of Moses and drew conclusions unfavorable to Jesus. They
   reason thus: "Moses fed many millions for forty years with bread from
   heaven, but Moses was less than Messiah. This man fed but five thousand
   for only one day and gave them barley bread. This man is even less than
   Moses, and consequently far less than the Messiah."] 34 Then said they
   unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. [They readily recognized
   the insufficiency of manna and the possibility of God sending a better
   bread, and in a vague, wondering, half-credulous mood they asked for it
   just as the woman asked for water (John iv. 15). In answer to each set
   of questions Jesus proceeded to reveal himself, and to show that the
   blessings sought were not external to himself, but were in himself and
   were obtained by belief in him. When Jesus stood thus self-revealed,
   the Samaritan woman believed in him and was satisfied; but these Jews
   at Capernaum disbelieved and murmured.] 35 And Jesus said unto them, I
   am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he
   that believeth on me shall never thirst. [Compare John iv. 10, 13, 14
   .] 36 But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.
   [The personality of Jesus was the great proof of his divinity, but the
   Jews, though familiar with that personality, refused to consider it,
   and kept clamoring for a sign. Hence Jesus states the hopelessness of
   the situation. If one refuses to believe in the sun when he sees its
   light, feels its heat and witnesses its life-giving power, by what sign
   will you demonstrate to him the existence of the sun?] 37 All that
   which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to
   me I will in no wise cast out. [These words of Christ arise naturally
   out of the situation. The Jews, having wavered between belief and
   disbelief, had settled in a proud disbelief which was about to be
   expressed in murmuring and scorn. They were complacently
   self-satisfied, and felt that they had displayed great wisdom in
   arriving at this decision. But Jesus strikes at their pride by
   informing them that they are not his because God has rejected them as
   unworthy to be given to him. There is no suggestion or hint that the
   Father acts arbitrarily in selecting whom he shall give to Christ. The
   Son of God followed a prescribed course in the winning of men. If this
   did not win them, it was the Father's decree that they were not his. If
   this course did win them, Jesus in nowise rejected them, no matter how
   lowly their station, or how vile their past record.] 38 For I am come
   down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that
   sent me. 39 And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all which
   he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the
   last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that every one that
   beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and
   I will raise him up at the last day. [It was the purpose of God the
   Father to offer to the sons of men an eternal life through the
   life-giving power of Jesus Christ. The power which was to work in men a
   fitness for this exalted honor was a belief in the Son. How could signs
   and wonders be wrought contrary to the Father's will? They ought to
   have believed for the signs and wonders he had already wrought, instead
   of pretending that he had wrought none that were conclusive of his
   claims.] 41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he
   said, I am the bread which came down oiut of heaven. 42 And they said,
   Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
   How doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? [The Jews had
   entered with Christ upon a discussion as to whether he was a greater
   prophet than Moses, and as they denied even this fact, it is not to be
   wondered that they murmured at the turn which the discussion had taken.
   In asserting that he came down from heaven, etc., he ascribed to
   himself a participation in the divine glory which entitled him to an
   absolute superiority over all men, prophets or others. This claim was
   to them insufferable, and they thought they had a sufficient answer to
   it in that they supposed themselves to be acquainted with his birth and
   parentage.] 43 Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
   yourselves. 44 No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me
   draw him. And I will raise him up in the last day. 45 It is written in
   the prophets [Isa. liv. 13; Jer. xxxi. 33, 34; Joel iii. 16, 17], And
   they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the
   Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. [Jesus rebukes their
   murmuring as out of place. They thought themselves offended by what
   they believed to be an intolerable assumption on his part. But they
   were really offended in him for an entirely different cause, viz.:
   because they were not drawn by the Father. The Father had given the law
   as a tutor to draw to Christ (Gal. iii. 24), and he had also sent forth
   his prophets for the same purpose. Those who had availed themselves of
   this instruction, and had learned the Father's lessons, were ready to
   come to Christ. The sense of misery and desire of redemption begotten
   by the law drove one to Christ, and all the yearnings and aspirations
   inspired by the prophets attracted him thither. The Father had taught,
   but the people had not learned, just as their fathers had not learned;
   and Jesus accuses them in language kindred to the accusation of Moses
   when he says, "But Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes
   to see, and ears to hear, unto this day" (Deut. xxix. 4). In each case
   the people were to blame.] 46 Not that any man hath seen the Father,
   save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father. [The Jews might have
   construed the words of Jesus as indicating an immediate relation to the
   Father and of obtaining instruction directly from him. Such a doctrine
   would strike at the mediation of Christ. Jesus therefore guards against
   this false apprehension by denying humanity's direct access to God the
   Father, and claiming it as his own exclusive right. The teaching of the
   Father which he spoke of was obtained through the Scriptures and (in
   earlier times) the prophets, who were the authors of the Scriptures.]
   47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
   everlasting life. 48 I am the bread of life. [Jesus here reasserts the
   proposition to which the Jews had objected. Having paused to speak of
   the cause of their objections, he now asserts the main propositions,
   that he may enlarge upon them.] 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the
   wilderness, and they died. [Manna did not stay death. During the forty
   years' sojourn in the wilderness all the grown men who started from
   Egypt died save two.] 50 This is the bread which cometh down out of
   heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. [He quietly
   condescends to contrast the two breads. Manna simply sustained the body
   like any other natural food; it did no more. Jesus is supernatural
   food; he sustains the spirit unto eternal life.] 51 I am the living
   bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he
   shall live for ever: and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for
   the life of the world. [He had declared himself to be the bread of
   life, but bread must be assimilated. The assimilation of natural bread
   requires eating, but Jesus, the spiritual bread, is assimilated by
   believing on him. But he was not then perfected as the bread of life.
   It was necessary that he should sacrifice himself for our sins before
   sins could be forgiven, and it was necessary for sins to be forgiven
   before men could have life with God. By his sacrifice on the cross he
   opened the fountain of forgiveness. By raising his humanity from the
   dead and by taking it with him in his ascension into heaven, he showed
   the results which men may expect to accrue to them by his death upon
   the cross.] 52 The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How
   can this man give us his flesh to eat? [They were not all of one mind
   with regard to Christ, and they discussed from opposite sides the
   problem raised by these mysterious words.] 53 Jesus therefore said unto
   them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the
   Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. [He
   here expressed in words what he afterward expressed in symbols, when he
   gave the Lord's supper. The vital force of a disciple is proportioned
   to his belief in, remembrance of, and desire to assimilate the Christ.]
   54 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life. And
   I will raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is meat indeed,
   and my blood is drink indeed. [The flesh to be eaten must be broken,
   and the blood, if it is to be drunk, must be poured out. Christ speaks
   of himself as the sacrifice given for the saving of the world, and one
   must appropriate to himself by faith this expiation and find in it
   reconciliation with God if he would live; but the next verse enlarges
   the thought and shows that it includes more than the idea of
   expiation.] 56 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in
   me, and I in him. [The thought of drinking blood was startling to the
   Jew, for he was forbidden to taste even the blood of animals, and the
   reason assigned was very pertinent--because the blood was the life of
   the animal (Gen. ix. 4; Lev. xvii. 10-14). By insisting, therefore, on
   the drinking of his blood, Jesus has insisted that his very life be
   absorbed and assimilated. To be disciples of other teachers it is only
   necessary that we accept and follow their doctrine. But to be a
   disciple of Christ is to do more than this. His divinity permits us to
   have a spiritual communion and fellowship with him, an abiding in his
   presence, an indwelling of his Spirit, and a veritable assimilation of
   life from him. Were it otherwise he could not be food for the
   spirit--bread of life. He had started to show to the Jews that he was
   to the spirit what bread was to the body. It was difficult to bring
   home to their carnal minds so spiritual a thought, and therefore Jesus
   clothed it in carnal metaphors and made it as plain as possible.
   Christians to-day, being more spiritually minded, and more used to
   spiritual language, are somewhat confused by the carnal dress in which
   Jesus clothed his thought.] 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live
   necause of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because
   of me. [The result of our union or abiding with Christ is a perfect
   life. The life of the Father enters the soul of the disciple through
   the mediatorship of the Son. The Father, who is the fountain of life,
   sent forth the Son that he might bestow it upon all who believe in him
   and abide in him.] 58 This is that bread which came out of heaven: not
   as the fathers ate and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for
   ever. [Thus Jesus sums up the comparison which the Jews had thrust upon
   him between himself and the manna.] 59 These things said he in the
   synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. [It was in the synagogue built by
   the centurion, which we have before mentioned. Pots of manna appear to
   have been engraved upon its walls, possibly upon the frieze, for
   Colonel Wilson says of it: "It was not without a certain strange
   feeling that, on turning over one of the blocks (in the ruins), we
   found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words,
   'I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness,
   and are dead.'"] 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had
   heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 61 But Jesus
   knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them,
   Doth this cause you to stumble? 62 What then if ye should behold the
   Son of man ascending where he was before? [If the prophecy of his
   sacrifice disturbed their dreams of a temporal kingdom, what would be
   the effect of his ascension on those dreams? The Book of Acts answers
   our Lord's question. In the very hour of the ascension the very
   apostles were still expecting the revival of the kingdom of David, with
   Jerusalem for its capital. But ten days later, at Pentecost, they had
   abandoned the earthly idea and looked upon Jesus as enthroned at the
   right hand of God--Acts i. 6; ii. 32-36.] 63 It is the spirit that
   giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken
   unto you are spirit, are are life. [Jesus here tells them plainly that
   his words relate to the spiritual realm, and to life in that realm. It
   is his Spirit in our spirit which gives eternal life. His flesh in our
   flesh would profit nothing, even were a priest able, by his blessing,
   to perform the miracle of transubstantiation. The life-principle of
   Jesus lay in his divinity, and his divinity lay in his Spirit, and not
   in his flesh. We would not come in contact with his divinity by eating
   that which represented his humanity.] 64 But there are some of you that
   believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that
   believed not, and who should betray him. 65 And he said, For this cause
   have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given
   unto him of my Father. [Jesus here distinguishes between those who were
   drawn to him by divine influences, and who were therefore ready to
   follow him as he really was, and those who were drawn to him by
   mistaken notions concerning him, and who would desert him as soon as
   they discovered that their conceptions of him were incorrect. He knew
   the reason which prompted each to become his disciple.] 66 Upon this
   many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. [He had
   sifted them, for their false following could be of no benefit either to
   them or to his kingdom.] 67 Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would
   ye also go away? [Jesus had sifted the outer circle of his disciples,
   and the loss, though prophetically anticipated, was not without its
   pang. In this sixty-seventh verse he proceeds to sift the innermost
   circle, and his words are full of pathos. By giving them an opportunity
   to depart he called forth from them an expression of loyalty which
   bound them more closely to him.] 68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to
   whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. 69 And we have
   believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God. 70 Jesus answered
   them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71
   Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that
   should betray him, being one of the twelve. [We have seen from verse 64
   that Jesus has already had the betrayer in his mind. Here he speaks of
   him openly. In a discourse which forecasted his passion it was natural
   that he should allude to his betrayer, especially, when his presence
   enforced remembrance. But there was another reason to mention him at
   this time. He was an illustration of the truth that no man could be a
   real follower of Jesus unless he became such by the drawing of the
   Father.]

Jesus Fails to Attend the Third Passover.

Scribes Reproach Him for Disregarding Tradition.

(Galilee, Probably Capernaum, Spring a.d. 29.)

^A Matt. XV. 1-20; ^B Mark VII. 1-23; ^D John VII. 1.

   ^d 1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not
   walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him. [John told us in
   his last chapter that the passover was near at hand. He here makes a
   general statement which shows that Jesus did not attend this passover.
   The reason for his absence is given at John v. 18.] ^a 1 Then there
   come to Jesus from Jerusalem ^b 1 And there are gathered together unto
   him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from
   Jerusalem, 2 and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread
   with defiled, that is, with unwashen, hands. [Evidently several days
   intervened between the address of John vi. and the events recorded
   here, for the Pharisees and scribes would not be likely to leave
   Jerusalem until after the passover. [7] ] 3 (For the Pharisees, and all
   the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the
   tradition of the elders; 4 and when they come from the market-place,
   except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there
   are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and
   brasen vessels.) 5 And the Pharisees and scribes asked him, ^a saying,
   ^b Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders,
   but eat their bread with defiled hands? ^a 2 Why do thy disciples
   transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands
   when they eat bread. [For former comment on the custom of washing or
   dipping see page 312. Belief in the tradition of the elders was the
   fundamental peculiarity of the Pharisaic system. They held that these
   traditions, or oral expositions of and additions to the law, were
   revealed to Moses along with the law, and were communicated by him
   orally to the elders of the people, by whose successors they had been
   handed down through each successive generation. They regarded these
   traditions as equal in authority with the written word. Various types
   of uncleanness are specified in the Mosaic law. Traditions extended the
   idea of uncleanness so as to hold the man as probably unclean who had
   been in the marketplace, where he might have touched an unclean person,
   and to hold certain cups, pots, and brazen vessels as ceremonially
   unclean when neither the laws of Moses nor the laws of hygiene declared
   them to be so. Since the law of Moses ordered the unclean to dip
   himself in a bath for his cleansing, the tradition of the elders
   required a like dipping in these cases of uncleanness which they had
   invented. When we remember that bathing was a daily practice among the
   Pharisees, we are less surprised at this observance. As to the theory
   that the tradition of the elders was derived from Moses, Jesus here
   flatly contradicts it. There is no trustworthy evidence to show that it
   is of higher antiquity than the time of the return from the Babylonian
   captivity.] 3 And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also
   transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 7 Ye
   hypocrites, ^b Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites [ Isa. xxix.
   13], ^a saying, ^b as it is written, This people honoreth me with their
   lips, But their heart is far from me. 7 But in vain do they worship me,
   Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. 8 Ye leave the
   commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. 9 And he said
   unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may
   keep your tradition. [These Pharisees coming from Jerusalem could find
   nothing wherein Jesus or his disciples transgressed the law, so they
   eagerly grasped this transgression of the tradition as affording ground
   for an accusation. Jesus does not deny their charge, but justifies his
   disciples by attacking the whole traditional system, basing his attack
   upon a pointed prophecy which condemns it. It is hard for us to learn
   and apply the distinction between serving God as God wishes to be
   served, and serving him according to our own wishes and notions.] ^a 4
   For God { ^b Moses} said [that is, God said it through Moses], Honor
   thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or
   mother, let him die the death [see Ex. xx. 12; Deut. v. 16; Ex xxi. 17;
   Lev. xx. 9]: 11 but ye say, If a man { ^a Whosoever} shall say to his
   father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited
   by me ^b is Corban, that is to say, Given to God; ^a 6 he shall not
   honor his father. ^b 12 ye no longer suffer him to do ought for his
   father or his mother; ^a And ye have made { ^b 13 making} void the word
   of God by { ^a because of} your tradition. ^b which ye have delivered:
   and many such like things ye do. [Leaving for a moment the main
   question concerning uncleanness and washing, Jesus makes good his
   indictment against their tradition by giving an example of the
   mischievous way in which it set aside God's commandments. The law
   required the honoring of parents, and for any one to cast off his
   parents in their old age, thus subjecting them to beggary or
   starvation, was to do more than to speak evil of them. Such conduct was
   practically to curse them, and to incur the death penalty for so doing.
   But at this point the Pharisees interfered with their tradition, which
   taught that a son could say of that part of his estate by which his
   parents might be profited, It is a gift; that is, a gift to God, and by
   thus dedicating that part to God, he would free himself from his
   obligation to his parents. Thus tradition undid the law. God's law
   leads to pure and acceptable worship, while human additions and
   amendments make worship vain, if not abominable. There is probably not
   one such addition or amendment which does not to a greater or less
   degree make some commandment void.] 14 And he called to him the
   multitude again, and said unto them [Having been accused by the scribes
   and Pharisees of a breach of their tradition, Jesus points out to them
   generally the iniquity of tradition, for it lay within their power as
   leaders to remedy the whole system of things. Having done this, he
   turns to the multitude and answers before them as to the offense with
   which he is specifically charged. Thus he gives to the leaders general
   principles, and to the common people the single instance], Hear me all
   of you, and understand: ^a 11 Not that which entereth into the mouth
   defileth a man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this
   defileth a man. ^b 15 there is nothing from without a man, that going
   into him can defile him: but the things which proceed out of the man
   are those that defile the man. 17 And when he was entered into the
   house from the multitude, ^a 12 Then came the disciples, and said unto
   him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard
   this saying? [The entire speech offended them. He charged them with
   hypocrisy. He showed that their tradition, which they reverenced as a
   revelation from God, led them into sin, and he disturbed their
   self-complacency by showing that the ceremonial cleanness, which was
   founded on tradition, and in which they prided themselves, was
   worthless in comparison with the moral cleanness required by God's law,
   which they had ignored. It grieved the disciples to see Jesus offend
   these reverend gentlemen from Jerusalem. Like many modern disciples
   their respect for men counteracted their zeal for truth.] 13 But he
   answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath planted
   not, shall be up rooted up. [God had planted the law with its doctrine:
   he had planted the Hebrew religion as given by Moses. He had not
   planted the tradition of the elders; so it, and the religion founded
   upon it, was doomed to be rooted up.] 14 Let them alone: they are blind
   guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.
   [This proverbial expression is found in the Sermon on the Mount. See
   page 262. There it taught that the disciple could expect to attain no
   higher felicity than his teacher. Here it teaches the lesson of
   patience, and is akin to the words of David, which begin, "Fret not
   thyself because of evil-doers" (Ps. xxxvii. 1, 2). The words of Jesus
   are full of encouragement to those who adhere to the simple teachings
   of God; for they show that God guarantees that every error shall be
   uprooted, and that every teacher of error or false religion shall
   participate in the judgment which uproots, and shall fall into the pit
   of ruin; and his disciples, no matter how numerous, shall share his
   fate. In this particular instance, the destruction of Jerusalem was the
   pit. The Jewish leaders led their disciples into it, and God uprooted
   their system of tradition, that the pure gospel might be sowed in the
   room which they occupied.] 15 And Peter answered and said unto him,
   Declare unto us the parable. [The word "parable" is used here in its
   looser sense to indicate an obscure saying.] ^b his disciples asked of
   him the parable. [They asked what he meant by the words contained in
   the eleventh verse. 18 And he saith { ^a said,} ^b unto them, ^a Are ye
   even yet ^b so without understanding also? [It was to be expected that
   the multitude, swayed by the teaching of the Pharisees, would be slow
   to grasp what Jesus said about uncleanness; but the disciples, having
   been so long taught of him, and having felt free to eat with unwashed
   hands, should have been more quick of understanding.] Perceive ye not,
   that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;
   19 because it goeth not into his heart, but ^a passeth into the { ^b
   his} belly, and goeth out into { ^a and is cast out into} the draught?
   ^b This he said, making all meats clean. 20 And he said, ^a 18 But the
   things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and
   they defile the man. ^b That which proceedeth out of the man, that
   defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, ^a come
   forth { ^b proceed,} ^a evil thoughts, ^b fornications, thefts,
   murders, adulteries, 22; covetousness, wickedness, deceit,
   lasciviousness, an evil eye [an envious eye] ^a false witness,
   railings: { ^b railing,} pride, foolishness: 23 all these evil things
   proceed from within, and ^a 20 these are the things which defile the
   man; but to eat with unwashen hands, defileth not the man. [Thus Jesus
   sets forth the simple doctrine that a man's moral and spiritual state
   is not dependent upon the symbolic cleanness of his physical diet, much
   less is it dependent on ceremonial observances in regard to things
   eaten, or the dishes from which they are eaten. Of course, Jesus did
   not mean at this time to abrogate the Mosaic law of legal uncleanness.
   These uncleannesses worked no spiritual defilement, but were merely
   typical of such; for the food in no way touched or affected the mind or
   soul, the fountains of spiritual life, but only the corporeal organs,
   which have no moral susceptibility. The Pharisees had erred in
   confusing legal and spiritual defilement, and had added error to error
   by multiplying the causes of defilement in their tradition. By thus
   showing that legal defilement was merely symbolic, Jesus classed it
   with all the other symbolism which was to be done away with when the
   gospel reality was fully ushered in (Col. ii. 16, 17). In saying,
   therefore, that Jesus made all meats clean, Mark does not mean that
   Jesus then and there repealed the law. The declaration of such repeal
   came later (Acts x. 14, 15). He means that he there drew those
   distinctions and laid down those principles which supplanted the Mosaic
   law when the kingdom of God was ushered in on the day of Pentecost.
   Here was the fountain whence Paul drew all his teaching concerning
   things clean and unclean.]

Second Withdrawal from Herod's Territory.

^A Matt. XV. 21; ^B Mark VII. 24.

   ^b 24 And from thence ^a Jesus ^b arose, and went ^a out ^b away ^a and
   withdrew into the parts { ^b borders} of Tyre and Sidon. [The journey
   here is indicated in marked terms because it differs from any
   previously recorded, for it was the first time that Jesus ever entered
   a foreign or heathen country. Some commentators contend from the use of
   the word "borders" by Mark that Jesus did not cross over the boundary,
   but the point is not well taken, for Mark vii. 31 shows that the
   journey led through Sidon. For the location of Tyre and Sidon, see page
   286. Jesus withdrew to escape the opposition of his enemies and the
   mistaken movements of his friends. As he was not on a missionary tour,
   it was perfectly proper for him to enter heathen territory.]

Healing a Phoenician Woman's Daughter.

(Region of Tyre and Sidon.)

^A Matt. XV. 22-28; ^B Mark VII. 24-30.

   ^b And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it [Jesus
   sought concealment for the purposes noted in the last section. He also,
   no doubt, desired an opportunity to impact private instruction to the
   twelve]; and he could not be hid. [The fame of Jesus had spread far and
   wide, and he and his disciples were too well known to escape the notice
   of any who had seen them or heard them described.] 25 But { ^a 22 And}
   behold, ^b straightway ^a a Canaanitish woman ^b whose little daughter
   [the word for daughter is a diminutive, such as often used to indicate
   affection] had an unclean spirit, having heard of him [having formerly
   heard of his power and having recently heard of his arrival in her
   neighborhood], ^a came out from those borders [this does not mean, as
   some construe it, that she crossed over into Galilee from Phoenicia; it
   means that she came out of the very region where Jesus then was], and
   cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David [Sympathy so
   identified her with her daughter that she asked mercy for herself. The
   title "son of David" shows that the Jewish hopes had spread to
   surrounding nations and that some, like this woman and the one at
   Jacob's well, expected to share in the Messianic blessing]; my daughter
   is grievously vexed with a demon. 23 But he answered her not a word.
   [God's unanswering silence is a severe test of our faith.] ^b 26 Now
   the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by race. [The Macedonian
   conquest had diffused Greek civilization throughout western Asia till
   the word Greek among the Jews had become synonymous with Gentile. The
   term Canaanite was narrower and indicated an inhabitant of Canaan--that
   is, a non-Jewish inhabitant of Palestine. The term Syrophoenician was
   narrower still. It meant a Syrian in Phoenicia, and distinguished the
   Phoenicians from the other Syrians. Phoenicia was a narrow strip near
   the northeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea. It was some twenty-eight
   miles long with an average width of about one mile. Canaan means
   lowland; Phoenicia means palmland. The Canaanites founded Sidon (Gen.
   x. 19), and the Phoenicians were their descendants.] And she besought
   him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. ^a And his
   disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth
   after us. [The woman by her loud entreaties was drawing to Jesus the
   very attention which he sought to avoid. The disciples therefore
   counseled him to grant her request for his own sake--not for mercy or
   compassion, but merely to be rid of her.] 24 But he answered [answered
   the disciples, not the woman] and said, I was not sent but unto the
   lost sheep of the house of Israel. [Jesus had not forborne answering
   her prayers through lack of feeling, but from principle. It was part of
   the divine plan that his personal ministry should be confined to the
   Jewish people. Divine wisdom approved of this course as best, not only
   for the Jews, but for the Gentiles as well. Variations from this plan
   were to be few and were to be granted only as rewards to those of
   exceptional faith.] 25 But she came ^b and fell down at his feet. ^a
   and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. [The narrative indicates
   that Jesus had left the house and was moving on, and that the woman
   obtruded herself upon his notice by falling in front of him and
   obstructing his way.] 26 And he answered and said, ^b unto her, Let the
   children first be filled: for it is not meet [suitable, becoming] to
   take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs. [By the use of
   the word "first" Jesus suggested that there would come a time of mercy
   for the Gentiles. He uses the diminutive for the word dog, thus
   indicating a tame pet, and suggesting rather the dependence and
   subordinate position than the uncleanness of the dog. By so doing he
   gave the woman an argumentative handle which she was not slow to
   grasp.] 28 But she answered and saith { ^a said,} ^b unto him, Yea,
   Lord; ^a for even the dogs ^b under the table eat of the children's
   crumbs. ^a which fall from their masters' table. [Jesus had suggested
   that domestic order by which dogs are required to wait until the meal
   is over before they receive their portion; but with a wit made keen by
   her necessity, she replies by alluding to the well-known fact that dogs
   under the table are permitted to eat the crumbs even while the meal is
   in progress; intimating thereby her hope to receive and before all the
   needs of Israel had first been satisfied. By using the word dogs Jesus
   did not mean to convey the impression that he shared the Jewish
   prejudices against Gentiles; a construction which would be contrary to
   Luke iv. 25, 26, and Matt. viii. 10-12.] 28 Then Jesus answered and
   said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: ^b For this saying go thy
   way; ^a be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. ^b the demon is gone
   out of thy daughter. [Thus by its ending this little incident
   illustrates the doctrine that men should pray and not faint (Luke
   xviii. 1-8). The woman's experience has been often repeated by other
   parents who have prayed for children which, if not demon-possessed, was
   certainly swayed by diabolical influences. The woman's faith is shown
   in many ways: 1. She persisted when he was silent. 2. She reasoned when
   he spoke. 3. She regarded this miracle, though a priceless gift to her,
   as a mere crumb from the table of his abundant powers. It is noteworthy
   that the two most notable for faith--this woman and the centurion--were
   both Gentiles.] ^a And her daughter was healed from that hour. ^b 30
   And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the
   bed, and the demon gone out. [The posture of the daughter indicated the
   physical exhaustion which would naturally succeed the intense nervous
   strain of demoniacal possession--especially the last paroxysms produced
   by the departing demon.]

Another Avoiding of Herod's Territory.

^A Matt. XV. 29; ^B Mark VII. 31.

   ^b 31 And ^a Jesus ^b again went out. ^a And departed thence, ^b from
   the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon, ^a and came nigh unto the
   sea of Galilee; ^b through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. ^a
   and he went up into a mountain, and sat down there. [From Tyre Jesus
   proceeded northward to Sidon and thence eastward across the mountains
   and the headwaters of the Jordan to the neighborhood of Damascus. Here
   he turned southward and approached the Sea of Galilee on its eastern
   side. Somewhere amid the mountains on the eastern side he sat down; i.
   e., he ceased his journeying for some days.]

The Deaf Stammerer Healed and Four Thousand Fed.

^A Matt. XV. 30-39; ^B Mark VII. 32-VIII. 9.

   ^b 32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
   in his speech [The man had evidently learned to speak before he lost
   his hearing. Some think that defective hearing had caused the
   impediment in his speech, but verse 35 suggests that he was
   tongue-tied]; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. 33 And he
   took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into
   his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue [He separated him from
   the crowd to avoid publicity (see verse 36, below), and by signs
   indicating an intention to heal, Jesus gives him the assurance which in
   other cases he is accustomed to give by words. He evidently induced the
   man by signs to stick out his tongue. He then placed one finger of each
   hand in the man's ears, after which he spat. Where he spit is not said.
   He then touched with one or both his thumbs the man's tongue, and,
   speaking the healing word, the cure was accomplished]; 34 and looking
   up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be
   opened. [Jesus here, as in the healing of Jairus' daughter, spoke the
   Aramaic. Why he sighed is not said. It was doubtless an expression of
   sympathy, though Farrar thinks he did so because he thought of the
   millions there were of deaf and dumb who in this world never hear and
   never speak.] 35 And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue
   was loosed, and he spake plain. [He was evidently not deaf from his
   birth, or he would not have known how to speak at all.] 36 And he
   charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged
   them, so much the more a great deal they published it. [Jesus was still
   seeking to suppress excitement. A very little encouragement from him
   would have brought together a multitude, the very thing which he was
   journeying to avoid. He therefore cautioned the people to be silent,
   but by a common freak of human nature, his desire to avoid publicity
   made him more wonderful in the eyes of the people, and thereby inspired
   a greater eagerness on their part to tell about him.] 37 And they were
   beyond measure astonished [Mark here coins a double superlative to
   express the boundlessness of their amazement], saying, He hath done all
   things well [commendation upon the workman which had originally been
   bestowed upon his work--Gen. i. 31]; he maketh even the deaf to hear,
   and the dumb to speak. [These were the people who had asked Jesus to
   depart from their coast on account of the loss of their swine. A
   complete change in their feelings had taken place since that day.] ^a
   30 And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame,
   blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his
   feet; and he healed them [We have here an instance of the common
   difference between the narratives of Matthew and Mark. Where Matthew is
   wont to mention the healing of multitudes, Mark picks out one of the
   most remarkable cases and describes it minutely. The hasty action of
   those who brought in the sick and returned to bring in others is
   indicated by the way in which they cast down their burdens at Jesus'
   feet]: 31; insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
   speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and
   they glorified the God of Israel [The people whom Jesus healed were
   Jews, but daily intercourse with the heathen of Decapolis had tended to
   cool their religious ardor. The works of Jesus revived this ardor and
   caused them to praise the God whose prophet they esteemed Jesus to be.]
   ^a 32 And ^b 1 In those days [i. e., while Christ was in Decapolis],
   when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, ^a
   Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, { ^b saith,} unto them,
   2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
   three days, and have nothing to eat: ^a And I would not send them away
   fasting, lest haply they faint on the way. ^b 3 and if I send them away
   fasting to their home, they will faint on the way: for some of them are
   come from far. [When the five thousand had been caught in similar
   circumstances, the apostles had come with suggestions to Jesus, but
   now, being taught by experience, they keep silence and let Jesus manage
   as he will. The multitude had not been three days without food, but it
   had been with Jesus three days and was now without food.] 4 And his {
   ^a the} disciples say unto { ^b answered} him, Whence shall one be able
   to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? ^a Whence should
   we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a
   multitude? [It seems strange that the apostles should ask such a
   question after having assisted in feeding the five thousand. But the
   failure to expect a miracle, despite previous experience, was a common
   occurrence in the history of Israel and of the twelve (Num. xi. 21-23;
   Ps. lxxviii. 19, 20). In this case the failure of the apostles to
   expect miraculous relief suggests that they had probably often been
   hungry and had long since ceased to look for supernatural relief in
   such cases. Their disbelief here is so similar to their disbelief in
   the first instance that it, with a few other minor details, has led
   rationalistic commentators to confound the miracle with the feeding of
   the five thousand. But the words of Jesus forbid this-- Matt. xvi. 9,
   10; Mark viii. 19, 20.] 34 And Jesus said unto them, ^b 5 And he asked
   them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. ^a and a few small
   fishes. 35 And he commanded { ^b commandeth} the multitude to sit down
   on the ground [they were on the bleak mountain, and not in the grassy
   plain of Butaiha]: and he took the seven loaves ^a and the fishes; and
   he gave thanks, ^b and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his {
   ^a the} disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. { ^b to set
   before them; and they set them before the multitude.} 7 And they had a
   few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these
   also before them. ^a 37 And they all ate, and were filled: and they
   took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets
   full. 38 And they that did eat were ^b about ^a four thousand men,
   besides women and children. 39 And he sent away the multitudes.

Third Withdrawal from Herod's Territory.

Pharisaic Leaven. A Blind Man Healed.

(Magadan and Bethsaida. Probably Summer, a.d. 29.)

^A Matt. XV. 39-XVI. 12; ^B Mark VIII. 10-26.

   ^b 10 And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, ^a
   and came into the borders of Magadan. ^b into the parts of Dalmanutha.
   [It appears from the context that he crossed the lake to the west
   shore. Commentators, therefore, pretty generally think that Magadan is
   another form of the name Magdala, and that Dalmanutha was either
   another name for Magdala, or else a village near it.] ^a 1 And the
   Pharisees and Sadducees ^b came forth, and began to question with him,
   seeking of him a sign ^a and trying him [testing the strength of his
   miraculous power] asked him to show them a sign from heaven. [They
   rejected his miracles as signs of his Messiahship, the Pharisees
   holding that such signs could be wrought by Beelzebub. They therefore
   asked a sign from heaven such as only God could give, and such as he
   had accorded to Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and Elijah, or such as Joel
   foretold (Joel ii. 31). It is generally thought that the Herodians were
   Sadducees of Galilee. If so, we note the beginning of their hostility
   recorded at Mark iii. 6, page 216.] ^b 12 And he sighed deeply in his
   spirit [being grieved deeply at the sinful obduracy which demanded
   signs in the midst of overwhelming demonstrations of divine power], ^a
   2 He answered and said { ^b saith,} ^a unto them, ^b Why doth this
   generation seek a sign? ^a When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair
   weather: for the heaven is red. 3 And in the morning, It will be foul
   weather to-day: for the sky is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern
   the face of the heaven; but ye cannot discern the signs of the times.
   [For comment on similar language, see page 325. The signs of the times
   being fulfillments of prophecies, were better evidence of the period
   and presence of the Messiah than heavenly portents. It is useless to
   bestow new signs upon those who are blind as to the signs already
   existing. Jews continue to require a sign--I. Cor. i. 22.] 4 An evil
   and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and ^b verily I say
   unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. [i. e.,
   none such as was demanded] ^b but the sign of Jonah. [For comment on
   similar language, see pages 305-306. The resurrection or Jonah sign was
   a sign from heaven in the sense in which they used the words; that is,
   it was wrought directly by God, and not through man.] 13 And he left
   them, ^b And again entering into the boat departed to the other side.
   [I. e., from Magdala back again to the east shore, or rather, toward
   Bethsaida Julias, on the northeast shore.] ^a 5 And the disciples came
   to the other side and forgot to take bread. ^b and they had not in the
   boat with them more than one loaf. [This loaf was probably left over
   from the previous supply.] ^a 6 Then Jesus said unto them, ^b 15 And he
   charged them, saying, ^a Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
   Pharisees and Sadducees. Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of
   the Sadducees. ^b and the leaven of Herod. [Leaven, which answered to
   our modern yeast, was a symbol of a secret, penetrating, pervasive
   influence, usually of a corrupting nature. The influence of the
   Pharisees was that of formalism, hypocritical ostentation, and
   traditionalism; that of the Sadducees was sneering rationalistic
   unbelief, free thought and cunning worldliness, manifesting itself
   among the Herodians in political corruption. 16 And they reasoned one
   with another, ^a among themselves, saying, We took { ^b have} no bread.
   They thought that Jesus reproved them for their carelessness in
   forgetting to take bread, since that carelessness might lead them to be
   without bread on their journey. So his rebuke below indicates.] ^a 8
   And Jesus perceiving it said, { ^b saith,} unto them, ^a O ye of little
   faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
   bread? 9 Do ye not yet perceive, ^b neither understand? ^a neither
   remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets
   [cophini, probably traveling baskets] ye took up? 10 Neither the seven
   loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets [spurides, probably
   grain baskets or hampers] ye took up? 11 How is it that ye do not
   perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? ^b have ye your
   hearts hardened? 18 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye
   not? and do ye not remember? 19 When I brake the five loaves among the
   five thousand, how many baskets [cophini] full of broken pieces took ye
   up? They say unto him, Twelve. 20 And when the seven among the four
   thousand, how many basketfuls [spurides] of broken pieces took ye up?
   And they say unto him, Seven. 21 And he said unto them, Do ye not yet
   understand? ^a But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
   12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven
   of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. [Jesus
   had resorted to metaphor because the word leaven better expressed his
   idea than did the word teaching. The formulated dogmas of the Pharisees
   were not so bad, but the subtle influence of their spirit and example
   corrupted without warning, like a concealed grave. There are those
   to-day who are too skillful to be openly convicted of heterodox
   statements, but whose teaching, nevertheless, in its very essence and
   spirit, tends to infidelity.] ^b 22 And they cometh unto Bethsaida.
   [Not the suburb of Capernaum, but Bethsaida Julias, a town on the east
   side of the Jordan, near where it flows into the Sea of Galilee. Jesus
   was proceeding northward toward Cæsarea Philippi.] And they bring to
   him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. 23 And he took hold of
   the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village [Jesus
   increased the sympathy between himself and the man by separating him
   from the crowd. Our greatest blessing can only come to us after we have
   been alone with God]; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his
   hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught? 24 And he looked up,
   and said, I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking. 25 Then again
   he laid his hands again upon his eyes; and he looked steadfastly, and
   was restored, and saw all things clearly. [The man's eyes were probably
   sore, and Jesus made use of saliva to soften and soothe them. But it
   was our Lord's custom to give variety to the manifestation of his
   power, sometimes using one apparent auxiliary means, and sometimes
   another; and also healing instantly or progressively, as he chose, that
   the people might see that the healing was altogether a matter of his
   will. The man had evidently not been born blind, else he would not have
   been able to recognize men or trees by sight, for those not used to
   employ sight can not by it tell a circle from a square.] 26 And he sent
   him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village. [The
   man, of course, lived in the village, and to send him home was to send
   him thither, but he was to go directly home and not spread the news
   through the town, for if he did the population would be at once drawn
   to Jesus, thus breaking up the privacy which he sought to maintain.]

Third Withdrawal from Herod's Territory.

The Great Confession Made by Peter.

(Near Cæsarea Philippi, Summer, a.d. 29.)

^A Matt. XVI. 13-20; ^B Mark VIII. 27-30; ^C Luke IX. 18-21.

   ^b 27 And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of
   Cæsarea Philippi [The city of Paneas was enlarged by Herod Philip I.,
   and named in honor of Tiberias Cæsar. It also bore the name Philippi
   because of the name of its builder, and to distinguish it from Cæsarea
   Palestinæ or Cæsarea Strotonis, a city on the Mediterranean coast.
   Paneas, the original name, still pertains to the village, though now
   corrupted to Banias. It is situated under the shadow of Mt. Hermon at
   the eastern of the two principal sources of the Jordan, and is the most
   northern city of the Holy Land visited by Jesus, and save Sidon, the
   most northern point of his travels]: ^a 13 Now when Jesus came into the
   parts of Cæsarea Philippi, ^c it came to pass, ^b on the way ^c as he
   was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked ^b his
   disciples, saying, unto them, ^a Who do men say that the Son of man is?
   ^a Who do men { ^c the multitude} say that I am? [Jesus asks them to
   state the popular opinion concerning himself as contrasted with the
   opinion of the rulers, Pharisees, etc.] 19 And they answering ^b told
   him, saying, { ^c said,} ^a Some say John the Baptist; ^c but { ^b and}
   ^a some, ^b others, Elijah; but { ^c and} others, ^a Jeremiah, or ^c
   that one of the old prophets is risen again. [For comment on similar
   language, see page 370 (Section LXII). It should be noted that popular
   opinion did not honor him as Messiah, but since it accepted him as a
   prophet, the people were therefore inexcusable in not receiving the
   statements which he made in regard to himself, and admitting the
   Messianic claims which he set forth.] 20 And he said { ^a saith} unto
   them, ^b 29 And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? [Jesus here
   first asks the disciples this question, having given them abundant time
   and opportunity in which to form a correct judgment. The proper answer
   of the heart to this question forms the starting-point of the true
   Christian life.] ^a 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, { ^c
   answering ^b answereth and saith} unto him, Thou art the Christ. ^c of
   God. ^a the Son of the living God. [Peter asserts this as an assured
   fact and not as a mere opinion. This confession embraces two
   propositions: 1. The office of Jesus--the Christ; 2. The divinity of
   Jesus--the Son of God. The Christhood of Jesus implies his humanity,
   for as such he was to be the son of David. It also identifies him as
   the hero or subject of prophecy, the long-expected deliverer. In
   declaring Jesus to be the Son of God, Peter rose above the popular
   theories as to the personality of Messiah, for the Jews generally did
   not expect him to be divine. The term "living God" was used by prophets
   to express the contrast between dead idols and the supreme Being who is
   possessed of vitality, reason, and feeling.] 17 And Jesus answered and
   said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah [Jesus gives the full
   name to make his saying more personally emphatic]: for flesh and blood
   [The common words of contrast by which humanity was distinguished from
   divinity. See also Gal. i. 16] hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
   Father who is in heaven. [Peter was blessed by having a revelation from
   God by which facts were made known that could not be discovered by the
   unaided human reason. God had revealed the truth to him in the words
   and works of Jesus, and this revealed truth was to him a source of
   happiness both temporal and eternal. Like confessions as to this truth
   had been made before (Matt. xiv. 33; John i. 49), but they had been
   made under the pressure of miraculous display and strong emotion. Hence
   they were rather exclamatory guesses at the truth, and differed from
   this now made by Peter which was the calm expression of a settled
   conviction produced both by the character and by the miracles of
   Jesus.] 18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter [petros, a
   noun masculine] and upon this rock [Petra, a noun feminine] I will
   build my church [The tense here is future. Christ had followers, but
   they were not yet organized, and hence had no such structural form as
   to suggest a similitude to a building]; and the gates of Hades [Hades
   was the name of the abode of the dead. Its gate symbolized its power
   because the military forces of an ancient city always sallied forth
   from its gates] shall not prevail against it. [Death shall neither
   destroy the organic church which is in the world, nor the members
   thereof which go down into the grave (I. Thess. iv. 15; I. Cor. xv.
   54-56). No passage in the word of God has called forth more discussion
   than this and the succeeding verse, the first point in dispute being as
   to what is meant by the rock; i. e., whether Christ or Peter or Peter's
   confession is the foundation of the church; the second point being as
   to the extent of the power and authority bestowed on Peter by the
   symbol of the keys. To aid us in reaching a correct conclusion we must
   note that Jesus speaks in metaphorical language. He represents: 1. His
   kingdom as a city about to be built upon a rock. 2. Himself as a
   builder of the city. 3. Simon Peter as the one who holds the keys to
   the gates by which egress and regress is had to the city. 4. The gates
   or powers of the opposing city of Hades are not able to prevail against
   this kingdom city. Now, since Jesus himself occupies the position of
   builder in the metaphor, and Simon Peter the position of key-bearer,
   neither of them can properly be regarded as the foundation. The
   foundation must therefore be the confession which Peter has just
   spoken, since it is all that remains that is liable to such
   application. The case could present no difficulty at all were it not
   for the unmistakable allusion to Peter (petros, a loose stone) as in
   some way associated with petra, the bedrock or foundation. But in the
   light of other Scriptures this allusion presents no difficulty; for all
   the apostles were such stones, and were closely allied to the
   foundation (Eph. ii. 19-22; Gal. ii. 9). Compare also I. Pet. ii. 3-8.
   The Christian religion in all its redemptive completeness rests and can
   rest on no other foundation than Christ (I. Cor. iii. 11). But the
   church or kingdom of Christ among men rests organically and
   constitutionally upon a foundation of apostolic authority, for the
   apostles were the mouthpieces of the Holy Spirit; but in this apostolic
   foundation the other apostles had equal rights, each one of them
   becoming a living foundation stone as soon as his faith led him to make
   a like confession with Simon Peter. Hence we find the apostle Paul
   asserting the superior authority of the apostles to all other Christian
   teachers and workers (I. Cor. xii. 28), and times without number
   asserting his apostolic office and authority--I. Cor. ix. 1, 2; II.
   Cor. xii. 12; xiii. 1-4; Gal. i. 1, 8; Eph. iii. 1-6; Phil. 8, 9.] 19 I
   will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever
   thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou
   shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [Continuing his
   metaphorical language, Jesus promised to Peter the keys; i. e., the
   authority to lay down the rules or laws (under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, however) for admission to or exclusion from the kingdom or
   church. This office was, of course, given to Peter in a secondary
   sense, since it must ever belong to Christ in a primary sense (Rev.
   iii. 7). The figure of key-bearer is taken from Isa. xxii. 22. Peter
   used the keys on the day of Pentecost to open the church to the Jews,
   and about seven years afterward, at Cæsarea Palestinæ, he used them
   again to admit the Gentiles. In fixing the terms of admission, he also
   fixed the terms of exclusion, for all who are not admitted are
   excluded. The keys as used by Peter have never been changed; that is to
   say, the terms of admission abide forever. Plurality of keys is merely
   part of the parabolic drapery, since cities were accustomed to have
   several gates, thus requiring a plurality of keys. The kingdom was not
   opened to Jews and Gentiles by different keys, since both were admitted
   on the same terms. The words "bind" and "loose" were commonly used
   among the Jews in the sense of forbid and allow. Abundant instances of
   this usage have been collected by Lightfoot. They relate to the binding
   and annulling of laws and rules. In this sense the word for loose, is
   used very many times in the New Testament, but it is translated by the
   word break or broken ( Matt. v. 19; John vii. 23; x. 35). The power
   here given to Peter was soon after extended to the rest of the apostles
   ( Matt. xviii. 18). The apostles were to lay down, as they afterward
   did, the organic law of the new kingdom, defining what things were
   prohibited and what permitted. Their actions in this behalf would of
   course be ratified in heaven, because they were none other than the
   acts of the Holy Spirit expressed through the apostles.] ^b 30 And ^a
   20 Then { ^c 21 But} ^a charged he the disciples ^c and commanded them
   to tell this to no man; ^b that they should tell no man of him. ^a that
   he was the Christ. [The people were not ready to receive this truth,
   nor were the apostles sufficiently instructed to rightly proclaim it.
   Their heads were full of wrong ideas with regard to Christ's work and
   office, and had they been permitted to teach about him, they would have
   said that which it would have been necessary for them to subsequently
   correct, thus producing confusion.]

Passion Foretold. Peter Rebuked.

^A Matt. XVI. 21-28; ^B Mark VIII. 31-38; IX. 1; ^C Luke IX. 22-27.

   ^a 21 From that time [i. e., from the time of Peter's confession, and
   about three-quarters of a year before the crucifixion] began Jesus to
   show unto his disciples, ^b 31 And to teach them, that the Son of man
   must suffer many things [Since the apostles, by the mouth of Peter, had
   just confessed Jesus as Christ, it was necessary that their crude
   Messianic conceptions should be corrected and that the true
   Christhood--the Christhood of the atonement and the
   resurrection--should be revealed to them. In discourse and parable
   Jesus had explained the principles and the nature of the kingdom, and
   now, from this time forth, he taught the apostles about himself, the
   priestly King], ^a that he must go up to Jerusalem, ^b and be rejected
   by ^a and suffer many things of the elders, and ^b the chief priests,
   and the scribes [The Jewish Sanhedrin was generally designated by thus
   naming the three constituent parts. See page 45], and be killed, ^a and
   the third day be raised up. { ^b and after three days rise again.} [For
   comment on these variant phrases, see page 306.] 32 And he spake the
   saying openly. ^c 22 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things,
   and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
   killed, and the third day be raised up. [Very early in his ministry
   Jesus had given obscure intimations concerning his death (John ii.
   19-22; iii. 14; Matt. xii. 38-40), but these had not been understood by
   either friend or foe. Now that he thus spoke plainly, we may see by
   Peter's conduct that they comprehended and were deeply moved by the
   dark and more sorrowful portion of his revelation, and failed to grasp
   the accompanying promise of a resurrection.] ^a 22 And Peter took him,
   and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall
   never be unto thee. [Evidently Peter regarded Jesus as overcome by a
   fit of despondency, and felt that such talk would utterly dishearten
   the disciples if it were persisted in. His love, therefore, prompted
   him to lead Jesus to one side and deal plainly with him. In so doing,
   Peter overstepped the laws of discipleship and assumed that he knew
   better than the Master what course to pursue. In his feelings he was
   the forerunner of those modern wiseacres who confess themselves
   constrained to reject the doctrine of a suffering Messiah.] ^b 33 But
   he turning about, and seeing his disciples. ^a turned, ^b rebuked
   Peter, and saith, { ^a said} unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
   thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of
   God, but the things that be of men. [Jesus withdrew from Peter and
   turned back to his disciples. By the confession of the truth Simon had
   just won his promised name of Peter, which allied him to Christ, the
   foundation. But when he now turned aside to speak the language of the
   tempter, Peter receives the name Satan, as if he were the very devil
   himself. Peter presented the same temptation with which the devil once
   called forth a similar rebuke from Christ (Matt. iv. 10). He was
   unconsciously trying to dissuade Jesus from the death on which the
   salvation of the world depended, and this was working into Satan's
   hand. Peter did not mind or think about the Messiah's kingdom as
   divinely conceived and revealed in the Scriptures.] ^b 34 And he called
   unto him the multitude with his disciples, ^a 24 Then said Jesus unto
   his disciples, ^c 23 And he said unto all [despite the efforts of Jesus
   to seek privacy, the people were still near enough at hand to be called
   and addressed], If any man would come after me, let him deny himself,
   and take up his cross daily [comp. Rom. viii. 36; I. Cor. xv. 31] and
   follow me [For comment, see page 368. The disciple must learn to say
   "no" to many of the strongest cravings of his earthly nature. The cross
   is a symbol for duty which is to be performed daily, at any cost, even
   that of the most painful death. The disciple must follow Jesus, both as
   to his teaching and example.] 24 For whosoever would save his life
   shall lose it; ^a and { ^c but} whosoever shall lose his life for my
   sake, ^b and the gospel's ^c the same shall ^a find it. ^c save it.
   [Jesus here plays upon the two meanings of the word life, one being of
   temporal and the other of eternal duration. For comment on a similar
   expression, see page 368. ^b 36 For what doth it profit a man, { ^c is
   a man ^a shall a man be profited,} if he shall gain { ^b to gain} the
   whole world, ^c and lose or forfeit his own self? ( ^a his life? or {
   ^b 37 For} ^a what shall { ^b should} a man give in exchange for his
   life? [Peter and the rest of the apostles had been thinking about a
   worldly Messianic kingdom, with its profits and rewards. Jesus shows
   the worthlessness even of the whole world in comparison with the
   rewards of the true kingdom. It is the comparison between the things
   which are external, and which perish, and the life which is internal,
   and which endures. External losses may be repaired, but a lost life can
   never be regained, for with what shall a man buy it back?] 38 For
   whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words [comp. Luke
   xii. 9; II. Tim. i. 8, 12; ii. 12] in this adulterous and sinful
   generation [see pp. 305, 306], the Son of man also shall be ashamed of
   him ^c when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the { ^b his}
   ^c Father, and of { ^b with} the holy angels. [Peter had just been
   ashamed of the words in which Christ pictured himself as undergoing his
   humiliation. Jesus warns him and all others of the dangers of such
   shame.] ^a 27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father,
   with his angels; and then he shall render unto every man according to
   his deed. [The Father's glory, the angels, and the rendering of
   universal judgment form a threefold indication that Jesus here speaks
   of his final coming to judge the world.] ^b 1 And he said unto them,
   Verily I say unto you, ^c 27 But I tell you of a truth, ^a There are
   some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till
   they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. ^c till they see the
   kingdom of God. ^b come with power. [The mention of his final coming
   suggested one nearer at hand which was to be accomplished during the
   life of most of those present, since none but Jesus himself and Judas
   were to die previous to that time. The kingdom was to come and likewise
   the King. The former coming was literal, the latter spiritual. Those
   who refer this expression to the transfiguration certainly err, for no
   visible kingdom was established at that time. The expression refers to
   the kingdom which was organized and set in motion on the Pentecost
   which followed the resurrection of Jesus. It was set up with power,
   because three thousand souls were converted the first day, and many
   other gospel triumphs speedily followed.]

The Transfiguration. Concerning Elijah.

(a Spur of Hermon, Near Cæsarea Philippi.)

^A Matt. XVII. 1-13; ^B Mark IX. 2-13; ^C Luke IX. 28-36.

   ^c 28 And it came to pass about eight days { ^a six days} ^c after
   these sayings [Mark agrees with Matthew in saying six days. Luke
   qualifies his estimate by saying "about." But if we regard him as
   including the day of the "sayings" and also the day of the
   transfiguration, and the other two as excluding these days, then the
   three statements tally exactly. The "sayings" referred to were the
   words of Jesus with regard to his suffering at Jerusalem], that ^a
   Jesus taketh { ^c took} ^a with him Peter, and James, and John his
   brother [These three, as leaders among the apostles, needed the special
   encouragement which was about to be given. For further comment, see
   page 355], and bringeth them { ^c went} ^a up into a { ^c the} ^b high
   mountain apart by themselves: ^c to pray. [A tradition dating from the
   fourth century fixes upon Mt. Tabor as the site of the transfiguration,
   but this is unquestionably a mistake. Mt. Tabor is in Galilee, while
   Jesus was still in the region of Cæsarea Philippi (Mark ix. 30).
   Moreover there is little doubt that at that time and for centuries
   previous there was an inhabited fortress upon Mt. Tabor (Josh. xix. 12;
   Jos. B. J. i. 8, 7; Vit. 37). Moreover, Mt. Tabor is not a high
   mountain, its elevation above the sea being but 1,748 feet. Hermon, on
   the contrary, is the highest mountain in Palestine, its elevation,
   according to Reclus, being 9,400 feet. It was Jesus' custom to withdraw
   for prayer by night (Matt. xiv. 23, 24; Luke vi. 12; xxi. 37; xxii. 39)
   and the transfiguration took place at night.] 29 And as he was praying,
   the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became
   white and dazzling. ^a 2 and he was transfigured [i. e., transformed;
   the description shows to what extent] before them; and his face did
   shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. ^b
   glistering, exceeding white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
   [We may conceive of the body of Jesus becoming luminous and imparting
   its light to his garments. The Christian looks forward to beholding
   such a transfiguration and also to participating in it--I. John iii.
   2.] ^a 3 And, behold, there appeared unto them ^c two men, who were
   Moses and { ^b with} ^c Elijah; ^b and they were talking with Jesus.
   [The three apostles could identify Moses and Elijah by the course of
   this conversation, though it is possible that miraculous knowledge may
   have accompanied miraculous sight.] ^c 31 who [i. e., Moses and Elijah]
   who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to
   accomplish at Jerusalem. [The word for decease is "exodus," an unusual
   word for death. It means a departure and is, as Bengel says, a very
   weighty word, since it includes the passion, crucifixion, death,
   burial, resurrection, and ascension.] 32 Now Peter and they that were
   with him were heavy with sleep [it being night]; but when they were
   fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
   33 And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, ^a Peter
   answered and said { ^b answereth and saith} ^a unto Jesus, ^b Rabbi, ^c
   Master, ^a Lord, it is good for us to be here: ^b and let us make three
   tabernacles; ^a if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one
   for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. ^c not knowing what he
   said. ^b 6 For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.
   [Peter's fears overcame his discretion, but did not silence his tongue.
   Though he trembled at the fellowship of Moses and Elijah, he also
   realized the blessedness of it and could not let them depart without an
   effort to detain them, though the best inducement that he could offer
   was to build three booths, or arbors, made of the branches of trees,
   for their and Christ's accommodation. By thus speaking, Peter placed
   Jesus upon the same level with Moses and Elijah--all three being worthy
   of a booth.] ^c 34 And while he said these things, ^a 5 While he yet
   speaking, behold, ^b there came ^a a bright cloud ^b overshadowing
   them: { ^c and overshadowed them:} and they feared as they entered into
   the cloud. [Clouds often roll against the sides of Mt. Hermon, but the
   brightness of this cloud and the fear which it produced suggests that
   it was the Shekinah, or cloud of glory, which was the symbol of God's
   peculiar presence-- Ex. xiii. 21, 22; xix. 9, 18; xxiv. 16; xl. 34, 35;
   I. Kings viii. 10 .] ^a and behold, ^b there came a voice out of the
   cloud, ^a saying, This is my beloved Son, ^c my chosen: ^a in whom I am
   well pleased; hear ye him. [This command contains the chief
   significance of the entire scene. Spoken in the presence of Moses and
   Elijah, it gave Jesus that pre-eminence which a son has over servants.
   He is to be heard. His words have pre-eminence over those of the
   lawgiver and the prophet (Heb. i. 1, 2). Peter recognized Jesus as thus
   honored by this voice--II. Pet. i. 16-18.] 6 And when the disciples
   heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. [As every man
   is who hears the voice of God.] 7 And Jesus came and touched them and
   said, Arise, and be not afraid. [As mediator between man and God, Jesus
   removes fear.] ^b 8 And suddenly looking round about, ^a 8 And lifting
   up their eyes, ^b they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with
   themselves. ^c 36 And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone.
   [Leaders and prophets depart, but Christ abides--Heb. iii. 5, 6.] ^b 9
   And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them, that
   they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of
   man should have risen again from the dead. ^a 9 And Jesus commanded
   them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen
   from the dead. [The people were not ready for the publication of such
   an event. To have told it now would only have been to raise doubts as
   to their veracity.] ^b 10 And they kept the saying, questioning among
   themselves what the rising from the dead should mean. [Jesus spake so
   often in parables and made so frequent use of metaphors that the
   apostles did not take his words concerning the resurrection in a
   literal sense. They regarded his language as figurative, and sought to
   interpret the figure.] ^c And they held their peace, and told no man in
   those days any of the things which they had seen. ^a 10 And his
   disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must
   first come? ^b How is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first
   come? [They were puzzled by the disappearance of Elijah. They looked
   upon him as having come to fulfill the prophecy of Malachi (Mal. iv. 5,
   6), but they marveled that, having come, he should so soon withdraw,
   and that they should be forbidden to tell that they had seen him, since
   the sight of him would be some sign of Jesus' Messiahship.] ^a 11 And
   he answered and ^b said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and
   restoreth { ^a shall restore} all things [this sentence leads some to
   think that Elijah will appear again before the second coming of our
   Lord, but the words are to be interpreted in connection with the rest
   of the passage] : ^b and how it is written of the Son of man, that he
   should suffer many things, and be set at naught? [If the writings
   concerning Elijah perplexed the apostles, those concerning the Messiah
   perplexed them also. From one set of prophecies they might learn
   something about the other. Elijah came, but the Scriptures concerning
   him were so little understood that he was put to death. The Messiah
   also came, and the prophecies concerning him were so little understood
   that he, too, would be set at naught.] 13 But I say unto you, that
   Elijah is come, ^a already, and they knew him not, but did { ^b and
   they have also done} unto him whatsoever they would. Even as it is
   written of him. ^a Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. 13
   Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the
   Baptist. [Malachi used the name of Elijah figuratively to represent
   John the Baptist. See pp. 102, 284. That there shall be a second coming
   of Elijah in fulfillment of this prophecy is hardly possible, for the
   office of Elijah is prophetically outlined as that of the restorer. But
   Elijah could not restore Judaism, for that dispensation had been done
   away with in Christ. He could hardly have chosen to restore
   Christianity, for even if it should need such a restoration, a Jewish
   prophet would be ill-suited to such an office. One of the apostles
   would be vastly preferable.]

Healing the Demoniac Boy.

(Region of Cæsarea Philippi.)

^A Matt. XVII. 14-20; ^B Mark IX. 14-29; ^C Luke IX. 37-43.

   ^c 37 And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down
   from the mountain, ^b 14 And when they came to the disciples [the nine
   apostles which had been left behind], they saw a great multitude about
   them [We last heard of the multitude at Mark viii. 34. See page 416. It
   had no doubt been with Jesus until he ascended the mount and had
   remained with his apostles until he came down], and scribes questioning
   with them. [These scribes had caught the apostles in one and perhaps
   the only case where they had failed to cure, and they were making full
   use of the advantageous opportunity to discredit Christ and his
   apostles before the people by asking sneering and sarcastic questions.]
   15 And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly
   amazed, and running to him ^c a great multitude met him. ^b saluted
   him. [Why were the multitude amazed? Most commentators answer that it
   was because the face of Jesus shone with remaining traces of
   transfiguration glory, as did that of Moses (Ex. xxxiv. 29), but this
   can hardly have been so, for it would have been at variance with the
   secrecy which Jesus enjoined as to his transfiguration. Moreover, so
   important a feature could hardly have escaped from the narratives of
   all three evangelists. Undoubtedly the amazement was caused by the
   sudden and opportune return of Jesus. Those who urge that this was not
   enough to produce amazement show themselves to be poor students of
   human nature. The multitude had been listening to and no doubt enjoying
   the questions of the scribes. The unexpected appearance of Jesus
   therefore impressed them with the sudden sense of having been detected
   in wrong-doing which invariably leads to amazement. Moreover, those who
   remained loyal to Jesus would be equally amazed by his approach, since
   they could not but feel that an exciting crisis was at hand.] ^a 14 And
   when they were come to the multitude [i. e., when Jesus and the
   multitude met], ^b he asked them, What question ye with them? [He
   surprised the scribes by this demand and they saw at once that he knew
   all and they felt rebuked for their unwarranted exultation, and so kept
   silent.] ^c 38 And, behold, ^a there came to him a man, ^b one of { ^c
   from} the multitude, ^a kneeling to him, ^b answered him, ^c cried,
   saying, ^b Teacher, ^a 15 Lord, ^b I brought unto thee my son, who hath
   a dumb spirit; ^a have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and
   suffereth grievously; ^c I beseech thee look upon my son: for he is
   mine only child. 39 and behold a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly
   crieth out; ^b 18 and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down:
   ^c and it teareth him that he foameth, ^b and grindeth his teeth, and
   pineth away: ^c and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.
   [When the scribes did not answer, the father of the demoniac boy broke
   the embarrassing silence by telling Jesus about the matter in question.
   His child was deaf, dumb, and epileptic, but all these physical
   ailments were no doubt produced by the demon or evil spirit which
   possessed him. The phrase "hardly departeth from him" rather suggests
   the continual unrest in which the demon kept his victim rather than
   that the demon ever really relinquished his possession of him. Pauses
   in the delirium of agony were regarded as departures of the demon.] ^a
   16 And I brought him to thy disciples, ^b and I spake to thy disciples
   that they should cast him out; ^c 40 And I besought thy disciples to
   cast him out; and they could not. ^b they were not able. ^a and they
   could not cure him. 17 And Jesus answered and said, { ^b answereth them
   and saith,} ^a O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be
   with you? how long shall I bear with you? ^c bring hither thy son to
   me. ^b unto me. [As there was no reason to accuse the apostles of
   perversity, it is evident that the rebuke of Jesus is addressed
   generally to all and not particularly to the disciples. The perverse
   faithlessness and infidelity of the scribes had operated upon the
   multitude, and the doubts of the multitude had in turn influenced the
   apostles, and thus, with the blind leading the blind, all had fallen
   into the ditch of impotent disbelief. The disbelief of the people was a
   constant grief to Jesus, but it must have been especially so in this
   case, for it fostered and perpetrated this scene of weakness,
   mean-spiritedness, misery, and suffering which stood out in such sharp
   contrast with the peace, blessedness, and glory from which he had just
   come.] 20 And they brought him unto him: ^c 42 And as he was yet a
   coming, ^b when he saw him [saw Jesus], straightway ^c the demon dashed
   him down, and ^b the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the
   ground, and wallowed foaming. 21 And he asked his father, How long is
   it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child. 22 And
   oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire, and into the waters, to
   destroy him: { ^a he falleth into the fire, and oft-times into the
   water.} [By causing the long-standing nature of the case and the
   malignity of it to be fully revealed, Jesus emphasized the power of the
   cure] ^b but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help
   us. 23 And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible
   to him that believeth. [Jesus echoed back the "if thou canst" which the
   man had uttered. If Jesus marveled at the faith of a Gentile which
   trusted the fullness of his divine power, he also marveled at the
   disbelief of this Jew which thus coolly and presumptuously questions
   the sufficiency of that power. In the remainder of his answer Jesus
   shows that the lack of power is not in him, but in those who would be
   recipients of the blessings of his power, for those blessings are
   obtained by faith.] 24 Straightway the father of the child cried out,
   and said I believe; help thou my unbelief. [He confessed his faith, but
   desired so ardently to have the child healed that he feared lest he
   should not have faith enough to accomplish that desire, and therefore
   asked for more faith.] 25 And when Jesus saw that the multitude came
   running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou
   dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no
   more into him. [Jesus had found the multitude when he came down from
   the mountain, but the excitement in this multitude was evidently
   drawing men from every quarter, so that the crowd was momentarily
   growing greater. A longer conversation with the man might have been
   beneficial, but to prevent the gathering of any larger company Jesus
   acted at once and spoke the words of command. Since the demon was
   manifestly of a most daring, impudent, and audacious nature, Jesus took
   the precaution to forbid it attempting to re-enter its victim, a
   precaution which the conduct of the demon abundantly justified.] 26 And
   having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and the boy became as
   one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead. [The malicious
   effrontery and obstinacy displayed by this demon stands in marked
   contrast to the cowed, supplicating spirit shown by the Gergesene
   legion. See pp. 345, 346.] 27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and
   raised him up; and he arose. ^c But Jesus healed the boy, and gave him
   back to his father. [For comment on similar conduct see page 277.] ^a
   and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour. ^c
   43 And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. [The failure of
   the disciples had only emphasized the power of the Master.] ^b 28 And
   when he was come into the house, ^a 19 Then came the disciples to Jesus
   apart, and said, ^b asked him privately, How is it that we could not we
   cast it out? ^a Why could not we cast it out? 20 And Jesus saith unto
   them, Because of your little faith [The failure of the disciples was
   not because of any insufficiency of power in Jesus, but was due to
   their own failure to appropriate that power by faith. The relation of
   belief and unbelief to miraculous power is fully illustrated in Peter's
   attempt to walk upon the waters. See page 380]: for verily I say unto
   you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto
   this mountain [Mount Hermon] Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall
   remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. [The mustard seed was
   the proverbial type for the infinitely little (Matt. xiii. 32). Faith
   has such power with God that even little faith becomes well-nigh
   omnipotent in an age of miracles.] ^b 29 And he said unto them, This
   kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer. [Prayer was the means of
   increasing faith. Demons, like spirits in the flesh, have different
   degrees of will force, some being easier to subdue than others, and
   this once, being particularly willful and obstinate, required more
   faith to expel it.]

Return to Galilee. The Passion Foretold.

^A Matt. XVII. 22, 23; ^B Mark IX. 30-32; ^C Luke IX. 43-45.

   ^b 30 And they went forth from thence [from the region of Cæsarea
   Philippi], and passed through Galilee [on his way to Capernaum]; and he
   would not that any man should know it. [He was still seeking that
   retirement which began on the journey to Tyre. See page 399. This is
   the last definite mention of that retirement, but we find it referred
   to again at John vii. 3, 4. See page 439.] 31 For he taught his
   disciples [the reason for his retirement is here given: he wished to
   prepare his disciples for his passion], and said unto them, The Son of
   man is delivered up [the present tense is used for the future to
   express the nearness and certainty of the event] into the hands of men,
   ^a 22 And { ^c But} ^a while they abode in Galilee, ^c while all were
   marvelling at all the things which he did, ^a Jesus ^c said unto his
   disciples, 44 Let these sayings sink into your ears: for the Son of man
   shall be delivered up into the hands of men. [We have here two notes of
   time during which Jesus spoke of his passion. It was all the while he
   was in Galilee, between his return from Cæsarea and his departure into
   Judæa, for which see page 439. The length of time suggests that the sad
   lesson was oft repeated, but was at a time when the marvels of his
   works strengthened the faith of the disciples so as to enable them to
   bear the instruction.] ^b and they shall kill him; and when he is
   killed, after three days he shall rise again. { ^a and the third day he
   shall be raised up.} [For comment on similar language see page 306.]
   And they were exceeding sorry. [Peter's experience taught them not to
   attempt to correct Jesus while thus speaking, so there was nothing left
   for them but to grieve at his words.] ^c 45 But they understood not
   this { ^b the} saying, ^c and it was concealed from them, that they
   should not perceive it [What was told to them was not for their present
   but their future benefit, and therefore they were left to puzzle over
   the words of Jesus]; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
   [Not so much from any awe with which they regarded him, as from the
   delicacy of the subject itself, and their own sorrow, which shrank from
   knowing it more fully.]

Jesus Pays the Tribute Money.

(Capernaum, Autumn, a.d. 29)

^A Matt. XVII. 24-27.

   ^a 24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the
   half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the
   half-shekel? [The law of Moses required from every male of twenty years
   and upward the payment of a tax of half a shekel for the support of the
   temple (Ex. xxx. 12-16; II. Chron. xxiv. 5, 6). This tax was collected
   annually. We are told that a dispute existed between the Pharisees and
   Sadducees as to whether the payment of this tribute was voluntary or
   compulsory. The collectors of it may have thought that Jesus regarded
   its payment as voluntary, or they may have thought that Jesus
   considered himself exempt from it because he was so great a rabbi.
   Though this temple tax was usually collected in March, Lightfoot
   informs us that the payment of it was so irregular that its receivers
   kept two chests; in one of which was placed the tax for the current
   year, and in the other that for the year past. The demand was made upon
   Jesus at Capernaum because that was his residence, and it was not made
   sooner because of the wandering life which he led. It appears that
   since the first of April he had been in Capernaum only once for a brief
   period, probably no longer than a Sabbath day (John vi. 22-24). The
   Jewish shekel answered to the Greek stater, which has been variously
   estimated as worth from fifty to seventy-five cents. The stater
   contained four drachmæ, and a drachma was about equivalent to a Roman
   denarius, or seventeen cents.] 25 He saith, Yea. [Peter answered with
   his usual impulsive presumption. Probably he had known the tribute to
   be paid before out of the general fund held by Judas; or he may have
   assumed that Jesus would fulfill this as one of God's requirements.]
   And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him [without
   waiting for him to tell what he had said], saying, What thinkest thou,
   Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or
   tribute? from their sons, or from strangers? 26 And when he said, From
   strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free. [The
   argument is this: If the sons of kings are free from the payment of
   tribute, I, the Son of God, am free from God's tribute. The half-shekel
   was regarded as given to God--Jos. Ant. xviii. 9. 1.] 27 But, lest we
   cause them to stumble [lest we be totally misunderstood, and be thought
   to teach that men should not pay this tribute to God], go thou to the
   sea [of Galilee], and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first
   cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
   shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. [Jesus paid the
   tribute in such a manner as to show that the whole realm of nature was
   tributary to him, and that he was indeed the Son of the great King.
   Some have thought that our Lord's beneficence, in paying Peter's tax
   also, was an evidence that Peter, too, was exempt from tribute. But the
   conclusion is not well drawn. Had this been intended, Jesus would have
   said "for us," and would not have used the words "for me and thee,"
   which distinguished between the exempted Son and the unexempted
   subject. Though afterward Peter might possibly have claimed exemption
   as a child of God by adoption, he was not yet free from this duty to
   pay this tax--John i. 12.]

False Ambition Versus Childlikeness.

(Capernaum, Autumn, a.d. 29.)

^A Matt. XVIII. 1-14; ^B Mark IX. 33-50; ^C Luke IX. 46-50.

   ^c 46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the
   greatest. ^b 33 And he came to Capernaum: ^c 47 But when Jesus saw the
   reasoning of their heart, ^b and when he was in the house [probably
   Simon Peter's house] he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?
   34 But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on
   the way, who was the greatest. [The Lord with his disciples was now on
   his way back to Galilee from Cæsarea Philippi, where, some ten days
   before, he had promised the keys of the kingdom to Peter, and where he
   had honored Peter and the sons of Zebedee by a mysterious withdrawal
   into the mount. These facts, therefore, no doubt started the dispute as
   to which should hold the highest office in the kingdom. The fires of
   envy thus set burning were not easily quenched. We find them bursting
   forth again from time to time down to the very verge of Christ's exit
   from the world-- Matt. xx. 20-24; Luke xxii. 24.] 35 And he sat down,
   and called the twelve, and he said unto them, If any man would be
   first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all. [The spirit which
   proudly seeks to be first in place thereby consents to make itself last
   in character, for it reverses the graces of the soul, turning love into
   envy, humility into pride, generosity into selfishness, etc.] ^a 1 In
   that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest
   in the kingdom of heaven? [Not comprehending our Lord's answer and
   wishing to have him definitely point out the honored person, they now
   come asking this question. Had Jesus wished to teach the primacy of
   Peter, no better opportunity could have been found.] 2 And he called to
   him a little child ^b 36 And he took a child, ^c and set him by his
   side, ^b and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms,
   he said unto them, ^a Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become
   as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of
   heaven. 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little
   child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. [Jesus told them
   plainly that they must turn from their sin of personal ambition or they
   could not be his disciples--part of his kingdom--and he pointed them to
   a little child as the model in this particular, because the humble
   spirit in which the child looks up to its parents stood out in sharp
   contrast with their self-seeking, self-exalting ambition.] 5 And ^b 37
   Whosoever shall receive one of such little children { ^c this little
   child} in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive { ^b
   receiveth} me, receiveth not me, but ^c receiveth him that sent me: for
   he that is least among you all, the same is great. [Greatness does not
   consist in place. Disciples who receive those of a childlike spirit and
   disposition that they may thereby honor the name of Christ are honored
   of Christ as the greatest. The words "in my name" probably suggested to
   John the incident which follows.] 49 And John answered and said,
   Master, ^b Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we
   forbade him, ^c because he followeth { ^b followed} ^c not with us.
   [Was not one of our immediate company. This man's actions had excited
   the jealousy of John. Jealousy as to official prerogative is very
   common. His zeal for Jesus reminds us of the friends of Moses (Num. xi.
   27-29). But Jesus shows that one who knows enough of him to use his
   power is not apt to dishonor him.] 50 But Jesus said unto him, ^b
   Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my
   name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. 40 For he that is not
   against us is for us. ^c for he that is not against you is for you.
   [The converse of this statement is found at Matt. xii. 30. The two
   statements taken together declare the impossibility of neutrality. If a
   man is in no sense against Christ, then he is for him; and if he is not
   for Christ, he is against him.] ^b 41 For whosoever shall give you a
   cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you,
   he shall in no wise lose his reward. [Jesus here returns to the
   discussion of greatness, and reasserts the doctrine that the smallest
   act of righteousness, if performed for the sake of the King, shall be
   honored in the kingdom. For comment, see page 368.] 42 And { ^a 6 but}
   ^b whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to
   stumble, it were better for him if { ^a it is profitable for him that}
   ^b a great millstone [the word indicates a large millstone which was
   turned by an ass] were { ^a should be} ^b hanged about his neck, and he
   were { ^a that he should be} ^b cast into the sea. ^a sunk in the depth
   of the sea. [Character depends upon small things. If a small act of
   goodness receives its reward, an act of evil, made apparently small by
   the trifling insignificance of the person against whom it is committed,
   receives just as inevitably its punishment. In short, there is no
   smallness in good and evil that men may rely upon, for heavy penalties
   may be meted out for what the world judges to be light sins. Those who
   cause the weak to lapse into unbelief through their ecclesiastical
   arrogance have a heavy reckoning for which to answer. Greeks, Romans
   and Egyptians were punished by such millstone drowning. But the fate of
   one who, by striving for place, causes others to sin, will be worse
   than that. From offenses caused by a proud spirit Jesus now passes to
   discuss offences or sins caused by any spirit of evil.] 7 Woe unto the
   world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the
   occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!
   [The depravity of man makes sin inevitable, but nevertheless it does
   not remove or reduce the personal responsibility of him who tempts to
   or causes to sin.] ^b 43 And if thy hand causeth thee to stumble, cut
   it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than
   having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 45
   And if thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for
   thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be
   cast into hell. { ^a the eternal fire.} [We see from this that "hell"
   and "eternal fire" are interchangeable terms, and stand in contrast to
   eternal life.] 9 And if thine eye causeth { ^b cause} ^a thee to
   stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to
   enter into life { ^b the kingdom of God} with one eye, rather than
   having two eyes to be cast ^a into the hell of fire. ^b 48 where their
   worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. [It is better to deny
   ourselves all unlawful pleasures, even if the denial be as painful and
   distressing as the loss of a member. The image of the worm is taken
   from Isa. lxvi. 24, and refers to those worms which feed upon the
   carcasses of men. The fire and worm can hardly be taken literally, for
   the two figures are incompatible--worms do not frequent fires. The two
   figures depict hell as a state of decay which is never completed and of
   burning which does not consume. Some regard the worm as a symbol of the
   gnawings of remorse, and the fire as a symbol of actual punishment.] 49
   For every one shall be salted with fire. [At this point many ancient
   authorities add, "and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."] 50
   Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye
   season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
   [We have here one of the most difficult passages in the Bible. If the
   word "fire" were found in an isolated text it might be taken as a
   symbol either of purification or of punishment. But the context here
   determines its meaning, for it has just been taken twice as a symbol of
   punishment. Salt is a symbol of that which preserves from decay. Now,
   Jesus has just been talking about the future state, with its two
   conditions or states of bliss and punishment. In both of these states
   the souls of men are salted or preserved. Every one of the wicked is
   preserved by a negative or false salt--a worm which feeds but does not
   die, and a fire which consumes but refuses to go out. Though this state
   is a condition of life, it is such a negative and false condition that
   it is elsewhere termed a second death. It is therefore rightly called a
   "salted" or preserved condition, yet it contradicts the symbolic idea
   of saltness. As we understand it, the difficulty of the passage lies in
   this contradictory sense in which the term "salt" is used--a
   contradiction in which the term "eternal life" also shares, for eternal
   life is the constant contrast to life in hell, though that life also is
   spoken of as eternal. The true Christian--the man who offers his body
   as "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God"--is preserved by the
   true salt or element of preservation, which is a divinely begotten life
   of righteousness within him. This is the good state of preservation
   which a man is counseled to obtain, and not to lose, since it will not
   be restored to him. The passage summarizes and contrasts the two states
   of future preservation, one being the salt of eternal life which
   preserves a man to enjoy the love of God in heaven, and the other being
   the salt of fire which preserves him in hell to endure the just
   punishment of God. The "every one" in verse 49 refers to the sufferers
   mentioned in verse 48.] ^a 10 See that ye despise not one of these
   little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always
   behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. [Jesus here resumes his
   warning against that pride which exalts itself and despises the humble;
   disclosing the fact that the ministration of angels is not only general
   but special, certain angels being entrusted with the care of certain
   individuals, and all of them supplementing their own wisdom and power
   by direct access to the presence of God.] 12 How think ye? if any man
   have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave
   the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which is
   goeth astray? 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you,
   he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not
   gone astray. 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in
   heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. [Those who have
   led highly moral lives have a tendency to despise those who have been
   defiled by gross sin. This truth is abundantly illustrated by the
   conduct of the Pharisees, but that such little ones should not be
   despised Jesus speaks this warning parable. Though the sheep in the
   fold and the one that is lost have, as individuals, the same intrinsic
   value, yet this even balance of value is somewhat modified by the
   sentiments and emotions incident to loss and recovery. Moreover, the
   anxiety and trouble caused by the sheep's wandering do not depreciate
   but rather enhance the value of that sheep, because the heart of the
   Shepherd is so replete with goodness that the misbehavior of the sheep
   prompts him to feel pity and compassion, rather than to cherish
   resentment and revenge. Sin does not add to a man's intrinsic value in
   God's sight--nay, it detracts from it; but it excites in the heart of
   God pity, compassion, and other tender emotions which make it extremely
   dangerous for those who hinder his reformation and imperil his soul by
   despising him.]

Sin and Forgiveness Between Brethren.

(Autumn, a.d. 29.)

^A Matt. XVIII. 15-35.

   ^a 15 And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault
   between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy
   brother. [Having warned against giving offense, Jesus now shows how to
   act when offense is received. The fault is to be pointed out to the
   offender, but for the purpose of gaining him--not from a desire to
   humiliate him. The offended is to seek the offender, and the offender
   is likewise to seek the offended (Matt. xv. 23, 24), and neither is to
   wait for the other.] 16 But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or
   two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be
   established. [Reconciliation is still to be sought, but witnesses are
   now to be called in preparatory to the next step, which is the hearing
   before the church, wherein their testimony will be needed.] 17 And if
   he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he refuse to
   hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the gentile and the
   publican. [As the Saviour was giving preparatory instruction, he was
   compelled to thus speak of the church by anticipation before it
   actually existed. The word "church" means assembly, and the apostles
   knew that there would be some form of assembly in the kingdom about to
   be set up. When Matthew wrote his Gospel, churches were already in
   existence. One who will not hear the church is to be regarded as an
   outsider. This implies that such a one is to be excluded from the
   church.] 18 Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on
   earth shall be bound in heaven: and what things soever ye shall loose
   on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [The binding and loosing here
   mentioned is limited by the context or the subject of which Jesus now
   treats. Binding represents exclusion from membership; loosing, the
   restoration to fellowship in cases of repentance. The church's act in
   thus binding or loosing will be recognized in heaven if performed
   according to apostolic precept or precedent. Hence it is a most august
   and fearful prerogative.] 19 Again I say unto you, that if two of you
   shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall
   be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 20 For where two or
   three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
   them. [These two verses illustrate the sublime power of the church
   which has just been suggested by its right of excommunication. A small
   church of two or three can prevail with God in prayer (in matters not
   wholly at variance with his will) and can be honored by the very
   presence of the Christ.] 21 Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how
   oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven
   times? [Peter, seeing that the language of Jesus called for large
   forbearance, asked the Lord to fix the bounds. If we accept the Talmud
   as probably representing the ideals of forgiveness which pertained
   among the Jews of that age, we find that Peter was striving to be
   liberal, for the Talmud limits forgiveness to three times.] 22 Jesus
   saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until
   seventy times seven. [Jesus here plays upon the words so as to show
   that there is no numerical limitation. To keep track of four hundred
   ninety offenses one would have to open a set of books with his
   neighbor, which would be ridiculous. Forgiveness, prayer, and charity
   know no arithmetic. Peter's question brings to mind the forgiveness of
   God and calls forth the following parable.] 23 Therefore is the kingdom
   of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with
   his servants. 24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto
   him, that owed him ten thousand talents. [Assuming that the silver
   talent is meant ($1,600), the debt was $16,000,000, which would render
   the debtor hopeless enough. If it was a gold talent, it would be nearly
   twenty times as much. 25 But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay,
   his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all
   that he had, and payment to be made. [The law of Moses allowed such a
   sale--Lev. xxv. 39-47; II. Kings iv. 1.] 26 The servant therefore fell
   down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I
   will pay thee all. 27 And the lord of that servant, being moved with
   compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. [Seeing the man's
   apparent willingness to pay, and knowing the hopelessness of his offer
   to do so, the lord compassionately forbore to sell him and forgave him
   the whole debt.] 28 But that servant went out, and found one of his
   fellow-servants, who owed him an hundred shillings [The denarius or
   shilling was worth about seventeen cents. The debt was, therefore,
   about $100]: and he laid hold on him, and took him by the throat,
   saying, Pay me that thou owest. [This frenzy to collect might have been
   somewhat pardonable had the lord still been demanding his debt, but,
   that debt being forgiven, such harsh conduct was inexcusable.] 29 So
   his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience
   with me, and I will pay thee. [Compare this conduct with that depicted
   in verse 26 above.] 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into
   prison, till he should pay that which was due. [Prison life was far
   worse than slavery. The Roman law permitted such a punishment, and it
   was practiced in this country until after the beginning of the last
   century.] 31 So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were
   exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
   [They were sorry for the sin of the one and the suffering of the other.
   Human nature rarely grows so wicked that it fails to resent sin in
   others.] 32 Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou
   wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest
   me: 33 shouldest thou not also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant,
   even as I had mercy on thee? [God's forgiveness places us under
   obligation to be forgiving. The lord does not call the servant wicked
   because he had contracted a debt which he could not pay, but because of
   the merciless, unforgiving spirit which he had manifested toward his
   fellow-servant. Thus God freely forgives sin against himself, but the
   sin of refusing to forgive our fellow-man is with him an unforgivable
   sin. No doctrine of the Bible is more plainly taught than this.] 34 And
   his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should
   pay all that was due. [The picture is to be interpreted by the usages
   of the East, where even at the present day torture is used to compel
   debtors to confess the possession of property which they suspected of
   hiding. Thus the man had escaped being sold into slavery only to
   receive sentence of death by torture.] 35 So shall also my heavenly
   Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your
   hearts. [Jesus reminds us that God is a Father unto him whom we have
   refused to forgive. The key to the parable is introduced by the words,
   "So shall also." God will so deliver to the tormentors the unforgiving.
   Incidentally the parable draws comparisons between the forgiving spirit
   of God and the revengeful spirit of man, and the magnitude of our debt
   to him and the insignificance of our debts to each other. The
   retraction of forgiveness is merely a part of the parabolic drapery,
   but it is nevertheless true that those who are delivered from sin come
   to a worse state than ever if they return to it--II. Pet. ii. 20-22.]

Jesus' Brothers Advise Him to Go to Jerusalem.

(Galilee, Probably Capernaum.)

^D John VII. 2-9.

   ^d 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
   [The first verse of this chapter tells us that Jesus kept away from
   Judæa because the Jews sought for his life. See page 393. This keeping
   away or seclusion began at the Passover season, and led Jesus not only
   to keep away from Judæa, but even to hover upon the outskirts of
   Galilee itself. This seclusion is described in Sections LXV.-LXXI. We
   now turn back to take up with John the narrative which tells how, after
   his six months' retirement, Jesus prepared to appear once more in
   Judæa. The Feast of Tabernacles began on the 15th day of the month
   Tisri, which answers to our September-October, and consequently came
   six months after and six months before the Passover. It was the most
   joyous of the two great feasts, and not only commemorated the time when
   Israel dwelt in the wilderness in tents, but also celebrated the
   harvest home. It was, therefore, a thanksgiving both for permanent
   abodes and for the year's crops. As the people dwelt in booths, the
   feast partook much of the form and merriment of a picnic.] 3 His
   brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea,
   that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest. 4 For no
   man doeth any thing in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly.
   If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. [When we
   consider how Jesus had withdrawn into the regions of Tyre, Sidon,
   Decapolis, and Cæsarea Philippi, and with what assiduity he had avoided
   crowds and concealed miracles, these words become very plain. The
   twelve had been instructed sufficiently to confess his Messiahship, but
   thousands of his disciples had not seen a miracle in six months. To his
   brothers such secrecy seemed foolish on the part of one who was
   ostensibly seeking to be known. They were not disposed to credit the
   miracles of Jesus, but insisted that if he could work them he ought to
   do so openly.] 5 For even his brethren did not believe on him. [This
   verse explodes the idea that the parties known in the New Testament as
   our Lord's brothers were the sons of Alphæus and cousins to Jesus. The
   sons of Alphæus had long since been numbered among the apostles, while
   our Lord's brothers were still unbelievers. As to his brothers, see pp.
   224-226, 360.] 6 Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet
   come: but your time is always ready. [Jesus is answering a request that
   he manifest himself. The great manifestation of his cross and
   resurrection could not properly take place before the Passover, which
   was still six months distant. But his brothers, having no message and
   no manifestation, could show themselves at Jerusalem any time.] 7 The
   world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that
   its works are evil. [The world can not hate you because you are in mind
   and heart a part of it, and it can not hate itself. It hates those who
   are not of it, and who rebuke its sins and oppose its ways.] 8 Go ye up
   unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet
   fulfilled. 9 And having said these things unto them, he abode still in
   Galilee. [He did go to the feast, but he did not go up to manifest
   himself, as his brothers asked, and hence, in the sense in which they
   made the request, he did not go up. Six months later, at the Passover,
   he manifested himself by the triumphal entry somewhat as his brothers
   wished.]

The Private Journey to Jerusalem.

(Through Samaria. Probably September, a.d. 29.)

^C Luke IX. 51-56; ^D John VII. 10.

   ^d 10 But when his brethren were gone up unto the feasts, then went he
   also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. [This section follows
   immediately after the preceding. The secrecy of this journey consists
   in the fact that Jesus did not join the caravans or pilgrim bands, and
   that he did not follow the usual Peræan route, but went directly
   through Samaria.] ^c 51 And it came to pass, when the days were
   well-nigh come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his
   face to go to Jerusalem, 52 and sent messengers before his face: and
   they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready
   for him. [Taken in its strictest sense, the expression "taken up"
   refers to our Lord's ascension, but it is here used to embrace his
   entire passion. Though our Lord's death was still six months distant,
   his going to Jerusalem is described as attended with a special effort,
   because from that time forth Jerusalem was to occupy the position of
   headquarters, as Capernaum had done, and his withdrawals and returns
   would be with regard to it. The presence of the twelve alone is
   sufficient to account for the messengers. He did not wish to overtax
   the fickle hospitality of the Samaritans by coming unannounced.] 53 And
   they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going
   to Jerusalem. [Had Jesus come among them on a missionary tour he would
   doubtless have been received. But when he came as a Jew passing through
   to Jerusalem, and using their highway as a convenience, they rejected
   him.] 54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
   Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume
   them? 55 But he turned, and rebuked them, 56 And they went to another
   village. [Refusing to receive a religious teacher was considered a
   rejection of his claim. This rejection roused the ire of the two sons
   of thunder and prompted them to suggest that the example of Elijah be
   followed ( II. Kings i. 9-12), but Jesus was a Saviour and not a
   destroyer, so he passed on to another village. The conduct of John in
   after years contrasts sharply with the wish which he here
   expressed--Acts viii. 14-25.]

As to Sacrifice for Christ's Service.

(Samaria. Probably September, a.d. 29.)

^C Luke IX. 57-62.

   ^c 57 And as they went on the way [the way through Samaria to
   Jerusalem], a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee
   whithersoever thou goest. 58 And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have
   holes and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath
   not where to lay his head. 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But
   he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 60 Jesus said
   unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and preach
   the kingdom of God. [For comment upon similar language see pp. 341,
   342.] 61 And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first
   suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house. 62 But Jesus
   said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
   back, is fit for the kingdom of God. [Comparing Luke with Matthew, as
   indicated above, we find that Matthew gives two and Luke three
   proposals to follow him, and that they differ widely as to the time. It
   is likely that the first instance occurred where Matthew places it, and
   the last two occurred where Luke places them, and that each Evangelist
   borrowed an item from another period and joined it to his incident
   because of the similarity of the subject. But as such proffers of
   discipleship may have been very common, the incidents may be entirely
   different. The teaching of the last incident is that at a command of
   Christ all conflicting obligations must be set aside.]

In the Temple at the Feast of Tabernacles.

(October, a.d. 29.)

^D John VII. 11-52.

   ^d 11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is
   he? [It was now eighteen months since Jesus had visited Jerusalem, at
   which time he had healed the impotent man at Bethesda. His fame and
   prolonged obscurity made his enemies anxious for him to again expose
   himself in their midst. John here used the word "Jews" as a designation
   for the Jerusalemites, who, as enemies of Christ, were to be
   distinguished from the multitudes who were in doubt about him, and who
   are mentioned in the next verse.] 12 And there was much murmuring among
   the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others
   said, Not so; but he leadeth the multitude astray. [The use of the
   plural, "multitudes," suggests that the vast crowd disputed as groups
   rather than individuals. The inhabitants of some towns were disposed to
   unite in his defense, while those from other towns would concur in
   condemning him.] 13 Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the
   Jews. [They would not commit themselves upon a question so important
   until the Sanhedrin had given its decision.] 14 But when it was now the
   midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. [As the
   feast lasted eight days, the middle of it would be from the third to
   the fifth day. Though Jesus had come up quietly to prevent public
   demonstrations in his favor, he now taught boldly and openly in the
   very stronghold of his enemies. His sudden appearance suggests the
   fulfillment of Mal. iii. 1.] 15 The Jews therefore marvelled, saying,
   How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? [The enemies of
   Christ were content to know but little about him, and now when they
   heard him they could not restrain their astonishment at his wisdom. By
   letters was meant the written law and the unwritten traditions which
   were taught in the great theological schools at Jerusalem. The same
   word is translated "learning" at Acts xxvi. 24 . No one was expected to
   teach without having passed through such a course. Skeptics of our day
   assert that Jesus derived his knowledge from the schools, but the
   schoolteachers who are supposed to have taught him complained of him
   that he was not their scholar, and surely they ought to have known.] 16
   Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but
   his that sent me. [Seeing the Jews inquiring as to the source of his
   wisdom, Jesus explains that it was given him of God, and was therefore
   not derived from any school.] 17 If any man willeth to do his will, he
   shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak
   from myself. [Those who would test the divinity of the doctrine of
   Christ can not do so by rendering a mere mechanical obedience to his
   teaching. A willing, heartfelt obedience is essential to a true
   knowledge of his doctrine. Such a disposition makes a good and honest
   heart in which the seeds of his kingdom must inevitably grow. But a
   spirit of disobedience is the general source of all skepticism.] 18 He
   that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh
   the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no
   unrighteousness is in him. [Those who bear their own message seek their
   own glory. Those who bear God's message seek God's glory, and such
   seeking destroys egotism.] 19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet
   none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? [The point he makes
   here is, that their seeking to kill him was proof that they were not
   keeping the law.] 20 The multitude answered and said, Thou hast a
   demon: who seeketh to kill thee? [The multitude had sought to kill him
   at his last visit, and it now affects to deny it. Wild notions and
   extraordinary conduct indicated insanity, and insanity was usually
   attributed to demoniacal possession. Comp. Matt. xi. 18. Their meaning
   therefore was that the words of Jesus were insanely preposterous, and
   their words savored more of roughness and irreverence than of malignant
   unkindness.] 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and
   ye all marvel because thereof. [Jesus forbears to speak further as to
   the plot to murder him, knowing that time would reveal it; but refers
   to the miracle performed on the Sabbath day at Bethesda eighteen months
   before, which gave rise to the plot to murder him. A reference to the
   excitement at that time would recall to the thoughtful the evidence and
   bitter hostility which the Jerusalemites had then manifested.] 22 Moses
   hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the
   fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man. 23 If a man receiveth
   circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken;
   are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the
   sabbath? 24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous
   judgment. [The law which said that no work must be done on the Sabbath
   day was in conflict with the law which said that a child must be
   circumcised on the eighth day, whenever that eighth day happened to
   fall on the Sabbath. It was a case of a specific command making
   exception to the general law. Circumcision was great because it
   purified legally a portion of the body. But the healing worked by Jesus
   was greater, for it renewed the whole man. If the act of Christ in
   healing a man were judged as a mere act, it might be considered a
   breach of the Sabbath. But if the nature of the act be taken into
   account and all the laws relative to it be considered--in short, if it
   be judged righteously in all bearings--it would be amply justified.] 25
   Some therefore of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to
   kill? 26 And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can
   it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? [Thus, by
   referring to the miracle at Bethesda, Jesus not only brought to mind
   the former opposition of the Jewish rulers, but he started the people
   of Jerusalem (who were acquainted with the present tempter of the
   hierarchy) to talking about the intention to kill him, thus warning the
   people beforehand that they would be called upon to assist in his
   crucifixion. The men of Jerusalem spoke more freely because the present
   boldness of Jesus led them to think that maybe the rulers were changing
   their attitude toward him.] 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is:
   but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. [Jerusalem
   shared the prejudice of its rulers: its citizens felt sure that the
   rulers could not accept Jesus as Christ because his manner of coming
   did not comply with accepted theories. Prophecy fixed upon Bethlehem as
   the birthplace and the line of David as the family of the Christ, but
   the Jews, probably influenced by Isa. liii. 8, appear to have held that
   there would be a mystery attached to the immediate and actual parentage
   of the Messiah. Surely there could have been no greater mystery than
   the real origin of Jesus as he here outlines it to them, and as they
   might have fully known it to be had they chosen to investigate the
   meaning of his words.] 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught,
   saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of
   myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 29 I know him;
   because I am from him, and he sent me. [Our Lord here asserts their
   ignorance as to his divine origin. Since he came from God, and they did
   not know God, they consequently did not know whence he came. As they
   expected a Messiah who would be supernaturally sent, they ought to have
   been satisfied with Jesus. But they had no eyes with which to discern
   the supernatural.] 30 They sought therefore to take him [because they
   understood his language as referring to God and were incensed that he
   should so openly declare them ignorant of God] ; and no man laid his
   hand on him, because his hour was not yet come. [Because it was not the
   will of God that he should be arrested at this time.] 31 But of the
   multitude believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come,
   will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? [Their
   question was an argument in favor of the Messiahship of Jesus.] 32 The
   Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him;
   and the chief priests and the Pharisees [that is, the Sanhedrin,
   described by its constituent classes] sent officers to take him. [When
   the Sanhedrin heard the people expressing their faith in Jesus they
   felt that it was time to take action.] 33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a
   little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me. [Knowing
   their attempt to arrest him, Jesus tells them that it is not quite time
   for them to accomplish this purpose.] 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall
   not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come. [They would soon destroy
   Jesus; after which they would seek him in vain. Their violence would
   result in his return to his Father. In the dark days which were about
   to come, the Jews would long for a Messiah, for the Christ whom they
   had failed to recognize in Jesus. They, too, would desire the heavenly
   rest and security of a better world, but their lack of faith would
   debar them from entering it.] 35 The Jews therefore said among
   themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? Will
   he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 36
   What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find
   me: and where I am, ye cannot come? [The words of Jesus were plain
   enough, but the assertion that he would return to God, and that such a
   return would be denied to them was, in their ears, too preposterous to
   be entertained. They therefore made light of it by construing it
   nonsensically. They asked if he would go among the Jews who had been
   dispersed or scattered by the captivity and who had never returned to
   Palestine, and if, when so doing, he would teach the heathen among whom
   these dispersed were scattered, assuming that such teaching would
   certainly frustrate and render absurd his claims to be a Jewish
   Messiah. They little suspected that Jesus, through his apostles, would
   do this very thing and thereby vindicate his claim as the true Messiah
   of God.] 37 Now on the last day [the eighth day], the great day of the
   feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come
   unto me and drink. [If we may trust the later Jewish accounts, it was
   the custom during the first seven days for the priests and people in
   joyful procession to go to the pool of Siloam with a golden pitcher and
   bring water thence to pour out before the altar, in commemoration of
   the water which Moses brought from the rock and which typified the
   Christ (I. Cor. x. 4). If this is so, it is likely that the words of
   Jesus have some reference to this libation, and are designed to draw a
   contrast between the earthly water which ceases and the spiritual water
   which abides, similar to the contrast which he presented to the
   Samaritan woman at Jacob's well.] 38 He that believeth on me, as the
   scripture hath said. [in such passages as Isa. lviii. 11; Zech. xiv. 8,
   etc.] from within him shall flow rivers of living water. [For comment
   on similar expressions see page 145.] 39 But this spake he of the
   Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit
   was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified. [The first and
   second chapters of the Book of Acts is the best comment upon this
   passage. When Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father and was
   glorified, he sent forth the Spirit upon his apostles on the day of
   Pentecost, and the apostles in turn promised the gift of the Spirit to
   all who would believe, repent, and be baptized.] 40 Some of the
   multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a
   truth the prophet. 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said,
   What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee? 42 Hath not the scripture
   said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem,
   the village where David was? 43 So there arose a division in the
   multitude because of him. [Some of the well disposed toward Jesus,
   seeing the boldness with which he proclaimed himself, asserted that he
   was the prophet spoken of by Moses (Deut. xviii. 15), which prophet was
   thought by some to be the Messiah himself, and by others to be no more
   than the Messiah's forerunner. Still others of the multitude went
   further and asserted that he was the Christ. These latter were
   confronted by those who contended that Jesus was not born in the right
   place nor of the right family. These did not know that he had satisfied
   the very objections which they named.] 44 And some of them would have
   taken him; but no man laid hands on him. [We note here that the enmity
   of the rulers which had been taken up by the men of Jerusalem (see
   verse 30) had now reached a faction even of the multitude, so that it
   desired his arrest, but was restrained from acting.] 45 The officers
   therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees [i. e., to those that
   had sent them]; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?
   [These officers were temple police or Levites, under direction of the
   chief priests. The words suggest that the Sanhedrin was assembled and
   waiting for the return of the officers. An extraordinary proceeding for
   so great a day, but no more extraordinary than that assembly at the
   feast of the Passover which met and condemned Jesus six months later.]
   46 The officers answered, Never man so spake. [Their report has passed
   into a saying, which is as true now as when first spoken.] 47 The
   Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray? 48 Hath any
   of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? 49 But this
   multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed. [This rebuke to the
   officers may be paraphrased thus: You are to respect the authority of
   the officers and the judgment of the Pharisees, but you have permitted
   yourselves to be influenced by a multitude which rests under a curse
   because of its ignorance.] 50 Nicodemus said unto them (he that came to
   him before, being one of them) [therefore able to speak from a position
   of equality], 51 Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from
   himself and know what he doeth? [Nicodemus bids these proud rulers note
   that they were breaking the very law which they extolled--Deut. i. 16;
   Ex. xxiii. 1.] 52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of
   Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. [They
   laid the lash to the pride of Nicodemus by classing him with the
   Galilæans who formed the main body of Jesus' disciples, thus separating
   him from the true Jews. There is no clear evidence that any of the
   prophets save Jonah was from the district at this time called Galilee,
   and this fact would justify the hasty demand of the objectors, who were
   not very scrupulous as to accuracy.]

The Story of the Adulteress.

(Jerusalem.)

^D John VII. 53-VIII. 11.

   [This section is wanting in nearly all older manuscripts, but Jerome
   (a.d. 346-420) says that in his time it was contained in "many Greek
   and Latin manuscripts," and these must have been as good or better than
   the best manuscripts we now possess. But whether we regard it as part
   of John's narrative or not, scholars very generally accept it as a
   genuine piece of history.] ^d 53 And they went every man unto his own
   house [confused by the question of Nicodemus, the assembly broke up and
   each man went home]: 1 but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
   [Probably crossing the mountain to the house of Lazarus and sisters.] 2
   And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the
   people came unto him; and he sat down [as an authoritative teacher
   did--Matt. v. 1], and taught them. 3 And the scribes and the Pharisees
   bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, 4
   they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in
   the very act. [The woman had probably been brought to the rulers for
   trial, and they had seen in her case what appeared to be a promising
   means of entrapping Jesus. In the presence of the woman and the form of
   their accusation we see their coarse brutality. The case could have
   been presented to Jesus without the presence of the woman, and without
   a detailed accusation.] 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone
   such [It was a case under verse 22 of Deut. xxii. Stoning was the legal
   method of capital punishment]: what then sayest thou of her? 6 And this
   they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him.
   [They were placing Jesus in a dilemma. They reasoned that he could not
   set aside the law of Moses and clear the woman without so losing the
   confidence and favor of the people as to frustrate his claim to be
   Messiah. They thought he would therefore be compelled to condemn the
   woman. But if he ordered her to be put to death, he would be assuming
   authority which belonged only to the Roman rulers, and could therefore
   be accused and condemned as a usurper.] But Jesus stooped down, and
   with his finger wrote on the ground. [His act was intended to make them
   vehement, and to give his answer greater effect. What he wrote is
   unimportant and immaterial, and hence was not told.] 7 But when they
   continued asking him [they insisted on an answer, hoping that he would
   so explain away the seventh commandment as to encourage them in
   breaking the sixth], he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that
   is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. [Under the
   law (Deut. xvii. 7), the witnesses were to cast the first stone. Jesus
   maintained and vindicated the law, but imposed a condition which they
   had overlooked. The one who executed the law must be free from the same
   crime, lest by stoning the woman he condemn himself as worthy of a like
   death. There is no doubt that the words of Jesus impressed upon them
   the truth that freedom from the outward act did not imply inward purity
   or sinlessness--Matt. v. 27, 28.] 8 And again he stooped down, and with
   his finger wrote on the ground. [Thus giving them the opportunity to
   retire without the embarrassment of being watched.] 9 And they, when
   they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even
   unto the last [the oldest was first to be convicted of his conscience,
   because his experience of life's sinfulness was necessarily the
   fullest]: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in
   the midst. [I. e., in the midst of the court, where the crowd had
   been.] 10 And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where
   are they? did no man condemn thee? [This question is asked to pave the
   way for the dismissal of the woman.] 11 And she said, No man, Lord.
   ["Lord" is ambiguous; it may mean "Master" or simply "sir."] And Jesus
   said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no
   more. [The woman did not ask forgiveness, so no words of pardon are
   spoken. Compare this case with Luke xii. 14. Jesus did not come as an
   earthly judge; neither did he come to condemn, but to save. The
   narrative shows how Jesus could deal with malice and impurity in a
   manner so full of delicacy and dignity as to demonstrate the divine
   wisdom which dwelt within him.]

Messianic Claims Met by Attempt to Stone Jesus.

(Jerusalem. October, a.d. 29.)

^D John VIII. 12-59.

   ^d 12 Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of
   the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but
   shall have the light of life. [The metaphor of light was common, and
   signified knowledge and life; darkness is opposed to light, being the
   symbol of ignorance and death.] 13 The Pharisees therefore said unto
   him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. [They
   perhaps recalled the words of Jesus at John v. 31.] 14 Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is
   true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not
   whence I come, and whither I go. [No man can bear testimony of his own
   nature, for he knows neither its origin nor its end. The Jews could not
   judge as to Christ's nature--that he was the source of light and life,
   because of their ignorance as to him. But Jesus, having complete
   knowledge as to his eternal existence, was qualified to testify. These
   are truths about Deity to which Deity alone can testify, and as to the
   truth of which Deity alone is fully competent to judge.] 15 Ye judge
   after the flesh [i. e., carnally, superficially, according to
   appearances. Carnal tests are not suited to spiritual truth]; I judge
   no man. 16 Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone,
   but I and the Father that sent me. [He contrasts his spirit with
   theirs. They came upon him eager to condemn, but he had come not to
   condemn, but to save (John iii. 17). As an exception to his general
   course he might at intervals condemn a sinner; but should be do so the
   sentence would be just, for it would be the judgment of the Father, and
   hence devoid of any personal resentment or other biasing, perverting
   influence; the Father being lifted above and removed from the heats of
   argument in which the Son engaged.] 17 Yea and in your law it is
   written, that the witness of two men is true. 18 I am he that beareth
   witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
   [Jesus here returns to the point raised in verse 13. He cites the law
   as to two witnesses, found at Deut. xix. 15, and calls the law their
   law because they had arrogantly claimed possession of it (John vii.
   49). The Father had borne witness to the Son by the prophets, including
   John the Baptist, by his voice at the baptism and transfiguration, by
   the works wrought by Jesus, and by the very nature of the life
   manifested by our Lord throughout his entire ministry. If the witness
   of two men establishes truth, much more the witness of the two divine
   voices--that of the Father and of the Son.] 19 They said therefore unto
   him, Where is thy Father? [They evidently thought that Jesus referred
   to the testimony of some earthly parent (see verse 27), and appeal to
   him to produce this absent, unseen witness. It was according to their
   carnal or fleshly judgment to thus think.] Jesus answered, Ye know
   neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
   [If they had really known the Son they would have recognized in him the
   Father, and vice versa--John xiv. 6, 8.] 20 These words spake he in the
   treasury, as he taught in the temple and no man took him; because his
   hour was not yet come. [The treasury, or place where the chests for
   offerings were placed, was in the court of the women, the most public
   part of the Jewish temple. It was near the hall Gazith, where the
   Sanhedrin met. Though he taught in a place so suited to his arrest, he
   was not taken. There is evidently a pause after verse 20, but probably
   not a very long one.] 21 He said therefore Jesus again unto them, I go
   away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye
   cannot come. [See comment on page 447. Seeking their Messiah as an
   earthly and not as a spiritual deliverer, they would not find him, and
   hence would die unforgiven, and therefore could not come to the land
   whither Jesus went, since the unforgiven cannot enter there.] 22 The
   Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go,
   ye cannot come? 23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am
   from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 24 I said
   therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye
   believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. [Jesus had made
   their sins the ground of separation between him and them, but they
   assumed that they could go wherever he went, unless he went some place
   for self-murder. Thus they adroitly attempt to make his sin the cause
   of the separation. To this Jesus replies that they are even now
   separated from him by their origin and nature, and that theirs is the
   sinful nature, and that they shall die in it unless delivered from it
   through faith in him.] 25 They said therefore unto him, Who art thou?
   Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from
   the beginning. [His bold call to them to believe in him leads them to
   make a counter demand that he confess himself to them, but Jesus had
   all along confessed himself to them as the Son of the Father, the bread
   and water of life, the light of the world, etc., and had no new
   confession to make.] 26 I have many things to speak and to judge
   concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I
   heard from him, these speak I unto the world. [Up to this point Jesus
   had sought to reveal himself; from this point on he would reveal his
   enemies also, and though the revelation would be displeasing, it was
   from the Father, and hence would be spoken.] 27 They perceived not that
   he spake to them of the Father. 28 Jesus therefore said, When ye have
   lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I
   do nothing of myself; but as the Father hath taught me, I speak these
   things. 29 And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone;
   for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. [The words which
   he was about to speak would seem to them to be prompted by personal
   malevolence. Misconstruing his words as spoken in this spirit, the Jews
   would crucify him; but when their rage had accomplished his death and
   spent itself, they would look back upon his life--especially the
   closing scenes of it--and see that his soul contained no bitterness
   toward them, that what he had said was true, and was spoken at the
   dictation of his Father. At the day of Pentecost and the season which
   followed it, the repentance of the Jews amply fulfilled this prophecy.]
   30 As he spake these things, many believed on him. [The tender manner
   in which Jesus spoke these words convinced many that he was filled with
   the spirit of loving good will, and they believed him. Among these
   converts were some of the Jewish hierarchy, which had been but even now
   opposing him. The succeeding verses shows how Jesus tried to correct
   their false views of his Messiahship, and to raise their faith to a
   higher level, and how their faith utterly broke down under the test.]
   31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews [those of the hierarchy] that had
   believed him [the words indicate a less faith than the "believed on
   him" of the previous verse], If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly
   my disciples [Discipleship is an abiding condition--a life, not an act.
   The prejudices and preconceived notions of these Jews would prevent
   them from believing on him]; 32 and ye shall know the truth, and the
   truth shall make you free. [Freedom consists in conformity to that
   which, in the realm of intellect, is called truth, and in the realm of
   morality, law. The only way in which we know truth is to obey it, and
   God's truth gives freedom from sin and death.] 33 They answered unto
   him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any
   man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 34 Jesus answered them,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the
   bondservant of sin. [Jesus here shows that the freedom of which he
   spoke was spiritual--a relief from the distress mentioned in verses 21,
   24.] 35 And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son
   abideth for ever. 36 If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall
   be free indeed. [For light on this passage read Gal. iv. 19-21. Slaves
   have no permanent relationship to a house, and may be changed at will.
   God was about to dismiss the Jews as unfaithful slaves (Luke xx.
   16-19). Sons, on the contrary, have a permanent relationship to the
   house, and if a son take one into fraternal adoption, he communicates
   to such a one his own perpetuity--Rom. viii. 2.] 37 I know that ye are
   Abraham's seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free
   course in you. [Outwardly and carnally ye are Abraham's seed, but ye
   are not so inwardly and spiritually, for he was the friend of God (Jas.
   ii. 23), but ye are the enemies of God's Son, even seeking to kill him
   because ye are so corrupt that his words are distasteful to you, and ye
   resist them.] 38 I speak the things which I have seen with my Father:
   and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father. [An
   introductory statement leading up to verse 44. In the discourse which
   follows, Jesus discloses two households, two sets of children, and two
   styles of language or thought--one divine, the other diabolic.] 39 They
   answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. [Seeing that he was
   distinguishing between his parentage and their parentage, they reassert
   for themselves the fatherhood of Abraham, leaving him to find a better
   one if he could.] Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children,
   ye would do the works of Abraham. 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man
   that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not
   Abraham. [Jesus here asserts that true descent is spiritual--a common
   nature manifesting itself in a similarity of works. According to this
   standard, the works of the Jews disproved their claim to be derived
   from Abraham.] 41 Ye do the works of your father. [This refers back to
   verse 38, and shows that in distinguishing between his and their
   parentage Jesus had not allotted them the parentage of Abraham which
   they so gliby claimed.] They said unto him, We were not born of
   fornication; we have one Father, even God. [Perceiving that he spoke of
   spiritual parentage, and recognizing the fact that he had shattered
   their claim of spiritual derivation from Abraham, they fell back upon
   the citadel of Jewish confidence and pride--spiritually they were
   begotten of God; they were not begotten of an idolatrous but of a godly
   stock. Fornication is here used as the common symbol for idolatry--Ex.
   xxxiv. 15, 16; Hos. i. 2; ii. 4.] 42 Jesus said unto them, If God were
   your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and came from God; for
   neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. [If ye were God's
   children, ye would recognize me as of the same household, and love me
   accordingly, for I am both God-derived and God-sent. Thus their hatred
   destroyed this claim also.] 43 Why do ye not understand my speech? Even
   because ye cannot hear my word. [By "speech" here Jesus means the
   outward form or expression of an idea; by "word" he means the inner
   thought or substance--the idea itself. Throughout this whole dialogue
   the Jews had failed to understand the verbiage of Jesus, because his
   thoughts were so utterly unfamiliar that no words could make them
   plain. Minds filled with ideas of the devil find it difficult to
   comprehend the thoughts of God, no matter how plainly expressed.] 44 Ye
   are of your father the devil, and the lusts [wishes, desires] of your
   father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and
   standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
   speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
   father thereof. [By your hatred of the truth and your desire to commit
   murder, which are notable lusts of the devil, you show that you are
   spiritually derived from him. He was a murderer in the very beginning,
   for he brought sin into the world, which caused death ( Rom. v. 12). He
   shrinks from the truth as you do, because it meets no response in his
   heart. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own offspring, for he is
   a liar and the father of lying.] 45 And because I tell [you] the truth,
   ye believe me not. [As children of Satan they were used to his
   flattering speech; hence they rejected the word of Jesus because it was
   the bitter truth, and convicted them of sin.] 46 Which of you
   convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me? [If you
   can not convict me of sin, then what I say must be true. Why, then, do
   you not believe me?] 47 He that is of God heareth the words of God: for
   this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God. [The word
   "hear" is used in the sense of receive. Children of God love the
   honesty of God, but children of the devil prefer to be deceived. The
   saying is akin to John iii. 20, 21.] 48 The Jews [the same mentioned in
   verse 31] answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a
   Samaritan, and hast a demon? [They present this piece of scorn as
   though it were a current saying; but it was probably suggested by the
   distinction in parentage which Jesus had just made. See verse 38. He
   had shown they were no true sons of either Abraham or God, and they
   retaliate by calling him a Samaritan, swayed by diabolical influences.
   Jesus had visited Samaria (John iv.), and had just come through Samaria
   to this feast; these things, coupled with his bitter charges against
   the sons of Abraham, were sufficient to suggest the slanderous
   accusation.] 49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my
   Father, and ye dishonor me. [He did not deny the charge of being a
   Samaritan, not choosing to recognize the difference which they attached
   to race--John iv. 39-42; Luke x. 33; xvii. 16.] 50 But I seek not mine
   own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. [I do not mind your
   abuse, for I do not seek my own glory. My Father seeks it, and judges
   those in whom he finds it not--John v. 23.] 51 Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. [Jesus here
   re-states the thought in verses 31, 32. "To keep" here means to cherish
   and obey. Sin is bondage, and its wages is death. The fleshly body of
   the Christian dies, but the spirit within him does not. His eternal
   life begins in this world--John v. 24.] 52 The Jews said unto him, Now
   we know that thou hast a demon. [They thus construed his words as a
   confirmation of their former accusation.] Abraham died, and the
   prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste
   of death. 53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and
   the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself? [The argument is this:
   God's word spoken to Abraham and the prophets had not preserved their
   lives, yet you claim power of life for your words greater than God's,
   yet surely you will not claim even to be as great as Abraham. Such wild
   talk is mere raving. They expected Jesus to disclaim the high position
   to which he seemed to have exalted himself.] 54 Jesus answered, If I
   glorify myself, my glory is nothing [he prefaces his answer by showing
   that his words are not spoken in a spirit of self-exaltation, but in
   accordance to the will of his Father]: it is my Father that glorifieth
   me; of whom ye say, that he is your God; 55 and ye have not known him:
   but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like
   unto you, a liar [referring back to verse 44]: but I know him, and keep
   his word. [Jesus here makes plain as sunlight his entire discourse by
   showing that he has used the word Father where they would have used the
   word God. There is a distinction, too, between the "known" and the
   "know" used by Jesus. The first represents knowledge which is acquired.
   The Jews had not acquired a knowledge of God from their Scriptures. The
   second, "know," indicates that which is grasped intuitively, by direct
   personal cognition.] 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and
   he saw it, and was glad. ["My day" means the mediatorial manifestation
   of Messiah. Abraham saw it by faith in the promised seed.] 57 The Jews
   therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast
   thou seen Abraham? [They continue to persist in a literal
   interpretation, and even wrest the words of Jesus; for Abraham might
   well have seen him as the seed of promise, without his fleshly eyes
   ever seeing Abraham. Fifty years indicated the prime of life. It had
   been two thousand years since the time of Abraham, and Jesus was not
   yet a mature man as estimated by years.] 58 Jesus said unto them,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am. ["I was"
   would simply have expressed priority, but "I am" marks timeless
   existence. It draws the contrast between the created and the uncreated,
   the temporal and the eternal. Compare Ex. iii. 14.] 59 They took up
   stones therefore to cast at him. [judging him to be a blasphemer]: but
   Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple. [He doubtless drew back
   into the crowd and was concealed by his friends.]

LXXXI.

Contention Over the Man Born Blind.

(Jerusalem.)

^D John IX. 1-41.

   [Some look upon the events in this and the next section as occurring at
   the Feast of Tabernacles in October, others think they occurred at the
   Feast of Dedication in December, deriving their point of time from John
   x. 22.] ^d 1 And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.
   [The man probably sought to waken compassion by repeatedly stating this
   fact to passers-by.] 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who
   sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? [They
   assumed that all suffering was retributive, and asked for whose sins
   this man suffered, regarding it as a case of extreme hardship, for to
   be born blind is uncommon, even in the East. Their question had
   reference to the doctrine of transmigration of souls, the man being
   regarded as possibly having sinned in some pre-existing state.] 3 Jesus
   answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works
   of God should be made manifest in him. [Jesus found a third alternative
   to their dilemma. The man's parents were sinners, but neither their sin
   nor the beggar's own sin had caused this calamity. It had come upon him
   as part of God's plan for his life; it was part of the providential
   arrangement by which God governs the world.] 4 We must work the works
   of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
   work. [As to the duration of his earthly works, Jesus classifies
   himself with his disciples, for his humanity, like ours, had its season
   of activity, or day, which was practically terminated by the night of
   death. After his resurrection, Jesus performed no miracles of healing.]
   5 When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. [In the
   spiritual sense, Christ is ever the light of the world, but while he
   lived among men, even the privileges of physical light were imparted to
   him.] 6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
   of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay. 7 and said unto
   him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent).
   [Jesus probably used the clay to aid the man's faith. His so doing gave
   the Pharisees a chance to cavil at Jesus for breaking the Sabbath. If
   later rabbis report correctly, the traditions of that day, clay might
   be put on the eyes for pleasure on the Sabbath, but not for medicine,
   nor might the eyes be anointed with spittle on that day. As to the pool
   of Siloam, see page 327. It was probably called Sent because its waters
   are sent to it from the Virgin's Fountain through a tunnel cut through
   the hill Ophel. For the Virgin's Fountain, see page 194.] He went away
   therefore, and washed, and came seeing. [He did not come back to Jesus,
   but came to his own house.] 8 The neighbors therefore, and they which
   saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, is not this he that sat
   and begged? 9 Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like
   him. [The conclusion of the neighbors is very natural. Such a cure
   would slightly change his appearance, but in any event the
   impossibility of the cure would raise doubts as to the identity of the
   cured.] He said, I am he. 10 They said therefore unto him, How then
   were thine eyes opened? [They question as to the manner, not as to the
   fact.] 11 He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and
   anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went
   and washed, and I received sight. [He speaks of Jesus as one well
   known. He had learned who sent him before he went to Siloam. We shall
   note how opposition enlarges the faith and the confession of this man.]
   12 And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not. 13 They
   bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. [They wanted to
   see how the Pharisees would deal with Jesus' miracles. See McGarvey's
   "Credibility," page 112 f.] 14 Now it was the sabbath on the day when
   Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. [Such conduct on the Sabbath
   raised legal questions of which the Pharisees were also the recognized
   judges.] 15 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he
   received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes,
   and I washed, and I see. [The Pharisees ascertained no more than the
   neighbors had learned.] 16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This
   man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others
   said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was
   division among them. [The cause for division is apparent. One party
   laid stress upon the Jewish tradition and judged Jesus a sinner because
   he had violated them. The other party laid stress upon the sign or
   miracle and argued that one who could do such things could not be a
   violator of God's laws.] 17 They [both parties] say therefore unto the
   blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes?
   [Each party asked the opinion of the blind man, hoping to get something
   to aid their side of the argument--one party trusting to the man's
   gratitude, and the other to his fear of the rulers.] And he said, He is
   a prophet. [A far more pronounced confession than that which he gave in
   verse 11.] 18 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that
   he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the
   parents of him that had received his sight. 19 and asked them, saying,
   Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
   [The man's advocacy of Jesus as prophet suggested to those cunning
   diplomats that there was collusion between Jesus and the man, and that
   the cure was fraudulent. They therefore denied the cure and sent for
   the parents, to whom they put the threefold question as to sonship,
   blindness and cure.] 20 His parents answered and said, We know that
   this is our son, and that he was born blind [thus they answer clearly
   as to the first two points]: 21 but how he now seeth, we know not; or
   who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak
   for himself. [The emphasis in this verse lies in the pronouns. Thus the
   parents timidly declined to answer the third point, alleging that their
   son is old enough to answer for himself.] 22 These things said his
   parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed
   [informally] already, that if any man should confess that him to be
   Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. [The parents, having
   heard the unrestrained, freely spoken account given by their son as to
   his healing, had no doubt in their own minds as to who effected that
   healing. They therefore declined to speak because of fear, and not
   through lack of knowledge.] 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of
   age; ask him. 24 So [following the suggestion of the parents, and
   because a miracle could not now be denied] they called a second time
   the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know
   that this man is a sinner. [Taken in their English sense, these words
   would mean, "praise God and not Jesus for what has been done," but the
   phrase "give God the praise" is, in Hebrew usage, an adjuration to a
   criminal to confess his guilt (Josh. vii. 9; I. Sam. vi. 5). The idea
   may then be paraphrased thus: confess that you and Jesus have conspired
   to work a pretended miracle. It is your best course, since we know all
   about the frauds of Jesus and will soon unearth this one.] 25 He
   therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I
   know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. [As to the doings of Jesus,
   whether fraudulent or not, he could not answer, but he could say that
   there was no sham or deception about his eyesight.] 26 They said
   therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 27
   He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore
   would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? [Perceiving
   that their boasted knowledge as to the frauds of Jesus was untrue, and
   that they were even then questioning him to obtain material to be used
   against Jesus, he declines to repeat his statement and shows them that
   he understands their sinister motive in questioning him by ironically
   asking them if they wished to become disciples of Jesus.] 28 And they
   reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of
   Moses. 29 We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man,
   we know not whence he is. [In Jewish estimation, Moses stood next to
   God. To forsake Moses for another prophet was to be an apostate. Such
   reviling was a severe test, but the man stood it.] 30 The man answered
   and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence
   he is, and yet he opened mine eyes. [The man answers contempt with
   contempt; with biting irony he declares that the miracle of his healing
   is no wonder at all when compared with the fact that such wonderfully
   learned men should be totally ignorant of so great a miracle-worker as
   Jesus. Thus he scorned their superlative claim to infallible knowledge,
   expressed in verses 24 and 29.] 31 We know [he takes up their style of
   speech] that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of
   God, and do his will, him he heareth. [Such was the teaching of the Old
   Testament--Prov. xv. 29; Isa. i. 15; Mic. iii. 4; Jas. v. 16, 17.] 32
   Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes
   of a man born blind. [The Old Testament contains no record of such a
   miracle; the case stood alone as a marvel of power.] 33 If this man
   were not from God, he could do nothing. [He draws the same conclusion
   which the better element of the Pharisees had drawn. See verse 16.] 34
   They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and
   dost thou teach us? [They give here the Jewish answer to the question
   asked in verse 2. Do you, so stamped a sinner from birth, presume to
   teach us, the heads of Israel? They had been denying that he had been
   blind; they now inconsistently taunt him with blindness as an evidence
   of his sin.] And they cast him out. [The vast majority of commentators
   take this as an immediate act, and hence allege that the language
   refers to his being cast out of the hall or place where they were
   assembled, and not to his being excommunicated. Their reason for this
   is found in the fact that the man could not be excommunicated without a
   formal meeting of the Sanhedrin. But there is nothing to show that the
   act was not a deliberate one, including a formal meeting, etc. We agree
   with DeWette that his expulsion from a hall "would not be important
   enough to occasion verse 35."] 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him
   out [His was a sad plight, indeed. To be put out of the synagogue was
   to be put on a level with the heathen, and to be left without a country
   or a religious fellowship]; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe
   on the Son of God? [Being cut off from all that came through Moses,
   Jesus was leading him into all that came through the Son of God.] 36 He
   answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? [The
   form of the man's question showed that he regarded a knowledge of the
   Son of God as a privilege beyond all hope or expectation, and the reply
   of Jesus is suited to this idea.] 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast
   both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. [Thus the unhoped
   for had been actually and sensually realized. To the outcast of the
   synagogue here and to the outcast of the nation at Jacob's well (John
   iv. 26), how fully Jesus revealed himself!] 38 And he said, Lord, I
   believe. And he worshipped him. 39 And Jesus said [not addressing
   anyone in particular, but rather as summing up the whole incident] ,
   For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see;
   and that they that see may become blind. [The life course of Jesus
   attracted the needy and repelled the self-satisfied, and was therefore
   a continuous judgment. Those conscious of their deficiencies and ready
   to ask for light received it (verses 36-38 ), while those satisfied
   with their own opinion became daily more blinded by their bigotry. See
   verses 24 and 34, and Matt. xi. 25.] 40 Those of the Pharisees who were
   with him [not as disciples, but for curiosity's sake] heard these
   things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? 41 Jesus said unto them,
   If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your
   sin remaineth. [If you were conscious of your spiritual darkness, and
   sought light, you either find it or not be blamed for your failure to
   do so. They could see if they would, and were responsible for their
   blindness.]

Discourse on the Good Shepherd.

(Jerusalem, December, a.d. 29.)

^D John X. 1-21.

   ^d 1 Verily, verily, I say to you [unto the parties whom he was
   addressing in the last section], He that entereth not by the door into
   the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a
   thief and a robber. [In this section Jesus proceeds to contrast his own
   care for humanity with that manifested by the Pharisees, who had just
   cast out the beggar. Old Testament prophecies were full of declarations
   that false shepherds would arise to the injury of God's flock (Ezek.
   xxxiv. 1-6; Jer. xxiii. 1-6; Zech. xi. 4-11). But other prophecies
   spoke of the true shepherding of God and his Messiah (Ps. xxiii.;
   lxxvii. 20; Ps. lxxx. 1; xcv. 7; Jer. xxxi. 10; Ezek. xxxiv. 31; Mic.
   vii. 14; Isa. xliii. 11). The Pharisees were fulfilling the first line
   of prophecies, and Jesus was fulfilling the second. The sheepfolds of
   the East are roofless enclosures, made of loose stone, or surrounded by
   thornbushes. They have but one door. Jesus, the true shepherd, came in
   the proper and appointed way (and was the proper and appointed Way),
   thus indicating his office as shepherd. A thief steals by cunning in
   one's absence; a robber takes by violence from one's person. The
   Pharisees were both. They stole the sheep in Messiah's absence, and
   they slew Messiah when he came. They did not come in the ways ordained
   of God.] 2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
   sheep. 3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and
   he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. [Several small
   flocks were sometimes kept in one field. The door was fastened from the
   inside with sticks or bars by the porter, who remained with the sheep
   during the night, and opened for the shepherds in the morning. The fold
   is the church, Christ is the door, the sheep are the disciples, and the
   shepherd is Christ. The porter is probably part of the drapery of the
   parable. If he represents anybody, it is God, who decides who shall
   enter through the door.] 4 When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth
   before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. [In the
   East, sheep are not driven, but led, and each sheep has and knows its
   name. Disciples also are led. There is no rough road or thorny path
   which the feet of Jesus have not first trod. The Pharisees had put
   forth the beggar to be rid of him; the true shepherd puts forth to
   feed.] 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him:
   for they know not the voice of strangers. [The mingled flocks are
   separated by the calling voices of the several shepherds. The control
   of the Pharisees was not of this order. The authority of the synagogues
   had passed into their hands, and their rule was about the same as when
   thieves and robbers gained possession of the sheepfold. The people were
   disposed to flee from them--Matt. ix. 36.] 6 This parable spake Jesus
   unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake
   unto them. [The idea of loving care was so foreign to the nature of the
   Pharisees that they could not comprehend the figures which clothed such
   a thought. The word here translated "parable" is not the word
   "parabole," which John never uses, but the word " paroimia," which the
   synoptists never use. Paroimia means, literally, "beside the way," i.
   e., speech not of the common or direct form, i. e., a similitude or
   allegory.] 7 Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. [Seeing that they did not
   understand the allegory, Jesus gives a twofold explanation of it found
   in verses 7-10 and 11-16.] 8 All that came before me are thieves and
   robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. [He speaks of the past, and
   refers to false Messiahs.] 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in,
   he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.
   [The door is here spoken of with reference to the sheep, and hence
   becomes a symbol of entrance into protection and shelter, or exit to
   liberty and plenty.] 10 The thief cometh not, but that he may steal,
   and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it
   abundantly. [Through the life of Jesus, as through a heavenly portal,
   men have entered upon true civilization, with its schools, colleges,
   railroads, telegraph, telephone, and innumerable privileges and
   liberties.] 11 I am the good shepherd [The relations of Christ to his
   people are so abounding and complex as to overburden any parable which
   seeks to carry them. He is not only the passive doorway to life, but
   also the active, energizing force which leads his people through that
   doorway into life]: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the
   sheep. [Verses 11-14 set forth the perfect self-sacrifice through which
   the blessings of Christ have been obtained for us. The world-ruling
   spirit blesses itself through the sacrifice of the people; the
   Christ-spirit blesses the people through the sacrifice of self.] 12 He
   that is an hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not
   [shepherds were not, as a rule, owners of the sheep, but they were
   expected to love and care for them by reason of their office as
   shepherds], beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
   fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them [the perils of
   the Oriental shepherd accord with the picture here given--Gen. xiii. 5;
   xiv. 12; xxxi. 39, 40; xxxii. 7, 8; xxxvii. 33; Job i. 7; I. Sam. xvii.
   34, 35]: 13 he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the
   sheep. [He flees because he loves his wages rather than the flock.] 14
   I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, 15
   even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father [Our Lord's
   relationship to his flock is one of mutual knowledge and affection, and
   is far removed from the spirit of hire. The knowledge existing between
   disciple and Master springs from mutual acquaintanceship and love. Thus
   it is the same kind of knowledge which exists between Father and Son,
   though it is not of the same quality, being infinitely less full and
   perfect]; and I lay down my life for the sheep. [The sacrifice of the
   good shepherd to shield his sheep has never been in vain.] 16 And other
   sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and
   they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one
   shepherd. [Jesus was speaking to the Jews, who had been frequently
   spoken of in Scripture as God's flock. The other sheep were Gentiles.
   They are spoken of as scattered sheep, and not as flocks, because with
   them there was no unity. Here, as everywhere, the truth breaks through,
   revealing Christ as the world's Redeemer, who would break down the
   middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile, and cause all true
   worshipers to have a common relationship to one Master.] 17 Therefore
   doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it
   again. [Jesus did not permit his life to be sacrificed so as to become
   cast away, but to be raised again as an earnest of the resurrection of
   all flesh.] 18 No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of
   myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
   This commandment received I from my Father. [This shows that his death
   was voluntary, and with the resurrection which followed, it was in full
   and perfect accordance with his original commission or commandment from
   the Father.] 19 There arose a division again among the Jews because of
   these words. [The word "again" refers to John vii. 43 and ix. 16.] 20
   And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
   [The theory that demons could produce supernatural effects (Matt. xii.
   24) formed a handy device for explaining away the miracles of Christ.]
   21 Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a
   demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? [These defenders refer
   to the well-remembered cure of the man born blind, and argue, as he
   did, that a demoniac could not work such a miracle. They fail, however,
   to make a positive confession of faith in Jesus.]

Mission and Return of the Seventy.

(Probably in Judæa, October, a.d. 29.)

^C Luke X. 1-24.

   ^c 1 Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others [i. e.,
   other messengers in addition to the twelve apostles], and sent them two
   and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself
   was about to come. [Luke has told us of the journey through Samaria to
   Jerusalem, and John has told us what occurred at the Feast of
   Tabernacles in Jerusalem. We learn from John also that Jesus was at the
   Feast of Dedication (John x. 22). The first feast was in October and
   the latter in December. Jesus evidently spent the time between these
   feast in Judæa, making a tour of that province and sending the seventy
   before him, thus thoroughly evangelizing it as he had Galilee, by
   sending out the twelve.] 2 Therefore he said unto them, The harvest
   indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the
   Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his
   harvest. 3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst
   of wolves. 4 Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on
   the way. [This last was probably a common direction in cases of haste
   (II. Kings iv. 29). Eastern salutations were tedious and overburdened
   with ceremony. Those in haste were excused from them.] 5 And into
   whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 6
   And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if
   not, it shall turn to you again. 7 And in that same house remain,
   eating and drinking such things as they give [they were not to give
   trouble and waste time by asking for better food]: for the laborer is
   worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 8 And into whatsoever
   city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before
   you: 9 and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
   kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 10 But into whatsoever city ye
   enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and
   say, 11 Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we
   wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God
   is come nigh. [For comment, see pp. 362-365.] 12 I say unto you, It
   shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 13
   Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
   works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you,
   they would have long ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14
   But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than
   for you. 15 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven?
   thou shalt be brought down unto Hades. [For comment on a similar
   passage, see pp. 286, 287.] 16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he
   that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him
   that sent me. [For comment, see page 368.] 17 And the seventy returned
   with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy
   name. [The report of the seventy is more joyous than that of the
   twelve, for the sayings of the latter on their return were overshadowed
   by the news of John the Baptist's death.] 18 And he said unto them, I
   beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. [This may be translated
   "I was beholding Satan fallen as lightning falls from heaven." The
   sense indicates that the words refer to the victories over the unclean
   spirits just reported by the seventy. In their successes Jesus saw
   Satan falling from the lofty heights with the swiftness of lightning.
   The overthrow of Satan was then in progress-- John xvi. 11; xii. 31.]
   19 Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and
   scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in
   any wise hurt you. [While the messengers of Christ were, no doubt,
   literally protected from the poisons of reptiles, etc. (Acts xxviii.
   3-6 ), serpents and scorpions are here to be taken an emblematic of the
   powers of evil.] 20 Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits
   are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in
   heaven. [Your joy in visible and temporal success, and in the
   subjection to you of the powers of evil, is not to be compared to the
   joy that you have the prospect of heaven.] 21 In that same hour he
   rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
   heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and
   understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it
   was well-pleasing in thy sight. 22 All things have been delivered unto
   me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father;
   and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
   willeth to reveal him. [For comment, see pp. 288, 289.] 23 And turning
   to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the
   things that ye see. 24 for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings
   desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear
   the things which ye hear, and heard them not. [For comment, see p.
   332.]

Parable of the Good Samaritan.

(Probably Judæa.)

^C Luke X. 25-37.

   ^c 25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him,
   saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? [For the term
   lawyer see pp. 313, 314, The lawyer wished to make trial of the skill
   of Jesus in solving the intricate and difficult question as to how to
   obtain salvation. Jesus was probably teaching in some house or
   courtyard, and his habit of giving local color to his parables suggests
   that he was probably in or near Bethany, through which the road from
   Jerusalem to Jericho passes. The lawyer stood up to attract attention
   to himself, and thus give emphasis to his question and its answer.] 26
   And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
   [Looking upon Jesus as a sabbath-breaker and a despiser of tradition,
   the lawyer no doubt expected that Jesus would lay down some new rule
   for obtaining salvation. If so, he was surprised to be thus referred to
   the law of Moses for his answer.] 27 And he answering said, Thou shalt
   love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
   with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as
   thyself. [Deut. vi. 4, 5; Lev. xix. 18. Having made himself conspicuous
   by standing up, the lawyer had to give the best answer he knew or sully
   his own reputation for knowledge. He therefore gives the two great laws
   which comprise all other laws.] 28 And he said unto him, Thou hast
   answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. [The lawyer had asked his
   question simply as a test. With him the law was simply matter for
   speculation and theory, and the word "do" was very startling. It showed
   the difference between his and the Master's views of the law. He had
   hoped by a question to expose Jesus as one who set aside the law, but
   Jesus had exposed the lawyer as one who merely theorized about the law,
   and himself as one who advocated the doing of the law.] 29 But he,
   desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
   [He could justify his conduct if permitted to define the word
   "neighbor." He asked his question, therefore, in the expectation of
   securing such a definition of the word as would enable him to maintain
   his public standing and quiet his conscience.] 30 Jesus made answer and
   said, A certain man [evidently a Jew, for otherwise the nationality
   would have been specified] was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho;
   and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and
   departed, leaving him half dead. [The road from Jerusalem to Jericho is
   eighteen miles long, and descends about 3,500 feet. About two miles
   from Jerusalem it passes through the village of Bethany, and for the
   rest of the eighteen miles it passes through desolate mountain ravines
   without any habitation save the inn, the ruins of which are still seen
   about half way to Jericho. This district from that time till the
   present has been noted for robberies, and Jerome tells that the road
   was called the "bloody way."] 31 And by chance a certain priest was
   going down that way [a very natural thing for a priest to do, for there
   was a very large priestly settlement at Jericho]: and when he saw him,
   he passed by on the other side. [He did this although the law commanded
   mercy and help to a neighbor--Ex. xxiii. 4; Deut. xxii. 1-4.] 32 And in
   like manner a Levite also [A temple minister. The tribe of Levi had
   been set apart by God for his service], when he came to the place, and
   saw him, passed by on the other side. [In the priest and Levite the
   lawyer saw the picture of his own life, for he saw in them those who
   knew the law, but did not practice it. There may have been many excuses
   for this neglect of the wounded man: danger, hate, dread of defilement,
   expense, but Jesus does not consider any of them worth mentioning.] 33
   But a certain Samaritan [the hereditary enemy of the Jew--John iv. 9],
   as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved
   with compassion, 34 and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring
   on them oil and wine [the ordinary remedies for wounds-- Isa. i. 6];
   and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took
   care of him. 35 And on the morrow he took out two shillings [the
   shilling or denarius was worth about seventeen cents, but it
   represented the price of a day's labor], and gave them to the host [the
   inn-keeper], and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest
   more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. [The compassion of
   the Samaritan bore full fruitage. However heterodox he was, he was
   after all a worshiper of Jehovah and more orthodox at heart than either
   the priest or the Levite. Though it was not customary for an inn-keeper
   to furnish food either for man or beast, he could do so if he chose out
   of his own stores. The scant cash left by the Samaritan indicates a
   poverty which made his charity the more praiseworthy. His eye and heart
   and hand and foot and purse were all subservient to the law of God.] 36
   Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell
   among the robbers? [Instead of answering didactically, "Everybody is
   your neighbor," Jesus had incarnated the law of neighborliness in the
   good Samaritan, and had made it so beautiful that the lawyer could not
   but commend it even when found in a representative of this apostate
   race. He showed, too, that the law was not for causistry but for
   practice.] 37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. [The lawyer
   avoided the name Samaritan so distasteful to his lips. Jesus gave
   countenance to no such racial prejudice, even though the Samaritans had
   rejected him but a few weeks before this--Luke ix. 53.] Then said Jesus
   unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. [All the laws and teachings of God
   are to be generously interpreted (Matt. v. 43, 44) and are to be
   embodied in the life--Matt. vii. 24-27.]

Jesus the Guest of Martha and Mary.

(Bethany, Near Jerusalem.)

^C Luke X. 38-42.

   ^c 38 Now as they went on their way [he was journeying through Judæa,
   attended by the twelve], he entered into a certain village [It was the
   village of Bethany (John xi. 1), which was on the eastern slope of the
   Mount of Olives, less than two miles from Jerusalem]: and a certain
   woman named Martha received him into her house. 39 And she had a sister
   called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word.
   [Sitting at the feet was the ancient posture of pupils (Acts xxii. 3).
   Martha honored Christ as a Guest, but Mary honored him as a Teacher.]
   40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving [she was evidently
   preparing an elaborate repast, and was experiencing the worry and
   distraction which usually accompanies such effort]; and she came up to
   him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to
   serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. [Martha so forms her
   appeal to Christ as to make it a covert insinuation that Mary would not
   listen to her requests.] 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her,
   Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things [By
   thus repeating the name, Jesus tempered the rebuke. See also Luke xxii.
   31; Acts ix. 4]: 42 but one thing is needful [I.e., one duty or
   privilege is pre-eminent. Bread for the body may be important, but food
   for the soul is, after all, the one thing needful]: for Mary hath
   chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. [The
   expression "good part" is an allusion to the portion of honor sent to
   the principal guest at a banquet. Its use shows that Jesus had food in
   mind when he used the expression "one thing is needful," and that he
   was contrasting spiritual nourishment with physical. The description of
   the two sisters here tallies with that given at John xii. 2, 3, for
   there Martha serves and Mary expresses personal devotion. Our Lord's
   rebuke is not aimed at hospitality, nor at a life full of energy and
   business. It is intended to reprove that fussy fretfulness which
   attempts many unneeded things, and ends in worry and fault-finding. It
   does not set a life of religious contemplation above a life of true
   religious activity, for contemplation is here contrasted with activity
   put forth with a faulty spirit. The trend of the New Testament teaching
   shows that a man must be a doer as well as a hearer of the Word.]

Prayer Taught and Encouraged.

(Probably Judæa.)

^C Luke XI. 1-13.

   ^c 1 And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that
   when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to
   pray, even as John also taught his disciples. [Jesus had already taught
   his disciples how to pray in the Sermon on the Mount. This disciple
   probably thought that the prayer already taught was too brief to be
   sufficient, especially as Jesus often prayed so long. It was customary
   for the rabbis to give their disciples forms of prayer, and the Baptist
   seems to have followed this practice, though the prayer taught by him
   appears soon to have been forgotten.] 2 And he said unto them, When ye
   pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. 3 Give us
   day by day our daily bread 4 And forgive us our sins; for we also
   forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into
   temptation. [The form given by Matthew is fuller than this. See pp.
   252-254. The variation of the two prayers is an evidence of the
   independence of the two Gospels. In the prayer as usually publicly
   repeated, the word "trespasses" is often used in place of the word
   "debts." This is a remnant of Tyndale's translation (a.d. 1526) which
   has been preserved and handed down in the Episcopal Liturgies. Tyndale
   renders Matthew as follows: "And forgive us our trespases even as we
   forgive them which trespas vs."] 5 And he said unto them, Which of you
   shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight [a most
   unseasonable hour], and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 6
   for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing
   to set before him [In the summer Orientals often travel by night to
   avoid the heat of the day, and the customs of the land then made
   hospitality so obligatory that the greatest inconvenience and deepest
   poverty did not excuse one from practicing it. The occasion here
   described would call for three loaves, that the host and the guest
   might each have one, and that there might be one in reserve as an
   evidence of liberality]; 7 and he from within shall answer and say,
   Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in
   bed; I cannot rise and give thee? [The man within does not use the word
   "friend." His answer is blunt and discouraging. In the house of a
   laboring man, the family all sleep in one room. The pallets, or thin
   mattresses, are spread upon the divan, or raised platform, which passes
   around the room next to the wall. Where there was no divan they were
   spread upon the floor. For a father to rise and grope about in the dark
   that he might unbolt the door and find the required bread was indeed no
   slight trouble. He would be apt to step upon, or otherwise disturb, the
   sleeping children.] 8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give
   him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will
   arise and give him as many as he needeth. [Friendship should have
   prompted the man to supply his friend. It failed, however; yet the
   bread was given to get rid of a noisy beggar, to be rid of whom all the
   bread in the house would be willingly sacrificed if necessary. If a
   selfish man can be thus won by importunity, much more can a generous
   God, whose reluctance is never without reason, and whose ever-present
   desire is to bless. Idle repetition of prayers is forbidden; but
   persistence and importunity are encouraged. See Isa. xlii. 6; Gen.
   xviii. 23-33; Matt. xv. 27, 28.] 9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it
   shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
   opened unto you. 10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
   seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 11 And of
   which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him
   a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent? 12 Or if he
   shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? 13 If ye then, being
   evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
   shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
   [The substance of this passage is recorded by Matthew as a portion of
   the Sermon on the Mount. See pp. 264, 265. Verse 12 is peculiar to
   Luke, and in verse 13 Matthew has "good things" where Luke has "Holy
   Spirit." The Holy Spirit is the best of all gifts, being as necessary
   to the soul as food to the body. The scorpion is an insect somewhat
   similar to a small lobster. It is two or three inches long, and has a
   sting at the end of its tail which is about as severe as that of a
   wasp. The old commentators tell us that the white scorpion, when rolled
   up, closely resembled an egg.]

Sabbath Healing. Mustard Seed and Leaven.

(Probably Peræa.)

^C Luke XIII. 10-21.

   ^c 10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.
   [Our Lord's habit of teaching in the synagogue, which had been for some
   time interrupted by his retirement, had probably been revived during
   the mission of the seventy.] 11 And behold, a woman that had a spirit
   of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in
   no wise lift herself up. [The use of the word "spirit" in this verse
   indicates that the curvature of the spine which afflicted this woman
   was attributed to demoniacal agency.] 12 And when Jesus saw her, he
   called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine
   infirmity. 13 And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was
   made straight, and glorified God. 14 And the ruler of the synagogue,
   being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath,
   answered and said to the multitude, There are six days [quite enough]
   in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and
   not on the day of the sabbath. [There is not evidence that the woman
   came with any intention of being healed, nor was the ruler angry at
   her, but at Jesus. Too cowardly to openly rebuke Jesus, the ruler fell
   to reprimanding the people, and thus indirectly censuring the Lord.] 15
   But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one
   of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead
   him away to watering? [The word "hypocrite" was among the strongest
   ever used by our Lord. He here applies it to the whole class to whom
   the ruler belonged and for whom he was the spokesman--the class who are
   mentioned as "adversaries" in verse 17. Their hypocrisy appears in two
   ways: 1. They were disguising their hatred toward Christ under a
   pretended zeal for the Sabbath. 2. Their zeal for the Sabbath was at no
   time sincere, for they favored indulgence where their own interests
   were involved, but applied their Sabbath rules sharply where others
   were concerned. It was their tradition and not the Sabbath which Jesus
   had broken, and he here attempts no other justification of himself than
   to show that he is guiltless under a fair application of their own
   precedents.] 16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham,
   whom Satan had bound, lo, these eighteen years, to have been loosed
   from this bond on the day of the sabbath? [Taking their own conduct on
   the Sabbath day as the basis for his justification, Jesus presents
   three contrasts, each of which made his action better than theirs: 1.
   He had blessed the woman instead of an ox. 2. He had loosed from a
   disease instead of from a comfortable stall. 3. He had relieved a
   waiting of eighteen years' standing instead of one of some few hours'
   duration--the brief time since the watering of the morning. He mentions
   the woman's descent from Abraham because, according to their ideas, it
   made her worthy of every consideration. In attributing the infirmity to
   Satan he acknowledges the action of the demon as Satan's agent. Disease
   were not infrequently ascribed to Satan and the demons--Acts x. 38; II.
   Cor. xii. 7.] 17 And as he said these things, all his adversaries were
   put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious
   things that were done by him. [The people rejoiced not only in the
   miracle, but in that wisdom which silenced the narrow-minded rulers.
   The triumph which they rejoiced in was but a slight foretaste of the
   victories to come, and to point out the nature of those victories the
   Lord spoke the two parables which follow.] 18 He said therefore, Unto
   what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it? 19 It
   is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into
   his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the
   heaven lodged in the branches thereof. 20 And again he said, Whereunto
   shall I liken the kingdom of God? 21 It is like unto leaven, which a
   woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.

Feast of the Dedication. The Jews Attempt to Stone Jesus and He Retires to
PerÆa.

(Jerusalem and Beyond Jordan.)

^D John X. 22-42.

   ^d 22 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: 23; it was
   winter; and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. [The feast
   of dedication was one of eight days' duration and began upon the 25th
   Chisleu, which, according to the calculation of M. Chevannes, fell upon
   the nineteenth or twentieth of December, a.d. 29. The feast was kept in
   honor of the renovation and purification of the temple in the year b.c.
   164, after it had been desecrated by the Syrians under Antiochus
   Epiphanes (I. Macc. i. 20-60; iv. 36-59; II. Macc. x. 1-8; Jos. Ant.
   xii. 7. 6, 7). As this feast was commemorative of national deliverance,
   the rulers considered it an opportune time to tempt Jesus to declare
   himself to be the Messiah, or coming Deliverer from the present Roman
   oppression. We are told that it was winter, that we may understand why
   Jesus walked under cover in Solomon's porch. This was a colonnade on
   the east side of the temple court, the name probably being derived from
   the wall against which it was built, which Josephus tells us was the
   work of Solomon--Jos. Ant. xx. 9. 7.] 24 The Jews therefore came round
   about him [as if to detain him until he answered], and said unto him,
   How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us
   plainly. [The previous conduct and temper of the questioners, together
   with the context (which includes an attempt to stone, followed by an
   effort to arrest), shows that this question was asked for the purpose
   of committing Jesus to an open declaration which might be used as an
   accusation against him.] 25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye
   believe not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear
   witness of me. [Jesus was the Christ of the Old Testament, but not the
   Christ of Pharisaic hopes. Had he assumed to himself in their presence
   the title of Christ, it would have led them to false expectations. By
   his declarations and works Jesus had repeatedly published and proved to
   all his claims to be the true Messiah. He had, at the feast of
   tabernacles, set himself forth as the Good Shepherd, and on other
   occasions as the Son of God, etc. (John v. 19; viii. 36, 56). Had they
   understood or received the Old Testament ideal of the Messiah, they
   could not have failed to understand his claims.] 26 But ye believe not,
   because ye are not of my sheep. [Failure to be Christ's sheep was not
   the cause, but the evidence of their unbelief.] 27 My sheep hear my
   voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 28 and I give unto them
   eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them
   out of my hand. [The thought here is similar to to that set forth on
   pp. 469, 470.] 29 My Father, who hath given them me, is greater than
   all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. [This
   passage is taken by Calvinists as asserting the doctrine of the
   impossibility of apostacy. It is certainly a strong assurance that the
   Christian may expect to succeed in fighting the good fight. It may be
   taken in connection with Rom. viii. 38, 39; but both passages must be
   interpreted in the light of Heb. vi. 4-8. We can not be taken from God
   against our will; but our will being free, we may choose to leave him.
   We can not be protected against ourselves in spite of ourselves. If
   that were so, no one could be lost.] 30 I and the Father are one. [This
   assertion as to the unity of power residing in the hand brings forward
   the idea of the general unity which subsists between the Father and the
   Son. This unity Jesus asserts fully, without limitation or restriction;
   the unity of interest, design, and essence are all included. It is the
   advance from an assertion of special unity to an assertion of general
   unity.] 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. [They
   prepared to act on Lev. xxiv. 14-16, and a precedent as to it found at
   I. Kings xxi. 10; though the right to stone for blasphemy was now
   abrogated by the Roman dominion. The repairs and enlargements then
   going on in the temple no doubt supplied an abundance of missiles. The
   word "again" refers back to John viii. 59.] 32 Jesus answered them,
   Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those
   works do ye stone me? 33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work
   we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
   man, makest thyself God. [Jesus, conscious that he was living the
   divine life, endeavored to arouse the Jews to a consciousness of that
   life by asking them to point out what part of it offended them. It was
   a demand that his claim to be divine be tested and judged by his life.
   But the Jews insisted upon judging him by his words without in any way
   taking his life into account. Jesus urged that a divine claim was made
   good by a divine life, but they replied that a divine claim issuing
   from a human body was blasphemy.] 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not
   written in your law [Ps. lxxxii. 6. The whole Old Testament not
   infrequently is thus designated as the "law"], I said, Ye are gods? 35
   If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the
   scripture cannot be broken), 36 say ye of him, whom the Father
   sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I
   am the Son of God? [Since the civil rulers of a land are ordained of
   God (Rom. xiii. 1-7 I. Sam. xxiv. 6, 7), they were regarded as God's
   delegates or ministers, and as such the inspired Psalmist addresses
   them, calling them gods. Compare also Ex. xxii. 28. If it was not
   blasphemy to call those gods who so remotely represented the Deity, how
   much less did Christ blaspheme in taking unto himself a title to which
   he had a better right than they, even in the subordinate sense of being
   a mere messenger. The expression "word of God" is equivalent to
   "commission from God." Compare Luke iii. 2, where John was
   commissioned. The Jews regarded the Scripture as final authority. Jesus
   asserted this view by stating that the Scripture could not be broken;
   that is, could not be undone or set aside. We may regard Jesus as here
   ratifying their view, since he elsewhere concurred in it--see Matt. v.
   19.] 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 38 But if I
   do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know
   and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. [Having
   set aside their false judgment which was based upon his mere words,
   Jesus again bids them to consider his works or manner of life.] 39 They
   sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand. [The
   calm reasoning of Jesus cooled their violence, and so far changed their
   evil designs that they now sought to arrest him that they might bring
   him before the Sanhedrin. The word "again" refers back to John vii. 30,
   32, 44.] 40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place
   where John was at first baptizing; and there he abode. [The word
   "again" either refers to John i. 28, or else it refers to some former
   escape beyond the Jordan not recorded by John, but by one of the other
   evangelists. The supplementary nature of John's Gospel makes this
   latter view somewhat plausible.] 41 And many came unto him; and they
   said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of
   this man were true. [John at first baptized "in the wilderness of
   Judæa" and afterwards at Bethany and Ænon. The presence of Jesus in
   this place recalled to the minds of the people the work of the Baptist
   and his testimony concerning Jesus. They had held John to be a prophet,
   yet when they searched for his credentials as a prophet, they found
   them inextricably intertwined with the claims of Jesus. John had failed
   to prove himself a prophet by miracles and signs--the accustomed
   credentials. But he had done so by his predictions which had come true,
   and all of these predictions related to Jesus.] 42 And many believed on
   him there. [The word "there" stands in contrast to Jerusalem, which
   rejected Jesus.]

The Strait Gate. Warned Against Herod.

(Peræa.)

^C Luke XIII. 22-35.

   ^c 22 And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and
   journeying on unto Jerusalem. [This verse probably refers back to verse
   10, and indicates that Jesus resumed his journey after the brief rest
   on the Sabbath day when he healed the woman with the curvature of the
   spine.] 23 And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved?
   [It is likely that this question was asked by a Jew, and that the two
   parables illustrating the smallness of the kingdom's beginning
   suggested it to him. The Jews extended their exclusive spirit even to
   their ideals of a world to come, so that they believed none but the
   chosen race would behold its glories. The circumstances attending to
   the conversion of Cornelius, recorded in Acts, show how this
   exclusiveness survived even among Jewish Christians. The questioner
   wished Jesus to commit himself to this narrow Jewish spirit, or else to
   take a position which would subject him to the charge of being
   unpatriotic.] And he said unto them, 24 Strive [literally, agonize] to
   enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to
   enter in, and shall not be able. [Jesus answers that many shall be
   excluded from the kingdom, and that the questioner, and all others who
   hear, need to exercise themselves and give the matter their own
   personal attention lest they be among that many. The passage should be
   compared with that in Matthew, p. 266. There one enters by a narrow
   gate upon a narrow road, indicating the strictness of the Christian
   life. Here one enters by a narrow door upon a season of festivity,
   indicating the joyous privileges of a Christian life.] 25 When once the
   master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye
   begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to
   us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are
   [This verse gives the reason why one should strive to enter in. The
   time for entrance is limited, and he must get in before it expires; for
   when the limited time has passed, he can not enter, no matter how
   earnestly he may seek or strive. Our Lord pictures a householder who
   refuses to receive any guest that has shown contempt for his feast by
   coming late. The strict spirit of the Lord in giving his invitation is
   indicated by the phrase "narrow door," but the phrase includes more
   than this, for those who would strive must not only be prompt to act,
   but must be painstaking so as to act intelligently, and of obedient
   spirit so as to act acceptably]; 26 then ye shall begin to say [in
   answer to the Lord's statement that he does not know them], We did eat
   and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets [Thus
   they idly urged their privileges to him who was condemning them for
   having neglected to make a proper use of those privileges. Had these
   privileges been valued and improved, the clamoring outcasts would have
   been inside and not outside the door]; 27 and he shall say, I tell you,
   I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
   [Thus pleading avails not. The door would not be narrow if it opened to
   excuses.] 28 There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when
   ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
   the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without. [See pp. 273 and
   274.] 29 And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north
   and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. [See p. 273.] 30
   And behold [little as you may think it] , there are last who shall be
   first, and there are first who shall be last. [A familiar proverb of
   Christ's (Matt. xix. 30; xx. 10), to be interpreted by such passages as
   Matt. xxi. 31 and Rom. ix. 30, 31. The Jew who thought the Gentile had
   no hope at all, and that he himself was sure of salvation, would be
   surprised to find that his opinion was the very reverse of the real
   fact as time developed it.] 31 In that very hour there came certain
   Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would
   fain kill thee. [This shows that Jesus was in the territory of Herod
   Antipas, and hence probably in Peræa. The Pharisees, no doubt, wished
   to scare Jesus that they might exult over his fright. We might suppose,
   too, that their words were untrue, were it not that Jesus sends a reply
   to Herod. Herod long desired to see Jesus (Luke ix. 9; xxiii. 8), but
   it was not likely that he desired to put him to death. He was,
   doubtless, glad enough to get Jesus out of his territory, lest he might
   foment an uprising, and to this end he employed this strategy of
   sending messengers to warn Jesus under the guise of friendship.] 32 And
   he said unto them, Go and say to that fox [i.e., say to that crafty,
   sly fellow. The fox is a type of craftiness and treachery. We have no
   other instance where Jesus used such a contemptuous expression; but
   Herod richly merited it. An Idumæan by his father, a Samaritan by his
   mother, a Jew by profession, and a heathen by practice, he had need to
   be foxy by nature. And he was even now playing the fox by sending these
   messengers], Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and
   to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected. 33 Nevertheless [although
   I know what lies before me] I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow
   and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
   Jerusalem. [Wieseler, Meyer, Alford, and other able commentators think
   that the days mentioned in this difficult passage are literal days. If
   the language is to be thus construed, the saying amounts to a promise
   to leave Herod's territory in three days. Such construction, however,
   is not consistent with the elevation of the sentiment and the solemnity
   of its repetition. Three days are thus sometimes used proverbially to
   designate a short time (Hos. vi. 2), and they are unquestionably so
   used here. The meaning then is this: "For a little while I liberate and
   heal and abide in your territory to disturb your peace. But in a few
   days I shall be perfected in my office as a liberator and healer, after
   which I shall be seen no more in your territory. And though I
   understand these plots against me, I must fill up my time and go on my
   course till I suffer martyrdom at Jerusalem, which has the gruesome
   honor of being the prophet-slaying city." This word "perfected" in this
   passage finds its complement in the "It is finished" of John xix. 30.
   Both the verbs are derived from the Greek word telos, which means end
   or completion. Compare also II. Cor. xii. 9; Phil. iii. 12; Heb. ii.
   10; v. 8, 9; xi. 40. John the Baptist having perished at Machærus in
   Peræa is regarded as an exception to this rule and the prophets die at
   Jerusalem. The exception does not disprove the rule, if it be a true
   exception; which may be questioned, since John died at the hands of
   Herod and Herodias, neither of whom were, properly speaking Jews. John,
   therefore, died as a prophet to foreigners rather than as a prophet to
   the Jewish people.] 34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the
   prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I
   have gathered thy children [inhabitants] together, even as a hen
   gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye would not! [Jesus
   repeated these words again as recorded in Matt. xxiii. 37-39. With such
   beautiful imagery does Jesus set forth his tender love for the people
   of that city which he knew would soon compass his death.] 35 Behold,
   your house [temple] is left unto you desolate [he was about to withdraw
   from the temple, which for centuries to come was to be visited by no
   heavenly messenger whatever]: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me,
   until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
   [It is hardly possible that these words can refer to the triumphal
   entry for their fulfillment (Matt. xxi. 9 ). The use of them on that
   occasion may have had no reference to his prediction. They undoubtedly
   refer to the Parousia, or second coming of the Lord in his glory,
   before which time the Jews must turn and believe (Rom. xi. 25-27). Not
   until they were thus prepared would they again see him without whom
   they were now rejecting.]

XC.

Dining with a Pharisee. Sabbath Healing and Three Lessons Suggested by the
Event.

(Probably Peræa.)

^C Luke XIV. 1-24.

   ^c 1 And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the
   rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were
   watching him. [The Pharisees were an unorganized party, hence their
   rulers were such not by office, but by influence. Those who were
   members of the Sanhedrin, or who were distinguished among the rabbis,
   might fitly be spoken of as rulers among them. The context favors the
   idea that Jesus was invited for the purpose of being watched--a
   carrying out of the Pharisaic purpose declared at Luke xi. 53, 54.
   Bountiful feasts on the Sabbath day were common among the Jews; the
   food, however, was cooked the previous day in obedience to the precept
   at Ex. xvi. 23.] 2 And behold, there was before him a certain man that
   had the dropsy. [The phrase "let him go" of verse 4 shows that the man
   was not a guest, but rather one who seems to have taken advantage of
   the freedom of an Oriental house to stand among the lookers-on. He may
   have been there purely from his own choice, but the evil intention with
   which Jesus was invited makes it highly probable that the man's
   presence was no accident, but part of a deep-laid plot to entrap
   Jesus.] 3 And Jesus answering [replying to their unspoken thoughts, in
   which they were assuming that he would heal the sick man] spake unto
   the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath,
   or not? 4 And they held their peace. [They evidently expected Jesus to
   act on the impulse, and were confused by his calm, deliberate question.
   If they declared it lawful, they defeated their plot, and if they said
   otherwise, they involved themselves in an argument with him in which,
   as experience taught them, they would be humiliated before the people.
   Hence, they kept silence, but their silence only justified him, since
   it was the duty of every lawyer to pronounce this act unlawful if it
   had been so.] And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. 5 And he
   said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a
   well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day? 6 And they
   could not answer again unto these things. [Here Jesus again asserts
   that the Sabbath law did not forbid acts of mercy. See pp. 212, 213,
   215. Though silenced, the Pharisees relented not, either as to their
   bigotry or their hatred.] 7 And he spake a parable unto those that were
   bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats [The
   triclinia, or Grecian table, then in use had three sections which were
   placed together so as to form a flat-bottomed letter U. The space
   enclosed by the table was not occupied. It was left vacant that the
   servants might enter it and attend to the wants of the guests who
   reclined around the outer margin of the table. The central seat of each
   of these three sections were deemed a place of honor. This struggle for
   precedence was a small ambition, but many of the ambitions of our day
   are equally small] ; saying unto them, 8 When thou art bidden of any
   man to a marriage feast [Jesus mentions another kind of feast than the
   one in progress, that he may not be needlessly personal], sit not down
   in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man [Phil. ii. 3] than
   thou be bidden of him, 9 and he that bade thee and him shall come and
   say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame
   to take the lowest place. [Because when ousted from the top he would
   find every place full except the bottom.] 10 But when thou art bidden,
   go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee
   cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have
   glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee. [The words
   here used by our Lord teach how to avoid earthly shame and to obtain
   worldly honor. But they form a parable which is intended to teach the
   great spiritual truth that true humility leads to exaltation.] 11 For
   everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth
   himself shall be exalted. [This is one of our Lord's favorite maxims
   (Luke xviii. 14; Matt. xxiii. 12). Both man and God look upon
   humiliation as the just punishment of pride; but it is a pleasure to
   every right-minded spirit to give joy to the humble by showing him
   respect and honor.] 12 And he said to him also that had bidden him,
   When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
   brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid
   thee again, and a recompense be made thee. 13 But when thou makest a
   feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 14 and thou shalt
   be blessed; for they have not wherewith to recompense thee: for thou
   shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just. [According to the
   Oriental mode of speech Jesus here emphatically commands one course of
   action by prohibiting a contrary course. But his prohibition is not to
   be construed strictly. He does not forbid the exercise of social
   hospitality, but discountenances that interested form of it which seeks
   a return. His teaching is positive rather than negative, and should
   constrain us to live more for charity and less for sociability. Some
   think that this verse teaches that there shall be two resurrections,
   but the contrast is not between two times, but rather between two
   parties or divisions of one resurrection. If one has part in the
   resurrection of the just, he may expect recompense for his most trivial
   act. But if he be resurrected among the unjust, he need expect no
   reward, even for the most meritorious deeds of his whole life.] 15 And
   when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said
   unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
   [The language of Christ implied that God himself would feast those who
   feasted the poor, and this implication accorded with the Jewish notion
   that the kingdom of God would be ushered in with a great festival.
   Inspired by this thought, and feeling confident that he should have
   been part of the festivities, this guest exclaimed upon the anticipated
   blessedness.] 16 But he said unto him, A certain man made a great
   supper; and he bade many: 17 And he sent forth his servant at supper
   time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now
   ready. [The custom of sending a second invitation at the supper hour is
   a very old one ( Esth. v. 8; vi. 14), and is still observed.] 18 And
   they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto
   him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray
   thee have me excused. 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of
   oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused. 20 And
   another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
   [These three excuses show: 1. That the guests had made their
   engagements, either for business or pleasure, without the least regard
   for the hour of the banquet; 2. That they set little value upon either
   the friendship or the feast of the one who had invited them. Moreover,
   the excuses progress in disrespect, for the first excuse is on the
   ground of necessity, the second simply offers a reason, and the third
   is almost impudent in its bluntness. Viewing the excuses spiritually,
   we note that each one contains an element of newness--new field, new
   oxen, new wife. Thus the things of the earth seem new and sweet in
   comparison with the gospel invitation. Again, all the excuses are
   trifling, for the parable is intended to teach that men forego their
   rights to heaven for trifles. Again, the "sacred hate" of Luke xiv. 25,
   26 would have eliminated all these excuses. Possibly Paul had this
   parable in mind when he wrote I. Cor. vii. 29-33. The three excuses
   warn us not to be hindered by 1. the love of possessions; 2. the
   affairs of business; 3. Our social ties.] 21 And the servant came, and
   told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry
   said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the
   city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. 22
   And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet
   there is room. 23 And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the
   highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may
   be filled. 24 For I say unto you, that none of those men that were
   bidden shall taste of my supper. [We have a preliminary or general
   invitation followed by three special invitations. We may regard the
   general invitation as given by Moses and the prophets in the ages
   before the feast was prepared. Then the first special one would be
   given by John the Baptist and Christ to the Jewish nation in the first
   stages of Christ's ministry. The second special invitation was given by
   Christ, the twelve and the seventy, and came more especially to the
   poor and outcast, the publicans and sinners, because the leading men of
   the nation spurned the invitation. The third invitation was begun by
   the apostles after the Lord's ascension and is still borne forward by
   those who have come after them and includes all nations. The three
   conditions of Jew, outcast and Gentiles are indicated by the three
   orders of guests: 1. The honorable citizens of the city; 2. Those who
   frequent the streets and lanes, but are still in and out of the city;
   3. Those who live without the city and are found upon the highways and
   in the hedgepaths of the vineyards and gardens. The second and third
   classes are depicted as needing to be constrained. This would be so,
   because they would hold themselves unworthy of the invitation. But they
   were to be constrained by moral and not by physical means ( Matt. xiv.
   22; II. Cor. xii. 11; Gal. ii. 14). Physical constraint would have been
   contrary to all custom, as well as impossible to one servant.
   Incidentally the parable shows the roominess of heaven and the
   largeness of divine hospitality, so that Bengel aptly observes, "Grace,
   no less than nature, abhors a vacuum."]

Cost of Discipleship Must Be Counted.

(Probably Peræa.)

^C Luke XIV. 25-35.

   ^c 25 Now there went with him great multitudes [he had hitherto spent
   but little time in Peræa, and the people were availing themselves of
   this opportunity to see and hear him]: and he turned, and said unto
   them, 26 If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and
   mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his
   own life also, he cannot be my disciple. ["Hateth," as used here, is an
   example of phenomenal speech, or speaking from appearances. In the
   cases supposed, the person would appear to hate those whom he abandoned
   for Christ. It is like repent, anger, etc., when spoken of God. To
   construe the passage literally as enjoining hatred would be contrary to
   the fifth commandment as re-enacted at Eph. vi. 1-3 and Col. iii. 20;
   and also contrary to our Lord's own example (John xix. 25-27). Seeing
   the number of those adherents which now surrounded him, Jesus made use
   of this striking statement that he might startle each hearer, and
   impress upon him the wide difference between a mere outward appearance
   upon him and a real, disciple-like adhesion to him. The latter requires
   that we be ready to sacrifice all, even our animal life, in so far as
   it tends to separate from Christ--Rom. xii. 11; Acts xx. 24.] 27 And
   whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my
   disciple. [Christ must be followed and imitated even to the extremity
   of suffering. The costliness of discipleship is illustrated in the two
   brief parables which follow.] 28 For which of you, desiring to build a
   tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have
   wherewith to complete it? 29 Lest haply, when he hath laid the
   foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock
   him, 30 saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
   [Discipleship is character-building, and shame awaits him who attempts
   to be a Christian and fails to live up to his profession. Unless his
   tower rises to the heavenly heights to which it aspired, it is but a
   Babel at last. The parable is not intended to discourage anyone from
   attempting to be a disciple. It is meant to warn us against attempting
   so great an undertaking with the frivolity of spirit and want of
   determination which insure failure.] 31 Or what king, as he goeth to
   encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take
   counsel, whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh
   against him with twenty thousand? 32 Or else, while the other is yet a
   great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.
   [Is the adversary here God or the devil? As warring against God is no
   part of discipleship, it might seem that the conflict was with Satan.
   But the case supposed is that of a man who, after counting the cost, is
   about to decline taking up his cross--about to rebel against the claims
   of God. But while in this rebellious state he sees a superior force
   coming against him. This superior force can not be the devil's, for
   Jesus could not counsel any to make peace with him, as the parable
   advises. The superior force, then, is God's, and the lesson here is
   that however fearful the task of being a disciple may be, it is not so
   dreadful as to fight against God. As soon as the hesitating man takes
   in his thought, he will immediately take up the cross which he was
   about to refuse.] 33 So therefore whosoever he be of you that
   renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. [The tower
   can not be built by him who spends his time or squanders his money on
   other enterprises, nor can the peace be maintained by one who does not
   fully renounce his rebellion.] 34 Salt therefore is good: but if even
   the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? 35 It is
   fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: men cast it out. [Our
   Lord twice before used such language. See pp. 234, 433. Salt is here
   used as a symbol of perseverance. The condition of those who begin the
   Christian life and fail to persevere is dangerous in the extreme--Heb.
   vi. 4-12; x. 26-39.] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. [See p.
   330.]

Introduction.

^C Luke XV. 1, 2.

   ^c 1 Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing hear unto him to
   hear. 2 And both the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
   receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. [For publicans see p. 76, and
   for eating with them see p. 349. The Pharisees classed as "sinners" all
   who failed to observe the traditions of the elders, and especially
   their traditional rules of purification. It was not so much the
   wickedness of this class as their legal uncleanness that made it wrong
   to eat with them. Compare Gal. ii. 12, 13. In answer to their
   murmuring, Jesus spoke three parables, in which he set forth the
   yearnings of redemptive love. Having thus replied to the Pharisees,
   Jesus continued his discourse, adding two other parables, concerning
   the right employment of worldly goods, and ending with some teaching
   concerning offenses, etc. We defer comparing the parables until we have
   discussed them.]

Parable of the Lost Sheep.

^C Luke XV. 3-7.

   ^c 3 And he spake unto them this parable [Jesus had spoken this parable
   before. See pp. 434, 435.] saying, 4 What man of you [man is emphatic;
   it is made so to convey the meaning that if man would so act, how much
   more would God so act], having an hundred sheep [a large flock], and
   having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the
   wilderness [the place of pasture, and hence the proper place to leave
   them], and go after that which is lost, until he find it? [The
   ninety-nine represent the Jewish respectability, and the lost sheep
   stands for a soul which has departed from that respectability.] 5 And
   when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. [A
   touch suggesting the weakness of the sheep and the willing affection of
   the shepherd.] 6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his
   friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me [Heb. xii.
   2], for I have found my sheep which was lost. [The call implies that
   the loss was known to the neighbors, and that they felt concerned about
   it. Had the Pharisees been neighbors to the spirit of Christ, they
   would have sympathized with him in his joy; but they were false
   undershepherds-- Ezek. xxxiv.] 7 I say unto you, that even so there
   shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
   ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance. [How little
   Jesus thought of external morality may be seen by his words at Luke
   xviii. 9, but he here quoted the Pharisees at their own valuation to
   show that even when so doing, God's love for the sinner was the
   paramount love.]

Parable of the Lost Coin.

^C Luke XV. 8-10.

   ^c 8 Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
   doth not light a lamp [because oriental houses are commonly without
   windows, and therefore dark], and sweep the house, and seek diligently
   until she find it? 9 And when she hath found it, she calleth together
   her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I
   have found the piece which I had lost. [The drachma, or piece of
   silver, corresponded to the Latin denarius, and was worth about
   seventeen cents. The woman, having only ten of them, was evidently
   poor. Such small coin have been for centuries worn by oriental women as
   a sort of ornamental fringe around the forehead. The phrase "until she
   find it," which is practically repeated in both parables, is a sweet
   source of hope; but it is not to be pressed so as to contradict other
   Scripture.] 10 Even so, I say unto you, there is joy [Ezek. xxxiii. 11]
   in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
   [By thus reaffirming the heavenly joy, Jesus sought to shame the
   Pharisees out of their cold-blooded murmuring.]

Parable of the Lost Son.

^C Luke XV. 11-32.

   ^c 11 And he said, A certain man had two sons [These two sons represent
   the professedly religious (the elder) and the openly irreligious (the
   younger). They have special reference to the two parties found in the
   first two verses of this chapter --the Pharisees, the publicans and
   sinners]: 12 and the younger of them [the more childish and easily
   deceived] said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy
   substance that falleth to me. [Since the elder brother received a
   double portion, the younger brother's part would be only one-third of
   the property--Deut. xxi. 17.] And he divided unto them his living.
   [Abraham so divided his estate in his lifetime (Gen. xxv. 1-6); but the
   custom does not appear to have been general among the Jews. God,
   however, gives gifts and talents to us all, so the parable fits the
   facts of life--Ps. cxlv. 9; Matt. v. 45; Acts x. 34.] 13 And not many
   days after [with all haste], the younger son gathered all together and
   took his journey into a far country. [He yearned for the spurious
   liberty of a land where he would be wholly independent of his father.
   Thus the sinful soul seeks to escape from the authority of God]; and
   there he wasted his substance with riotous living. [Sin now indulges
   itself with unbridled license, and the parable depicts the sinner's
   course: his season of indulgences (vs. 12, 13); his misery (vs. 14-16);
   his repentance (vs. 17-20); his forgiveness (vs. 20-24).] 14 And when
   he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he
   began to be in want. [Sooner or later sinful practices fail to satisfy,
   and the sense of famine and want mark the crises in our lives as they
   did in the life of the prodigal. The direst famine is that of the word
   of God--Amos viii. 11-13; Jer. ii. 13.] 15 And he went and joined
   [literally, glued] himself to one of the citizens of that country; and
   he sent him into his fields to feed [literally, to pasture or tend]
   swine. [This was, to the Jew, the bottom of degradation's pit. They so
   abhorred swine that they refused to name them. They spoke of a pig as
   dabhar acheer; i. e., "the other thing."] 16 And he would fain have
   filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave
   unto him. [The master upon whom he had forced himself did not deem his
   services worthy of enough food to sustain life; so that he would gladly
   have eaten the husks or pods of the carob bean, which are very similar
   to our honey-locust pods, if they would have satisfied his hunger.] 17
   But when he came to himself [his previous state had been one of
   delusion and semi-madness (Eccl. ix. 3); in it his chief desire had
   been to get away from home, but returning reason begets a longing to
   return thither] he said, How many hired servants of my father's have
   bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 18 I will
   arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned
   against heaven, and in thy sight: 19 I am no more worthy to be called
   thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. [The humility of his
   confession indicates that the term "riotous living" means more than
   merely a reckless expenditure of money. But vile as he was he trusted
   that his father's love was sufficient to do something for him.] 20 And
   he arose, and came to his father. [Repentance is here pictured as a
   journey. It is more than a mere emotion or impulse.] But while he was
   yet afar off, his father saw him [being evidently on the lookout for
   him], and was moved with compassion [seeing his ragged, pitiable
   condition], and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. [Giving him
   as warm a welcome as if he had been a model son.] 21 And the son said
   unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am
   no more worthy to be called thy son. [The son shows a manly spirit in
   adhering to his purpose to make a confession, notwithstanding the
   warmth of his father's welcome; in grieving for what he had done, and
   not for what he had lost; and in blaming no one but himself.] 22 But
   the father said to his servants [interrupting the son in his
   confession], Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and
   put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet [none but servants went
   barefooted]: 23 and bring the fatted calf [which, according to Eastern
   custom, was held in readiness for some great occasion (Gen. xviii. 7;
   I. Sam. xxviii. 24; II. Sam. vi. 13 ), and which some custom still
   exists], and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry [the robe, ring,
   etc., are merely part of the parabolic drapery, and are so many sweet
   assurances of full restoration and forgiveness, and are not to be
   pressed beyond this]: 24 for this my son was dead, and is alive again;
   he was lost, and is found. [The condition of the impenitent sinner is
   frequently expressed in the Bible under the metaphor of death--Rom. vi.
   13; Eph. ii. 1; v. 14; Rev. iii. 1.] And they began to be merry.
   [Having thus finished his account of the openly irreligious, Jesus now
   turns to portray that of the professedly religious; i. e., he turns
   from the publican to the Pharisee. He paints both parties as alike
   children of God, as both faulty and sinful in his sight, and each as
   being loved despite his faultiness. But while the story of the elder
   son had a present and local application to the Pharisees, it is to be
   taken comprehensively as describing all the self-righteous who murmur
   at and refuse to take part in the conversion of sinners.] 25 Now his
   elder son was in the field [at work]: and as he came and drew nigh to
   the house, he heard music and dancing. [He heard evidences of joy, a
   joy answering to that mentioned at verses 7 and 10; the joy of angels
   in seeing the publicans and sinners repenting and being received by
   Jesus--the joy at which the Pharisees had murmured.] 26 And he called
   to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be. 27
   And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed
   the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 28 But he
   was angry, and would not go in [he refused to be a party to such a
   proceeding]: and his father came out, and entreated him. [In the
   entreating father Jesus pictures the desire and effort of God then and
   long afterwards put forth to win the proud, exclusive, self-righteous
   spirits which filled the Pharisees and other Jews-- Luke xiii. 34; Acts
   xiii. 44-46; xxviii. 22-28.] 29 But he answered and said to his father,
   Lo, these many years do I serve thee [literally, I am thy slave], and I
   never transgressed a commandment of thine [He speaks with the true
   Pharisaic spirit (Luke xviii. 11, 12; Rom. iii. 9). His justification
   was as proud as the prodigal's confession was humble]; and yet thou
   never gavest me a kid [much less a calf], that I might make merry with
   my friends [he reckons as a slave, so much pay for so much work, and
   his complaint suggests that he might have been as self-indulgent as his
   brother had he not been restrained by prudence]: 30 but when this thy
   son [he thus openly disclaims him as a brother] came, who hath devoured
   thy living with harlots [and not decent friends such as mine], thou
   hast killed for him the fatted calf. 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou
   art ever with me [a privilege which the elder brother had counted as
   naught, or rather as slavery], and all that is mine is thine. [See Rom.
   ix. 4, 5. The younger brother had the shoes, etc., but the elder still
   had the inheritance.] 32 But it was meet to make merry and be glad
   [Acts xi. 18]: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and
   was lost and is found. [Here the story ends. We are not told how the
   elder brother acted, but we may read his history in that of the Jews
   who refused to rejoice with Jesus in the salvation of sinners. At the
   next Passover they carried their resentment against him to the point of
   murder, and some forty years later the inheritance was taken from them.
   Thus we see that the elder brother was not pacified by the father. He
   continued to rebel against the father's will till he himself became the
   lost son. A comparison of the three preceding parables brings out many
   suggestive points, thus: The first parable illustrates Christ's
   compassion. A sentient, suffering creature is lost, and it was bad for
   it that it should be so. Hence it must be sought, though its value is
   only one out of a hundred. Man's lost condition makes him wretched. The
   second parable shows us how God values a soul. A lifeless piece of
   metal is lost, and while it could not be pitied, it could be valued,
   and since its value was one out ten, it was bad for the owner that it
   should be lost. God looks upon man's loss as his impoverishment. The
   first two parables depict the efforts of Christ in the salvation of
   man, or that side of conversion more apparent, so to speak, to God;
   while the third sets forth the responsive efforts put forth by man to
   avail himself of God's salvation--the side of conversion more apparent
   to us. Moreover, as the parabolic figures become more nearly literal,
   as we pass from sheep and coin to son, the values also rise, and
   instead of one from a hundred, or one from ten, we have one out of
   two!]

Parable of the Unrighteous Steward.

^C Luke XVI. 1-18.

   ^c 1 And he said also unto the disciples [If we remember that many
   publicans were now taking their stand among Jesus' disciples, we will
   more readily understand why Jesus addressed to them a parable about an
   unjust man. They would be more readily affected by such a story], There
   was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused
   unto him that he was wasting his goods. ["Wasting" of this verse and
   "wasted" of Luke xv. 13 are parts of the same verb. The attitude of the
   two brethren to their father's estate, as set forth in the previous
   parable, introduced thoughts as to the proper relation which a man
   bears to his possessions, and these relations Jesus discusses in this
   parable. While no parable has been so diversely explained, yet the
   trend of interpretation has been in the main satisfactory. In verse 8
   the Lord himself gives the key to the parable, which is that the
   children of light, in the conduct of their affairs, should emulate the
   wisdom and prudence of the children of the world in the conduct of
   their affairs. The difficulty of the parable is more apparent than
   real. The whole parabolic machinery is borrowed from worldly and
   irreligious life, where dishonest cunning and rascality are freely
   tolerated. The child of light is equally shrewd and wise in the
   management of his affairs; using, however, only those means and methods
   which are permissible in his sphere of action. God's word, of course,
   nowhere teaches the absurdity that sinful methods are permitted to him
   whom it calls to lead a sinless life. While the steward's conduct
   teaches valuable lessons, the steward himself is condemned as an
   "unrighteous" man in verse 8 .] 2 And he called him, and said unto him,
   What is this that I hear of thee? [an indignant expression of surprise
   arising from abused confidence] render the account of thy stewardship;
   for thou canst be no longer steward. [Ordinarily the stewards were
   slaves; but this was evidently a free man, for he was neither punished
   nor sold, but discharged.] 3 And the steward said within himself, What
   shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I
   have not strength to dig [Being too weak in body because of my
   luxurious living. Digging refers generally to agricultural labor]; to
   beg I am ashamed. [Being too strong in pride because of my exalted
   manner of life.] 4 I am resolved what to do [a way of escape comes to
   him in a sudden flash of discovery], that, when I am put out of the
   stewardship, they [my lord's debtors] may receive me into their houses.
   5 And calling to him each of his lord's debtors, he said to the first,
   How much owest thou unto my lord? 6 And he said, A hundred measures of
   oil. [The measure mentioned here is the Hebrew bath, which corresponded
   roughly to a firkin, or nine gallons.] And he said unto him, Take thy
   bond [literally, writings], and sit down quickly and write fifty. [The
   amount remitted here--450 gallons of olive oil--represented a large sum
   of money. Such a reduction would put the debtor under great obligation
   to the steward.] 7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?
   And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. [The measure here is the
   Hebrew cor, which contains ten baths, or ephahs, or, more exactly,
   eighty-six and seven-tenths gallons.] He saith unto him, Take thy bond,
   and write fourscore. [The amount remitted was about 267 bushels, and
   the debtor himself altered the writing, that he might be in no
   uncertainty about it. Scholars disagree as to whether these debtors
   were tenants or traders; i.e., purchasers of produce who had given
   their bonds or notes for the same. Meyer, Trench, Godet, and others
   favor this latter view, but the language used and the customs of the
   land rather indicate that the former is correct. In the East rents are
   in proportion to the crop, and hence they vary as it varies. It was
   natural, therefore, that the steward should ask the amount of the rent;
   and also natural, since rents were thus payable in kind, that the
   tenant should answer as to the very thing owed. A trader would have
   been held, not for the purchase, but for the price, and would rather
   have specified the money due than the quantity or thing bought. Since
   the price of produce varies, it has been the immemorial custom
   everywhere to fix the amount to be paid for it at the very time it is
   purchased, and this amount becomes the debt.] 8 And his lord commended
   the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely [shrewdly]: for the
   sons of this world are for their own generation [their own clan or
   class] wiser than the sons of light. [That is to say, the steward, a
   worldly-minded rascal, knew better how to deal with a worldly-minded
   master above him and dishonest tenants beneath him, than a son of light
   knows how to deal with the God over him and his needy brethren about
   him. The verse contrasts the sons of two households: the children of
   the worldly household exercise more forethought and prudence in gaining
   among their brethren friends for the day of need, and in expending
   money to that end, than do the children of the light. The "devil's
   martyrs," in their skillful prudence, often shame the saints. If the
   latter showed a wisdom in their affairs analogous to that which the
   unjust steward employed in his affairs, God would commend them as the
   lord commended the steward.] 9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves
   friends of the mammon of unrighteousness [see p. 257]; that, when it
   shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. [Worldly
   possession are the Christian's stewardship. If he has been wasting them
   in self-indulgence, he must take warning from the parable and so employ
   them in deeds of usefulness and mercy that, when the stewardship is
   taken from him, he may have obtained for himself a refuge for the
   future. But how can those whom the Christian has befriended receive him
   into heaven? The key to the difficulty is found at Matt. xxv. 35-40,
   where our Lord altogether identifies himself with his poor and
   unfortunate disciples, and returns on their behalf a heavenly
   recompense for any kindness which has been shown them on the earth.
   Only in this secondary and subordinate sense can those whom the
   Christian has benefited receive him into heaven. Nor does the passage
   teach that their is any merit in almsgiving, since the thing given is
   already the property of another (verse 12). Almsgiving is only a phase
   of the fidelity required of a steward, and the reward of a steward is
   not of merit but of grace--Luke xvii. 7-10; Matt. xxv. 21.] 10 He that
   is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is
   unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. [God does not
   judge by the magnitude of an act, but by the spiritual principles and
   motives which lie back of the act. A small action may discover and lay
   bare these principles quite as well as a large one. In the
   administration of small properties entrusted to us on the earth we
   reveal our disposition and temper as stewards quite as well as if we
   owned half the universe.] 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in
   the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
   [The word "unrighteous" is here used to mean deceitful, as opposed to
   true. Worldly riches deceive us by being temporal and transitory, while
   the true riches are eternal--II. Cor. iv. 18.] 12 And if ye have not
   been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which
   is your own? [We are all God's stewards, and the perishing possessions
   of earth are not our own (I. Chron. xxix. 14), but that which is given
   us forever is our own--I. Cor. iii. 22.] 13 No servant can serve two
   masters [Gal. i. 10; Jas. iv. 4]: for either he will hate the one, and
   love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye
   cannot serve God and mammon. [See p. 257.] 14 And the Pharisees, who
   were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.
   [They derided him with open insolence (Luke xxiii. 35). This was a new
   phase of their opposition, and showed that they no longer feared Jesus
   as formerly, being assured that he aimed at no earthly dominion.
   Because of his poverty they may have regarded him as prejudiced against
   wealth. At any rate, they regarded themselves as living contradictions
   of this to them ridiculous statement that a man could not be rich and
   yet religious.] 15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify
   yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: dor that
   which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. [The
   Pharisees lived in such outward contrast to the publicans and made such
   pretensions and claims that men esteemed them righteous, but they were
   none the less abominable in God's sight. God approves righteousness
   when inward, but despises the mere outward show of it.] 16 The law and
   the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom
   of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. [See p.
   283.] 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one
   tittle of the law to fall. [See page 236. The law and the prophets had
   been used of God to set up the old dispensation, and it had been so
   perverted and abused that in it the Pharisees could pass for righteous
   men, though abominable according to its true standard. Since the days
   of John the old dispensation has been merging into the new, and this
   also has been subjected to violence. But despite all the changes made,
   approved, and justified by men, the God-given law had never changed.
   Its smallest letter could no more be eliminated than the universe could
   be obliterated. But of course the Lawgiver could with notice modify his
   law.] 18 Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
   committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a
   husband committeth adultery. [See p. 242. This precept is inserted here
   as an illustration of a flagrant violation of the law of God both
   countenanced and practiced by these Pharisees.]

Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus.

^C Luke XVI. 19-31.

   [The parable we are about to study is a direct advance upon the
   thoughts in the previous section. We may say generally that if the
   parable of the unjust steward teaches how riches are to be used, this
   parable sets forth the terrible consequences of a failure to so use
   them. Each point of the previous discourse is covered in detail, as
   will be shown by the references in the discussion of the parable.] ^c
   19 Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and
   fine linen, faring sumptuously every day [For convenience' sake, this
   rich man has been commonly called Dives, which is simply Latin for rich
   man, and is therefore not truly a name, for it is not fitting to name
   him whom the Lord left nameless. Along the coast of Tyre there was
   found a rare shell-fish (Murex purpurarius) from which a costly purple
   dye was obtained, each little animal yielding about one drop of it.
   Woolen garments dyed with it were worn by kings and nobles, and idol
   images were sometimes arrayed in them. This purple robe formed the
   outer, and the linen the inner garment. The byssus, or fine linen of
   Egypt, was produced from flax, which grew on the banks of the Nile. It
   was dazzlingly white, and worth twice its weight in gold (Gen. xli. 42;
   Ex. xxvi. 31-33; xxviii. 5; I. Chron. xv. 27; Ezek. xxvii. 7). The
   mention of these garments and a continual banqueting indicates a life
   of extreme luxury.] 20 and a certain beggar [literally, one who
   crouches. It is used thirty-four times in the New Testament, and is
   everywhere translated "poor" save here and at Gal. iv. 9. In the last
   stages of life Lazarus had become an object of charity, but there is
   nothing to indicate that he had been an habitual beggar] named Lazarus
   [This is the only name which occurs in our Lord's parables. It is
   derived from Eleazar, which means, God a help. The name is symbolic of
   destitution, and many words indicative of beggary are derived from it]
   was laid at his gate [in the East the gates of the rich are still the
   resorts of the poor.] full of sores, 21 And desiring to be fed with the
   crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; yea, even the dogs come and
   licked his sores. [The contrast here is sharp. Lazarus is naked and
   clothed with sores instead of rich apparel, and desires crumbs instead
   of a banquet. That he limited his desire to crumbs suggests a freedom
   from both worldly lust and envy. Whether he got the crumbs is not
   stated. His sufferings may have been as unmitigated on earth as those
   of the rich man were in Hades (verse 24), and it is certain that even
   if he received the crumbs they did not count as a gift, being mere
   refuse, utterly worthless in the sight of the rich man. The very point
   of the parable is that the rich man gave him nothing. The dogs also
   suggest a contrast. The rich man is surrounded by loyal brethren and
   attentive servants, while Lazarus is the companion of dogs, the
   scavengers of the streets, who treat him with rude compassion as one of
   their number, soothing his sores with their saliva.] 22 And it came to
   pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels
   into Abraham's bosom [it is the office of angels to minister to the
   heirs of salvation--Matt. xxiv. 31; Mark xiii. 27; Heb. i. 14]: and the
   rich man also died, and was buried. [In death as well as in life the
   two men stand in contrast. The rich man passes from view with the pomp
   and pagentry of a burial (II. Chron. xvi. 13, 14), an earthly honor
   suited to a worldly life. But Lazarus passes hence with the angels, a
   spiritual triumph suited to one accepted of God.] 23 And in Hades, he
   lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth [Rev. xiv. 10] Abraham
   afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. [Hades (Greek), or Sheol (Hebrew),
   was the name given to the abode of the dead between death and the
   resurrection. In it the souls of the wicked are in torment, and those
   of the righteous enjoy a paradise (Luke xxiii. 43). The joys of
   Paradise were conceived of as those of a feast, and the expression
   "Abraham's bosom" is taken from the custom of reclining on couches at
   feasts. As a guest leaned upon his left arm, his neighbor on his left
   might easily lean upon his bosom. Such a position of respect to the
   master of the house was one of special honor, and indicated great
   intimacy (John i. 18; xiii. 23). What higher honor or joy could the Jew
   conceive of than such a condition of intimacy and fellowship with
   Abraham, the great founder of their race?--Matt. viii. 11.] 24 And he
   cried [in earnest entreaty] and said, Father Abraham [the claim of
   kindred is not denied, but it is unavailing-- Luke iii. 8], have mercy
   on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
   and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. [The smallness
   of the favor asked indicates the greatness of the distress, as it does
   in verse 21, where crumbs are desired. There is a reciprocity also
   between the desired crumbs and the prayed-for drop, which contains a
   covert reference to verses 4 and 5. Had the rich man given more he
   might now have asked for more. The friendship of Lazarus might have
   been easily won, and now the rich man needed that friendship, but he
   had neglected the principle set forth in verse 9, and had abused his
   stewardship by wasting his substance upon himself. Again, the former
   condition of each party is sharply reversed. Lazarus feasts at a better
   banquet, and the rich man begs because of a more dire and insatiable
   craving. Thus the life despised of men was honored by God, and (verse
   15) the man who was exalted among men is found to have been abominable
   unto God.] 25 But Abraham said, Son [a tender word--Josh. vii. 19],
   remember [Prov. v. 11-14] that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good
   things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here [where a
   different order pertains from that of the earth] he is comforted and
   thou art in anguish. [The woes received by Lazarus are not spoken of as
   his. He neither earned nor deserved them ( Rev. vii. 13-17). His was
   the stewardship of suffering (I. Cor. iv. 9; II. Cor. iv. 7 ), and in
   its small details he had shown great faithfulness. The rich man had the
   stewardship of wealth, with its accompanying obligation of generosity.
   This obligation he had esteemed as too contemptibly small to deserve
   his notice; but in neglecting it, he had inadvertently been unfaithful
   in much. See verse 10. This has been the sin of omission on the part of
   the rich man, and his sin of commission answered as a complement to it,
   for he had been guilty of that money-loving self-indulgence which was
   condemned by Jesus and justified by the Pharisees ( verses 14, 15). No
   other crime is charged against the rich man, yet he is found in
   torment. But the rich man during his lifetime had been so deceived by
   his wealth that he had failed to detect his sin. Moreover, as he
   indicates in verse 28, a like deception was now being practiced upon
   his brethren. Thus the parable justifies the term "unrighteous" which
   Jesus had given to mammon at verses 9, 11.] 26 And beside all this,
   between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would
   pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over
   from thence to us. [We have here a clear statement of the separation
   which parts the good from the evil in the future state. But it has been
   urged that the coloring and phraseology of this parable is derived from
   rabbinical teaching, that our Lord made use of a current but erroneous
   Jewish notion to teach a valuable lesson, and that therefore it is not
   safe to draw any inferences from the narrative relative to the future
   state. But it should be observed that the parables of Jesus never
   introduce fictitious conditions, nor do they anywhere violate the order
   and course of nature. It is hardly possible that he could have made
   this an exception to his rule, especially since it is in a field where
   all the wisdom of the world is insufficient to make the slightest
   correction. Moreover, it is certainly impossible that he could
   exaggerate the differences between the states of the lost and saved in
   the hereafter. Nor can the teaching of the parable be set aside on the
   ground that it represents merely the intermediate and not the final
   condition of things. If the intermediate condition of things is fixed
   and established, the final condition must, a fortiori, be more so.
   Moreover, the teaching here differs from that of the old rabbis, for,
   according to Lightfoot, a wall and not a gulf separated between the
   just and the unjust, and they were not "afar off" from each other, the
   distance being but a handbreadth. The passage therefore confirms the
   doctrine that the righteous are neither homeless nor unconscious during
   the period between death and the resurrection (Phil. i. 23), and
   refutes the doctrine of Universalism, for the gulf is, 1, fixed, and,
   2, can not be passed or bridged. The gulf of pride and caste between
   the rich man and Lazarus while on earth was easy to cross.] 27 And he
   said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my
   father's house [The double attempt of the rich man to use Lazarus as
   his servant shows how hard it was for him to adjust himself to his new
   condition]; 28 for I have five brethren [there is no typical
   significance in the number]; that he may testify unto them, lest they
   also come into this place of torment. [Deceived by his wealth, the rich
   man looked upon his earthly possessions as real and substantial, and,
   like rich sinners of to-day, had simply disregarded the affairs of the
   future life. Aroused by the sudden experience of the awful realities of
   the future state, he desires to make it as real to his brethren as it
   had now become to him. In endeavoring to carry out his desire he
   proceeds on the theory that the testimony of the dead in reference to
   the realities of the future state are more trustworthy and influential
   than the revelations of God himself, given through his inspired
   spokesmen. This dishonoring of God and his law was to be expected from
   one who had made mammon his real master, even though professing (as the
   context suggests) to serve God. The singleness of his service is shown
   in that he, though practically discharged by one master--mammon, can
   not even now speak respectfully of God. Some commentators make much of
   the so-called repentance of the rich man, manifested in this concern
   for his brethren; but the Lord did not count kindness shown to kindred
   as evidence of goodness, much less of repentance (Luke vi. 32-35, pp.
   248, 249). Besides the natural feeling for his brothers, he knew that
   their presence in torment would add to his own. His concern for his
   brethren is not told to indicate repentance. It is mentioned to bring
   out the point that the revealed will of God of itself and without more
   makes it inexcusable for a man to lead a selfish life.] 29 But Abraham
   saith, They have Moses and the prophets [i. e., the entire Old
   Testament]; let them hear them. [John i. 45; v. 39-46; Luke xxiv. 27.
   The Scriptures are a sufficient guide to godliness--II. Tim. iii. 16,
   17, and a failure to live rightly when possession them is due to lack
   of will, and not to lack of knowledge.] 30 And he said, Nay, father
   Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. [With
   the spirit of a true Pharisee, he sought a sign for his brothers. See
   page 305. But the guidance of Scripture is better than any sign.] 31
   And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
   will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead. [These words might
   sound like an overstatement of the obduracy of unbelief were they not
   amply verified by the literal facts. Jesus had already raised at least
   two from the dead as witnesses to his divine power, and he was about to
   raise a third, who, with startling suggestiveness, would bear this very
   name of Lazarus. But despite all these witnesses the majority of the
   Jews disbelieved and continued to disbelieve in him; nay, they even
   went so far as to seek the death of Lazarus that they might be rid of
   his testimony (John xii. 10). This is also a reference to Jesus' own
   resurrection. It is true that he did not appear in person to those who
   disbelieved in him, but they had clear knowledge of his resurrection
   (Matt. xxviii. 11-15), and it was considered as proved to all men--Acts
   xvii. 31.]

Concerning Offenses, Faith, and Service.

^C Luke XVII. 1-10.

   ^c 1 And he said unto the disciples [Jesus here ceases to speak to the
   Pharisees, and begins a new series of sayings addressed to the
   disciples, which sayings are, however, pertinent to the occasion, and
   not wholly disconnected with what he has just been saying], It is
   impossible [in a world where Pharisees abound, etc.--I. Cor. xi. 19]
   but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through
   whom they come! [See page 432.] 2 It were well for him if a millstone
   [not the large millstone mentioned by Matthew and Mark, but the small
   one which was turned by hand] were hanged about his neck, and he were
   thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these
   little ones [beginners in the faith, or weaklings--Rom. xiv. 1] to
   stumble. [See page 432.] 3 Take heed to yourselves [our dangers are not
   overpassed when we avoid giving offenses, for it is also required of us
   that we should forgive the evils which we receive]: if thy brother sin,
   rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. [Righteousness has its
   obligation to rebuke as well as love has to forgive.] 4 And if he sin
   against thee seven times in the day [a general expression indicating a
   great number of times], and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I
   repent; thou shalt forgive him. [See p. 437. The passage differs from
   that in Matthew in that the repentance of the sinner is required as a
   condition precedent to forgiveness.] 5 And the apostles said unto the
   Lord, Increase our faith. [The apostles asked for faith that they might
   be able to fulfill the great moral requirements which Jesus had just
   revealed. Our Lord sanctions the wisdom of their prayer by showing the
   greatness of faith.] 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of
   mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up,
   and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you. [See pp. 424,
   426. "The only real power of the universe," says Godet, "is the divine
   will. The human will, which has discovered the secret of blending with
   this force of forces, is raised, in virtue of this union, to
   omnipotence." But our distance from omnipotence measures how far we are
   from attaining that desired union of will. The sycamine tree is the
   well-known black mulberry tree, which belongs to the same natural order
   as the fig-tree, and is a tree distinguished for being deeply rooted.]
   7 But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep,
   that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come
   straightway and sit down to meat; 8 and will not rather say unto him,
   Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I
   have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 9 Doth
   he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? 10
   Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all things that are commanded
   you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our
   duty to do. [In this passage, which is in the nature of a parable,
   Jesus teaches that duty is coextensive with ability, and explodes the
   doctrine that it is possible for a man to do "works of supererogation."
   Since in God's sight no man can even do his full duty (Ps. cxliii. 2),
   it is impossible that he can do more than his duty. We may be rewarded
   for the discharge of our duty, but the reward is of grace and not of
   merit. Compare Luke xii. 3-48. The theme is no doubt suggested by verse
   6. When one's faith endows him with great gifts he need not consider
   himself as an unusually profitable servant for he can do no more than
   it is his duty to do. Godet denies this connection with verse 6,
   contending that miracles are not among "the things that are commanded"
   in the terms of verse 10; but miracles were commanded, and for those
   who could bestow it, a gift of healing was as much an obligation as a
   gift of alms (Matt. x. 8; Acts iii. 1-6). The paragraph is a fitting
   close to a discourse so much of which relates to Phariseeism.]

PerÆa to Bethany. Raising of Lazarus.

^D John XI. 1-46.

   ^d 1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of
   Mary and her sister Martha. [For Bethany and the sisters, see p. 478.]
   2 And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped
   his feet with her hair [John xii. 3 ], whose brother Lazarus was sick.
   [The anointing had not yet taken place, as John himself shows. For a
   similar anticipation see Matt. x. 4. There are five prominent Marys in
   the New Testament: those of Nazareth, Magdala and Bethany; the mother
   of Mark, and the wife of Clopas.] 3 The sisters therefore sent unto
   him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. [The message
   and its form both indicate the close intimacy between this family and
   Christ. They make no request, trusting that Jesus' love will bring him
   to Bethany.] 4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not
   unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be
   glorified thereby. [The sickness of Lazarus was for the purpose or
   design of a resurrection, so that death was a mere preceding incident.
   By this resurrection the Son of God would be glorified by manifesting
   more clearly than ever before that death came under his Messianic
   dominion, and by gathering believers from amongst his enemies. In all
   this the Father would also be glorified in the Son.] 5 Now Jesus loved
   Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. [In this passage we have two Greek
   words for love. In verses 3 and 36 we have philein, which expresses
   natural affection such as a parent feels for a child. In this verse we
   have agapan, an affection resulting from moral choice, loftier and less
   impulsive. We are told of the Lord's love that we may understand that
   his delay was not due to indifference.] 6 When therefore he heard that
   he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.
   [It is urged that the exigencies of his ministry delayed Jesus in
   Peræa. But the import of the texts is that he kept away because of his
   love for the household of Lazarus and his desire to bless his
   disciples. He delayed that he might discipline and perfect the faith of
   the sisters and disciples. He withheld his blessing that he might
   enlarge it. Strauss pronounces it immoral in Christ to let his friend
   die in order to glorify himself by a miracle. In the vocabulary of
   Strauss, glorification means the gratification of personal vanity, but
   in the language of Christ it means the revelation of himself as the
   divine Saviour, that men may believe and receive the blessing of
   salvation.] 7 Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into
   Judæa again. [The word "again" refers back to John x. 40. Jesus does
   not propose to them to return to Bethany, where he has friends, but to
   go back to Judæa, the land of hostility. In so doing he caused them to
   think of his death, of which he had some time been seeking to accustom
   them to think.] 8 The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but
   now seeking to stone thee. [John x. 31]; and goest thou thither again?
   9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk
   in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
   10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is
   not in him. [This parabolic expression resembles that at John ix. 4.
   See p. 462. In this passage, day represents the alloted season of life
   which was to be terminated by what Jesus called "his hour." Until this
   "hour" came, Jesus felt no fear. He did not thrust himself into danger,
   thus tempting God; but he feared not to go whither his duty and the
   Spirit led him. As yet it was still day, but the evening shadows were
   falling, and the powers of darkness were soon to prevail (Luke xxii.
   53), and then the further prosecution of the work would lead to death,
   for death was part of the work, and had its allotted time and place.]
   11 These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend
   Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
   12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth, he shall do well. 13
   Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of
   taking of rest in sleep. [Jesus had before this spoken of death under
   the figure of sleep (Luke viii. 52, see p. 355), and the disciples
   might have understood him to mean death in this case had they not
   misunderstood his promise given at verse 4. As it was, they looked upon
   the mentioned sleep as marking the crisis of the disease, as it so
   often does in cases of fever. They were glad to urge it as an evidence
   of complete recovery, and thus remove one of the causes of the dreaded
   journey into Judæa.] 14 Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly,
   Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there,
   to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. [Had
   Jesus been present during the sickness of Lazarus, he would have felt
   constrained to heal him, and so would have lost the opportunity of
   presenting to his disciples a more striking proof of his divine power,
   a proof which has been the joy of each succeeding age. The disciples
   were soon to learn by sad experience how little belief they really
   had--Mark xiv. 50; xvi. 11; Luke xxiv. 11, 21, 25.] 16 Thomas
   therefore, who is called Didymus [see p. 224], said unto his
   fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. [I. e., die
   with Christ, see verse 8. They could not die with Lazarus, as some have
   foolishly supposed, for he was already dead. This mention of Thomas is
   closely connected with the thought in verse 15. Jesus was about to work
   a miracle for the express purpose of inducing his disciples to believe
   in him, especially as to his power over death. In this despairing
   speech Thomas shows how little faith he had in Christ's ability to cope
   with death. Thomas sadly needed to witness the miracle of the
   resurrection of Lazarus, and even after seeing it, it proved
   insufficient to sustain his faith in the ordeal through which he was
   about to pass--John xx. 25-29.] 17 So when Jesus came, he found that he
   had been in the tomb four days already. [If Lazarus was buried on the
   day he died, as is the custom in the East, and in hot climates
   generally ( Acts v. 6, 10), he probably died on the day that the
   messengers brought word to Jesus about his sickness. If so, Jesus set
   forth for Bethany on the third day and arrived there on the fourth. The
   resurrections wrought by Jesus are progressional manifestations of
   power. Jairus' daughter was raised immediately after death, the young
   man of Nain was being carried to his grave, and Lazarus was buried four
   days. All these were preparatory to that last and greatest
   manifestation of resurrectional power--the raising of his own body.] 18
   Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off [the
   furlong, or stadium, was six hundred feet, so that the distance here
   was one and seven-eighths miles]; 19 and many of the Jews had come to
   Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. [These Jews
   were present four days after the death because Jewish custom prolonged
   the season of mourning (Gen. i. 3, 10; Num. xx. 29; Deut. xxxiv. 8; I.
   Sam. xxviii. 13). The Mishna prescribed seven days for near relatives,
   and the rules as laid down by rabbis, required seven days' public and
   thirty days' private mourning for distinguished or important
   personages.] 20 Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming,
   went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. [Jesus evidently
   paused on the outskirts of the town. He probably wished to avoid the
   noisy conventional wailing, the hypocrisy of which was distasteful to
   him (Mark v. 40). It comports with the businesslike character of Martha
   as depicted by Luke to have heard of our Lord's arrival before Mary.
   She was probably discharging her duty towards the guests and new
   arrivals, as was her wont. See p. 478.] 21 Martha therefore said unto
   Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 22 And
   even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give
   thee. [We might take it that Martha confidently expected the Lord to
   raise Lazarus, were it not for the subsequent conversation and
   especially verse 39. We must therefore look upon her hope as more vague
   than her words would indicate. Such vague and illusive hopes are common
   where a great expectation, such as she had before indulged, had but
   lately departed.] 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise
   again. 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
   resurrection at the last day. 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the
   resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet
   shall he live; 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never
   die. Believest thou this? [Instead of saying "I will raise Lazarus,"
   Jesus uses the wholly impersonal phrase "thy brother shall rise again,"
   for it was this very impersonal feature of faith which he wished to
   correct. Martha assents to it at once. The doctrine of a resurrection
   was commonly held by all the Jews except the Sadducees. It was in their
   view, however, a remote, impersonal affair, a very far distant event
   powerless to comfort in bereavement. From this comparatively cheerless
   hope, Jesus would draw Martha to look upon himself as both resurrection
   and life. Where he is there is life, and there also is resurrection at
   his word without limitation. No mere man, if sane, could have uttered
   such words. They mean that Jesus is the power which raises the dead and
   bestows eternal life--John vi. 39-54; x. 28.] 27 She saith unto him,
   Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God,
   even he that cometh into the world. [She could not say she believed it,
   for Lazarus had believed in Jesus and yet he had died. So, evading the
   question, she confessed her faith in him. Believing him, she accepted
   whatever he might say. She responds in the words of that apostolic
   creed which, in its ultimate application, embraces all that is true and
   discards all that is false (Matt. xvi. 16; John vi. 68, 69; xx. 31; I.
   John v. 1-5). See p. 411.] 28 And when she had said this, she went
   away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here,
   and calleth thee. [She called Mary secretly, for she wished that Mary
   might have a private word with Jesus such as she had just had.] 29 And
   she, when she heard it, arose quickly [moved by ardent feeling], and
   went unto him. 30 (Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was
   in the place where Martha met him.) 31 The Jews then who were with her
   in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose
   up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going
   unto the tomb to weep there. [Rather, to wail (Matt. ii. 18; Mark v.
   38). According to Eastern custom, the Jews followed her as friends, to
   assist in the demonstration of mourning. This frustrated the effort of
   Martha to keep secret the Lord's coming, and caused the miracle to be
   wrought in the presence of a mixed body of spectators.] 32 Mary
   therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his
   feet [in grief and dependence, but with less self-control than Martha],
   saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not
   died. [That both sisters used this phrase, shows that it is an echo of
   the past feelings and conversations of the sisters. It is clear that
   they felt hurt at his not coming sooner, as he could have done.] 33
   When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who
   came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled [The verb
   translated "groaned" carries in it the idea of indignation. But the
   fact that sin had brought such misery to those he loved was enough to
   account for the feeling], 34 and said, Where have ye laid him? [This
   question was designed to bring all parties to the tomb; it was not
   asked for information. See pp. 353, 354, 376.] They [the sisters] say
   unto him, Lord, come and see. 35 Jesus wept. [This is not the verb for
   wailing, but for shedding tears. On another occasion, when Jesus saw
   with prophetic eye a vast city, the center of God's chosen nation,
   sweeping on to destruction, he lamented aloud (Luke xix. 41), but here,
   as a friend, he mingled his quiet tears with the two broken-hearted
   sisters, thus assuring us of his sympathy with the individual grief of
   each lowly disciple (Rom. xii. 15). Nor did the nearness of comfort
   prevent his tears. They were tears of sympathy. "A sympathetic
   physician," says Neander, "in the midst of a family drowned in
   grief,--will not his tears flow with theirs, though he knows that he
   has the power of giving immediate relief?"] 36 The Jews therefore said,
   Behold how he loved him! 37 But some of them said, Could not this man,
   who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man
   also should not die? [Knowing the miracle which he had performed upon a
   blind man (John ix. 1-13), they could therefore see no reason why he
   should not have performed one here.] 38 Jesus therefore again groaning
   in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay
   against it. [These stones were frequently in the shape of large
   grindstones resting in a groove, so that they could be rolled in front
   of the door of the tomb. Tombs had to be closed securely to keep out
   jackals and other ravenous beasts.] 39 Jesus saith, Take ye away the
   stone. [Miracles only begin where human power ends.] Martha, the sister
   of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body
   decayeth; for he hath been dead four days. [She evidently thought that
   Jesus wished to see the remains of his friend, and her sisterly feeling
   prompted her to conceal the humiliating ravages of death. Her words
   show how little expectation of a resurrection she had.] 40 Jesus saith
   unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou
   shouldest see the glory of God? [Jesus reminds her of his words which
   are recorded in verses 25 and 26, and of the message which he sent,
   found in verse 4, thus removing her objections.] 41 So they took away
   the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee
   that thou heardest me. 42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but
   because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may
   believe that thou didst send me. [Jesus, dwelling in constant communion
   with the Father, knew that the Father concurred in his wish to raise
   Lazarus. He therefore makes public acknowledgment, and offers a prayer
   of thanksgiving, for the Father's gracious answer to this and all his
   petitions. He states, too, that the prayer is publicly made that it may
   induce faith in the bystanders. He wished all present to know that the
   miracle about to be wrought is not the work of some independent
   wonder-worker, but is performed by him as one commissioned and sent of
   God. In other words, the miracle was wrought to prove the concord
   between the Son and the Father, the very fact which the Jews refused to
   believe. Rationalists criticize this prayer as a violation of the
   principle at Matt. vi. 5, 6, and Weisse called it "prayer for show."
   But it shows on its face that it is not uttered by Jesus to draw
   admiration to himself as a praying man, but to induce faith unto
   salvation in those who heard.] 43 And when he had thus spoken, he cried
   with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. [The loud cry emphasized the
   fact that the miracle was wrought by personal authority, and not by
   charms, incantations, or other questionable means. His voice was as it
   were an earnest of the final calling which all shall hear (Rev. i. 5;
   John v. 28, 29; I. Thess. iv. 16). It has been happily said he called
   Lazarus by name, lest all the dead should rise.] 44 He that was dead
   came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was
   bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let
   him go. [It is thought by some that Lazarus walked forth from the tomb,
   and the fact that the Egyptians sometimes swathed their mummies so as
   to keep the limbs and even the fingers separate is cited to show that
   Lazarus was not so bound as to prevent motion. But the grave-clothes
   were like a modern shroud, wrapped around arms and legs, and mummies
   also were thus wrapped after their limbs were swathed. It was part of
   the miracle that Lazarus came out bound hand and foot, and John puts
   emphasis upon it.] 45 Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and
   beheld that which he did, believed on him. 46 But some of them [some of
   the class mentioned in verse 37] went away to the Pharisees, and told
   them the things which Jesus had done. [By the miracle Jesus had won
   many from the ranks of his enemies, but others, alarmed at this
   deflection, rush off to tell the Pharisees about this new cause for
   alarm. Farrar argues that these may have gone to the Pharisees with
   good intentions toward Jesus, but surely no friend of Jesus could have
   been so hasty to communicate with his enemies. But the way in which the
   Evangelist separates these from the believers of verse 45, stamps their
   action as unquestionably hostile.]

Retiring Before the Sanhedrin's Decree.

(Jerusalem and Ephraim in Judæa.)

^D John XI. 47-54.

   ^d 47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council
   [called a meeting of the Sanhedrin], and said, What do we? [Thus they
   reproach one another for having done nothing in a present and urgent
   crisis. As two of their number (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathæa) were
   afterwards in communications with Christians, it was easy for the
   disciples to find out what occurred on this notable occasion.] for this
   man doeth many signs. [They did not deny the miracles, therefore their
   conduct was the more inexcusable.] 48 If we let him thus alone, all men
   will believe on him [they found that despite the threat of
   excommunication, Jesus was still winning disciples under the very
   shadow of Jerusalem]: and the Romans will come and take away both our
   place and our nation. [The course of Jesus seemed to undermine Judaism,
   and to leave it a prey to the innovations of Rome. It is uncertain what
   is meant by the noun "place." Meyer says it refers to Jerusalem; Luecke
   to the temple; while Bengel says that place and nation are a proverbial
   expression, meaning "our all;" but the Greek language furnishes no
   example of such proverbial use. It is more likely that place refers to
   their seats in the Sanhedrin, which they would be likely to lose if the
   influence of Jesus became, as they feared, the dominant power. They
   feared then that the Romans would, by removing them, take away the last
   vestige of civil and ecclesiastical authority, and then eventually
   obliterate the national life.] 49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas,
   being the high priest that same year [that notable, fatal year; he was
   high priest from a.d. 18 to a.d. 36], said unto them, Ye know nothing
   at all, 50 Nor do ye account that it is expedient for you that one man
   should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. [His
   words are a stinging rebuke, which may be paraphrased thus: "If you had
   any sense you would not sit there asking, 'What do we?' when there is
   but one thing to do; viz.: Let Jesus die and save the people."
   Expediency, not justice, is his law.] 51 Now this he said not of
   himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus
   should die for the nation; 52 and not for the nation only, but that he
   might also gather together into one [Gal. iii. 28; Col. iii. 11] the
   children of God that are scattered abroad. [The expression "not of
   himself" is a very common Hebrew idiom for "not of himself only." God
   had a meaning in his words different from his own. In earlier, better
   days the high priest had represented the divine headship of the nation,
   and through him, by means of the Urim and Thummin, the inspired oracles
   and decisions had been wont to come. This exalted honor had been lost
   through unworthiness. But now, according to the will of God, the high
   priest prophesies in spite of himself, as did Balaam and Saul,
   performing the office without the honor.] 53 So from that day forth
   they took counsel that they might put him to death. [Thus, acting on
   the advice of Caiaphas the Sanhedrin condemned Jesus without a hearing
   and sought means to carry their condemnation to execution. Quieting
   their consciences by professing to see such political dangers as made
   it necessary to kill Jesus for the public welfare, they departed
   utterly from justice, and took the course which brought upon them the
   very evils which they were professedly seeking to avoid.] 54 Jesus
   therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence
   into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim,
   and there he tarried with the disciples. [Ephraim is supposed to be the
   city called Ophrah at Josh. xviii. 23 and Ephraim at II. Chron. xiii.
   19. Dr. Robinson and others identify it with the village now called et
   Taiybeh, which is situated on a conical-shaped hill about sixteen miles
   northeast of Jerusalem and five miles east of Bethel. It is on the
   borders of a wilderness, and commands an extensive view of the Jordan
   valley. Here Jesus remained till shortly before his last Passover.]

Journey to Jerusalem. Ten Lepers. Concerning the Kingdom.

(Borders of Samaria and Galilee.)

^C Luke XVII. 11-37.

   ^c 11 And it came to pass, as they were on their way to Jerusalem, that
   he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. [If our
   chronology is correct, Jesus passed northward from Ephraim about forty
   miles, crossing Samaria (here mentioned first), and coming to the
   border of Galilee. He then turned eastward along that border down the
   wady Bethshean which separates the two provinces, and crossed the
   Jordan into Peræa, where we soon find him moving on toward Jericho in
   the midst of the caravan of pilgrims on the way to the passover.] 12
   And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that
   were lepers, who stood afar off. [One may still meet such groups of
   lepers outside the villages. They do not stand directly in the road so
   as to make an actual meeting, but are off to one side and near enough
   to beg. The law required lepers to keep away from the rest of the
   people (Lev. xiii. 45, 46). The rabbis are said to have prescribed a
   fixed distance at which lepers must keep, but authority varies as to
   this distance, some giving it as a rod, and others as high as a hundred
   paces]: 13 and they lifted up their voices [such as they had, for the
   leper's bronchial tubes are dry, and the voice is harsh and squeaky],
   saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. [Considering their condition,
   their prayer was definite enough.] 14 And when he saw them [the
   disciples about him probably at first obstructed the Lord's view], he
   said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. [See p. 180.]
   And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. [They received
   the blessing when they showed their faith by their obedience.] 15 And
   one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back [like
   Naaman--II. Kings v. 15], with a loud voice [made strong by health and
   gratitude] glorifying God; 16 and he fell down on his face at his feet,
   giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. [On his way to the priests
   at Mt. Gerizim the Samaritan turned back to express his thanks.
   Apparently nine of the lepers were Jews. A Samaritan was among them
   because they were along the border of his country, and because the
   fellowship of affliction and disease obliterated the distinctions of
   race, as it does to this day. In the leper-houses at Jerusalem
   Mohammedans and Jews now live together despite the rancor existing
   between the healthy representatives of these two religions.] 17 And
   Jesus answering said, Were there not the ten cleansed? but where are
   the nine? [The Lord publicly noted the indifference and ingratitude of
   the nine and the thanksgiving of the tenth. As we look around to-day
   and see how many are ungrateful for the blessings which they receive,
   the words ring like an echo in our ears.] 18 Were there none found that
   returned to give glory to God, save this stranger? [It sometimes
   happens that we receive most where we expect least. Though the
   Samaritan's religion was partly Jewish, yet by blood he was a
   foreigner, as the word "stranger" means.] 19 And he said unto him,
   Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. [Thus Jesus
   emphasized the fact that the blessing came through faith, encouraging
   the man to seek higher blessings by the same means.] 20 And being asked
   by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and
   said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 21 neither shall
   they say, Lo here! or, There! for, lo, the kingdom of God is within
   you. [Rom. xiv. 17. The question of the Pharisees was doubtless a
   covert criticism. More than three years before this Jesus had begun to
   say that the kingdom of heaven was at hand; and they thought that after
   all this preparation it was high time that the kingdom should commence.
   They were looking for some manifestation of the sovereignty of God in
   the realm of the civil and the external, which would raise the Jewish
   nation to conspicuous supremacy, but they are told that the work of the
   kingdom is internal and spiritual (John iii. 8; xviii. 36; Rom. x. 8;
   Col. i. 27), and that its effects are not such as can be located in
   space. They were seeking honors and joys, and would find contempt and
   sorrow (Amos v. 18-20). Some have thought it strange than Jesus should
   say "within you" when addressing the Pharisees, but the word "you" is
   used generally and indefinitely.] 22 And he said unto his disciples
   [giving them instructions suggested by the question of the Pharisees],
   The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the
   Son of man, and ye shall not see it. 23 And they shall say to you, Lo,
   there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after them: 24 for as the
   lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven,
   shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in
   his day. [Acts xxvi. 13; II. Thess. ii. 8. If the Pharisees looked
   eagerly for a sensuous external Messianic kingdom, so also would the
   disciples be tempted in the days to come to cherish a somewhat similar
   yearning. Knowing that Jesus was to come again to rule in power and in
   great glory, they would, under the stress of persecution, hunger to see
   one of the days of his rule. This longing for the coming of the Christ
   is frequently expressed (Phil. iv. 5; Tit. ii. 13; Jas. v. 7-9; Rev.
   xxii. 20). In their restless eagerness the unwary disciples would be
   tempted to follow the false Messiahs who excited widespread admiration
   and attention. Against all this Jesus warns them, telling them that
   when the kingdom of heaven does at last assume a visible shape in the
   manifestation of its King, that manifestation will be so glorious,
   universal and pronounced as to be absolutely unmistakable.] 25 But
   first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
   [Thus when he speaks of his glory Jesus is careful to mention the
   humiliation and suffering which precedes it, that the faith of his
   disciples may not be weakened by false expectations and
   misunderstandings. The day of glory was not for that generation, since
   it would reject him.] 26 And as it came to pass in the days of Noah
   [Gen. vii. 11-23], 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were
   given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and
   the flood came, and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise even as it came to
   pass in the days of Lot [Gen. xix. 15-28; Ezek. xvi. 46-56; Jude 7];
   they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
   builded; 29 but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire
   and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: 30 after the same
   manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed. [Our
   Lord here gives us two historical incidents of the false security of
   the ungodly, and in doing so he endorses them as real history. The
   antediluvians and the citizens of Sodom discharged the business of the
   day and laid their plans for to-morrow and had no thought of evil or
   anticipation of trouble down to the very moment that the bowls of wrath
   were poured upon them. Despite all warnings, they were taken by
   surprise when completely off their guard. The coming of Christ shall be
   a like surprise to the people of the last day (Matt. xxiv. 44; Luke
   xii. 39; I. Thess. v. 2; II. Pet. iii. 10; Rev. iii. 3; xvi. 15), and
   it shall be a day of like punishment--II. Thess. i. 6-10.] 31 In that
   day, he that shall be on the housetop. [the flat roofs of Oriental
   houses are used much the same as we use porches], and his goods in the
   house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in
   the field likewise not return back. 32 Remember Lot's wife. [Gen. xix.
   26; Luke ix. 62.] 33 Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose
   it: but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. [See p. 416.]
   [It seems strange that the terrors of the last day should be
   accompanied by any thought or concern for property, but such is the
   plain intimation of the text. If our hope has been centered upon
   earthly things, we will be found seeking them even in that hour, just
   as the face of Lot's wife was turned toward Sodom despite the glare of
   the penal fires. Our earthly characters become fixed, and great
   catastrophes do not change them (Rev. xxii. 10-12). If in that hour we
   be found seeking to save our carnal treasures, it will be a sign that
   we have lost the spiritual from our lives and have no heavenly
   treasures.] 34 I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on
   one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 35 There
   shall be two women grinding together [making meal or flour with the
   little stone hand-mills, as they still do in the East]; the one shall
   be taken, and the other shall be left. [Day and night exist
   simultaneously upon the earth, and the Lord's coming will be at noon to
   some and at midnight to others. His saints will be found mingled with
   the rest of the people and engaged in duties befitting the hour. But
   the Lord will receive them to himself as his own (John xiv. 3; I.
   Thess. iv. 17), and they will be ready to be detached from their
   worldly ties that they may go to meet and welcome the bridegroom at his
   coming-- Matt. xxv. 6, 7.] 37 And they answering say unto him, Where,
   Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, thither will the eagles
   also be gathered together. [The disciples desired to know where this
   manifestation and division would take place, looking upon it as a local
   prediction. Jesus gave a proverbial answer, the meaning of which is
   that sin courts and draws to itself punishment and destruction just as
   a carcass draws winged scavengers. Applying his words, we may say that
   as the corruption of the antediluvians drew upon them, the devastation
   of the flood, and as the crimes of the Sodomites called down upon them,
   the fires from heaven, and as the unbelief of the Jews of Christ's day
   caused the destruction of Jerusalem and the death of the nation, so the
   wickedness of the men of the last times will result in the ending of
   the world. The word translated eagles is generic, and included the
   vultures also (Pliny Nat. His. ix. 3). It is likely that the Revision
   Committee retained the word "eagles" instead of vultures because of the
   mistaken notion of Lightfoot and others that our Lord here makes a
   covert allusion to the eagles which were borne upon the Roman
   standards. A passage similar to the latter part of this section is
   found at Matt. xxiv. 17-41.]

Parable of the Importunate Widow.

^C Luke XVIII. 1-8.

   ^c 1 And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always
   to pray, and not to faint; 2 saying, There was in a city a judge, who
   feared not God, and regarded not man [an utterly abandoned character]:
   3 and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him,
   saying, Avenge me of [rather, Do justice to me as to] mine adversary.
   [In Scripture language widowhood is symbolic of defenselessness (Ex.
   xxii. 22-24; Deut. x. 18; xxvii. 19; Mal. iii. 5; Mark xii. 40), and
   the early church concerned itself much about the welfare of
   widows--Acts vi. 1; ix. 41; Jas. i. 27; I. Tim. v. 3.] 4 And he would
   not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear
   not God, nor regard man; 5 yet because this widow troubleth me, I will
   avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming. [The point of
   this soliloquy is this: Though the high motives such as accountability
   to God for my office and my good name and respect among men do not lead
   me to do this woman justice, yet will I do it simply to be rid of her
   importunity.] 6 And the Lord said [this expression indicates that the
   Lord paused for a moment, that the parable might be fully grasped
   before he made the application], Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.
   7 And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night
   [The application is an argument a fortiori, and presents a triple
   antithesis: 1. In the petitioned--a just God and an unrighteous judge.
   2. In the petitioners--a despised widow and the beloved elect. 3. In
   the petition--the frequent visits of the one, and the continual cries
   of the many], and yet he is longsuffering over them? 8 I say unto you,
   that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man
   cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? [Though a beloved people cry
   continually unto a just God, yet will he in mercy be longsuffering to
   their enemies, and because of the longsuffering he will seem to delay
   his answer, but the delay will not be extended a moment longer than
   necessary. When the season of repentance is past, and the measure of
   iniquity is full (Gen. xv. 16), then the Lord's answer will be speedy,
   immediate. But despite this admonition to pray without discouragement,
   and this promise to answer with all speed, God's patience with the
   wicked, and his consequent delays in answering the prayers of the just,
   will prove such a trial to his people as to leave it questionable
   whether any of them will have faith enough to pray until the coming of
   the Lord. We find an echo of this passage at II. Pet. iii. 1-13.
   Compare also Matt. xxiv. 12, 13. The parable resembles that of the
   friend who came at midnight (Luke xi. 5), see p. 480, but there the
   petitioner asked a gift, and here the request is for justice and
   deliverance. And this parable also teaches that the saints must be
   patient in prayer until the Lord's return.]

XCVII.

Parable of the Pharisee and Publican.

^C Luke XVIII. 9-14.

   ^c 9 And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in
   themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought [It
   is commonly said that this parable teaches humility in prayer, but the
   preface and conclusion (see verse 14) show that it is indeed to set
   forth generally the difference between self-righteousness and humility,
   and that an occasion of prayer is chosen because it best illustrates
   the point which the Lord desired to teach. The parable shows that the
   righteousness in which these parties trusted was devoid of that true
   charity or heart-love toward God and man without which our characters
   are worthless in the sight of God-- Prov. xxx. 12, 13; Isa. lxv. 5; I.
   Cor. xiii. 1-3]: 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray [The temple
   was the appointed place for Jewish prayer. To it the Jew went if near
   at hand, and towards it he prayed it afar off. The stated hours of
   prayer were 9 A. M. and 3 P. M., but men went there to pray whenever
   they felt like it]; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. [The
   two represent the extremes of Jewish social and religious life--see p.
   71 and 76.] 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself [This
   may mean that he stood alone, withdrawing from the contamination of
   others, but it seems rather to mean that he prayed having himself,
   rather than God, uppermost in his thoughts], God, I thank thee, that I
   am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as
   this publican. [His prayer is more a boast as to himself than an
   expression of worship toward God ( Rev. iii. 17, 18), and he makes the
   sinful record of the publican a dark background on which to display the
   bright contrast of his own character--a character for which he was
   thankful, and apparently with reason.] 12 I fast twice in the week [the
   law appointed one fast in the year, viz.: on the Day of Atonement (
   Lev. xvi. 29, 30), but the Pharisees fasted on Mondays and Thursdays of
   each week]; I give tithes of all that I get. [I give the tenth part of
   my income. The law required that tithes be given from the corn, wine,
   oil, and cattle (Deut. xiv. 22, 23), but the Pharisees took account of
   the humblest herbs of the garden, and gave a tenth of their mint,
   anise, and cummin (Matt. xxiii. 23). Thus he confessed his virtues
   rather than his sins.] 13 But the publican, standing afar off [remote
   from the Holy Place], would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
   [Ps. cxxiii. 1, 2; xl. 12; Ez. ix. 6], but smote his breast [as if to
   remind himself of the stroke of God which he so richly deserved--Nah.
   ii. 7; Luke xxiii. 48 ], saying, God be thou merciful to me a sinner.
   [He makes full confession of his sin without excuse or justification,
   and without offset of righteousness. Moreover, he petitions for no
   temporal blessings, but simply asks for mercy--I. Tim. i. 15.] 14 I say
   unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the
   other [we are taught here, as in the parable of the prodigal son, that
   the penitent unrighteous are more acceptable to God than the righteous
   who make no confession of their sins]: for every one that exalteth
   himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be
   exalted. [Luke xiv. 11, see p. 494. The Pharisee was an example of the
   first, and the publican of the second.]

Journey to Jerusalem. Concerning Divorce.

^A Matt. XIX. 1-12; ^B Mark X. 1-12.

   ^a 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words [the words
   contained in Matt. xviii., which are the last teachings in Galilee
   recorded by any of the Evangelists, p. 435 and p. 439 he departed from
   Galilee [Having come into the borders of it again from Ephraim. It
   seems likely that Matthew takes in at one view both departures from
   Galilee, viz.: that mentioned on p. 441 and that at [4]Sec. XCV., for
   Matthew records none of the intervening events and Jesus spent no time
   in Galilee between the two journeys, merely returning to the border of
   the land and making a second journey thence to Jerusalem. He now left
   Galilee to return thither no more until after the resurrection--Matt.
   xxviii. 16, 17; John xxi. 1], ^b 1 And he arose from thence, and cometh
   { ^a came} ^b into the borders of Judæa and beyond the Jordan [The land
   beyond the Jordan was called Peræa. See p. 176. It was no part of
   Judæa, but belonged to the tetrarchy of Herod. It and the river Jordan
   bordered Judæa on the east]: ^a 2 and multitudes ^b come together unto
   him again; ^a followed him; ^b and, as he was wont, he taught them
   again. [The teachings of this journey will be found in Sections
   XCVIII-CI.] ^a and he healed them there. [No doubt bands of pilgrims on
   their way to the Passover helped to swell the multitudes which now
   surrounded the Lord.] ^b 2 And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked
   him, ^a saying, ^b Is it lawful for a man ^a to put away his wife for
   every cause? [I.e., for every cause satisfactory to the husband.] ^b
   trying him. [Knowing that Jesus had modified the law of Moses, the
   Pharisees asked this question, seeking to entrap him. If he had
   reaffirmed his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. v. 32), they
   hoped to make it appear that he despised the authority of Moses. But if
   he ratified the law of Moses, then they would show that he was
   contradicting his former teaching, and hence too inconsistent to be
   worthy of credit. For the Lord's teaching concerning divorce see p.
   242.] 3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
   4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to
   put her away. ^a 4 And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he
   who made them from the beginning made them male and female, 5 and said,
   For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
   cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh? 6 So that they are
   no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together,
   let not man put asunder. [Jesus went back to the original law
   propounded by God and recorded by Moses, and shows from it: 1. That
   marriage is a fundamental principle of social order, God having it in
   view from the creation, and hence making them male and female. 2. That
   the relation of marriage is superior even to the parental relation. 3.
   That by it the pair become one flesh, so that a man is as much joined
   to his wife as he is to his own body. Now, since a man can only be
   separated from his parental relations or from his own body by death,
   which is an act of God, so it follows that the superior or similar
   relation of marriage can only be dissolved by the act of God. Thus
   Jesus draws the conclusion that no man or body of men, whether acting
   in private, civil, or ecclesiastical capacity, can dissolve marriage
   otherwise than according to the decrees of God.] 7 They say unto him,
   Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put
   her away? [Seeing that Jesus reaffirmed his former teaching, the Jews
   proceed to show that he is in conflict with the law of Moses,
   apparently failing to note that Jesus has merely cited Scripture, and
   that therefore the issue is really Moses against Moses.] ^b 5 But Jesus
   said { ^a saith} unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart ^b wrote
   you this commandment. ^a suffered you to put away your wives: but from
   the beginning it hath not been so. ^b 6 But from the beginning of the
   creation, Male and female made he them. [Thus Jesus replies that Moses
   did not command but suffered or permitted (the word "commandment" used
   by Mark having reference not to the matter but the manner; i. e.,
   commanding it to be done by giving a writing) men to put away their
   wives because at the time when the law was given the wickedness of men
   made such a concession beneficial. Had the law propounded at creation
   been re-enacted by Moses, many would have refused to marry at all,
   preferring an illicit life to the hazard of matrimony under a stringent
   law, and others finding themselves unhappily married would have
   secretly murdered their wives to gain their liberty. As a choice of two
   evils, God therefore temporarily modified the law out of compassion for
   women. It was expected that as the hearts of men softened they would
   recognize the wisdom, justice and wholesomeness of the original law,
   and cease to take advantage of their permission to evade it. But men
   had not done this, and Christ himself had brought this concession to an
   end, and since then it has been the most daring interference with the
   divine prerogative, for men to venture on a continuance of the same
   concession, as though they were possessed of divine authority.] 10 And
   in the house his disciples asked him again of this matter. 11 And he
   saith unto them, ^a 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his
   wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
   adultery: ^b against her; ^a and he that marrieth her when she is put
   away committeth adultery. ^b 12 and if she herself shall put away her
   husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery. [Thus Jesus
   reaffirms the teaching at Matt. v. 32.] ^a 10 The disciples say unto
   him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to
   marry. [The disciples illustrate not only the hardness of heart of
   which Jesus spoke, but also the wisdom of allowing divorce under the
   law of Moses.] 11 But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this
   saying, but they to whom it is given. 12 For there are eunuchs, that
   were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that were
   made eunuchs of men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves
   eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive
   it, let him receive it. ["This saying" is the saying which Jesus
   himself had just uttered concerning divorce: and his teaching is that
   the prohibition of divorce does not apply to eunuchs. If a woman finds
   herself married to a eunuch, she is not bound to him. So with a man
   married to a hermaphrodite. [8] ]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] * NOTE.--I dissent from the above interpretation for many reasons:
   If the cases be confined to the two instances given, the rule presents
   nothing but what every man and woman would gladly receive, which is
   contrary to what Jesus says about the saying. But, if the cases be
   extended to cover those who make themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
   heaven's sake, and it be contended that evangelists and others who
   sacrifice their home ties for the good of the cause thereby give to
   their wives a right of divorce, the saying becomes on the other hand
   too hard for any to receive. My understanding of the passage is this:
   The disciples, startled by the Lord's declaration as to the
   indissolubility of marriage, declared that marriage was inexpedient.
   Jesus accepts their sayings as a logical deducation from his teaching;
   but a difficult saying, because applicable to but three cases. Jesus is
   therefore speaking with regard to celibacy and not divorce. He says
   that eunuchs are unfit for marriage, whether made so by nature or by
   the violence of man. The two first--the physical eunuch--are introduced
   to illustrate the last or spiritual eunuch--the man whose intense
   interest in the affairs of the kingdom of heaven makes him prefer the
   celibate state. The saying with regard to him is indeed hard to
   receive, for it borders on the abnormal and unnatural, and hence it is
   no command save to those who, being in that abnormal and almost
   unnatural condition, are in a shape to receive it. Marriage is the
   natural condition of man, and celibacy is abnormal, but to some extent
   Biblically countenanced. The trend of Scripture shows that Jesus here
   speaks about celibacy and not about divorce, for it has much to say
   about the celibate principle involved here--those who prefer to be
   eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake, and nothing to say about
   women obtaining divorces because of their husbands' sacrifices for the
   kingdom of heaven. The Scripture everywhere treats of celibacy as a
   difficult problem, and the teaching is this: When any in the kingdom of
   heaven feel called to such extreme labors therein as render marriage
   impracticable ( Acts xiii. 2; I. Cor. ix. 4, 5), they are permitted to
   abstain from marriage; and when seasons of persecution seriously
   interfere with the regular order and course of life among Christians,
   they may find it expedient to live as eunuchs (I. Cor. vii. 25-34 ).
   But in no case must celibacy be practiced unless it can be done so
   without the sin of incontinency (I. Cor. vii. 1-9). The Bible nowhere
   countenances any celibate vow, for it teaches that celibacy is to be
   continued only so long as it is expedient. Much less does it give
   countenance to the doctrine that a church can pass laws enforcing
   celibacy on the whole class of clergy, without any regard for their
   natural constitution, their spiritual powers, or their faithful
   continuance.--P. Y. P.

Blessing Children. Concerning Childlikeness.

(in Peræa.)

^A Matt. XIX. 13-15; ^B Mark X. 13-16; ^C Luke XVIII. 15-17.

   ^a 13 Then were there brought ^b 13 And they were bringing ^a unto him
   little children, { ^c also their babes,} that he should touch them: ^a
   that he should lay his hands on them, and pray [According to Buxtorf,
   children were often brought to the presidents of the synagogue in order
   that they might pray over them. The prayers of a good man in our behalf
   have always been regarded as a blessing; no wonder, then, that the
   mothers of these children desired the prayers of Jesus in behalf of
   their little ones. It was customary to put the hand upon the person
   prayed for, probably following the patriarchal precedent (Gen. xlviii.
   14, 15). Compare Acts vi. 6]: ^c but { ^a and} ^c when the disciples
   saw it, they rebuked them. ^b 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was moved
   with indignation, and ^c called them unto him, saying, { ^b said} unto
   them, ^c Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not:
   ^a for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven. { ^b of God.} [The
   disciples wished to protect Jesus from what appeared to them to be an
   unseemly intrusion and annoyance, and possibly, as the context
   suggests, they thought it was beneath the dignity of the Messiah to
   turn aside from the affairs of the kingdom of heaven (Matt. xix. 12) to
   pay attention to children. But Jesus was indignant at their officious
   interference, and directed that the children be brought to him,
   declaring at the same time that the kingdom of heaven be composed, not
   of little children, but of such as are childlike in their nature.] ^c
   17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
   God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. [See p. 431.]
   ^b 16 And he took them up in his arms, ^a 15 And he laid { ^b laying}
   ^a his hands on { ^b upon} ^a them, ^b and blessed them, ^a and
   departed thence. [They were brought that he might lay his hands on them
   and bless them, and that is what he did for them. The command therefore
   that they be suffered to come to him should not be perverted into a
   precept directing that they be brought for other purposes. Those who
   have construed this as commanding or even permitting either infant
   baptism or an infant church membership, have abused the text. They are
   indebted for these ideas, not to the Bible, but to their creeds. The
   incident told in this section is a fitting sequel to the discourse on
   divorce. The little children, the offspring of happy wedlock, and a
   source of constant joy and pleasure to faithful husbands and wives,
   serve by their presence to correct false impressions as to supposed
   inconvenience of an indissoluble marriage bond. The sight of them in
   the arms of Jesus could not fail to leave a good impression with
   reference to the married life.]

Foretelling His Passion. Rebuking Ambition.

(Peræa, or Judæa, Near the Jordan.)

^A Matt. XX. 17-28; ^B Mark X. 32-45; ^C Luke XVIII. 31-34.

   ^b 32 And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem [Dean Mansel sees
   in these words an evidence that Jesus had just crossed the Jordan and
   was beginning the actual ascent up to Jerusalem. If so, he was in
   Judæa. But such a construction strains the language. Jesus had been
   going up to Jerusalem ever since he started in Galilee, and he may now
   have still be in Peræa. The parable of the vineyard which closed the
   preceding section was likely to have been spoken before he crossed the
   Jordan, for Peræa abounded in vineyards]; and Jesus was going before
   them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. [When
   Jesus turned his face toward Jerusalem, his disciples dropped behind
   and hung back. The outer circle of his disciples knew enough not to be
   fearful of the consequences, and the inner circle, fully acquainted
   with the dangers, were amazed that he should dare to go thither. A
   short while before this they had despaired of his life when he had
   proposed to go even into Judæa (John xi. 7-16), and his going at that
   time had not bettered the situation, but had, on the contrary, greatly
   increased the enmity and danger (John xi. 47-57). Notwithstanding all
   this, Jesus was now on his way to Jerusalem itself, and was speaking no
   reassuring word as he formerly had done--John xi. 9, 10.] ^a 17 And as
   Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took ^b again ^c unto him ^a the
   twelve disciples apart [He separated them from the throng of pilgrims
   on the way to the Passover, and from the outer circle of the disciples,
   for it was not expedient that these should hear what he was about to
   reveal concerning his death. Such a revelation might have spurred his
   Galilæan friends to resist his arrest, and might have resulted in riot
   and bloodshed], ^b and began to tell them the things that were to
   happen unto him, ^a and on the way he said unto them, 18 Behold, we go
   up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief
   priests and ^b the ^a scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, 19
   and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to
   crucify: ^b 34 and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon, and shall
   scourge him, and shall kill him; and three days he shall rise again. {
   ^a and the third day he shall be raised up.} ^c and all the things that
   are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of
   man. 32 For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be
   mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon: 33 and they shall
   scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. [This was
   the third and by far the clearest and most circumstantial prophecy
   concerning his death. For the other two see pp. 415 and 427. The
   details are minute even to the complicated arrangement by which the
   Jewish authorities pronounced sentence (Matt. xxvi. 66) and forced
   Pilate to confirm the sentence (Luke xxiii. 24). Since the evangelists
   honestly record an actual prediction, we may well pause to note how
   remarkable it is in that it gives seven details as follows: 1. Delivery
   or betrayal by Judas. 2. Condemnation. 3. Delivery to the Gentiles. 4.
   Mocking and the manner of it. 5. Scourging. 6. Death by crucifixion. 7.
   Resurrection on the third day. The announcement of these sufferings was
   made for the purpose of checking any materialistic hopes which the
   apostles might entertain as to the glories, honors, and offices of the
   Messianic reign. That such hopes were present is shown by the ambitious
   request which immediately follows. Moreover, to prepare them that they
   might not be crushed either by the announcement or the accomplishment
   of his death he gives them the clear promise of his resurrection.] 34
   And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from
   them, and they perceived not the things that were said. [So fixed and
   ineradicable was their false conception of the Messianic reign that
   they could not believe that what Jesus said could be literally true
   (Matt. xvi. 22). Only later did the full significance of his saying
   dawn upon them--John xii. 16-xiv. 26.] ^b 35 And there ^a 20 Then came
   { ^b come} near unto him ^a the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her
   sons, ^b James and John, ^a worshipping him, [giving him homage as a
   coming ruler, not worshiping him as a divine being], and asking a
   certain thing of him. ^b saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou
   shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee. [Zebedee's wife
   was named was Salome. See note on p. 225. They were ashamed of the
   selfish ambition of their request, and betrayed that fact by desiring
   Christ to grant it without hearing it. For a similar petition, see I.
   Kings ii. 19, 20. They asked through their mother, thinking that Jesus
   would be more likely to favor her than themselves.] ^a 21 And he said
   unto her, { ^b them,} ^a What wouldest thou? ^b What would ye that I
   should do for you? [Though Jesus knew what they wished, he required
   them to state it plainly and specifically, that their self-seeking
   might be clearly exposed and properly rebuked.] ^a She saith unto him,
   Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and on
   on thy left hand, in thy kingdom. ^b 37 And they said unto him, Grant
   unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left
   hand, in thy glory. [In the previous section Jesus had spoken about the
   thrones to be occupied by the apostles. The sons of Zebedee, presuming
   on their high standing among the apostles, and their near relationship
   to Jesus, were emboldened to ask for special seats of honor among the
   promised thrones--the seats to the right and left of the sovereign
   being next to his in dignity and consideration; thus Josephus
   represents Saul as seated with Jonathan on his right hand and Abner on
   his left. The terms "kingdom" and "glory" are here used synonymously.
   Despite the fact that Jesus was now telling them plainly of his death,
   these apostles could not rid their minds of the delusion that he was
   about to ascend the earthly throne of David.] ^a 22 But Jesus answered
   and said, ^b unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink
   of the cup that I drink? { ^a that I am about to drink?} ^b or to be
   baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? [The word "cup"
   among the Hebrews meant a portion assigned (Ps. xvi. 5; xxiii. 5),
   whether of pleasure or of sorrow. But the idea of sorrow usually
   predominated (Matt. xxvi. 39, 42; Rev. xiv. 10; xvi. 19; xviii. 6; Ps.
   lxxv. 8; Isa. li. 17; Jer. xxv. 15). To be baptized with suffering
   means to be overwhelmed with it, a metaphorical use of the word arising
   from the fact that it means an immersion. This metaphorical use of
   baptism aids us to understand the meaning of that word, for neither
   sprinkling nor pouring could have suggested the overpowering force
   which the metaphor implies. Alford distinguishes between cup and
   baptism, making the former refer to inward spiritual suffering, and the
   latter to outer persecution and trial.] 39 And they said { ^a say} unto
   him, We are able. ^b And Jesus said { ^a saith} unto them, My { ^b The}
   cup that I drink ^a indeed ye shall drink: ^b and with the baptism that
   I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized [They probably thought that
   Jesus referred to some battle or conflict which would attend the
   ushering in of the kingdom, and as they were not wanting in physical
   courage, they were ready enough to pledge themselves to endure it. They
   spoke with unwarranted self-confidence, but Jesus rebuked them very
   gently, as he foreknew what suffering they would indeed endure. James
   was the first apostolic martyr (Acts xii. 2), and John's spirit was
   sorely troubled with the conflict of error, as his epistles show, and
   his last days were darkened by the shadow of persecution--Rev. i. 9]:
   40 but to sit on my right hand or { ^a and} on my left hand, is not
   mine to give; ^b but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared. ^a
   of my Father. [Future rewards are indeed meted out by the hand of
   Christ (II. Tim. iv. 8; Rev. ii. 10, 17, 26, 28; iii. 12, 21, et al.),
   but they are not distributed according to caprice or favoritism, but
   according to the will of the Father and the rules which he has
   established. Jesus proceeds to set forth the principles by which places
   of honor are obtained in his kingdom.] 24 And when the ten heard it,
   they were { ^b began to be} ^a moved with indignation concerning the
   two brethren. ^b James and John 42 And { ^a but} Jesus called them unto
   him, and said { ^b saith} unto them, Ye know that they who are
   accounted to rule over { ^a the rulers of} the Gentiles lord it over
   them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 26 Not so
   shall it be { ^b 43 But it is not so} among you: but whosoever would
   become great among you, shall be your minister; 44 and whosoever would
   be first among you, ^a shall be your servant: ^b shall be servant of
   all. [The ten, sharing the same ambition as the two, jealously resented
   their efforts to take unfair advantage of the Lord's known affection
   for them. To restore peace among them, and to correct their false
   views, he draws the distinction between the worldly greatness to which
   they aspired, and the spiritual greatness which they ought to have
   sought. In an earthly kingdom honor and authority measure greatness,
   but in Christ's kingdom it is measured by humility and service. Jesus
   added power to his rebuke by showing them that their spirit was not
   even Jewish, but altogether heathenish.] 45 For { ^a 28 even as} ^b the
   Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
   give his life a ransom for many. [He enforces this lesson by his own
   example in that he came to serve men and not to have them serve him.
   Jesus could ever refer to himself as the best example of the virtues
   which he taught. Since honor consists in being like the King, the
   highest honor consists in being most like him. The closing words state
   the vicarious nature of Christ's suffering as plainly as language can
   express it. The ransom is offered for all (I. Tim. ii. 6), and will be
   efficacious for as many as accept it. The words are nearly a
   reproduction of the words of Isaiah--Isa. liii. 12 .]

BartimÆus and His Companion Healed.

(at Jericho.)

^A Matt. XX. 29-34; ^B Mark X. 46-52; ^C Luke XVIII. 35-43.

   ^c 35 And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain
   blind man sat by the way side begging: 36 and hearing a multitude going
   by, he inquired what this meant. 37 And they told him that Jesus of
   Nazareth passeth by. [Jesus came from the Jordan, and was entering
   Jericho by its eastern gate. As the crowd following Jesus passed by,
   Bartimæus asked its meaning and learned of the presence of Jesus. Jesus
   on this last journey went in advance of the crowd, and hence he had
   already entered Jericho before the sounds of the following multitude
   roused the beggar to question its meaning. Knowing that Jesus was on
   the way to Jerusalem, he resolved to avail himself of the opportunity
   to be healed by him before he left the neighborhood. Not knowing how
   long Jesus would remain in Jericho, and not being sure of his ability
   to find him if he entered the city, he appears to have passed around
   the wall till he came to the southern gate, by which Jesus would depart
   on his way to Jerusalem. Here he stationed himself and waited patiently
   for the coming of Jesus. The persistency with which he cried when Jesus
   again appeared goes far to corroborate this determined preparation and
   fixed expectation of the beggar. While he waited at the southern gate
   the events narrated in [5]Sec. CIII. occurred. But to avoid confusion
   we omit them for the present, that we may finish the story of
   Bartimæus.] ^b 46 And they come to Jericho: and as he { ^a they} ^b
   went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, ^a a
   great multitude followed him. [Being so near the Passover season, great
   crowds would be on their way to Jerusalem, and all the multitudes
   coming from Galilee and from Peræa would pass through Jericho on their
   way thither. Jesus, as we have just seen, had entered the city with a
   multitude, and as he spent some little time there, he would leave with
   even a larger crowd, for it would be augmented by those who had arrived
   at Jericho during his stay there and citizens of Jericho itself. Few
   would leave Jericho alone while they might have the pleasure and
   excitement of going with the crowd.] ^b The son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus
   [Bar is the Aramaic form for son. It is likely that both Timæus and
   Bartimæus were well known in apostolic days, but all memory of them is
   now lost save that contained in this passage] , a blind beggar
   [blindness and beggary form an awful combination, and when coupled with
   the general poverty then prevailing in Palestine, they suggest a
   fullness of suffering], was sitting by the way side. ^a 30 And, behold,
   two blind men sitting by the way side [Here Matthew tells of two, while
   Mark and Luke tell only of one--the principal one. They vary here as in
   the account of the two demoniacs, and for similar reasons. See page
   346], when they { ^b he} ^a heard ^b that it was Jesus the Nazarene, ^a
   that Jesus was passing by { ^b he} began to cry { ^a cried} out, ^b and
   say, { ^a saying,} Lord, ^b Jesus, thou son of David, ^a have mercy on
   us, { ^c me.} [The title "son of David" was the popular Jewish
   designation for the Messiah, and Bartimæus thus confessed his faith in
   the Messiahship of Jesus. Blind as he was, he saw more than those who
   spoke of the Lord as Jesus of Nazareth, thus making Jesus differ from
   other men merely in the matter of his residence.] 39 And they that went
   before [they that came out of the city just ahead of Jesus] { ^b many
   ^a the multitude} rebuked them, { ^c him} ^a that they { ^b he} ^a
   should hold their { ^b his} peace: ^a but they { ^c he} cried out the
   more a great deal, ^a saying, Lord, have mercy on us, { ^b me.} ^a thou
   son of David. [Various motives influenced the multitude to silence the
   beggar's cries. Some regarded his clamor as indecorous, distracting the
   thoughts and interrupting conversation. Others did not like to hear
   Jesus thus confessed as Messiah. Others still, believing that Jesus was
   about to be crowned king, thought that it was high time that he should
   cease paying so much attention to beggars and begin to assume the
   dignities of royalty. But Bartimæus was filled with the spirit of
   Jacob. The more resistance he met, the more strenuously he wrestled to
   obtain the blessing.] 32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, ^c and
   commanded him to be brought unto him: ^b and said, Call ye him. And
   they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he
   calleth thee. [The multitude had rebuked the cry, but Jesus stood still
   to hear and answer it. He is no respecter of persons. Rich rulers and
   blind beggars received his attention and care without respect of
   station. He died for every man.] 50 And he, casting away his garment,
   sprang up, and came to Jesus. [He cast off his outer garment or
   pallium, which was like a large shawl thrown over the shoulders, and is
   elsewhere called a cloak (see p. 245). It probably represented more
   than half the beggar's wealth, but he valued his eyesight more than it,
   and cast it aside because it hindered him in reaching Jesus through the
   crowd. Many to-day would come to Jesus, but their steps are impeded by
   some trifling obstacle (Isa. lxiv. 6). In the race to win the presence
   of Christ on high, Christians are advised to lay aside every
   weight--Heb. xii. 1, 2.] ^c and when he was come near, ^b Jesus
   answered him, ^c asked him, ^b and said, ^a What will ye { ^c wilt
   thou} ^a that I should do unto you? { ^b thee?} ^a 33 They say { ^b And
   the blind man said} ^a unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. ^c
   Lord, ^b Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. [Bartimæus had cried for
   mercy without specifying what mercy, and he had asked this mercy of
   Christ as the Messiah. The Lord therefore in his royal majesty asked
   Bartimæus to name the mercy, thus suggesting to him the fullness of the
   treasury of power and grace, to which he came. He was not to blame for
   this.] ^a 34 And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their
   eyes; ^b 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; ^c Receive thy sight:
   thy faith hath made thee whole. [We can see in this instance what faith
   really is. It caused Bartimæus to cry out, to come to Jesus and to ask
   for sight. Thus we see that faith saves by leading to proper actions.]
   43 And immediately ^a straightway they { ^c he} ^a received their { ^b
   his} sight, ^a and followed him. ^b in the way. ^c glorifying God: and
   all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. [Being a
   beggar, it would have been natural for him to hunt first for means of
   livelihood, but faith and gratitude prompted him to follow Jesus.]

CIII.

ZacchÆus. Parable of the Pounds. Journey to Jerusalem.

(Jericho.)

^C Luke XIX. 1-28.

   ^c 1 And he entered and was passing through Jericho. [This was about
   one week before the crucifixion. Jericho is about seven miles from the
   Jordan and about seventeen and a half from Jerusalem.] 2 And behold, a
   man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was
   rich. [See p. 76. It is probable that Zacchæus was a sub-contractor
   under some Roman knight who had bought the privilege of collecting
   taxes at Jericho, or perhaps the privilege of all Judæa. As the Jordan
   separated between the provinces of Judæa and Peræa, and as Jericho was
   the border city between these two provinces, the custom duties of the
   place were apt to be considerable. The famous balm of Gilead was
   cultivated in Peræa, and probably added considerably to the trade which
   passed through Jericho. Herod the Great had raised Jericho to opulence,
   and to be rich in such a city was no small matter. Zacchæus had not
   consented to become a social outcast without reaping his reward.] 3 And
   he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because
   he was little of stature. [Jericho had been filled with reports about
   Jesus, and great excitement existed among the people. Zacchæus shared
   this excitement.] 4 And he ran on before, and climbed up into a
   sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. [This tree
   differs from the sycamine, and grows only in those parts of Palestine
   where the climate is warmest. It is the wild fig, and because of its
   low trunk and spreading branches it is very easy to climb. The sycamore
   which grows along our streams is the "buttonwood," and is in no way
   related to the fig family.] 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he
   looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
   to-day I must abide at thy house. [This is the only instance where
   Jesus invited himself to be any man's guest. He knew the feeling of
   Zacchæus toward him as well as he knew his name, and hence had no doubt
   as to his welcome. Jesus says, "I must." Love constrained him to pause
   in Jericho that he might save the house of Zacchæus.] 6 And he made
   haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. [Glad that he had
   obtained not only the wished-for sight of Jesus, but a favor which he
   had not dared to hope for. To be thus honored of the Messiah was balm
   indeed to the outcast's heart.] 7 And when they saw it, they all
   murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.
   [See pp. 349 and 499. The "all" in this case did not include Jesus'
   disciples. Jesus was a constant disappointment to those who were
   seeking to make him an earthly king and who therefore desired him to
   manifest a kingly pride.] 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the
   Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I
   have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. [Zacchæus
   stood to give emphasis and publicity to his words. He does not mean
   that he is in the habit of giving half his goods to the poor, but that
   he does so now, immediately, on the spot, without delay. He does not
   merely promise to do so hereafter, or to make such a provision in his
   will. The laws of restoration in cases of theft or fraud will be found
   at Ex. xxii. 1-4; Num. v. 7. The proposition of Zacchæus to restore
   fourfold suggests that the bulk of his wealth had not been gained in
   dishonest ways, for if so he would not have been able to make such a
   restitution.] 9 And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to
   this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of
   man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. [The visit of
   Jesus had converted Zacchæus and brought salvation to his house. Though
   as yet Jesus was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
   (Matt. xv. 24), and was not proclaiming salvation to the Gentiles, yet
   he could consistently receive Zacchæus, for, though an outcast
   publican, he had not so forfeited his sonship in Abraham as to bar him
   from this right. He was one of the "lost sheep," the very class to
   which Jesus was sent.] 11 And as they heard these things, he added and
   spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they
   supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear. [The
   opening words show that the parable which follows was spoken in the
   house of Zacchæus. So far as the record shows, this was the first time
   in his ministry that Jesus ever approached Jerusalem with a crowd. By
   thus approaching Jerusalem with a multitude it seemed to the people
   that Jesus was consenting to be crowned. And they were filled with
   those dreams and expectations which a few days later resulted in the
   triumphal entry. All things pointed to a crisis, and the people were
   eagerly looking for honors and rewards under the new ruler. Jesus
   corrected these false views by a parable which showed that there must
   be patient waiting and faithful work before there could be any season
   of reward.] 12 A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive
   for himself a kingdom, and to return. [Those present were looking for
   the crowning of Jesus at Jerusalem, but he was to ascend into that far
   country called heaven and was there to receive the kingdom of the earth
   ( Acts ii. 32, 33; Matt. xxviii. 18), and his return in earthly majesty
   is yet to take place--I. Cor. xi. 26. 13 And he called ten servants of
   his, and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye herewith
   till I come. [To each of the servants he gave a crown, which was equal
   to about seventeen dollars of our money. It was a paltry sum for a
   nobleman and suggests a state of poverty and humiliation such as would
   give small incentive to any to remain faithful to his service.] 14 But
   his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We
   will not that this man reign over us. [In addition to the servants,
   this nobleman had citizens, or subjects who owed him respect and
   reverence pending the confirmation of his kingdom, and homage and
   obedience after that confirmation. But their hatred of him led them to
   oppose his confirmation, saying, "We will not," etc. These citizens
   represented the Jews, and Theophylact well observes how near the Jews
   came to repeating these very words of rejection when they said to
   Pilate, "We have no king but Cæsar . . . Write not, The King of the
   Jews."] 15 And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having
   received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he
   had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they
   had gained by trading. 16 And the first came before him, saying, Lord,
   thy pound hath made ten pounds more. [Thus Jesus shall call us to
   account for our stewardship (II. Cor. v. 10), and some, despite the
   long absence of their Lord, and the rebellion of the citizens, will be
   found to have been faithful. As to this servant's answer Grotius says
   (comparing it with I. Cor. xv. 10), "He modestly attributes this to his
   lord's money, and not to his own work."] 17 And he said unto him, Well
   done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very
   little, have thou authority over ten cities. [Thus by small
   faithfulness we are proved worthy of great trust (II. Cor. iv. 17). We
   should note that while the bounty is royal, yet it is proportionate. It
   suggests the difference in estate between the nobleman who departed and
   the king who returned.] 18 And the second came, saying, Thy pound,
   Lord, hath gained five pounds. 19 And he said unto him also, Be thou
   also over five cities. [The faithful servants are promoted to be rulers
   (II. Tim. ii. 1, 2). The nobleman, having been of low estate himself,
   could sympathize with his servants and delight in promoting them--Phil.
   ii. 7.] 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
   which I have kept laid up in a napkin [Having no banks in which to
   store money, such as we have, the men of Palestine usually concealed
   it. At the present time the people of that land are accustomed to bury
   their money in the ground within their houses]: 21 for I feared thee,
   because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst
   not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow. [He impudently
   criticizes his lord, saying that he was one hard to please and one who
   expected others to do all the work and let him reap all the gain. The
   injustice of his criticism had just been exposed beforehand by the
   king's treatment of the two preceding servants. This servant represents
   those who make the labors and difficulties of the Christian life an
   excuse for doing nothing.] 22 He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth
   will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an
   austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that
   which I did not sow; 23 then wherefore gavest thou not my money into
   the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?
   [The king patiently grants for argument's sake all that is urged, but
   shows that even so, the conduct of this servant could not be justified.
   Thus no argument can justify the sinner who contends against God. The
   word here translated "bank" means the table of the money-changer and is
   so translated at Matt. xxi. 12; Mark xi. 15, and John ii. 15. It would
   appear from this passage that the money-changers were willing to borrow
   and pay some rate of interest. The bank, therefore, was not a thing
   incorporated and watched by the government, but merely an individual
   with whom money might be secure or not, according to his personal
   honesty. Our present banking system has been the slow growth of many
   centuries. The lesson taught is that we should work with others if we
   have not self-confidence enough to work alone.] 24 And he said unto
   them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it unto him that
   hath ten pounds. 25 And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
   26 I say unto you, that unto every one which hath shall be given; but
   from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away
   from him. [See p. 331. The meaning here is that every one who makes use
   of what he has shall increase his powers, a rule which applies to all
   the affairs of life.] 27 But these mine enemies, that would not that I
   should reign over them bring hither, and slay them before me. [A
   reference in the first instance to the Jews who were citizens of
   Christ's kingdom and who were justly destroyed for rejecting him when
   he ascended his throne. A reference in the second instance to all the
   inhabitants of the globe who are all in his kingdom and who shall be
   destroyed at his coming if they have rejected him. It is a fearful
   thing to contemplate the destruction of sinners, but it is more fearful
   to think of sin, rebellion and uncleanness being tolerated forever.] 28
   And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
   [The crowd had paused, waiting for Jesus, and he now leads on toward
   Jerusalem.]

Jesus Arrives and is Feasted at Bethany.

(from Friday Afternoon Till Saturday Night, March 31 and April 1, a.d. 30.)

^D John XI. 55-57; XII. 1-11; ^A Matt. XXVI. 6-13; ^B Mark XIV. 3-9.

   ^d 55 Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to
   Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.
   [These Jews went up before the Passover that they might have time to
   purify themselves from ceremonial uncleanness before the feast. They
   were expected to purify before any important event (Ex. xix. 10, 11),
   and did so before the passover (II. Chron. xxx. 13-20), for those who
   were ceremonially unclean were excluded from it--John xviii. 28.] 56
   They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they
   stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?
   57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment,
   that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might
   take him. [The decree of the Sanhedrin ordering the arrest of Jesus led
   the people to question as to whether he would dare to approach the
   city. But this mention of it and the stir and question which it created
   have a dark significance. It shows that the Jews generally were
   forewarned of the evil purpose of the Sanhedrin, and the dangers which
   surrounded Jesus. They were not taken unawares when their rulers told
   them to raise the cry "Crucify him!" And they raised it after they had
   due notice and time for deliberation.] ^d 1 Jesus therefore six days
   before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus
   raised from the dead. [The word "therefore" refers to the decree and
   consequent dangers just mentioned. Because his "hour" had come, Jesus
   went to face these dangers. We are told that he came to the house of
   Lazarus and that he kept near Lazarus because these facts emphasized
   the great miracle which roused the hatred of the Jews, and caused them
   more earnestly to seek the death of Christ. Jesus appears to have
   arrived in Bethany Friday afternoon, March 31, a.d. 30. It is likely
   that he spent the Sabbath day at that place, and that the supper
   mentioned below was given him after sunset on Saturday, which,
   according to Jewish reckoning, would be the beginning of Sunday. This
   supper is mentioned later by Matthew and Mark, but without any note of
   time to show that it belongs specifically where they put it. But John
   does give us a note of time. The twelfth verse of this chapter shows
   that it was the night before the triumphal entry, and therefore we
   follow the chronology of John.] 2 So ^a 6 Now when Jesus was in
   Bethany, ^d they made him a supper there: ^a in the house of Simon the
   leper, ^d and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at
   meat with him. [Who Simon the leper was is not known. It is not
   unlikely that he was one whom Jesus had healed, and that he united with
   the household of Lazarus in a joint effort to show gratitude unto the
   Lord for his goodness to this group of his friends.] ^b 3 And while he
   was [there] as he sat at meat, there came ^a unto him a woman { ^d 3
   Mary} ^a having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, ^b
   of pure nard very costly; ^d 3 Mary therefore took a pound [a litra, a
   Greek weight containing nearly twelve ounces avoirdupois] of ointment
   of pure nard, very precious [Nard was a liquid perfume distilled from
   some odorous plant or plants and mingled with oil. It was sealed in
   flasks or alabaster boxes and imported from the far East], ^b and she
   brake the cruse, and poured it over { ^a upon} ^b his head. ^a as he
   sat at meat. ^d and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with
   her hair [The cruse seems to have been a long-necked flask sealed with
   wax so tightly as to necessitate it being broken to extract the nard.
   These flasks were tasteful and costly objects such as women delight to
   possess. Many of them were so delicate that Pliny compares them to
   closed rosebuds, and the same writer, speaking of nard, reckons it as
   an instance of excessive luxury to anoint the feet or ankles with it]:
   and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. [Thus the
   liberality of Mary contributed to the pleasure of all the guests. The
   odor of a good deed is generally diffusive.] 4 But Judas Iscariot, one
   of his disciples, that should betray him, saith, 5 Why was not this
   ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? 6 Now
   this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a
   thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein. ^a 8 But when
   the disciples saw it, they { ^b there were some that} had indignation
   among themselves, ^a saying, To what purpose is this waste? ^b To what
   purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made? 5 For this ointment
   might have been sold ^a for much, ^b for above three hundred shillings,
   and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. [It seems very
   likely that this murmuring was started by Judas Iscariot, for the
   murmurers fall in with his notions that the price of the ointment
   should be deposited in the poor fund. It is a singular thing that Jesus
   permitted a thief to occupy the office of treasurer. It is probable
   that Judas was honest when he was called to serve, but that same
   management and spirit of economy which made him fit for the place
   ruined him when he got it. Thus our strong points are often our
   weakest. The price of the pound of nard would be about fifty-one
   dollars of our money, but the purchasing power of money was then nearly
   ten times as great as it is now. The price here named agrees almost
   exactly with the figures at which Pliny rates the most costly nard.] ^a
   10 But Jesus perceiving it, ^d therefore said, ^a unto them, ^b Let her
   alone; ^a Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work
   upon me. ^d Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying. ^a 12
   For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to
   prepare me for burial. ^b 8 She hath done what she could; hath anointed
   my body beforehand for the burying. [The expression "Suffer," etc.,
   used by John, is taken by some as implying that all the ointment was
   not poured out, and that some of the apostles were endeavoring to
   persuade Mary to keep and sell what was left, and that Jesus ordered it
   kept to finish the embalming of his body which Mary had already begun.
   But there is nothing in the language to require such an interpretation.
   Jesus meant, "Let her use it rightly," using the word "keep" as in the
   expression, "keep the feast;" i. e., observe the ceremony. The words of
   Jesus about the ointment taken as a whole may be construed thus: "The
   sorrows of my coming passion oppress me (Matt. xxvi. 38), and Mary,
   conscious of that sorrow, wishes to cheer me with the evidence of love
   and gratitude. She sympathizes with me as I approach the shadow of
   death, and anoints me beforehand for the burial. You do not begrudge
   what is given to the dead. You do not censure as extravagant what is
   spent for the embalming of a dear one. You yourselves would be ready
   enough to anoint me in this same manner after I am dead. So do not
   censure her because in the fullness of her sympathy she has anticipated
   the coming catastrophe and has anointed me beforehand."] ^d 8 For the
   poor ye have always with you [Deut. xv. 11 ]; ^b and whensoever ye will
   ye can do them good: but me ye have not always. [There would be plenty
   of opportunities in which to do good to the poor, but the time for
   conferring a personal benefit upon Christ in the flesh was now limited
   to seven days. Thereafter gifts could only be given to Christ by
   bestowing them upon the poor.] 9 And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever
   the { ^a this} gospel shall be preached in { ^b throughout} the whole
   world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a
   memorial of her. [Jesus here makes prominent the different estimates
   which God and man place upon the same acts. That which the disciples
   had censured as a waste and that which they had regarded as worthy of
   rebuke was in his sight an action fit to be kept in everlasting
   remembrance as a model for the conduct of future generations throughout
   the whole earth, and he accordingly decreed that it be so kept in
   mind.] ^d 9 The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was
   there [in Simon's house]: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but
   that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead, 10
   But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to
   death; 11 because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away
   [withdrew from the party headed by the Jewish rulers], and believed on
   Jesus. [The presence of the resurrected man and the Christ who had
   resurrected him both at one table greatly excited the curiosity of the
   multitudes who had come up to Jerusalem to attend the passover. When
   word of this supper spread among the people it was natural that they
   should slip out to Bethany to see the sight, and it was equally natural
   that seeing it they should believe in Jesus. This deflection of the
   common people gave a keener venom to the hatred of the rulers.]

Jesus' Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem.

(from Bethany to Jerusalem and Back, Sunday, April 2, a.d. 30.)

^A Matt. XXI. 1-12, 14-17; ^B Mark XI. 1-11; ^C Luke XIX. 29-44; ^D John XII.
12-19.

   ^c 29 And ^d 12 On the morrow [after the feast in the house of Simon
   the leper] ^c it came to pass, when he he drew nigh unto Bethphage and
   Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, ^a 1 And when they came
   nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage unto { ^b at} ^a the mount
   of Olives [The name, Bethphage, is said to mean house of figs, but the
   derivation is disputed. Canon Cook and others think that the region on
   the eastern slope of Olivet was called Bethphage, and that Bethany was
   located in it. If it was a village, all trace of it has long since
   vanished, and it is not worth while to give the guesses and surmises of
   commentators as to its location. But it was evidently near Bethany],
   then Jesus sent { ^b sendeth} two of his { ^c the} disciples, ^b 2 and
   saith { ^a 2 saying} unto them, ^c Go your way into the village
   [probably Bethphage, for Jesus started from Bethany] ^a that is over
   against you, ^b and straightway as ye enter into it, ^a ye shall find
   an ass tied, and a colt ^b tied, ^a with her: ^b whereon no man ever
   sat; loose him, { ^a them, } ^b and bring him. { ^a them } unto me.
   [Numerous Scripture references show that the ass was held in high
   estimation in the East. The sons of the judges used them, and David's
   mule was used at the coronation of Solomon (Judg. x. 4; I. Kings i.
   33). It is specifically stated that no man had ever sat upon this colt,
   for if the colt had been used by men it would have been unfit for
   sacred purposes--Num. xix. 2; Deut. xxi. 3; I. Sam. vi. 7.] 3 And if
   any one say aught unto you, 31; ^c And if any one ask you, { ^b say
   unto you,} Why do ye this? ^c Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say,
   The Lord hath need of him. { ^a them;} ^b and straightway he will send
   him. { ^a them.} ^b back hither. [The owner of the ass was no doubt a
   disciple or well-wisher of Jesus, and therefore readily consented to
   respond to the Master's need. Such a well-wisher might readily be found
   in a multitude ready to lay their garments in the road to honor Christ.
   The words "send him back" are usually construed to be a promise on the
   part of Christ that he would return the colt when through with him. But
   such a promise seems rather out of keeping with the dignity of the
   occasion. We prefer to construe the words as referring to the movements
   of Christ's two messengers from the neighborhood of Bethany to
   Bethphage and back again, or to a backward movement along the caravan's
   line of march.] ^a 4 Now this is come to pass, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 5 Tell ye the
   daughter of Zion [the poetical name for the city of Jerusalem], Behold,
   thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and riding upon an ass, And upon a
   colt the foal of an ass. [The prophecy is a combination of Isa. lxii.
   11 and Zech. ix. 9. This is the only instance in which Jesus rode. He
   entered in meekness, for the ass was a symbol of peace as the horse was
   of war (Job xxxix. 19-25), but there was nothing degrading about riding
   such a beast. The Eastern ass is smaller, but livelier, and better
   framed than the specimens found in our country. They constituted a
   chief asset in the property of the wealthy--Gen. xii. 16; xxx. 43; Job
   xlii. 12; I. Chron. xxvii. 30; I. Kings i. 38.] 6 And the disciples {
   ^c they} that were sent away, ^a and did even as Jesus appointed them,
   ^c and found even as he had said unto them ^b a colt tied at the door
   without in the open street [the streets being narrow, one would very
   seldom see an ass tied in one]; and they loose him. ^c 33 And as they
   were loosing the colt, ^b certain of them that stood there ^c the
   owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? ^b What do ye,
   loosing the colt? 6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and
   they let them go. 7 And they bring { ^a brought} the ass, and the colt,
   { ^c him} ^b unto Jesus, ^a and put on them their garments [The
   garments were the loose cloaks worn over the tunics or shirts. This
   cloak survives in the abba or hyke of the modern Arab. The unbroken
   colt would of course have no saddle, and these loyal disciples lent
   their cloaks to supply the deficiency, and to do Jesus royal honor.
   Compare the enthronement of Jehu (II. Kings ix. 13). They prepared both
   beasts, not knowing which he would choose to ride]; ^c and they threw {
   ^b cast} ^c their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon. ^a and
   he sat thereon. { ^b upon him.} ^d a great multitude that had come to
   the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 13 took
   the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him [Palm-trees
   were never abundant in Palestine, but there were many around Jericho,
   through which city these Galilean pilgrims had so recently come. They
   were date palms, the leaves of which were often ten feet in length.
   They are now comparatively rare, but are found in the plains of
   Philistia. The palm branch is emblematic of triumph and victory--Lev.
   xxiii. 40; Rev. vii. 9; I. Macc. xiii. 51; II. Macc. x. 7], and cried
   out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even
   the King of Israel [The shouting appears to have been started by those
   who came out of Jerusalem; it is evident, therefore, that the apostles
   who were approaching the city with Jesus had nothing to do with
   inciting this praise.] 14 And Jesus having found a young ass, sat
   thereon; as it is written, 15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy
   King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 16 These things understood not
   his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then
   remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they
   had done these things unto him. [The apostles were not conscious that
   the prophecies were being fulfilled nor did they understand that Jesus
   was approaching a heavenly rather than an earthly coronation. But after
   Jesus was glorified, their understandings were spiritually illuminated
   (John xvi. 13). They not only remembered the prophecy, but saw in what
   sense it was that Jesus was king, and how badly mistaken they had been
   when they expected him to antagonize the Romans. The greatness of her
   king would have removed all cause for fear if Jerusalem had but
   accepted him.] 17 The multitude therefore that was with him when he
   called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare
   witness. [The two parts of the miracle--the calling and the
   raising--are both mentioned as alike impressive, sublime, and
   wonderful.] 18 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for
   that they heard that he had done this sign. [It is evident from this
   that the testimony of those who witnessed the raising of Lazarus had
   enthused the pilgrims in Jerusalem and had sent a large band of them
   forth charged with that ardent admiration which produced the shouting
   of the triumphal entry.] 19 The Pharisees therefore said among
   themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after
   him. [Again, as at John xi. 47-49, we notice the self-confessed
   impotency of the Pharisees, but the Sadducees, under the determined and
   more resolute leadership of Caiaphas, did not participate in this
   despair. The Pharisees speak of the world as if its acquisition by
   Jesus was their loss.] ^c 36 And as he went, ^a the most part of the
   multitude { ^b many} [Matthew would have us know that the demonstration
   was no small affair, but was well-nigh universal. Josephus estimates
   that the number present at one passover was three million, or about
   one-half the population of Judæa and Galilee. The language of the
   Pharisees in verse 19 above--"the world"--shows that there must have
   been indeed an immense multitude. The people had always been ready to
   acknowledge Jesus as king, and, seeing that he had now an evident
   disposition to accept their homage, they hastened to render it] spread
   their garments { ^a in} ^b the way; and others ^a spread ^b branches,
   ^a in the way. ^b which they { ^a cut} ^b had cut from the fields. { ^a
   trees,} [It has been the custom of all lands to bestrew in some manner
   the pathway of those who are thought worthy of the highest honor. When
   Lafayette visited our fathers after the Revolution, the roads over
   which he approached our cities were strewn with flowers. Thus over
   flowers Alexander entered Babylon, and Xerxes crossed the bridge of the
   Hellespont over a myrtle-strewn pathway. Monier tells of a Persian
   ruler who in modern times made his honored progress over a road for
   three miles covered with roses. But it is more natural to contrast the
   entry of Jesus with the Roman triumphs so popular in that day. The
   wealth of conquered kingdoms was expended to insure their magnificence.
   We find none of that tinsel and specious glitter in the triumph of
   Christ. No hired multitudes applaud him; no gold-broidered banners wave
   in his honor. There is nothing here but the lusty, honest shout of the
   common people, and the swaying of the God-made banners of the royal
   palms. The rich in purse, the learned in schoolcraft and the high in
   office were, as usual, not there--I. Cor. i. 26.] ^c 37 And as he was
   now drawing nigh, even at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole
   multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud
   voice for all the mighty works which they had seen [John has shown us
   just above that the raising of Lazarus was most prominent in their
   thoughts]; ^a 9 The multitudes that went before him, and that followed
   [Jesus approached the city leading a multitude of pilgrims, and we have
   seen from John's account above that another multitude came out of the
   city to meet him: Jesus approached the city between two great
   multitudes.] cried, saying, ^b Hosanna [This is the Greek form or
   spelling of two Hebrew words, Hoshiah-na, which means, Save now, or,
   Save, I pray, na being a particle of entreaty added to imperatives. The
   two words are taken from Ps. cxviii. 25, which was recognized as the
   Messianic Psalm. The shout "Hosanna" was customarily used at the feast
   of the tabernacles and the other festivals. It was a shout of
   exaltation about equivalent to "Salvation"]; ^a Hosanna to the Son of
   David [see p. 357]: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord
   [Ps. cxviii. 26]; ^c blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the
   Lord: ^b 10 blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our
   father David: ^c peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. ^a Hosanna
   in the highest. [This phrase is taken to mean in the highest degree or
   highest strains or in the highest heavens. It is likely they were
   calling upon heaven to participate in glorifying and to ratify their
   shouts of salvation. The Evangelists give us the various cries of the
   multitude, for they did not all cry one thing. The cries, if seriously
   construed, were a fore-recognition of the Messiahship of Jesus, but
   popular cries are soon caught up and are as fickle as the impulses
   which beget them. But the public recognition of the Messiahship of
   Jesus gave weight to the accusation made by Simon Peter on the day of
   Pentecost that they had slain the Messiah--Acts ii. 36. Comp. Acts iii.
   14, 15.] ^c 39 And some of the Pharisees from the multitude [not a
   committee sent from Jerusalem for that purpose] said unto him, Teacher,
   rebuke thy disciples. [It is possible that these may have been moved
   with an honest fear that the enthusiasm of the people would call down
   the vengeance of the Romans (John xi. 48), but it is more likely that
   they were prompted solely by envy.] 40 And he answered and said, I tell
   you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
   [The expression is probably proverbial (Hab. ii. 11). The meaning is
   that the occasion of the great King's visit to his city (Matt. v. 35)
   was so momentous that, if man withheld his praise, inanimate nature
   would lend its acclamations.] 41 And when he drew nigh, he saw the city
   and wept over it, 42 saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even
   thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from
   thine eyes. [The summit of Olivet is two hundred feet higher than the
   nearest part of the city of Jerusalem and a hundred feet higher than
   its farthest part, so that the Lord looked upon the whole of it as one
   looks upon an open book. As he looked upon it he realized the
   difference between what his coming might mean to it and what it did
   mean to it; between the love and gratitude which his coming should have
   incited and the hatred and violence which it did incite; between the
   forgiveness, blessing and peace which he desired to bring it and the
   judgment, wrath and destruction which were coming upon it. The vision
   of it all excited strong emotion, and the verb used does not indicate
   silent tears, but audible sobbing and lamentation. The day then passing
   was among the last before the crucifixion, which would present to the
   Jews a strong motive for repentance. Had Jerusalem hearkened unto Jesus
   then, he would have saved her from that self-exaltation which proved
   her ruin. But bigotry and prejudice blinded her eyes.] 43 For the days
   shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about
   thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side. [from
   where Jesus then stood he could see the houses which were to be thrown
   down, he could locate the embankments which would be built, and he
   could trace almost every foot of the line of the wall by which Titus in
   his anger girdled the city when his embankments were burned--Jos. Wars
   V. 6. 2, 11. 4-6, 12. 1, 2], 44 and shall dash thee to the ground, and
   thy children within thee [the city is figuratively spoken of as a
   mother, and her citizens as her children]; and they shall not leave in
   thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy
   visitation. [The term "visitation" usually refers to a season of
   judgment, but here, as elsewhere also (Ex. iv. 31), it means a season
   of grace. To not leave one stone upon another is a proverbial
   expression descriptive of a complete demotion, but in the overthrow of
   Jerusalem it was well-nigh literally fulfilled. Thus, while the people
   rejoiced in the present triumph, the prophetic eye and ear of our Lord
   beheld the judgments which were coming upon the city, heard the bitter
   cry of the starved defenders during the siege, the screams of the
   crucified left to perish upon their crosses after its capture, all
   ending in the final silence of desolation when not one stone was left
   upon another.] ^b 11 And he entered into Jerusalem [his route led him
   down the steep face of Olivet, past Gethsemane, across the stone bridge
   which spans the Kedron, and up the slope of Moriah to the eastern gate
   of the city], ^a 10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city
   was stirred, saying, Who is this? 11 And the multitude said, This is
   the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee. 12 And Jesus entered into
   the temple of God [here Matthew tells of the cleansing of the temple,
   which evidently occurred the next day], 14 And the blind and the lame
   came to him in the temple; and he healed them. 15 But when the chief
   priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the
   children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son
   of David; they were sore displeased, 16 and said unto him, Hearest thou
   what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; did ye never read [Ps.
   viii. 2 as rendered by the LXX.] , Out of the mouth of babes and
   sucklings thou hast perfected praise? [Matthew mingles this scene with
   events which apparently occurred on Monday, but the enthusiasm and the
   Hosanna cry evidently belonged to the triumphant Sunday. The presence
   of our Lord in the temple should, indeed, have been heralded with joy,
   for as that was the day in which the paschal lamb was presented and set
   apart, it was fitting that Christ our passover should be presented
   there amidst rejoicing.] ^b and when he had looked round about upon all
   things, it being now eventide. [a general expression covering the
   period both before and after sunset], ^a he left them, and went forth
   out of the city ^b unto Bethany with the twelve ^a and lodged there.
   [Having inspected the temple as his Father's house, Jesus withdrew from
   it, for in the present state of rancor which fermented within his
   enemies it was not safe for him to spend the night within Jerusalem.]

Barren Fig-Tree. Temple Cleansed.

(Road from Bethany and Jerusalem. Monday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^A Matt. XXI. 18, 19, 12, 13; ^B Mark XI. 12-18; ^C Luke XIX. 45-48.

   ^b 12 And ^a 18 Now ^b on the morrow [on the Monday following the
   triumphal entry], ^a in the morning ^b when they were come out from
   Bethany, ^a as he returned to the city [Jerusalem], he hungered.
   [Breakfast with the Jews came late in the forenoon, and these closing
   days of our Lord's ministry were full of activity that did not have
   time to tarry at Bethany for it. Our Lord's hunger implies that of the
   disciples also.] 19 And seeing a fig tree by the way side, ^b afar off
   having leaves, ^a he came to it, ^b if haply he might find anything
   thereon: and when he came to it, he ^a found nothing but leaves only;
   ^b for it was not the season of figs. [Two varieties of figs are common
   in Palestine. The bicura or boccore, an early fig with large green
   leaves and with fruit which ripens in May or June, and sometimes
   earlier near Jerusalem. Thomson found ripe fruit of this variety as
   early as May in the mountains of Lebanon, a hundred fifty miles north
   of Jerusalem, and Professor Post, of Beyrut, states that fig-trees
   there have fruit formed as early as February, which is fully ripe in
   April. The second variety is the summer fig or kermus. This ripens its
   main crop in August, but its later fruitage often hangs on all winter
   when the weather is mild, dropping off when the new spring leaves come.
   As the fruit usually appears before the leaves, the leaves were a
   promise that fruit might be found, and the fruit, though not perfectly
   ripe, is considered edible when the leaves are developed. Though it was
   too early for fruit, it was also too early for leaves. The tree
   evidently had an unusually favorable position. It seemed to vaunt
   itself by being in advance of the other trees, and to challenge the
   wayfarer to come and refresh himself.] 14 And he answered and said { ^a
   saith} unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever.
   ^b No man eat fruit of thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples
   heard it. ^a And immediately the fig tree withered away. [The disciples
   did not pause to watch the effect of Christ's words upon the tree. But
   from the degree to which it had shriveled when they saw it next day it
   became evident to them that it had begun to wither as soon as Christ
   had finished uttering its sentence. Our Lord here performed a miracle
   of judgment unlike any other of his wonderful works. The reader can
   hardly fail to note how perfectly this fig-tree, in its separation from
   the other trees, its showy pretensions, its barrenness of results and
   its judgment typifies the Jewish people. In fact, Christ's treatment of
   it appears in some respects to be a visible and practical application
   of the principles which he had formerly set forth in a parable (Luke
   xiii. 6-9). But we must not too confidently make such an application of
   the parable since Jesus himself gave no hint that he intended us so to
   apply it.] ^b 15 And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the
   temple, and began to cast out ^a all them that sold ^b and them that
   bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers,
   and the seats of them that sold the doves [three years before, Jesus
   had thus cleansed the temple at the first passover of his ministry, for
   an account of which see pp. 121-125]; 16 and he would not suffer that
   any man should carry a vessel through the temple. [The temple space
   being level and roomy tempted the people of Jerusalem to use it as a
   thoroughfare, or short-cut from one part of the city to another, but
   Jesus did not permit them to carry any sack, bag, jug, pail, basket,
   parcel or such like thing through the sacred enclosure. The Greek word
   skeuos which is here translated "vessel" embraces all kinds of
   household furniture. It is translated "goods" at Matt. xii. 29 and Luke
   xvii. 31. The LXX. uses it as equivalent to "instruments of war" at
   Deut. i. 41, and to "vestments" at Deut. xxii. 5.] 17 And he taught,
   and said { ^a saith} ^c 46 Saying unto them, It is written [the
   prophecy cited is a combination of Isa. lvi. 7 and Jer. vii. 11], { ^b
   Is it not written,} ^c And my house shall be { ^b shall be called} a
   house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made { ^a ye make} it
   a den of robbers. [The caves in certain sections of Palestine have been
   immemorially infested with robbers, and Jesus, because of the injustice
   of extortion practiced by the merchants, likens the polluted temple to
   such a den. The dickering and chafing and market talk were probably not
   unlike the grumbling and quarreling of thieves as they divide the
   booty.] ^b 18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and
   sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, ^c 47 And he
   was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes
   and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him: 48 and they
   could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him,
   listening ^b for all the people was astonished at his teaching.
   [Overawed by the magnitude of the popular demonstration made on Sunday,
   the Jewish rulers feared to attempt any violent measures in dealing
   with Jesus. But they neglected no opportunity by appeals to Jesus
   himself, by treacherous questions, etc., to divert the popular favor
   from the Lord that they might put him to death.]

Finding the Fig-Tree Withered.

(Road from Bethany to Jerusalem, Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^A Matt. XXI. 20-22; ^B Mark XI. 19-25; ^C Luke XXI. 37, 38.

   ^c 37 And every day he was teaching in the temple [he was there Sunday,
   Monday and Tuesday, but he seems to have spent Wednesday and Thursday
   in Bethany]; and every night { ^b evening} he went forth out out of the
   city. ^c and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet. [As Bethany was
   on the Mount of Olives, this statement leaves us free to suppose that
   he spent his nights there, but it is not likely that he retired to any
   one house or place continuously, for had he done so the rulers could
   easily have ascertained his whereabouts and arrested him.] 38 And all
   the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
   [The enthusiasm of the triumphal entry did not die out in a day: Jesus
   was still the center of observation.] ^b 20 And as they passed by in
   the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. [It
   was completely withered--dead root and branch. We have observed before,
   p. 578, that one coming into Jerusalem from Bethany is apt to come down
   the steep side of Olivet, and that one returning to Bethany is apt to
   take the easier grade, though longer way, around the south end of the
   mountain. This fig-tree was apparently on this short road, and was
   sentenced Monday morning. The disciples, returning by the other or
   longer road to Bethany or its vicinity, did not see the tree Monday
   evening, but they saw it Tuesday morning, when they again came back by
   the short road. From these facts argue a method of coming and going,
   from which it may be fairly inferred that Jesus, on the day of his
   triumphal entry, approached Jerusalem by the short road, though
   Stanley, Edersheim, and many others, think he came in over the long
   road.] ^a 20 When the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did
   the fig tree immediately wither away? [Jesus had simply condemned it to
   fruitlessness, but his condemnation involved it in an evil which it
   justly deserved. The judgment of God reveals; and that which is dead in
   fact is made dead in appearance also.] ^b 21 And Peter calling to
   remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou
   cursedst [devotedst to death] is withered away. [Peter is surprised
   both at the suddenness and at the fullness of the judgment. Since the
   miracles of Jesus, heretofore, had been only those of mercy, Peter
   boldly invited the Lord to discuss this miracle, hoping for more light
   on its meaning.] 22 And Jesus answering saith { ^a answered and said}
   unto them, ^b Have faith in God. 23 Verily I say unto you, ^a If ye
   have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig
   tree, but even if ye { ^b whosoever} shall say unto this mountain
   [Olivet], Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt
   in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he
   shall have it. ^a it shall be done. 22 And ^b 24 Therefore I say unto
   you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, { ^a ye shall ask in
   prayer,} ^b believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. { ^a
   believing, ye shall receive.} [Jesus here lays down the broad general
   rule in the application of which we must be guided by other Scriptures.
   The rule is, indeed, liberal and gracious, and the limitations are just
   and reasonable. We must not expect to obtain that which it is unlawful
   for us to desire (Jas. iv. 2, 3), or which it is unwise for us to seek
   (II. Cor. xii. 7-9), nor must we selfishly run counter to the will of
   God ( Luke xxii. 42; I. John v. 14, 15), nor must we expect that God
   shall perform a miracle for us, for miracles have ceased--in short, we
   must pray to God in full remembrance of the relationship between us, we
   must consider that he is the Ruler and we his subjects, and are not to
   think for one moment that by faith we can alter this eternal,
   unchangeable relation. The disciples whom Jesus addressed were very
   soon to enter upon a task which would seem to them as difficult as the
   removal of mountains. The license and immorality of paganism, and the
   bigotry and prejudice of Judaism, would seem insurmountable obstacles
   in their pathway to success. They needed to be assured that the power
   of faith was superior to all these adverse forces, and that the
   judgments of God could accomplish in a moment changes which apparently
   could not be wrought out in the tedious course of years. As we to-day
   look back upon this promise of Christ we can see that the mountains
   then standing have, indeed, been removed; and that which seemed
   vigorous and flourishing has been blasted in a day.] ^b 25 And
   whensoever ye stand [a customary attitude--Luke xviii. 13] praying,
   forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is
   in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. [Forgiveness has already
   been enjoined (see pp. 253, 254). Here our Lord emphasizes the need of
   forgiveness because he had just performed a miracle of judgment, and he
   wished his disciples to understand that they must not exercise their
   miraculous gifts with a vengeful, unforgiving spirit. They must suffer
   evil and not retaliate with miracles of judgment.]

In Reply to the Questions as to His Authority, Jesus Gives the Third Great Group
of Parables.

(in the Court of the Temple. Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

Subdivision A.

Introduction

^A Matt. XXI. 23-27; ^B Mark XI. 27-33; ^C Luke XX. 1-8.

   ^c 1 And it came to pass, on one of the days, ^b they [Jesus and the
   disciples] come again to Jerusalem: ^a 23 And when he was come into the
   temple, ^b and as he was walking in the temple [The large outer court
   of the temple, known as the court of the Gentiles, was thronged during
   the feasts, and was no doubt the part selected by Jesus and his
   apostles when they taught or preached in the temple. We thrice find
   them on that side of it where Solomon's porch was located--John x. 23;
   Acts iii. 11; v. 23], ^c as he was teaching the people and preaching
   the gospel [viz.: "the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at
   hand: repent ye"--Mark i. 15], there came upon him { ^b come ^a unto
   him} ^b the chief priests and the scribes, and { ^c with} the elders; {
   ^a of the people} [the Sanhedrin (see p. 415). This committee of that
   august tribunal came in formal state and with a great show of
   authority, hoping to make it apparent to the people that Jesus was an
   unauthorized, self-appointed meddler in matters over which they had
   exclusive control.] ^c 2 and they spake, ^b 28 and they said { ^c
   saying} unto him Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? ^a
   and { ^c or} who is he that gave thee this authority? ^b to do these
   things? [To regulate and control the affairs of the temple belonged
   unquestionably and exclusively to the priests and Levites. Knowing that
   Jesus had no authority from any priest or any scribe, they boldly
   challenged his right to cleanse the temple or to teach in it, feeling
   sure that to defend himself he would be forced to publicly declare
   himself as the Messiah and thus to give them the matter for accusation
   which they had long sought--John x. 24.] ^a 24 And Jesus answered and
   said unto them, ^c I also will ask you a { ^a one} question, which if
   ye tell me, ^b and answer me, ^a I likewise will tell you by what
   authority I do these things. 25 The baptism of John, whence was it? ^b
   Was it from heaven, or from men? answer me. [The question which Jesus
   asked was intimately and inseparably connected with the question which
   they had asked. Jesus, of course, did not derive his authority from
   John the Baptist, but John had testified plainly to the Messiahship of
   Jesus, and had, in no uncertain terms, designated Jesus as immeasurably
   greater than himself. Now, if the Pharisees admitted that John was a
   heaven-sent messenger or witness (of which fact his baptism was
   propounded as a test, since it was a religious ordinance introduced on
   his authority), then John had already answered the Sanhedrin that Jesus
   derived his authority from his Messiahship, and hence, all that the
   Sanhedrin had to do to satisfy their minds was simply to believe John.
   But if, on the other hand, the Pharisees rejected John's pretensions
   and claims as a heaven-sent messenger in the face of the almost
   universal popular conviction, then what was there for Jesus to present
   his claims to so blind, bigoted, and unreasoning a body?] 31 And they
   reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will
   say, ^a unto us, Why then did ye not believe him? [When he testified to
   the Messiahship of Jesus ( John i. 7, 15, 34; iii. 26-36; x. 40-42).
   The Sanhedrin could not admit that the messenger was heaven-sent and
   yet deny his testimony.] 26 But if we shall { ^b should we} say, From
   men-- ^c all the people will stone us: ^a we fear the multitude; for
   all hold John as a prophet. ^c for they are persuaded that John was a
   prophet. ^b they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a
   prophet. 33 And they answered Jesus ^c that they knew not whence it
   was. ^a and said, { ^b say,} We know not. [It should be noted in their
   consultation there was no effort either to ascertain or to speak the
   truth. The question as to whether John really was or was not a prophet
   was in no sense the subject of their investigation. They were merely
   deciding what to say. They were seeking for the most expedient answer,
   and as neither truthful answer was expedient, they resolved to falsely
   deny any knowledge of the case. Men of such brazen dishonesty could not
   be dealt with openly and fairly as could sincere seekers after truth.]
   And Jesus, ^a also said { ^b saith} unto them, Neither tell I you by
   what authority I do these things. [Their spoken lie was, "We know not,"
   but their inward and true answer was, "We will not tell," and Jesus
   answered the suppressed truth saying, "Neither tell I." How readily the
   subtle minds of the Jewish people would justify Jesus in thus declining
   to submit the question of his authority to judges who at that very
   moment publicly confessed their inability to even hazard an opinion,
   much less render a decision, as to the authority of John the Baptist,
   who claims were in popular estimation so obvious. It was plain that
   however well these men might judge human credentials, the divine
   testimonials of a prophet or of the Messiah were above their carnal
   sphere. Thus Jesus put his enemies to confusion in the first of man
   conflicts of that perilous Tuesday. But we may well imagine that they
   were rendered more bitter by the evidence of a wisdom so much beyond
   any which they possessed.]

Subdivision B.

Parable of the Two Sons.

^A Matt. XXI. 28-32.

   ^a 28 But what think ye? [By these words Jesus put them on notice that
   he was about to propound something which would require an answer, and
   therefore demanding the strictest attention.] A man had two sons [the
   two sons stand for the Jewish rulers and the Jewish common people]; and
   he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard. 29
   And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented
   himself, and went. [The common people made no special pretension to
   religious excellence, and the rulers regarded them as very careless
   about the will or law of their Father, God, and made disparaging
   contrasts between their own conduct and that of the people (John vii.
   48, 49). But this very same common people repented and did the will of
   God when they heard the preaching of John the Baptist--Matt. iii. 5,
   6.] 30 And he came to the second [the rulers], and said likewise. And
   he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. [The rulers, though all
   the while professing to be very zealous for the will of God, utterly
   refused to enter the kingdom or to work therein as God bade them to by
   the voice of John the Baptist--Matt. iii. 7-9.] 31 Which of the two did
   the will of his father? They say, The first. [They gave the true answer
   and did not perceive that in so doing they confirmed a parable which
   condemned themselves.] Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you,
   that the publicans and the harlots [the very worst representatives of
   the common people] go into the kingdom of God before you. [Rather than
   you.] 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness [The term
   "righteousness," as Plumptre observes, seems used in a half-technical
   sense, as expecting the aspect of righteousness which the Pharisees
   themselves recognized (Matt. vi. 1), and which includes, as its three
   great elements, the almsgiving, fasting, and prayer that were so
   conspicuous both in the life and the teaching of the Baptist. Surely
   they could have presented its demands in a form more acceptable to the
   Jewish rulers], and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the
   harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent
   yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him. [The parable of this
   subdivision is the outgrowth of the preceding subdivision. These rulers
   had demanded that Jesus show his authority for his assumption of right
   as teacher, prophet, etc. The parable is an indirect response to this
   demand, as if Jesus said, "It is in vain for me to tell you that I act
   under the authority of the Father, for despite all your great
   profession to the contrary, you really and actually, in your persistent
   rejection of another (the Baptist), who also acted under it, repudiate
   utterly his authority; though in so doing you see yourselves condemned
   by the conduct of even the publicans and harlots, who have felt the
   force of the Father's authority, and have repentantly obeyed it." The
   situation must have given great force to the parable; for the rulers in
   their private conversation had just admitted to each other that the
   people recognized and obeyed the divine authority of John, while they,
   the rulers, rejected it.]

Subdivision C.

Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen.

^A Matt. XXI. 33-46; ^B Mark XII. 1-12; ^C Luke XX. 9-19.

   ^b 1 And he began to speak unto them ^c the people [not the rulers] ^b
   in parables. { ^c this parable:} ^a 33 Hear another parable: There was
   a man that was a householder [this party represents God], who planted a
   vineyard [this represents the Hebrew nationality], and set a hedge
   about it, and digged a ^b pit for the ^a winepress in it [The winepress
   consisted of two tub-shaped cavities dug in the rock at different
   levels, the upper being connected with the lower by an orifice cut
   through from its bottom. Grapes were placed in the upper cavity, or
   trough, and were trodden by foot. The juice thus squeezed from them ran
   through the orifice to the trough below, from which it was taken and
   stored in leather bottles until it fermented and formed wine], and
   built a tower [a place where watchmen could be stationed to protect the
   vineyard from thieves as the grapes ripened for the vintage], and let
   it out to husbandmen [the rulers are here represented; and the rental
   was, as usual, a part of the fruits], and went into another country. ^c
   for a long time. [Jesus frequently refers to this withdrawal of the
   visible presence of God from the world, always bringing out the point
   that the withdrawal tests faithfulness. God had come down upon Mt.
   Sinai, given the law and established the Hebrew nation, after which he
   had withdrawn. That had indeed been a long time ago; and for four
   hundred years before the appearance of John the Baptist, God had not
   even sent a messenger to demand fruit. Some think the hedge refers to
   the manner in which Palestine was protected by sea and desert and
   mountain, but the hedge and the winepress and the tower are mere
   parabolic drapery, for every man who planted a vineyard did all three.]
   ^a 34 And when { ^c at} the season ^a of the fruits drew near, ^c he
   sent unto the husbandmen a servant, { ^a his servants} i. e., the
   prophets] ^c that they should give him { ^b that he might receive ^a to
   receive from the husbandmen} of the { ^a his} ^b fruits of the
   vineyard. [Luke iii. 8--He expected the children of Israel to bring
   forth joy, love, peace, and all the other goodly fruit of a godly life.
   And he looked to those in authority to bring forth such results, and
   the prophets were sent to the rulers to encourage them to do this.] 3
   And { ^c but} the husbandmen ^b took him, and beat him, and sent him
   away empty, 4 And again he sent unto them ^c yet another servant: him
   also they beat, ^b wounded in his head, and handled shamefully. ^c and
   sent him away empty. ^b 5 And he sent ^c yet ^b another; ^c a third:
   and him also they wounded, ^b and him they killed: ^c and cast him
   forth. ^b and many others; beating some, and killing some. ^a 35 And
   the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and
   stoned another. 36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first:
   and they did unto them in like manner. [For the treatment of the
   prophets, see such passages as I. Kings xviii. 13; xxii. 24-27; II.
   Kings vi. 31; II. Chron. xxiv. 19-22; xxxvi. 15, 16. For a summary of
   the treatment of the prophets or messengers of God, see Heb. xi.
   35-38.] 37 But ^b 6 He had yet one, a beloved son: ^a afterward ^b he
   sent him last unto them, ^c 13 And the lord of the vineyard said, { ^b
   saying,} ^c What shall I do? [Isa. v. 4.] I will send my beloved son;
   it may be they will reverence him. ^b They will reverence my son. [The
   lord of the vineyard was thoroughly perplexed. The conduct of his
   husbandmen was outrageous beyond all expectation. He had no better
   servants to send them unless his only son should take upon him the form
   of a servant and visit them (Phil. ii. 5-8). Being tender and
   forgiving, and unwilling to resort to extreme measures, the lord of the
   vineyard resolved to thus send his son, feeling sure that the son would
   represent the person, authority and rights of the father so much better
   than any other messenger (Heb. i. 1-5; ii. 1-3), that it would be
   well-nigh impossible for the husbandmen to fail of reverence towards
   him. In striking contrast, however, with this expectation of the
   Father, the rulers, or the husbandmen, had just now harshly demanded of
   the Son that he tell by what authority he did anything in the
   vineyard.] ^a 38 But the { ^b those} ^a husbandmen, when they saw { ^c
   him} ^a the son, ^c they reasoned one with another, ^a said among
   themselves, { ^c saying,} ^a This is the heir; come, let us kill him,
   and take his inheritance. ^c that the inheritance may be ours. ^b and
   the inheritance shall be ours. [In thus bringing the story down to the
   immediate present, and stating a counsel which his enemies had just
   spoken privately in each other's ears, Jesus must have startled them
   greatly. He showed them, too, that those things which made them deem it
   necessary to kill him were the very things which proved his heirship.
   They regarded the Jewish nation as their property, and they were
   plotting to kill Jesus that they might withhold it from him (John xii.
   19; xi. 47-50). That men might hope by such high-handed lawlessness to
   obtain a title to a vineyard seems incredible to us who have always
   been familiar with the even-balanced justice of constitutional
   government; but in the East the looseness of governments, the selfish
   apathy and lack of public spirit among the people, and the corrupt
   bribe-receiving habits of the judges makes our Lord's picture even to
   this day, though rather exceptional, still true to life. At this point
   Jesus turns from history to prophecy.] 8 And they took him, ^c 15 And
   they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. [After two
   intervening days the Jews would fulfill this detail by thrusting Jesus
   outside the walls of Jerusalem and crucifying him there.] ^a 40 When
   therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto
   those husbandmen? 41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those
   miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who
   shall render him the fruits in their seasons. ^c 16 [Jesus said] He
   will come and destroy these { ^b the} husbandmen, and will give the
   vineyard unto others. ^c And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
   [Part of the multitude, hearing only the story, pronounced
   unhesitatingly the judgment which ought to be inflicted upon such
   evil-doers, and Jesus confirmed their judgment. But others, perceiving
   the meaning underlying the parable, shrank from accepting what would
   otherwise have been to them a very proper ending, and said, Mee
   genoito, which means literally, Be it not so, and which might properly
   be paraphrased by our emphatic "Never!" but which the revisers in
   translating have, with small warrant, seen fit to paraphrase by using
   the semi-profane expression, "God forbid." There are fourteen such
   mistranslations in the epistles of Paul according to the King James
   version and only one of them (Gal. vi. 14) is corrected in the Revised
   version. In defense of these translations it is asserted that the
   phrase is an idiomatic invocation of the Deity, but the case can not be
   made out, since the Deity is not addressed.] 17 But he looked upon them
   [Thus emphasizing the fact that they had repudiated a most just decree.
   His look, doubtless, resembled that of a parent surprised at the
   outspoken rebellion of his children], and ^a 42 Jesus saith { ^c said,}
   ^a unto them, ^c What then is this that is written, ^b 10 Have ye not
   read even this scripture: ^a Did ye never read in the scriptures, ^c
   The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of
   the corner? ^a This was from the Lord, And it is marvellous in our
   eyes? [The quotation is from Ps. cxviii. 22, 23, which is here by Jesus
   applied as a prophecy to the Pharisees, who, in their treatment of him,
   were like unskilled builders who reject the very corner-stone of the
   building which they seek to erect. The Pharisees were eager enough in
   their desire to set up a Messianic kingdom, but were so blindly foolish
   that they did not see that this kingdom could not be set up unless it
   rested upon Christ Jesus, its corner-stone. They blundered in
   constructing their theory of the coming kingdom, and could find no room
   for one such as Jesus in it.] 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom
   of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing
   forth the fruits thereof. 44 And he { ^c 18 Every one} ^a that falleth
   on this { ^c that} ^a stone shall be broken to pieces: but on
   whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust. [The stone, of
   course, represents Jesus, and the two fallings set forth his passive
   and active state. In the day when he passively submitted to be judged,
   those who condemned him were broken ( Matt. xxvii. 3-5; Luke xxiii. 48;
   Acts ii. 37); but in the great day when he himself becomes the acting
   party and calls his enemies to judgment, they shall prefer, and pray,
   that a mountain fall upon them--Rev. vi. 15-17.] 45 And when the chief
   priests and Pharisees, ^c 19 And the scribes ^a heard his parables,
   they ^c sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, ^b for they
   perceived that he ^a spake of them. ^b spake the { ^c this} parable
   against them. ^a 46 And when they sought to lay hands on him, ^c they
   feared the people: { ^b multitude; ^a multitudes,} because they took
   him for a prophet. ^b and they left him, and went away. [Despite the
   warning which Jesus gave them that they were killing the Son and would
   reap the consequences, and despite the fact that he showed that the
   Psalm which the people had used so recently with regard to him foretold
   a great rejection which would prove to be a mistake, yet the rulers
   persisted in their evil intention to take his life, and were only
   restrained by fear of the people, many of whom were Galilæans, men of
   rugged courage, ready to draw swords on Jesus' behalf. Since they could
   neither arrest nor answer him, they withdrew as a committee, but
   returned again in the person of their spies.]

Parable of the Marriage of the King's Son.

^A Matt. XXII. 1-14.

   ^a 1 And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,
   2 The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a
   marriage feast for his son, 3 and sent forth his servants to call them
   that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come. 4
   Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden,
   Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are
   killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast. 5 But
   they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm,
   another to his merchandise; 6 and the rest laid hold on his servants,
   and treated them shamefully, and killed them. 7 But the king was wroth;
   and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their
   city. 8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
   that were bidden were not worthy. 9 Go ye therefore unto the partings
   of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage
   feast. 10 And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
   together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding
   was filled with guests. [This parable is very much like the one given
   in Luke xiv. 16-24--see pp. 495-497. [9] ] 11 But when the king came in
   to behold the guests, he saw there a man [this one man is a type of
   many--see verse 14] who had not on a wedding-garment: 12 and he saith
   unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a
   wedding-garment? And he was speechless. [We are of the opinion that the
   king furnished upper garments to his guests. But the antiquity of this
   custom is disputed. See Meyer, Lange and Trench, etc. in loco. However,
   the fact is immaterial, for the man was speechless--without
   excuse--which shows that he could have had a garment from some source
   had he chosen to wear it.] 13 Then the king said to the servants, Bind
   him hand and foot [the phrase suggests the impossibility of escaping
   from divine judgment], and cast him out into the outer darkness [the
   outdoor darkness: wedding feasts were usually held at night]; there
   shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 14 For many are called,
   but few chosen. [Many guests are invited, but few are accepted; because
   some neglect and despise the invitation, and others cast dishonor upon
   the one who invites, by the self-willed and irreverent way in which
   they accept his invitation. In this parable the first parties invited
   represent the Jews; the city of murderers is Jerusalem; the persons
   called from the highways are the Gentiles; the entrance of the king is
   the coming of the Lord to final judgment; and the man without the
   wedding-garment is anyone who will be found in the church without a
   suitable character. The character of Christ is our wedding-garment, and
   all the regenerated must wear it--Eph. iv. 24; Col. iii. 10; Gal. iii.
   27; John iii. 5; Rev. xix. 8, 9.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] * NOTE.--I regard this parable as a remodeling of the parable given
   by Luke, the changes being made to suit the changed relation between
   Jesus and his auditors. In the parable in Luke, God is represented as
   one who invites us as a friend, and whose invitation is simply
   disregarded. Since the speaking of that parable, the situation had
   become more tense and the relations more strained, and hence the
   parable takes on a more severe form. The host is not to be disregarded,
   for he is a king, and the supper is not to be despised, for it is a
   marriage supper. The invitation, therefore, savors of commandment, and
   while some still continue to treat it with indifference, others feel
   the constraint of the invitation and reject it in a spirit of rebellion
   which manifests itself in violence toward the king's servants. The
   king, in turn, is moved by this to retaliate, and visits upon the
   offenders an overwhelming judgment.--P. Y. P.

Pharisees and Herodians Ask About Tribute.

^A Matt. XXII. 15-22; ^B Mark XII. 13-17; ^C Luke XX. 20-26.

   ^a 15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare
   him in his talk. ^c 20 And they watched him, and sent forth { ^b send
   unto him} ^a their disciples, ^b certain of the Pharisees and of { ^a
   with} ^b the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. [Perceiving
   that Jesus, when on his guard, was too wise for them, the Pharisees
   thought it best to speak their cunning through the mouths of their
   young disciples, whose youth and apparent desire to know the truth
   would, according to their calculation, take Jesus off his guard. Having
   no ancient statement giving us the tenets or principles of the
   Herodians, we are left to judge them solely by their name, which shows
   that they were partisans of Herod Antipas. Whether they were
   out-and-out supporters of the Roman government, or whether they clung
   to Herod as one whose intervening sovereignty saved them from the worse
   fate of being directly under a Roman procurator (as Judæa and Samaria
   then were), would not, as some suppose, affect their views as to the
   payment of tribute. If they accepted Herod merely for policy's sake,
   policy would also compel them to favor the tribute, for Antipas, being
   appointed by Rome, would have to favor the tribute, and could count
   none as his adherents who opposed it.] ^c spies, who feigned themselves
   to righteous [sincere seekers after truth], that they might take hold
   of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority
   of the governor. [Pontius Pilate was the governor. We are not surprised
   at the destruction of Jerusalem when we see the religious teachers of
   the nation employing their young disciples in such a work as this. To
   play detective and entrap a rogue in his speech and thus become a
   man-hunter is debasing enough; but to seek thus to entrap a righteous
   man is simply diabolical.] ^b 14 And when they were come, they say unto
   him, { ^c saying,} Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest
   rightly, ^b we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for
   thou regardest not the person of men, ^c and acceptest not the person
   of any, but of a truth teachest the way of God: ^a in truth [The
   meaning of their preface is this: "We see that neither fear nor respect
   for the Pharisees or the rulers prevents you from speaking the plain,
   disagreeable truth; and we are persuaded that your courage and love of
   truth will lead you to speak the same way in political matters, and
   that you will not be deterred therefrom by any fear or reverence for
   Cæsar." Fearless loyalty to truth is indeed one of the noblest
   attributes of man. But instead of honoring this most admirable quality
   in Jesus, these hardened reprobates were endeavoring to employ it as an
   instrument for his destruction], 17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest
   thou? ^c 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not? ^b
   15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? [The Jews were required to pay
   annually a large sum of money to the Roman government as an
   acknowledgment of their subjection. About twenty years before this
   Judas of Galilee had stirred up the people to resist this tribute, and
   the mass of the Jews was bitterly opposed to it. To decide in favor of
   this tribute was therefore to alienate the affection and confidence of
   the throng in the temple who stood listening to him--an end most
   desirable to the Pharisees. If, on the other hand, Jesus said that the
   tribute should not be paid, the Herodians were present to hear it, and
   would be witnesses sanctioned by Herod, and therefore such as Pilate
   would be compelled to respect. What but divine wisdom could escape from
   so cunningly devised a dilemma!] ^a 18 But Jesus perceived their
   wickedness, ^c craftiness, ^b knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them,
   { ^a and said} Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites? [Thus, before
   answering, Jesus exposes the meanness and hypocrisy in their question,
   thereby emphasizing the important fact that he did not dodge, but
   answered it.] 19 Show me the tribute money. ^c 24 Show me a denarius.
   ^b bring me a denarius, that I may see it. [Religious dues and tributes
   had been paid in shekels or old Jewish coin, but the tribute to Rome
   was paid in Roman coin of which the denarius was a sample.] ^a And they
   brought unto him a denarius. [See p. 376.] 20 And he saith unto them,
   Whose is this image and superscription? ^c Whose image and
   superscription hath it? [The little silver coin had the head of the
   emperor stamped upon it, and the superscription
   TICAESARDIVIAVGFAVGVSTVS, which stands for the words Tiberias Cæsar,
   Divi Augusti Filius Augustus; i. e., Tiberius Cæsar, the August Son of
   the Divine Augustus.] And they said, { ^a say} unto him, Cæsar's. ^b 17
   And ^a Then ^b Jesus said { ^a saith} ^b unto them, ^c Then render ^a
   therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's; and unto God the
   things that are God's. [Each nation uses its own coin. Had the Jews not
   been under Roman sovereignty, they would not have been using Roman
   money; but the coin which they brought to Jesus bore witness against
   them that the Roman sovereignty was established in their land, and that
   tribute to it was therefore justly due; for whoso uses Cæsar's coin
   must pay Cæsar's tribute. This part of the answer satisfied the
   Herodians; and the last part "and unto God," etc., satisfied the
   people, for it asserted, in a manner which carried conviction with it,
   that the payment of enforced tribute was not inconsistent with
   maintaining complete allegiance of God. God was no longer, as of old,
   the civil ruler of his people, and hence the payment of tribute to a
   temporal sovereign is in no sense incompatible with his service, but is
   enjoined as a Christian duty--Rom. xiii. 1, 7.] ^c 26 And they were not
   able to take hold of the saying before the people: ^a 22 And when they
   heard it, they marvelled, ^b greatly at him. ^c at his answer, and held
   their peace. ^a and left him, and went away. [They were amazed to find
   how far his wisdom transcended that of the teachers in whom they had
   such supreme confidence.]

   ^c having a wife, and he be childless, { ^b and leave a wife behind
   him, and leave no child,} that his brother should take his { ^c the}
   wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. ^a Moses said, If a man die,
   having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
   unto his brother. 25 Now there were ^c therefore ^a with us seven
   brethren: and the first ^c took a wife, ^a married and deceased, ^b and
   dying left no seed; { ^c and died childless;} ^a and, having no seed
   left his wife unto his brother: ^b 21 And ^a 26 In like manner the
   second also, ^b took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the
   third likewise: ^c took her; ^a unto the seventh. ^c and likewise the
   seven also left no children, { ^b left no seed.} ^c and died. 32
   Afterward ^b Last of all ^a 27 And after them all, ^b the woman also
   died. ^a 28 In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of
   the seven? { ^b of them?} for the seven ^a all had her. ^b to wife.
   [This was evidently a favorite Sadducean argument against the
   resurrection. On the assumption that the marital state is continued
   after the resurrection, it makes the doctrine of a resurrection appear
   ridiculous, because, seemingly, it involves difficulties which even
   brothers could hardly settle amicably, and which even God would have in
   a sense to settle arbitrarily.] ^c 34 And { ^a 29 But} Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Ye do not err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the
   power of God. ^b Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not
   the scriptures, nor the power of God? [The relevancy of these
   statements will be discussed in the treatment of verse 38 below.] ^a 30
   For ^c the sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage: 35 but
   they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the
   resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
   ^b 25 For when they shall rise from the dead, ^a in the resurrection
   they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in
   heaven. ^c 36 for neither can they die any more: for they are equal
   unto the angels; and are the sons of God, being the sons of the
   resurrection. [This favorite argument of the Sadducees could not be
   successfully answered by the Pharisees because they could not refute
   the assumption that marriage is continued in the future world. But
   Jesus does refute it on his own authority.] ^a 31 But as touching the
   resurrection of the dead, ^c that the dead are raised, even Moses
   showed, in the place concerning the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the
   God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, ^b have ye
   not read in the book of Moses, ^a that which was spoken unto you by
   God, ^b how God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? ^c 38 Now ^a God is not ^c the
   God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. ^b ye do
   greatly err. [The disbelief of the Sadducees manifested itself in a
   triple form, for they denied the resurrection and the existence of
   angels and spirits (Acts xxiii. 8), but the basal principle of their
   infidelity was the denial of spirits. It was, as it were, the tree
   trunk from which their other errors sprang as branches. If there were
   such things as spirits, it was not worth while to deny that there was
   an order of them known as angels. If man had a spirit which could
   survive his body, it was reasonable to believe that God, having so
   fashioned him that a body is essential to his activity and happiness,
   would in some manner restore a body to him. Jesus therefore does not
   pursue the argument until he has proved a resurrection; but rests when
   he has proved that man has a spirit. Jesus proves that man has a spirit
   by a reference from the Pentateuch, that part of Scripture which the
   Sadducees accepted as derived from God through Moses. The reference
   shows that God was spoken of and spoke of himself as the God of those
   who were, humanly speaking, long since dead. But the Sadducees held
   that a dead man had ceased to exist, that he had vanished to
   nothingness. According to their view, therefore, God had styled himself
   the God of nothing, which is absurd. The Sadducees could not thus have
   erred had they known or understood the significance of this Scripture,
   and they could not have doubted the resurrection had they known the
   absolute power with which God deals with material such as that of which
   the body is formed. See verses 24 and 39 supra.] ^a 33 And when the
   multitude heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. ^c 39 And
   certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
   [Some of the scribes of less bitter spirit could not refrain from
   expressing their admiration at the ease with which Jesus answered an
   argument which their own wisdom could not refute.]

A Lawyer Asks About the Great Commandment.

^A Matt. XXII. 34-40; ^B Mark XII. 28-34; ^C Luke XX. 40.

   ^a 34 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees
   to silence, gathered themselves together. 35 And one of them, a lawyer,
   ^b one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and
   knowing that he had answered them well, ^a asked him a question, trying
   him [he was evidently deputed by those who counseled to ask this
   question]: 36 Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law? ^b
   What commandment is the first of all? [According to the statement of
   Jewish writers, there had been an old and interminable dispute among
   the rabbis as to which was the greatest commandment. Some held that it
   was the law which commanded sacrifices; others, that which commanded
   the wearing of phylacteries; others contended for those about
   purification; others, for those about the great feasts. But as they
   reckoned the commandments of Moses as numbering over six hundred, there
   was plenty of room for argument. On this memorable day the answers of
   Jesus had hitherto been of such a nature as to put his questioners to
   silence. Therefore, in asking this question, they hoped to get an
   answer about which they could at least find room to wrangle, and thus
   discredit the wisdom of Jesus.] 29 Jesus answered, ^a 37 And said unto
   him, ^b The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is
   one: 30 And ^a Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. ^b and with all thy strength.
   ^a 38 This is the great and first commandment. [Deut. vi. 4-9. This
   command is first because it is the foundation of the entire law of God.
   It is greatest, because, in a sense, it includes all the other laws.
   Polytheism, atheism, idolatry, and all sins against God are forbidden
   by it. All sins against man are likewise, in a sense, prohibited by it;
   for sin against man is sin against God's image, and against the objects
   of God's love. Those who truly love God can not consistently sin
   against man (I. John iv. 20). The curious may make metaphysical
   distinctions in the analysis of this required fourfold love, but the
   sum of it is that we are to love God with our whole being.] 39 And a {
   ^b 31 The} second ^a like unto it ^b is this, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbor as thyself. [Love is the cure for sin, for we can not sin
   against those whom we truly love. Where we love, we desire to bless.
   But sin always carries with it a willingness to injure or to curse.]
   There is none other commandment greater than these. ^a 40 On these two
   commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets. [The generic
   nature of the law of love is also noted by Paul (Rom. xiii. 8-10); but
   love without law is not sufficient. Love begets a desire to bless, but
   the law guides to the accomplishment of that desire. Perfect
   righteousness is the result of wisdom as well as affection. Love
   without law is power without direction, and law without love is
   machinery without a motor--I. Cor. xiii. 1-3.] ^b 32 And the scribe
   said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one;
   and there is none other but he: 33 and to love him with all the heart,
   and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love
   his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings
   and sacrifices. [Here, as in the preceding subdivision, the answer of
   Jesus was so clearly right that it enforced admiration.] 34 And when
   Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not
   far from the kingdom of God. [Prejudice is the great obstacle to
   entering the kingdom. In proportion as we overcome it we draw near to
   God.] And no man after that durst { ^c 40 For they durst not any more}
   ask him any question. [They found it expedient to keep silence when
   their questions only exposed their own shallowness, and made more
   conspicuous the supreme wisdom of Jesus.]

Jesus' Question Which None Could Answer.

^A Matt. XXII. 41-46; ^B Mark XII. 35-37; ^C Luke XX. 41-44.

   ^a 41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, ^b as he taught
   in the temple, ^a Jesus asked them a question [They had questioned him
   seeking to expose his lack of wisdom, but the question of Jesus was
   devoid of retaliation. It was asked to teach a most important lesson],
   ^b 35 And Jesus answered and said, { ^a 42 saying,} ^c unto them, ^a
   What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The
   son of David. [The answer was true, but it was not all the truth as the
   Scriptures themselves showed. And this additional truth was what the
   opposers of Jesus needed to learn.] 43 He saith unto them, ^b How say {
   ^c they} ^b the scribes that the Christ is the son of David? { ^c
   David's son?} ^a How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, ^c 42
   For David himself saith { ^b said} in the Holy Spirit, ^c in the book
   of Psalms, { ^a saying,} ^b The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my
   right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. { ^a
   Till I make thine enemies underneath thy feet?} 45 If ^b 37 David
   himself therefore ^a then calleth him Lord, how ^b and whence is he his
   son? [The quotation is from Psalm cx. The context here shows that the
   rabbis of that day accepted this Psalm as written by David and as
   Messianic in meaning. Since then the Jews have denied that the Psalm is
   Messianic, and that it was written by David; some saying that Abraham,
   and others that Hezekiah, wrote it. This Psalm speaks of the Messiah as
   the Lord of David, and other Scriptures call him David's son. So also
   the Scriptures describe Christ as conquering yet suffering, as divine
   yet human, as dying yet living, as judged yet judging, etc. The Jewish
   rulers seem able to grasp only one side of the character of Christ as
   revealed either in his life or in the Scriptures, and hence they
   stumbled.] ^a 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, neither
   durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. ^b And
   the common people heard him gladly. [By all their questioning, the Jews
   had not been able to weaken public confidence in Christ.]

Jesus' Last Public Discourse. Denunciation of Scribes and Pharisees.

(in the Court of the Temple. Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^A Matt. XXIII. 1-39; ^B Mark XII. 38-40; ^C Luke XX. 45-47.

   ^a 1 Then spake Jesus ^b 38 And in his teaching ^c in the hearing of
   all the people he said unto ^a the multitudes, and to his disciples [he
   spoke in the most public manner], 2 saying, ^c 46 Beware of the
   scribes, ^a The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: 3 all
   things whatsoever they bid you, these do and observe: but do not ye
   after their works: for they say, and do not. [As teachers of the law of
   Moses the scribes and Pharisees were the only religious guides whom the
   people had, so they were obliged to follow them as expounders of that
   law, but they were no means to look to them as living exemplification
   of that law.] 4 Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,
   and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them
   with their fingers. [The law itself was a heavy yoke (Acts xv. 10 ),
   but these teachers added to the burden of it a vast volume of
   traditions, but they themselves did not keep these traditions, excusing
   themselves by inventing subtle distinctions like those in reference to
   the Corban (Matt. xv. 4-6) and to oaths (Matt. xv. 16-22). See p. 314.]
   5 All their works they do to be seen of men [what laws and traditions
   they did keep were not kept privately and sincerely, but publicly that
   they might secure to themselves a reputation for sanctity]: for they
   make broad their phylacteries [Literally, preservatives or
   remembrances. They were probably so called because they were designed
   to aid the wearer in remembering his obligations to the law. They were
   strips of parchment on which were written four passages of the law,
   viz.: Ex. xiii. 3-10; 11-16; Deut. vi. 4-9; xi. 13-21. These were
   enclosed in a leather case and were fastened to the forehead and left
   arm. The authority for wearing them was purely traditional, and the
   practice seems to have arisen from a literal interpretation of Ex.
   xiii. 9, 16; Deut. vi. 8; xi. 18. The Pharisees made the leather case
   large, that their righteousness might be more conspicuous], and enlarge
   the borders of their garments [These were the fringes mentioned in Num.
   xv. 38, 39. But the Pharisees offended again, even in their obedience,
   by wearing broader fringes than other people, that they might appear
   more religious], ^c who desire to walk in long robes [This robe was a
   professional dress, as marked as that worn by priests and kings. It
   showed that its wearer was professionally religious], ^a 6 and love the
   chief places at feasts [see p. 493], and chief seats in the synagogues,
   7 and ^c love ^a the salutations in the marketplaces [see p. 313], and
   to be called of men, Rabbi. [The term "Rabbi" means master or teacher.]
   ^c 47 who { ^b 40 they that} devour widows' houses, and for a pretense
   make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation. [It is
   doubtful in what way the Pharisees devoured widows' houses, or
   property. Godet suggests that they extorted presents under pretense of
   interceding for them in their prayers, and Lightfoot thinks that they
   got the goods of widows "by subtle attractives," and by the management
   of their estates as judges, and as men acquainted with the law and
   therefore fit to administer estates. According to the later rabbinical
   teaching it is urged that a rabbi should pray one hour, and that he
   should meditate for an hour before and an hour after prayer. On days
   when they carried out this rule and the other rule which required three
   seasons of prayer a day, they would spend nine hours in prayer. But
   this was no doubt one of the cases where they said and did not. For
   thus making their religion a cloak for their vices they would be more
   severely punished. As to the particular blackness of the crime of
   robbing widows, see Ex. xxii. 22-24; Deut. xxvii. 19.] ^a 8 But be not
   ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher [Christ], and all ye are
   brethren. 9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
   Father, even he who is in heaven. 10 Neither be ye called masters: for
   one is your Master, even the Christ. 11 But he that is greatest among
   you shall be your servant. [See pp. 557, 558.] 12 And whosoever shall
   exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself
   shall be exalted. [See pp. 431, 494, 537. Thus Jesus reproves those who
   make religion a matter of praise-seeking ostentation, whether they do
   so by seeking position, or by peculiarity of dress, or by assuming or
   accepting titles of honor or distinction. This sin of ostentation was
   the first enumerated sin of the Pharisees.] 13 But woe unto you,
   scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
   against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them
   that are entering in to enter. [Our Lord's language is figurative and
   presents the kingdom of God as a house around the door of which the
   Pharisees have gathered, not entering in themselves, and blocking the
   way against those who would enter. This they did by their opposition to
   Jesus. For a similar charge see p. 315.] 15 Woe unto you, scribes and
   Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one
   proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of
   hell than yourselves. [Proselytes here meant are not those converted
   from heathenism to worship God, but Jews converted to Phariseeism.
   These become worse than their instructors, because each generation
   drifted farther from the law and became more zealously and completely
   devoted to the traditions.] 16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides [Jesus
   above denounced them for their hypocrisy, but this woe is pronounced
   upon them for their ignorance and folly], that say, Whosoever shall
   swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the
   gold of the temple, he is a debtor. [The word "debtor" is here meant to
   describe one who owes it to himself and to God to keep his oath. The
   Pharisees graduated oaths according to their own foolish conceptions of
   the sanctity of the object invoked, so that if the object by which a
   man swore was not sacred enough, he was not forsworn if he did not keep
   his oath. Esteeming the gold of the temple more sacred than the temple
   itself, they held that an oath by the former was binding while an oath
   by the latter was not. The gold meant is probably the golden ornaments
   on the temple.] 17 Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold,
   or the temple that hath sanctified the gold? 18 And, Whosoever shall
   swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the
   gift that is upon it, he is a debtor. 19 Ye blind: for which is
   greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 20 He
   therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things
   thereon. 21 And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
   him that dwelleth therein. 22 And he that sweareth by the heaven,
   sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. [Our
   Lord designed to teach that all oaths were binding. See p. 243.] 23 Woe
   unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and
   anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the
   law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done,
   and not to have left the other undone. [See p. 313. The anise was used
   for medical purposes and also for culinary seasoning, so that Pliny
   says "the kitchen can not be without it." Cummin also was a condiment
   and a medicine, the bruised seed mixed with wine being used as a
   styptic, especially after circumcision. It was also used as an
   ingredient for salves and plasters such as were applied to the ulcers
   of cattle produced from the bites, grubs, etc., of insects.] 24 Ye
   blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel! [A
   proverbial expression, indicating care for little faults and a
   corresponding unconcern for big ones.] 25 Woe unto you, scribes and
   Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the
   platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess. [Jesus
   here compares the Pharisees to a woman who washes the outside of her
   dishes and leaves the inside unclean. But in describing that inner
   uncleanness he passes from the figure to the reality, and specifies
   that it consists of extortion and self-indulgence. They made their
   outside clean by traditionary ablutions. See pp. 393, 394.] 26 Thou
   blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter,
   that the outside thereof may become clean also. [Here again the literal
   peeps through the figurative: a pure inner life makes clean outward
   conduct.] 27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
   are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but
   inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even
   so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are
   full of hypocrisy and iniquity. [Luke records Jesus as having taught
   this lesson by an exactly opposite figure. See p. 313. There men were
   contaminated by the touch of a grave because there was nothing outside
   to notify them of its presence. Here men are contaminated by the same
   thing because the outside is rendered so white and beautiful that men
   are deceived into thinking that the inside is harmless.] 29 Woe unto
   you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of
   the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous, 30 and say, If we
   had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers
   with them in the blood of the prophets. 31 Wherefore ye witness to
   yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets. 32 Fill ye
   up then the measure of your fathers. [See p. 314.] 33 Ye serpents, ye
   offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell? [See p.
   73.] 34 Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
   scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall
   ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city: 35 that
   upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the
   blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of
   Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar. 36 Verily
   I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. [See
   pp. 314, 315.] 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets,
   and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have
   gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
   under her wings, and ye would not! 38 Behold, your house is left unto
   you desolate. 39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth,
   till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

Observing the Offerings and Widow's Mites.

(in the Temple. Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^B Mark XII. 41-44; ^C Luke XXI. 1-4.

   ^b 41 And he sat down over against the treasury [It is said that in the
   court of the women there were cloisters or porticos, and under the
   shelter of these were placed thirteen chests with trumpet-shaped mouths
   into which offerings might be dropped. The money cast in was for the
   benefit of the Temple. An inscription on each chest showed to which one
   of the thirteen special items of cost or expenditure the contents would
   be devoted; as, for the purchase of wood, or gold, or frankincense,
   etc.], and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury [We
   should remember this calm inspection of our Lord when we are about to
   make an offering to his work. He is by no means indifferent as to our
   actions]: and many that were rich cast in much. ^c 1 And he looked up,
   and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury.
   ^b 42 And there came ^c 2 And he saw a certain poor widow casting in
   thither ^b and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. [The
   lepton or mite was worth one-fifth of a cent. It was a Greek coin, and
   the kodrantes or farthing was a Roman coin. It is suggested that she
   might have retained one of the coins, since she had two.] 43 And he
   called unto him his disciples [he had found an object-lesson which he
   wished them to see], and said unto them, Verily ^c Of a truth I say
   unto you, ^b This poor widow cast in more than all they that are
   casting into the treasury: 44 for they { ^c these} ^b all did cast in
   of their superfluity; ^c unto the gifts; ^b but she of her want did
   cast in all that she had, even ^c all the living that she had. { ^b all
   her living.} [We are disposed to measure the value of actions
   quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Moreover, we are better
   judges of actions than of motives, and can see the outward conduct much
   clearer than the inward character. God, therefore, in his word,
   constantly teaches us that he looks rather upon the inward than the
   outward. In this case, the value of the woman's gift was measured, not
   by quantity, but its quality; in quantity it was two mites, in quality
   it was the gift of all she had. From considering the corrupt character
   of the Pharisees, Jesus must have turned with pleasure to look upon the
   beautiful heart of this devout widow.]

Greeks Seek Jesus. He Foretells that He Shall Draw All Men Unto Him.

(in the Temple. Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^D John XII. 20-50.

   ^d 20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship
   at the feast [The language indicates that they were Greek converts to
   Judaism, such as were called proselytes of the gate. It is also noted
   that as Gentiles came from the east at the beginning of Jesus' life, so
   they also came from the west at the close of his ministry]: 21 these
   therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee [See p. 111.
   They were possibly drawn to Philip by his Greek name], and asked him,
   saying, Sir [the dignity of the Master elevates the disciple], we would
   see Jesus. [Jesus was evidently still in the court of the women, where
   the treasury was, and this court, being part of the sanctuary, no
   Gentile was permitted to enter it.] 22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew
   [Philip wished another to share the responsibility of the situation]:
   Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. 23 And Jesus answereth
   them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be
   glorified. [The humble seeking of these Gentiles formed a striking
   contrast to the persistent rejection of the Jews. And the occasion
   forcibly suggested that the gospel invitation, which had hitherto been
   confined to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, should be extended
   to the vast throng of waiting Gentiles. But, according to the counsel
   of God, this extension was not to take place until Jesus had been
   glorified by his death, resurrection, and enthronement. The demand for
   extension, therefore, suggested the advisability of a speedy
   glorification, which accorded with the plans of God.] 24 Verily,
   verily, [with these emphatic words Jesus prepares for a hard saying], I
   say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it
   abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. [As the
   germ of life in the grain of wheat can only pass into other grains by
   departing from the original grain and leaving it dead, so the life
   which was in Christ Jesus could only pass into his disciples by his
   death.] 25 He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his
   life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. [Though Jesus had
   his own death in view, yet he shows himself governed by a principle
   which he had already declared to be of universal application. See p.
   368. If a grain of wheat saves itself, it remains but one grain until
   it rots; but if it yields up its life-germ as a sacrifice to the law of
   growth, it multiplies itself thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold and
   continues its multiplication through an innumerable posterity.] 26 If
   any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also
   my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor. [Jesus
   here recommends to his disciples that they follow him in fruit-bearing
   self-sacrifice, promising them the joy of being with him and the honor
   of the Father. The joy of being with Christ is the chief expectation of
   the Christian--II. Cor. v. 8; Phil. i. 23; Rev. xxi. 3; xxii. 20 .] 27
   Now is my soul troubled [Thus Jesus admits that it was difficult for
   him to live up to the principle of sacrifice which he had just
   enunciated. Had it not been thus difficult for him, he would hardly
   have been a fitting example for his disciples; for certainly it is and
   has always been difficult for them]; and what shall I say? [In his
   trouble Jesus raises the question as to what prayer he shall offer to
   the Father.] Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause [for
   this purpose of imparting life through a sacrificial death] came I unto
   this hour. [Thus Jesus proposes a prayer for deliverance, but
   repudiates it as contrary to the very purpose of his life.] 28 Father,
   glorify thy name. [Having refused to ask for deliverance, Jesus prays
   that he may glorify the Father by suffering according to his original
   statement contained in verses 23 and 24. Two two prayers are
   counterparts to the two offered in Gethsemane (Luke xxii. 42 ). The
   prayer here is the climax of the thought begun at verse 23. We are
   first shown that nature is glorified by sacrifice (verse 24). Then that
   discipleship is so glorified (verses 25, 26) and this prayer shows that
   our Lord himself is glorified by the same rule.] There came therefore a
   voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify
   it again. [The Father had glorified his name in the Son. By words of
   commendation at his baptism (Matt. iii. 17) and at his transfiguration
   (Matt. xvii. 5), and by the performance of miracles (John xi. 40), and
   he would glorify it again by the preaching of the universal gospel, and
   by making Jesus head over all to the church and the final judge of all
   men.] 29 The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said
   that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. [Those
   who thought it thundered were nervous persons who were so startled as
   not to distinguish the words. [10] ] 30 Jesus answered and said, This
   voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes. [The voice was not
   spoken to encourage Jesus in his hour of suffering, but to aid the Jews
   to believe on him, and to warn them of the coming judgment which would
   follow their disbelief, and make them partakers in the condemnation of
   Satan.] 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
   this world be cast out. [The Greek word for "judgment" survives in our
   English word "crisis," but conveys much more meaning, since it embraces
   also the idea of final settlement and adjudication. The crucifixion of
   Jesus was the crisis in the contest between Satan and God. See Gen.
   iii. 15. "The meaning of it," says Barnes, "may be thus expressed: Now
   is approaching the decisive scene, the eventful period--the
   crisis--when it shall be determined who shall rule this world." In the
   long conflict which had hitherto been carried on, Satan had earned for
   himself the name "prince of this world," and it was no empty title (
   Matt. iv. 8, 9; II. Cor. iv. 4; Eph. vi. 12); but by his approaching
   death Jesus would break down the power of Satan, and cast him out, not
   suddenly, but by the advancing power of a superior kingdom. The kingdom
   of darkness recedes before the kingdom of light as the night withdraws
   before the rising sun.] 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
   will draw all men unto myself. 33 But this he said, signifying by what
   manner of death he should die. [Jesus thrice speaks of his death as a
   lifting up, a euphemism for being crucified (John viii. 28). While the
   distinctions between the three statements are not to be insisted upon,
   yet they suggest that the first is a saving sacrifice, a priestly work
   (John iii. 14); the second is mentioned as the convincing credential
   that he is the prophet sent from God, speaking the message of God (John
   viii. 26-28); and in the passage before us, he is evidently the king
   who shall wrest his kingdom from the usurping Satan.] 34 The multitude
   therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ
   abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted
   up? who is this Son of man? [The term "law" is used loosely for the
   whole of the Old Testament Scriptures (John x. 34). The people were
   persuaded by certain passages such as Isa. ix. 6, 7; Ps. lxxxix. 36;
   cx. 4; Dan. vii. 13, 14; Ezek. xxxvii. 25, etc. that the Messiah would
   abide forever. They knew that Jesus in his triumphal entry had received
   honors which they thought belonged to the Messiah, but when they hear
   him use words indicating that he should die, and thus (as they
   construed) not abide forever, they felt that he was openly disavowing
   all claim to Messiahship. Having heard him style himself the Son of man
   (verse 23), they now catch at it as if Jesus had used it to distinguish
   himself from the true Messiah, and ask with more or less contempt, "Who
   is this Son of man?" Thus blinded by their preconceived opinions and
   misconstructions of Scripture, the people wavered in their loyalty to
   Jesus, and Watkins well says, "This question came midway between the
   'Hosanna' of the entry into Jerusalem and the 'Crucify him' of the
   trial."] 35 Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the
   light among you. [The phrase "little while" stands in contrast with
   "abideth for ever."] Walk while ye have the light, that darkness
   overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not
   whither he goeth. 36 While ye have the light, believe on the light,
   that ye may become sons of light. [Jesus did not reply to their
   question, because it was asked contemptuously and not seriously, and
   because any effort to make their carnal mind grasp the idea that he
   could be lifted up, and yet still abide, would have resulted in more
   contempt. He therefore speaks a solemn warning to them, counseling them
   to make use of his presence while they had it, even if his fleshly
   abiding with them was but brief; and promises that a proper use of the
   light then given them would make them sons of light.] These things
   spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them. [This was his
   last public appeal to the people. He now retired, probably to Bethany,
   and they saw him no more until he was a prisoner in the hands of his
   enemies.] 37 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they
   believed not on him. [the multitude had long oscillated between belief
   and unbelief, but, despite all his past miracles and the marvelous
   wisdom shown on this the day of hard questions, they settled down in
   unbelief]: 38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet [Isa. liii. 1] might
   be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And
   to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 39 For this cause they
   could not believe, for that Isaiah said again [Isa. vi. 10], 40 He hath
   blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see
   with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I
   should heal them. [See p. 332. The quotation from Isaiah is not exact,
   for there God enjoins on the prophet the duty of hardening the people's
   hearts, while here it is spoken of as God's own act. Had God, however,
   hardened their hearts by a direct act and without any reference to
   their moral or spiritual condition, they could not have been held
   morally responsible for their disbelief. But this God did not do. He
   hardened their hearts and blinded their eyes by the manner in which he
   approached them through the person of his Son, Christ Jesus. Jesus so
   came, so loved, and so taught that those who hunger for godliness are
   drawn to him and enlightened by him, while those who despise the grace
   and love of God are repelled and blinded. John here recognizes that the
   type (Isaiah) should be fulfilled in the antitype (Christ). If Isaiah
   was to preach that the wicked would be blinded, then Christ in his
   ministry should likewise so teach and preach as to produce similar
   results.] 41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he
   spake of him. 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him;
   but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should
   be put out of the synagogue: 43 for they loved the glory that is of men
   more than the glory that is of God. [These members of the Sanhedrin
   believed with the head rather than with the heart (Rom. x. 10); their
   hearts already being occupied with the love of praise or man-glory.
   Their disbelief accorded with the words of Jesus (John v. 44). As to
   expulsion from the synagogue, see John ix. 22.] 44 And Jesus cried and
   said [These words were of course spoken before the departure mentioned
   in verse 36. They are placed here to bring out in stronger light the
   final unbelief of the Jews and the patient, persistent effort which
   Jesus had made to win those who were the better inclined], He that
   believeth on me, believeth not one, but on him that sent me. 45 And he
   that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. 46 I am come a light into
   the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the
   darkness. 47 And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge
   him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. [See
   pp. 131 and 454.] 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my
   sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same
   shall judge him in the last day. 49 For I spake not from myself; but
   the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should
   say, and what I should speak. 50 And I know that his commandment is
   life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father
   hath said unto me, so I speak. [The Father had sent the Son into the
   world to bring life and immortality to light in the gospel. Jesus
   therefore here declared that men will be tried by the gospel law and
   that some will be saved and some condemned by it.]

   [10] * I dissent here, as in the case of a similar passage found at
   page 85, and for like reasons. The apprehension of the divine voice
   depends upon the soul's capacity for hearing it, as appears from Saul's
   conversion (Acts ix. 7; xxii. 9; xxvi. 13 f.). To the mass, therefore,
   the voice was a mere sound; to others, the utterance was articulate
   though incomprehensible, while to John, and perhaps to all the
   disciples, the voice communicated a thought. "Thus," says Godet, "the
   wild beast perceives only a sound in the human voice; the trained
   animal discovers a meaning; a command, for example, which it
   immediately obeys; man alone discerns therein a thought." (P. Y. P.)

CXIII.

Destruction of Jerusalem Foretold.

^A Matt. XXIV. 1-28; ^B Mark XIII. 1-23; ^C Luke XXI. 5-24.

   ^a 1 And Jesus went out from the temple [leaving it to return no more],
   and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him ^b as he went
   forth ^a to show him the buildings of the temple. ^b one of his
   disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and
   what manner of buildings! ^c 5 And as some spake of the temple, how it
   was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said [The strength and
   wealth of the temple roused the admiration of the Galilæans. The great
   stones in its fortifications promised safety from its enemies, and the
   goodly offerings bespoke the zeal of its friends. According to
   Josephus, some of the stones were nearly seventy feet in length, twelve
   feet in height, and eighteen feet in breadth. The same historian tells
   us of the gifts or offerings which adorned it: crowns, shields,
   goblets, chain of gold present by Agrippa, and a golden vine with its
   vast clusters which was the gift of Herod. The temple was built of
   white limestone, and its beauty and strength made it admired of all
   nations. It took forty-six years to finish, and ten thousand skilled
   workmen are said to have been employed in its construction.] { ^a 2 But
   ^b Jesus ^a answered and said unto them, ^b him,} Seest thou these
   great buildings? ^a See ye not all these things? ^c 6 As for these
   things which ye behold, ^a verily I say unto you, ^c the days will
   come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another,
   that { ^b which} shall not be thrown down. [In the very hour when the
   disciples exulted in the apparent permanency of their glorious temple,
   Jesus startled them by foretelling its utter destruction, which, within
   forty years, was fulfilled to the letter. The emperor Vespasian, and
   his son Titus, after a three years' siege, took Jerusalem and destroyed
   its temple, a.d. 70. Of the temple proper not a vestige was left
   standing, but the vast platform upon which it stood, composed partly of
   natural rock and partly of immense masonry, was for the most part left
   standing. The destruction of the city and temple, however, was so
   complete that those who visited it could hardly believe that it had
   ever been inhabited--Jos. Wars vii. 1.] 3 And as he sat on the mount of
   Olives, over against the temple [he was in the middle portion of the
   mountain, for that is the part which is opposite the temple], ^a the
   disciples ^b Peter and James and John and Andrew [on this occasion
   Andrew was in company with the chosen three when they were honored by a
   special revelation, but is put last as being the least conspicuous of
   the four] ^a came unto him privately, ^b asked him privately, ^a
   saying, ^c Teacher, ^b 4 Tell us, when ^c therefore shall these things
   be? and what shall be the sign when these things are about to come to
   pass? { ^b to be accomplished?} ^a and what shall be the sign of thy
   coming, and of the end of the world? [Dismayed by the brief words which
   Jesus had spoken as he was leaving the temple, these four disciples
   asked for fuller details. Their question is fourfold. 1. When shall the
   temple be destroyed? 2. What shall be the signs which precede its
   destruction? 3. What shall be the sign of Christ's coming? 4. What
   shall be the sign of the end of the world? Jesus had said nothing of
   his coming nor of the end of the world; but to these four disciples the
   destruction of the temple seemed an event of such magnitude that they
   could not but associate it with the end of all things. Jesus deals with
   the first two questions in this section, and with the two remaining
   questions in [6]Section CXIV.] 4 And Jesus answered and said { ^b began
   to say} unto them, Take heed that no man lead you { ^c that ye be not
   led} astray: for many shall come in my name [claiming my name], saying,
   I am he; ^a I am the Christ; ^c and, The time is at hand: ^b and shall
   lead many astray. ^c go ye not after them. [The first sign of
   approaching destruction would be the appearance of false Christs. These
   would boldly claim the title, and assert that the time for the setting
   up of the eternal kingdom had arrived. We have no direct history of the
   appearance of such persons, the nearest approach to it being the
   parties mentioned by Josephus (Ant. xx. 5. 1; 8. 6, 10; Wars ii. 13. 4,
   5.) But as these men left no institutions or followers, it is quite
   natural that they should be overlooked or dropped by historians.
   Nothing is more natural, however, than that the excitement attendant
   upon the ministry of Jesus should encourage many to attempt to become
   such a Christ as the people wanted. The Gospels show so widespread a
   desire for a political Christ that the law of demand and supply would
   be sure to make many such.] ^a 6 And ^b when ^a ye shall hear of wars
   ^c and tumults, ^a and rumors of wars; see that ye ^b be not troubled:
   ^c be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; ^a but
   the end [the destruction of the temple] is not yet. { ^c immediately.}
   10 Then said he unto them, ^b 8 For ^c Nation shall rise against
   nation, and kingdom against kingdom [Wars and rumours of wars would be
   the second sign, but Christians in Jerusalem could rest there in safety
   until a more definite token bid them depart. Of course the wars here
   mentioned were only such as threatened particularly to affect the Jews,
   for the trouble coming upon the Jews was the subject of discourse.
   Alford, in commenting on this paragraph, takes the pains to enumerate
   three threats of war made against the Jews by as many Roman emperors
   and three uprisings of Gentiles against Jews in which many thousands of
   the latter perished]; 11 and there shall be great earthquakes, ^b in
   divers places; ^c and in divers places ^b there shall be ^c famines and
   pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.
   [Great natural disturbances would constitute the third sign. That these
   preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, there is abundant historic
   evidence. Alford enumerates the earthquakes as follows: 1. A great
   earthquake in Crete, a.d. 46 or 47. 2. One at Rome when Nero assumed
   the manly toga, a.d. 51. 3. One at Apamæa in Phrygia, mentioned by
   Tacitus, a.d. 53. 4. One at Laodicea in Phrygia, a.d. 60. 5. One in
   Campania, a.d. 62 or 63. There were an indefinite number of famines
   referred to by Roman writers, and at least one pestilence during which
   thirty thousand perished in Rome alone. All these signs are mentioned
   by unbelieving writers such as Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius,
   Philostratus, and Seneca, who speak of them because of their importance
   and not with any reference to the prophecy of Christ.] ^a 8 But all
   these things are the beginning of travail. ^c 12 But before all these
   things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you,
   delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before
   kings and governors for my name's sake. ^b 9 But take ye heed to
   yourselves: for ^a 9 Then shall they deliver you up ^b to councils; ^a
   unto tribulation, and shall kill you: ^b and in synagogues shall ye be
   beaten; ^a and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. ^b
   and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a
   testimony unto them. ^c 13 It shall turn out unto you for a testimony.
   [A fourth sign which they needed to heed particularly would be an
   outbreak of persecution. The Book of Acts furnishes an abundant
   evidence of the fulfillment of these details. The civil and
   ecclesiastical authorities (synagogues and kings) united to oppress the
   church. See Acts iv. 3; v. 18, 40; vii. 59; viii. 3; xii. 1, 2; xiv.
   19; xvi. 19-24; xxii. 30; xxiv. 1; xxv. 2, 3. Peter, James the elder
   and James the younger, and Paul, and doubtless many more of the
   apostles suffered martyrdom before the destruction of the temple.
   Tacitus bears testimony to the hatred and blind bigotry of the age when
   he speaks of Christians as "a class of men hated on account of their
   crimes" (Annals, xv. 44). See also Suetonius on Nero 16, and Pliny (Ep.
   x. 97). For comments on a similar passage see pp. 365, 366.] ^b 10 And
   the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations. [Paul says that
   this was done (Col. i. 23). Of course the language of both Jesus and
   Paul must be understood with reference to the geography of the earth as
   then known. Paul's declaration was written about the year a.d. 63, or
   seven years before the destruction of Jerusalem. His meaning is not
   that every creature had actually heard the gospel, but that each had
   been given an opportunity to hear because the gospel had been so
   universally preached.] 11 And when they lead you to judgment, and
   deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: ^c 14
   Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to
   answer: 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
   adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay. ^b but
   whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is
   not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit. [See p. 318. This is the third
   time Jesus has given this promise. See p. 366.] ^a 10 And then shall
   many stumble [persecution always causes a deflection of the
   faint-hearted, see p. 333, 334], and shall deliver up one another, and
   shall hate one another. [Apostates have ever been among the most bitter
   enemies of the church.] 11 And many false prophets shall arise, and
   shall lead many astray. [This refers to the false teachers which arose
   in the church. The apostles bear abundant testimony to their
   appearance--II. Cor. xi. 13-15; Gal. ii. 1-4; I. Tim. i. 3-7, 19, 20;
   II. Tim. iii. 8, 9; Tit. i. 10, 11; II. Pet. ii.; Jude.] 12 And because
   iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold. [The
   prevalence of sin tempts and encourages the feeble to commit it.] ^c 16
   But ye shall be delivered up even by parents, and brethren, and
   kinsfolk, and friends; ^b 12 And brother shall deliver up brother to
   death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against
   parents, and cause them to be put to death. ^c and some of you shall
   they cause to be put to death. [Hatred against Christianity would prove
   stronger than all family ties.] 17 And ye shall be hated of all men for
   my name's sake. [See p. 366.] 18 And not a hair of your head shall
   perish. [The previous verses show that this promise is spiritual. The
   destruction of a saint's body would work no real injury to him.] ^b but
   he that endureth to the end [i. e., to his death], the same shall be
   saved. [See p. 366.] ^c 19 In your patience ye shall win your souls.
   [The Christian's battle is won by endurance and not by violence, and he
   that can patiently hold out unto the end can, by the grace of God, save
   his soul.] ^a 14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in
   the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall
   the end come. [See the 1 given above. Jerusalem, the seat of the old
   dispensation, was not removed until the new dispensation was sown
   throughout the then known world.] ^c 20 But when ye see Jerusalem
   compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. ^b 14
   But ^a 15 When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which
   was spoken of through Daniel the prophet [Dan. iv. 11], standing in the
   holy place ^b where he ought not [for comment, see end of the
   paragraph, page 626 below] (let him that readeth understand) [Matthew
   also gives a similar parenthesis. If the words in parentheses were
   spoken by our Lord, they would constitute an exhortation to understand
   the prophecy of Daniel, and would be unnecessary, since our Lord's
   application of the prophecy explains it. The words are, therefore,
   exhortations by the Evangelists Matthew and Mark, bidding their readers
   take heed to this part of the prophecy (which constituted the last
   sign, and, therefore, the final warning) that they might not share in
   the bitter fate impending over Jerusalem and Judæa if they chanced to
   be in either in the hour of judgment], then let them that are in Judæa
   flee unto the mountains. ^c and let them that are in the midst of her
   [Jerusalem] depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter
   therein. ^b 15 and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor
   enter in, ^a to take out the things that are in { ^b to take anything
   out of} his house [see pp. 532, 533]: 16 and let him that is in the
   field not return back to take his cloak. ^c 22 For [this word
   introduces the reason for such hot haste] these are days of vengeance,
   that all things which are written may be fulfilled. [Deut. xxviii.
   49-57; Dan. ix. 26, 27; xii. 1, 11; Joel ii. 2.] ^b 17 But woe unto
   them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
   [because their condition would impede their flight] ^c for there shall
   be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people. [The city
   of Jerusalem was divinely sentenced to punishment for her sins.] 24 And
   they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into
   all the nations [According to Josephus, one million one hundred
   thousand perished during the siege, and ninety-seven thousand were
   taken captive. Of these latter, many were tortured and slain, being
   crucified, as he tell us, till "room was wanted for the crosses, and
   crosses wanted for the bodies"]: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
   the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. [By
   comparing this passage with Romans xi., we find that the times of the
   Gentiles signify that period wherein the church is made up of Gentiles
   to the almost exclusion of the Jews. The same chapter shows that this
   period is to be followed by one wherein the Jew and the Gentile unite
   together in proclaiming the gospel. This prophecy, therefore, declares
   that until this union of the Jew and the Gentile takes place, the city
   of Jerusalem shall not only be controlled by the Gentiles, but shall be
   trodden under foot--i. e., oppressed--by them. The history of
   Jerusalem, to this day, is a striking fulfillment of this prophecy.] ^b
   18 And pray ye that it ^a your flight ^b be not in the winter. [Because
   the flight will be so precipitate that it would necessitate much
   exposure to the weather, sleeping under the open heaven, etc.] ^a
   neither on a sabbath [Jewish tradition limited travel on the Sabbath
   day to a distance of seven furlongs. The early training of many
   Christians led them to have scruples about breaking the Sabbath. It is
   possible that Jesus had these scruples in view, but by no means
   conclusive, for in fleeing they would need the support and friendship
   of their Jewish brethren, who would be apt, not only to hinder, but
   even in those troublous and turbulent days, to show violence to any who
   openly disregarded the Sabbath. For it must be remembered that the
   Jews, not being guided by the admonitions of Christ, would regard the
   sudden flight of the Christians as unnecessarily hasty]: 21 for then {
   ^b those days} ^a shall be great tribulation, ^b such as there hath not
   been the like from the beginning of the creation { ^a the world} ^b
   which God created until now, and never, { ^a no, nor ever} shall be.
   [These words spoken before the event are strikingly verified by the
   statements of Josephus written after it. "No other city," says he,
   "ever suffered miseries, nor did any age, from the beginning of the
   world, ever breed a generation more fruitful in wickedness that this
   was." And again: "If the miseries of all mankind from the creation were
   compared with those which the Jews then suffered, they would appear
   inferior." The promise that there shall be no days like it of course
   excludes the terrors and miseries of the judgment day, since it belongs
   to celestial rather than terrestrial history. Having now the whole
   paragraph before us, we are ready to discuss the phrase "abomination of
   desolation" mentioned in Matt. xxiv. 15 (p. 624). Taking it in
   connection with the entire paragraph, we can readily see, 1. That it
   was a sign practically simultaneous with the compassing of Jerusalem by
   the Roman army. 2. That it was a clearly marked sign which was to be
   followed by immediate flight, even if the day of its appearing should
   chance to be the Sabbath--a flight so sudden that a man must not stop
   to enter his house or get his coat. Now, some translate the phrase
   "abomination of desolation" (or abomination that causeth desolation,
   for it may be so translated) as referring to the crimes of the zealots,
   a faction in Jerusalem, who took possession of the temple and profaned
   its sanctuary by using it as a fort, thus making themselves an
   abomination in the eyes of the Jews by polluting God's house and
   entering where they had no right to enter. But a long interval
   intervened between this evil deed of theirs and the coming of the
   Romans, during any day of which a Christian might have taken his
   departure after the most leisurely manner. Others take the phrase as
   referring to the entrance of the triumphant Roman army upon the temple
   courts; but as this was one of the last scenes of the prolonged siege,
   it could not properly be coupled with the encompassing Roman army.
   Meyer, aware of this difficulty, takes the position that there were two
   flights prescribed by Jesus, one from Jerusalem at the time when the
   Romans appeared, and the other from Judæa at the time when the temple
   fell. But the language used by Luke (Luke xxi. 20, 21) forbids us to
   make the flight from Judæa subsequent to the flight from Jerusalem, for
   both flights were to begin when the Romans appeared. Again it should be
   noted that the phrase "the holy place" is apt to mislead, especially
   when coupled with Mark's "where it ought not." The words when seen in
   English cause us to think of some person or thing polluting the
   sanctuary of the temple by standing in its holy place. But it is
   evident that the words do not refer to the temple at all. When the New
   Testament speaks of the holy place in the temple it styles it en too
   hagioo (in the holy), while the words here are en topoo hagioo (in a
   place holy). Moreover, after a careful perusal of the LXX. we are
   persuaded that they used the two terms to distinguish between the holy
   place in the sanctuary and other holy places, a distinction which the
   Revised Version recognizes (Lev. vi. 16, 26, 27, etc.). As none but
   priests could enter the holy place, it is evident that another is meant
   at Ps. xxiv. 3; but in this place the Septuagint gives us en topoo
   hagioo. We, therefore, conclude that in this place Matthew uses the
   term "holy place" to designate the holy territory round about the Holy
   City, and that the combined expression of Matthew and Mark signifies
   the investiture of the city by the Roman armies and is equivalent to
   the plainer statement made by Luke. The Roman armies were fittingly
   called the abomination of desolation, because, being heathen armies,
   they were an abomination to the Jews, and because they brought
   desolation upon the country. The sight of them, therefore, became the
   appointed sign for Christians to quit the city.] 22 And except those
   days had been shortened, ^b 20 And except the Lord had shortened the
   days, no flesh would have been saved [since the Lord is speaking to the
   Jews, this means that if God had not shortened the siege and restrained
   the Romans, they would have exterminated the Jewish race]; but for the
   elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. ^a those days shall
   be shortened. [since the term "elect" in verses 24 and 31 evidently
   means Christians, it doubtless means that here, though it may mean that
   God spared a remnant of the Jewish people because he had covenanted
   with the patriarchs that they should be his chosen people, for the Jews
   are also God's elect (Rom. xi. 28, 29). Moreover, it should be noted
   that there were few, if any, Christians remaining in the city, and that
   those who were spared were spared as Jews without discrimination.] ^b
   21 And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; ^a
   or, Here; ^b or, Lo, there; believe it not: 22 for there shall arise
   false Christs and false prophets, and shall show ^a great signs and
   wonders; so as to { ^b that they may} lead astray, if possible, ^a even
   the elect. [For accounts of these lying prophets who appeared before
   and during the siege, see Josephus, Wars iv., v., vi. Christ warns his
   followers: 1. Not to be deceived by spurious Christs. 2. Not to believe
   that he himself has again appeared. This latter warning is further
   enforced by what follows.] ^b 23 But take ye heed: behold, I have told
   you all things beforehand. ^a 26 If therefore they shall say unto you,
   Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the
   inner chambers; believe it not. 27 For as the lightning cometh forth
   from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming
   of the Son of man. [The coming of Christ would be an event needing no
   herald; every man would see it for himself. See p. 531.] 28 Wheresoever
   the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. [See pp.
   533, 534.]

CXIV.

The Second Coming of Christ.

^A Matt. XXIV. 29-51; ^B Mark XIII. 24-37; ^C Luke XXI. 25-36.

   ^b 24 But in those days, ^a immediately after the { ^b that} ^a
   tribulation of those days. [Since the coming of Christ did not follow
   close upon the destruction of Jerusalem, the word "immediately" used by
   Matthew is somewhat puzzling. There are, however, three ways in which
   it may be explained: 1. That Jesus reckons the time after his own
   divine, and not after our human, fashion. Viewing the word in this
   light, the passage at II. Pet. iii. 4-9 may almost be regarded as an
   inspired comment with reference to this passage. 2. The terrible
   judgment upon Jerusalem and the corresponding terror of the judgment
   day have between them no intervening season of judgment in any way
   worthy to be compared to either of them. The two periods, therefore,
   stand with regard to each other in immediate connection. 3. The
   tribulation which came upon the Jewish people merely began with the
   destruction of Jerusalem, other woes followed at once, and, coming down
   through all the centuries of wandering and dispersion, they were yet
   unfulfilled and incomplete. See Deut. xxviii. 58-68] the sun shall be
   darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
   fall { ^b shall be falling} from heaven, ^a and the powers of { ^b that
   are in} the heavens shall be shaken. [The language is that of the
   ancient prophets. See Amos viii. 9; Joel ii. 30, 31; Ezek. xxxii. 7, 8.
   Compare also Rev. vi. 12-14. Some regard the language as metaphorical,
   indicating the eclipse of nations and the downfall of rulers, but there
   are many similar passages of Scripture which constrain us to regard the
   language here as literal rather than figurative. See II. Pet. iii. 10;
   Heb. i. 12; Rev. xx. 11.] ^c 25 And there shall be signs in sun and
   moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity
   for the roaring of the sea and the billows [We can conceive of nothing
   which would produce greater mental distress or perplexity than changes
   in the position or condition of the heavenly bodies. Such changes will
   be followed by corresponding commotions on our planet, as, for
   instance, great tidal waves and vast agitation in the ocean]; 26 men
   fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming
   on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. ^a 30 and
   then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven [The coming and
   the sign are the same thing. The word "sign" is used in connection with
   the coming of Christ to indicate that the nature of the coming (that
   is, the manner of its manifestations) will be fully commensurate with
   the importance of the event. His first coming in the manger was not
   so]: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn [The coming will
   occasion universal mourning in the unprepared, and apparently the
   majority of people will be in that condition. The term "all" is not,
   however, to be construed as including all individuals--I. Thess. iv.
   15-17], ^b 26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in { ^a on
   the} clouds { ^c in a cloud} ^a of heaven ^b with great power ^a and
   great glory. ^b 27 And then shall he send forth the { ^a his} angels
   with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his
   elect from the four winds, from one of heaven to the other. ^b from the
   uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. [To the
   Jews the trumpet would naturally be associated with the assembling of
   the people, for silver trumpets were used to call Israel together (Num.
   x. 1-4; Ex. xix. 13, 16, 19; Ps. lxxxi. 3-5). We are not told why
   angels are used on this occasion, but they appear to be employed in all
   the great operations of Providence (Matt. xiii. 41). The phrases "four
   winds," etc., indicate that the angelic search shall extend over the
   entire globe. The language is that which was then used when one desired
   to indicate the whole earth. It is based upon the idea which then
   prevailed that the earth is flat, and that it extends outward in one
   vast plain until it meets and is circumscribed by the overarching
   heavens.] ^c 28 But when these things begin to come to pass, look up,
   and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh. [The
   preliminary death-throes of this present physical universe, which will
   strike terror to the souls of those who have limited themselves to
   material hopes, will be to the Christian a reassuring sign, since he
   looks for a new heaven and a new earth.] 29 And he spake to them a
   parable: ^a 32 Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch
   is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the
   summer is nigh; ^c Behold the fig tree, and all the trees: 30 when they
   now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer
   is now nigh. 31 Even so ye also, when ye see ^a all ^c these things
   coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh. ^a know ye
   that he is nigh, even at the doors. [As the change of the season in the
   natural world has its preliminary signs, so the change of conditions in
   the spiritual realm has its premonitory symptoms. When men see the
   symptoms which Jesus has described, they will recognize that changes
   are coming as to the nature of which they can only guess. But the
   Christian is informed that these changes indicate the coming of the Son
   of God--a change from a worse to a better season.] 34 Verily I say unto
   you, This generation shall not pass away, ^b until all things be
   accomplished. [Commentators differ widely as to the import of these
   words. Godet is so perplexed by them that he thinks they refer to the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and have been misplaced by the Evangelist.
   Cook straddles the difficulty by giving a dual significance to all that
   our Lord has said concerning his coming, so that our Lord in one
   narrative speaks figuratively of a coming in the power of his kingdom
   before, during, and right after the destruction of Jerusalem, and
   literally of his final coming at the end of the world. But this
   perplexing expression under this theory refers exclusively to the
   figurative and not to the literal sense of the passage. The simplest
   solution of the matter is to take the word "generation" to mean the
   Jewish family or race--and the word does mean race or family--Luke xvi.
   8. Thus interpreted, the passage becomes a prophecy that the Jewish
   people shall be preserved as such until the coming of Christ. The
   marvelous and almost miraculous preservation of the racial
   individuality of the Jews, though dispersed among all nations, might
   well become the subject of prophecy, especially when Jesus had just
   spoken of an event which threatened their very extermination.] 31
   Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
   [The disciples had regarded the temple as so permanent that they found
   it hard to conceive that Christ's words could be fulfilled with regard
   to it; but he assures them that his predictions and prophecies are the
   stable and imperishable things. That even the more permanent structure
   of the heavens is not so abiding as his utterances.] ^a 36 But of that
   day and { ^b or that} hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in { ^a
   of} heaven, neither the Son, ^b but the Father. ^a only. [These words
   indicate the profound secrecy in which God has concealed the hour of
   judgment. It is concealed from all people, that each generation may
   live in expectation of its fulfillment, and we are to watch for the
   signs, though we may not fully know the times. They also indicate that
   either by reason of his assumption of our human nature, or by a
   voluntary act on his part, the knowledge of Jesus became in some
   respects circumscribed. They also suggest that it is not only idle, but
   also presumptuous, for men to strive to find out by mathematical
   calculation and expositions of prophecy that which the Son of God did
   not know.] 37 And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of
   the Son of man. 38 For as in those days which were before the flood
   they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
   the day that Noah entered into the ark, 39 and they knew not until the
   flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son
   of man. [See p. 532.] 40 Then shall two man be in the field; one is
   taken, and one is left: 41 two women shall be grinding at the mill; one
   is taken, and one is left. [See p. 533.] 42 Watch therefore: for ye
   know not on what day your Lord cometh. 43 But know this, that if the
   master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he
   would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken
   through. 44 Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye think
   not the Son of man cometh. [See p. 322.] ^c 34 But take heed to
   yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and
   drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly
   as a snare: 35 for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the
   face of all the earth. [The image of a snare is that of a net which
   suddenly encloses a covey of birds as they feed in seeming safety. The
   warnings here given are applicable to our appearing before Christ
   whether he comes to meet us, or we depart from this life to meet him.
   The result is the same, whether he comes and finds us unprepared or
   whether we go hence without preparation.] ^a 45 Who then is the
   faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household,
   to give them their food in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant, whom
   his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 47 Verily I say unto you,
   that he will set him over all that he hath. 48 But if that evil servant
   shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth; 49 and shall begin to beat
   his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken; 50 the
   lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in
   an hour when he knoweth not, 51 and shall cut him asunder, and appoint
   his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the
   gnashing of teeth. [See p. 323.] ^c 36 But watch ye at every season,
   making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things
   that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. [The
   revealed presence of God is represented as such an overpowering event
   that sinners are crushed to the earth by it. Only the godly are able to
   stand in his presence--Ps. i. 5; Mal. iii. 2.] ^b 33 Take ye heed,
   watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 34 It is as when a
   man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given
   authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the
   porter to watch. [Under the figure of the householder and the thief,
   Jesus appealed to the sense of danger. Under the figure of the servant
   he appealed to the sense of duty, and under this figure of the porter
   he appealed to the sense of loyalty. The porter's desire to honor his
   lord was to make him so vigilant that he would open the door at once
   upon his lord's appearing.] 35 Watch therefore: for ye know not when
   the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at
   cockcrowing, or in the morning [The night was then divided into four
   watches. See p. 322. Jesus may here refer either to the duration of the
   world or to the life of the individual. He divides either period into
   four sections, in accordance with the night watches which were so fully
   associated with watchfulness]; 36; lest coming suddenly he find you
   sleeping. 37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. [This
   warning message was not for the apostles alone, but for all disciples.]

Conclusion of Our Lord's Discourse. Parables of Virgins and Talents. The Final
Judgment.

(Mount of Olives. Tuesday, April 4, a.d. 30.)

^A Matt. XXV. 1-46.

   ^a 1 Then [i. e., at the time of the Lord's coming. Jesus is still
   emphasizing the lesson of watchfulness, and proceeds to enforce it by
   two parables] shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten [probably
   the usual number on such occasions] virgins, who took their lamps
   [small earthenware vessels, with flax wicks, and without glass
   chimneys], and went forth to meet the bridegroom. [The Oriental wedding
   began with a feast in the house of the bride's father. After this the
   bridegroom led the bride to his own home, and it was the duty of his
   servants and household (of whom the ten virgins in this case were part)
   to honor him and the bride with an enthusiastic welcome.] 2 And five of
   them were foolish, and five were wise. 3 For the foolish, when they
   took their lamps, took no oil with them: 4 but the wise took oil in
   their vessels with their lamps. [The foolish showed their folly in
   failing to provide for their lord's delay. The oil in their lamps would
   only burn till about midnight. But the wise had provided an additional
   supply to burn from then till daylight.] 5 Now while the bridegroom
   tarried, they all slumbered and slept. [Rather, "nodded and slept."
   They did not lie down to regular slumber, but took such innocent rest
   as their office permitted. Others were on the lookout, and would give
   the warning; so these were permitted to sleep, but only in such a
   posture that they would be ready to arise and go at once when apprised
   of their lord's approach.] 6 But at midnight there is a cry, Behold,
   the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. 7 Then all those virgins
   arose, and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said unto the wise,
   Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. [The signal-call
   roused all ten, and each group of five prepared by trimming the lamps,
   etc. But then became apparent the difference between them. All had made
   some preparation, but that of the foolish five had been insufficient.
   Their glory began to depart, and their light waned into darkness at the
   approach of the bridegroom.] 9 But the wise answered, saying,
   Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to
   them that sell, and buy for yourselves. [There will be no borrowed
   righteousness on the day of the Lord's coming, for no one will have any
   to spare. The Roman Catholic confidence in saints, and the trust of
   some Protestants in pious parents, are alike unavailing: each soul must
   see to its own lamp. Those who had the oil to sell are merely part of
   the drapery of the parable, put in to bring out the point that it was
   then too late to secure any oil. The oil of God's grace is given
   without money and without price, but in the hour of the Lord's
   appearing it will be too late to seek for it.] 10 And while they went
   away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with
   him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. [The feast in the
   bridegroom's house was considered the most important part of the
   marriage, and certainly for those of the lord's own household it was
   the only feast. To be shut out from it was to be deprived of all
   participation in the marriage joy. All the wisdom and shrewdness of
   Universalism can never open this shut door.] 11 Afterward came also the
   other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and
   said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. [The verb "know" is here
   used, according to the Jewish idiom, for favorable knowledge (Matt.
   vii. 23). It signified that these virgins, on account of their
   remissness, were no longer counted even as acquaintances, much less as
   part of the household.] 13 Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor
   the hour. [Thus Jesus makes his own application of the parable.] 14 For
   it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own
   servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 15 And unto one he gave
   five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his
   several ability; and he went on his journey. 16 Straightway he that
   received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other
   five talents. [The parable of the virgins represented watchfulness
   displaying itself in waiting for the Lord, while it is here displayed
   in working for him. There it was inward spiritual life, here it is
   external activity.] 17 In like manner he also that received the two
   gained other two. 18 But he that received the one went away and digged
   in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 19 Now after a long time the
   lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. [We
   have here one of the Lord's intimations that the day of judgment would
   not come at once. The word for servants is douloi, which means slaves.
   They were the property of the master and he might dispose of them as he
   pleased. The reckoning is as sure as the trust; judgment is as sure as
   life. A man who had entrusted a talent (from $1,600 to $1,800) would
   surely not forget to ask a settlement, nor will God fail to demand an
   accounting from all those to whom he had entrusted the riches and
   privileges of this wonderful human life which he has given us, though
   many of us may lightly esteem it.] 20 And he that received the five
   talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
   deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.
   21 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou
   hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things;
   enter thou into the joy of thy lord. [The joy of the lord was doubtless
   some festival in celebration of his return, and it stands for the joy
   of Christ in the Father's house.] 22 And he also that received the two
   talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo,
   I have gained other two talents. 23 His lord said unto him, Well done,
   good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I
   will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
   [The second servant, having done well proportionately as the first,
   received the like precious commendation.] 24 And he also that had
   received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art
   a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou
   didst not scatter; 25 and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy
   talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. 26 But his lord answered
   and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that
   I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; 27 thou
   oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my
   coming I should have received back mine own with interest. 28 Take ye
   away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the
   ten talents. 29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he
   shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he
   hath shall be taken away. 30 And cast ye out the unprofitable servant
   into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of
   teeth. [See pp. 565, 566. This parable is much like that of the pounds,
   but differs in several particulars. There the same amount was entrusted
   to each one, but the returns were different, and the rewards were
   different. Here different amounts were entrusted, the returns were in
   proportion to the trust, and the rewards were the same.] 31 But when
   the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him,
   then shall he sit on the throne of his glory [Christ's judgment throne
   is called his throne of glory because in the day that he sits upon it
   his glory will be exhibited to men more brightly than ever before; for
   in the decisions of that hour his mercy, justice, and righteousness
   will most fully appear, and all the obscure things in the past
   administration of his government will be made clear]: 32 and before him
   shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them [not the
   nations, but the individuals which compose them] one from another, as
   the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats [It was the custom for
   the shepherd to let the sheep and goats feed together during the day
   and to separate them at night. This custom is placed in the parable
   because it is analogous to the present commingling and final separation
   of men. Goats are here employed to represent the evil class of men,
   because goats have to be driven while sheep follow the shepherd]; 33
   and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the
   left. [The right hand is always represented as the place of honor and
   preferment. The Jews in their traditions say that when criminals were
   tried by the Sanhedrin those who were acquitted were placed on the
   right hand, and those who were condemned on the left.] 34 Then shall
   the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my
   Father, inherit [take possession of as rightful heirs] the kingdom
   prepared for you from the foundation of the world [God's purpose
   designed such a kingdom from the beginning (Eph. i. 9-14), and we may
   conceive of it as in process of preparation ever since--John xiv. 2]:
   35 for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave
   me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; 36 naked, and ye clothed
   me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto
   me. [The acts here enumerated indicate more than a mere outlay of
   money. They are not such are the offspring of impulse, but such as call
   for the sacrifice of time, strength, sympathy, etc., and clearly
   demonstrate the fullness of the Christian life. Moreover, Jesus does
   not mean to teach that mere works of benevolence are a sufficient
   ground for salvation. The meaning is that none can be saved without
   these fruits of faith and love. The passage must be construed in the
   light of other Scriptures which teach the further necessity of
   forgiveness on the part of God and of obedience on the part of man.] 37
   Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
   hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? 38 And when saw
   we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 39
   And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 40 And the
   King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as
   ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it
   unto me. [This conversation is the drapery of the narrative. Such words
   will not be actually spoken at the judgment, but they are introduced
   for the twofold purpose of illustrating the beautiful unconsciousness
   of merit and which characterizes the noblest of deeds and the more
   important fact that anything done for his sake is the same as done for
   his person--Matt. x. 42; Mark ix. 41.] 41 Then shall he say also unto
   them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire
   which is prepared for the devil and his angels [The two preparations
   stand in contrast. God prepared a kingdom of joy and designed that man
   should be with him in it. He also prepared a place for punishment for
   Satan and his angels, and man can cast his lot there and share that
   punishment if he wills to do so]: 42 for I was hungry, and ye did not
   give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; 43 I was a
   stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick,
   and in prison, and ye visited me not. 44 Then shall they also answer,
   saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or
   naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 45 Then
   shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did
   it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me. [The neglect or
   abuse of Christ's disciples is a direct affront to his person--Acts ix.
   4.] 46 And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the
   righteous into eternal life. [This verse contains two important truths:
   1. That the doom of the wicked is as durable as the reward of the
   righteous. 2. That the doom of the wicked is a punishment. The word
   "punishment" expresses misery and suffering purposely inflicted.]

Jesus Predicts, the Rulers Plot for, and Judas Bargains for His Death.

(Mount of Olives, Bethany, and Jerusalem. Tuesday After Sunset,

Which Jews Regarded as the Beginning of Wednesday.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 1-5, 14-16; ^B Mark XIV. 1, 2, 10, 11; ^C Luke XXII. 1-6.

   ^c 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
   Passover. { ^b 1 Now after two days was the feast of the passover and
   the unleavened bread:} ^a 1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had
   finished all these words, he said unto his disciples, 2 Ye know that
   after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up
   to be crucified. [We may regard Jesus as having entered the temple
   Tuesday morning, and as having taught there until the evening. [11] He
   then retired to the slopes of Olivet and delivered the discourse which
   occupies Sections [7]CXIII.-CXV., The discourse finished, it is likely
   that he arose about or a little after sunset (which the Jews reckoned
   as Wednesday) and proceeded on his way to Bethany, where he remained
   until late Thursday afternoon. On his way to Bethany he spoke the words
   of this section. The two days mentioned are Wednesday and Thursday. The
   passover was eaten Thursday night after sunset, which the Jews reckoned
   as Friday. For a full discussion of the time when the Passover was
   eaten, see Andrews' "Life of Christ," pp. 423-460.] 3 Then were
   gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto
   the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; 4 and they took
   counsel together ^c 2 And sought ^b how ^a that they might take Jesus
   by subtlety, and ^c how they might put him to death; { ^a kill him.}
   [This council may have begun on the evening of Tuesday and continued
   until the beginning of Wednesday, Jewish time. It seems to have been a
   formal rather than an informal conference. The court where they met was
   the open space enclosed by the palace of the high priest. Caiaphas had
   been appointed high priest in a.d. 26 by the Procurator Valerius Gratus
   and was deposed a.d. 38. Ishmael, Eleazar, and Simon held the office
   between the deposition of Annas and the appointment of Caiaphas (Jos.
   Ant. xviii. 2. 2). See also p. 64.] 5 But { ^b 2 for} they said, Not
   during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult ^a arise among {
   ^b of} people. ^c for they feared the people. [They knew that there
   were many at the feast from Galilee, and other sections of the country
   where Jesus ministered; and, judging by the demonstration made at the
   triumphal entry, they felt that there were plenty to take arms in
   Jesus' behalf. The sense of their council, therefore, seemed to be that
   if Jesus could be taken by subtlety--i. e., arrested privately--he
   might be taken during the feast. But if he had to be arrested publicly,
   then it was better to postpone his apprehension until after the feast.
   The treachery of Judas caused them to adopt the former course. At this
   place Matthew and Mark insert the account of the supper given to Jesus
   in the house of Simon the leper. They do this because the treacherous
   determination of Judas was formed at it and dates from it. The rebuke
   of the Lord then administered, or the desire to reimburse himself for
   the price of the ointment, which Mary expended, and which he felt that
   he ought to have had, or some other reasons, evidently induced him at
   that time to decide upon our Lord's betrayal. Since then he had been
   seeking opportunity to betray the Master.] 3 And Satan entered into
   Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. { ^b
   he that was one of the twelve,} [See pp. 226, 391, 392.] ^a 14 Then one
   of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, ^b went away unto the
   chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them. ^c and communed
   with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto
   them. ^a 15 and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will
   deliver him unto you? [It is probable that the proposal to sell his
   Master was made by Judas to individual members of the Sanhedrin, and
   that this proposal was one of the moving causes leading to the
   assembling of the council. The language implies that Judas appeared
   before the council and bargained openly with it.] ^b 11 And they, when
   they heard it, were glad, and promised ^c and covenanted to give him
   money. ^a And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver. [There had
   been coined shekels since the time of Simeon, or 143 b.c., before that
   the money was weighed. It is likely that the term "weighed" survived
   the practice and became a synonym or equivalent for "paid." The amount
   paid him was about fifteen dollars of our money. It was indeed a low
   price for so base a deed, but from the language used it may be fairly
   implied that it was but the earnest money of a larger sum. But Judas
   evidently hardened himself, and shut out all thought as to anything
   save the actual labor involved. Viewed thus, his task was neither
   difficult nor dangerous.] ^c 6 And he consented, ^a 16 And from that
   time he sought opportunity to deliver him ^b how he might conveniently
   deliver him unto them. ^c in the absence of the multitude. [He soon
   found his opportunity. He bargained on Tuesday night and fulfilled his
   contract on Thursday night. Or, as the Jews reckoned time, he agreed in
   the beginning of Wednesday and fulfilled his covenant on the beginning
   of Friday.]

Preparation for Passover. Disciples Contend for Precedence.

(Bethany to Jerusalem. Thursday Afternoon and, After Sunset, Beginning of
Friday.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 17-20; ^B Mark XIV. 12-17; ^C Luke XXII. 7-18, 24-30.

   ^c 7 And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must
   be sacrificed. [See p. 57. Leaven was to the Jew a symbol of corruption
   and impurity, because it causes bread to become stale. The feast of
   unleavened bread began properly on the fifteenth of Nisan, and lasted
   seven days, but this was the fourteenth Nisan, the day on which the
   paschal lamb was slain. However, it was common to blend the slaying of
   the passover, the passover feast and the feast of the unleavened bread,
   and to look upon all three as one great festival, and to use the names
   passover and unleavened bread interchangeably to describe the entire
   eight days. This appears from the writings of Josephus, who sometimes
   reckons the feast as beginning on the fifteenth (Ant. iii. 10. 5), and
   again as beginning on the fourteenth (Wars v. 3. 1). He also sometimes
   reckons the feast as lasting seven days (Ant. iii. 10. 5), and again he
   reckons it as lasting eight days (Ant. iii. 15. 1). The Rabbinists say
   that all the leaven was carefully removed from the houses on the
   evening before the fourteenth Nisan. To the present day leaven is
   removed from the houses of the Jews on the night between the thirteenth
   and fourteenth. Hence the day could be very fittingly called "the first
   day of unleavened bread."] ^b 12 And ^a 17 Now ^b on the first day of
   unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his { ^a the}
   disciples came to Jesus [as the head of the household], saying, { ^b
   say} unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready ^a for thee to
   eat { ^b that thou mayest eat} the passover? [It required considerable
   preparation. The lamb must be slain in the temple, roasted, and
   unleavened loaves, wine, and bitter herbs, etc., must be provided (Ex.
   xii. 8), and a room for the feast must be secured.] 13 And he sendeth {
   ^c sent} Peter and John, ^b two of his disciples, ^c saying, God and
   make ready for us the passover, that we may eat. 9 And they said unto
   him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? 10 And he said { ^b saith}
   unto them, Go into the city, and ^c Behold, when ye are entered into
   the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow
   him into the house whereinto he goeth. ^b 14 and wheresoever he shall
   enter in, say to { ^c 11 And ye shall say unto} the master of the
   house, { ^a Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,} ^c The
   Teacher saith unto thee, ^a My time is at hand; I keep the passover at
   thy house with my disciples. ^c Where is the { ^b my} guest-chamber,
   where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? [It was customary for
   the residents of Jerusalem to open their houses for guests during this
   feast, and therefore Jesus might have presumed on the hospitality of
   almost anyone; but the probability is that the man to whom he sent this
   message was an acquaintance and a friend. It is not improbable that
   Jesus let Peter and John thus find the place that Judas might not know
   its whereabouts in time to bring the officers of the Sanhedrin so as to
   interrupt the feasts which meant so much to him and to his church.] 15
   And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready:
   and there make ready for us. 16 And the disciples went forth, and came
   into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready
   the passover. ^a 19 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and
   they made ready the passover. ^b 17 And ^a 20 Now when even was come, {
   ^b when it was evening} he cometh with the twelve [The law required
   that the paschal lamb should be slain "between the evenings." The Jews
   reckoned the two evenings as from three o'clock to sunset, and from
   sunset to nine o'clock, which was the end of the first watch. But
   Josephus tells us that the lambs were killed from the ninth to the
   eleventh hours, or between the hours of three and five. It would take
   some time to dress the lamb and to roast it, so that it must have been
   about sundown or shortly afterward when Jesus and his disciples sat
   down to the feast.] ^c 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and
   the apostles with him. 15 And ^a he was sitting at meat with the twelve
   disciples; 21 and ^c he said unto them, With desire I have desired to
   eat this passover with you before I suffer: 16 for I say unto you, I
   shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. [Jesus
   had desired to keep with his disciples this last type which stood so
   close to the thing typified. It was a feast commemorating a great
   deliverance from death through the sacrifice of a lamb, and the real
   sacrifice and deliverance of which it was typical were about to be
   fulfilled in the unfolding of the kingdom of God.] 17 And he received a
   cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it
   among yourselves: 18 for I say unto you, I shall not drink from
   henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall
   come. [Luke brings out the parallelism between the passover and the
   Lord's supper. Each consisted in eating followed by drinking, and the
   closeness of the parallel is emphasized by the use of almost the same
   words with regard to the cup. The passover was typical of the Lord's
   suffering before the event, and the Lord's supper is typical of the
   same thing after the event.] 24 And there arose also a contention among
   them, which of them was accounted to be greatest. 25 And he said unto
   them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that
   have authority over them are called Benefactors. 26 But ye shall not be
   so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the
   younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. 27 For which is
   greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that
   sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. [In
   sending to secure the room in which the paschal supper was being eaten,
   Jesus had said, "My time is at hand." Such expressions were falsely
   construed by the apostles. They thought that Jesus was about to set up
   his kingdom, and began at once to contend for the chief places. Jesus
   rebukes this false ambition in much the same manner as he had
   previously. See pp. 430, 557, 558.] 28 But ye are they that have
   continued with me in my temptations; 29 and I appoint unto you a
   kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me, 30 that ye may eat and
   drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging
   the twelve tribes of Israel. [The word "temptations" is here used to
   mean trials (Jas. i. 2, 3). For the rest of the passage compare the
   remarks on pp. 548, 549. The words concerning eating and drinking at
   the Lord's table refer to the ancient custom of thus bestowing honor
   and distinction (II. Sam. ix. 7; xix. 28), and indicate that the
   apostles, being about to participate in the Lord's condemnation and
   suffering, should in the end share his exaltation and its attendant
   joys.]

CXVIII.

The Paschal Meal. Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet.

(Thursday Evening of the Beginning of Friday.)

^D John XIII. 1-20.

   ^d 1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour
   was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father,
   having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the
   end. [Since the second century a great dispute has been carried on as
   to the apparent discrepancy between John and the synoptists in their
   statements concerning the passover. The synoptists, as we have seen in
   the previous section, clearly represent Jesus as having eaten the
   passover at the proper time, and as having been arrested on the same
   night, while John here and elsewhere (ch. xiii. 29; xviii. 28; xix. 14,
   31, compared with xviii. 1-14) seems to represent Jesus as being
   arrested before the passover. Our space does not permit us to enter
   upon a discussion of this difficulty. The reader is referred to a
   thorough rehearsal of the arguments found in Tholuck in loco (or, after
   the seventh edition, in his introduction to John's Gospel). The
   simplest solution of the difficulty is to attribute the apparent
   discrepancy to that loose way of speaking of the feast which we
   mentioned in the [8]last section. When the synoptists speak of the
   passover they refer to the actual paschal supper; when John speaks of
   the feast of the passover, or the passover, he refers to the seven
   days' feast of unleavened bread which followed the actual paschal
   supper. Jesus was put to death on the first day of this latter feast,
   and therefore John here uses the festival to designate the time of the
   Lord's suffering and death. The meaning, then, is that Jesus, having
   loved his disciples prior to this great trial or crisis of his life,
   was not deterred from loving them by its approach, but continued to
   give the most precious and unmistakable evidences of his love down to
   the very hour of its arrival, being neither driven from such a course
   by the terrors of his coming hour nor wooed from it by the glorious
   prospects of returning to his Father. These words form a preface to the
   remainder of John's Gospel in which John enumerates the tokens and
   evidences of that love which manifested itself throughout the entire
   passion, and continued until the hour of ascension; and which, by so
   doing, gave sweet assurance that it continues still.] 2 And during
   supper [This was the paschal supper proper. It accords with the
   supplementary nature of John's Gospel to thus mention it as a meal
   thoroughly familiar to his readers.] the devil having already put into
   the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him [see p. 642], 3
   Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands,
   and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God [Being about to
   narrate an act of loving humility, John prefaces it by stating that it
   was done in full knowledge of his threefold glory; viz.: 1. That all
   authority was committed to him (Matt. xxviii. 18); 2. That by nature he
   was divine ( John i. 1, 14), and, 3. That he was about to return to the
   divine exaltation which for our sakes he had laid aside--Phil. ii.
   5-11.] 4 riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took
   a towel, and girded himself. 5 Then he poureth water into the basin,
   and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
   wherewith he was girded. [John narrates in detail each of these acts:
   to him they seem as so many successive steps leading down to the depth
   of humility. The whole formed a striking but wholesome contrast to the
   self-seeking and ambitious spirit which the disciples had just
   manifested.] 6 So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord,
   dost thou wash my feet? [The others were awed into silence by the
   strange conduct of their Master; but it accorded with the bold
   impulsiveness of Peter to challenge the act.] 7 Jesus answered and said
   unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand
   hereafter. [It was no mere feet-washing; or Jesus would not have so
   spoken. It was at once an example of humility and a symbol of the
   purification which the Lord accomplished for us by reason of his
   humiliation. The full meaning of the act was afterward revealed to them
   by the Holy Spirit.] 8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my
   feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with
   me. 9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
   hands and my head. [Since Jesus spoke of the act as in some sense a
   license or token of permission to have "part" with him, Peter desired
   that his head and hands also might be included, that he might in his
   entire man have part with Christ.] 10 Jesus saith to him, He that is
   bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and
   ye are clean, but not all. 11 For he knew him that should betray him;
   therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. [The language implies that the
   disciples had bathed before leaving Bethany, and that only their feet,
   soiled by the journey to Jerusalem, needed to be rewashed. The saying
   is spiritually true as well, for one who has been washed thoroughly by
   baptism needs not to be re-baptized. After that general cleansing the
   particular sins are removed by confession (I. John i. 7-9). But there
   is no efficacy in any ordinance when the heart and will do not accord
   with the purposes for which it is administered. Hence it was that
   Judas, though he had done all that the others had done, was still as
   foul as ever.] 12 So when he had washed their feet, and taken his
   garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have
   done to you? 13 Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so
   I am. 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye
   also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have given you an
   example, that ye also should do as I have done to you. 16 Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither
   one that is sent greater than he that sent him. 17 If ye know these
   things, blessed are ye if ye do them. [Since a servant is not greater
   than his lord, he should not be ashamed to do what his lord does. It is
   well known that many, by a literal construction of this passage, have
   esteemed it to be their duty to wash each other's feet in their
   churches. But it should be noted that in the entire New Testament there
   is no command for this, nor is there any passage which recognizes any
   such church ordinance or practice. Jesus did not institute
   feet-washing; he found it already a familiar custom of the land, and
   merely used it as a most appropriate way of showing the proper spirit
   of humble service. Hence he does not say, "Do what I have done," but
   "Do as I have done," which requires us to do something similar to that
   which Christ had done, but necessarily the very same thing. The washing
   of feet as an act of courtesy or hospitality was never a custom among
   Western people, and to adopt it because of these words of Christ is to
   entirely miss his meaning. What he did was a natural daily act of
   hospitality. But what we would do if we followed his words literally
   would be to introduce a strange, outlandish practice, which would put a
   guest to great embarrassment and inconvenience.] 18 I speak not of you
   all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be
   fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me. [ Ps.
   xli. 9.] 19 From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that,
   when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. 20 Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth
   me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. [The meaning
   of the above passage may perhaps be brought out more easily if we
   paraphrase it as follows: "I do not speak of blessing to you all, for
   there is one who shall never be blessed. His conduct does not deceive
   or surprise me, for I know those whom I have chosen whether they be
   good or bad. His choosing is in accordance with the prophecy contained
   in the Book of Psalms. Hitherto I have held my peace about him, but
   henceforth I shall point out his course, that my foreknowledge of his
   actions may strengthen your faith in my Messiahship, and not leave you
   in that condition of hopelessness and despair in which the consequences
   had come upon me unawares. Do not let his treachery shake your
   confidence in me, for verily I say unto you that in being my messengers
   ye are indeed the messengers of the Most High."]

CXIX.

Judas' Betrayal and Peter's Denial Foretold.

(Jerusalem. Evening Before the Crucifixion.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 21-25, 31-35; ^B Mark XIV. 18-21, 27-31; ^C Luke XXII. 21-23,
31-38;

^D John XIII. 21-38.

   ^b 18 And ^d 21 When Jesus had thus said, ^b as they sat and were
   eating, ^d he was troubled in the spirit, and ^b Jesus ^d testified,
   and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray
   me. ^b even he that eateth with me. ^c 21 But behold, the hand of him
   that betrayeth me is with me on the table. [The foreknowledge of Judas'
   crime did not relieve the Lord from the sting of it. By the use of the
   word "betray" Jesus revealed to Judas that he had perfect knowledge of
   the peculiar crime which he was about to commit. To induce repentance
   the enormity of the crime is pointed out in two ways: 1. It was the act
   of one, an act in which no other could be found willing to have a part.
   2. It was the act of one whose hand rested on the table, who was
   admitted to the closest intercourse and fellowship.] ^d 22 The
   disciples looked one on another [in startled amazement], doubting of
   whom he spake. ^a 22 And they ^b began to be { ^a were} exceeding
   sorrowful [that the Lord should be betrayed was sorrow enough, but that
   one of the twelve should do the deed was an added grief], ^c 23 And
   they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that
   should do this thing. ^b and ^a began ^b to say unto him one by one, ^a
   every one, Is it I, Lord? [The form of the question in the Greek
   indicates that it expects "No" for an answer, so that it may be
   rendered, "Surely it is not I?"] 23 And he answered and said, ^b unto
   them, It is one of the twelve, ^a He that dipped { ^b dippeth} ^a his
   hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. [According to
   Oriental custom, knives and forks were not used. One dish served to
   hold the sop for several people, that they might dip their bread into
   it. In so large a company, two or three bowls would be used for
   convenience' sake. The words of Jesus, therefore, limited the circle of
   accused ones from twelve to four or five, and also further emphasized
   the tender and close intimacy between the traitor and the Master.] ^b
   21 For the Son of man goeth, ^c as it hath been determined: ^b even as
   it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man
   is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. [Jesus
   was following with unfaltering step the path of suffering marked out by
   the prophets. But this fact in no way exculpated the authors of his
   death. The prophecies referred to are many. As examples, see Ps. xxii.,
   Isa. liii. The woe pronounced upon Judas was no vindictive or vengeful
   wish; it is the solemn announcement of the divine judgment. The words
   of Jesus stop the mouths of the apologists for Judas. When the judge
   thus speaks in condemnation, who shall presume to argue in
   extenuation?] ^d 23 There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom
   one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. [John thus speaks of himself.
   His couch was in front of that of the Lord, so that when he laid his
   head back it rested upon Jesus' bosom. See p. 513.] 24 Simon Peter
   therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell us who it is of
   whom he speaketh. 25 He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast saith
   unto him, Lord, who is it? 26 Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for
   whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. [It was a mark of special
   respect and courtesy to thus dip a sop and hand it to a guest.] So when
   he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, the son of
   Simon Iscariot. [Thus Jesus advanced in his disclosure from twelve to
   three or four, and from three or four to one, and that one a friend
   most highly honored. But Judas was neither to be warned nor wooed from
   his purpose.] ^a 25 And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is
   it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said. [It seems strange that
   the disciples showed no resentment toward Judas, and made no effort to
   interfere with this course, but their conduct is plain if we regard
   them as viewing the predictions of Jesus as referring to the indefinite
   future, and not the immediate present.] ^d 27 And after the sop, then
   entered Satan into him. [Exposure only hardened Judas and made him
   resign himself more fully to the influence of the devil.] Jesus
   therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly. [Jesus does not
   command the deed, but since it has already been determined upon, he
   dismisses Judas from his presence with words which fix the manner in
   which the deed should be done. Judas was still under divine command in
   a limited sense, for Satan himself is not beyond divine authority.] 28
   Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
   [Jesus had not fully and openly revealed Judas as the traitor. To have
   done so in the presence of the fiery Galilæans might have resulted in
   violence to the person of the betrayer.] 29 For some thought, because
   Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have
   need of for the feast [the feast on the evening of the first day of the
   festival of unleavened bread appears to have been both joyful and very
   bountiful]; or, that he should give something to the poor. [Probably to
   aid them in preparing for this feast.] 30 He then having received the
   sop went out straightway: and it was night. [Though this expression,
   "it was night," is merely one which marks the time of day, nearly all
   commentators feel the weird force of it (Luke xxii. 53). Alford says,
   "I feel, with Meyer, that there is something awful in this
   termination--'it was night.'"] 31 When therefore he was gone out, Jesus
   saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him; 32
   and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify
   him. [The departure of Judas was the first step in the progress of the
   Lord's Passion, and in this moment of its beginning Jesus exults in the
   prospect of its end. Having just condemned the false pride and glory of
   men by washing his disciples' feet, Jesus rejoices that the true glory
   of God is about to be immediately manifested in himself--the glory of
   humility, charity, service, and self-sacrifice, which was realized to
   the utmost in the person of Jesus.] 33 Little children, yet a little
   while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews [see
   pp. 447, 448], Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you. 34
   A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I
   have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men
   know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. [In the
   term of tenderness "my little children," with which Jesus opens this
   paragraph, we see one of the marks of love referred to by John (John
   xiii. 1). It is found nowhere else in the Gospels. In the light of his
   near separation Jesus looked upon his apostles as about to be made
   orphan children. As to this new commandment, love had been commanded
   before (Lev. xix. 18), but the Christian love here commanded is
   different from that which the Jew was bade to feel for the Jew, just as
   the affection of a loving family differs from the mere broad and kindly
   spirit of neighborliness. A love which had Christ's heart as the
   standard would of necessity be new, and would distinguish those who
   possessed it from all men.] ^b 27 And ^a 31 Then saith Jesus unto them,
   All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written [ Zech.
   xiii. 7], I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall
   be scattered abroad. 32 But ^b 28 Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will
   go before you into Galilee. [The scattering would take place after the
   return of the apostles to Galilee, and there after his resurrection,
   Jesus would gather them together as their shepherd.] ^d 36 Simon Peter
   saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go,
   thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards. 37 Peter
   saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay
   down my life for thee. [Peter, grieved at the prospect of separation,
   can see no reason why he should not follow, since he is willing to pass
   even through the portal of the grave that he may do so. Though perhaps
   prevented by no moral inability, he was prevented by the plan of life
   which God had designed for him. It was not in accordance with the
   divine will that he should die at this time.] 38 Jesus answereth, Wilt
   thou lay down thy life for me? ^c 31 Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked
   to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: 32 but I made
   supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not [The language here
   suggests a repetition, in some degree, of Satan's conduct in the case
   of Job. See Job i., ii. Jesus, having insight into what was going on in
   the spirit world, made supplication that Peter might be enabled to
   endure the trial]; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again,
   establish thy brethren. [The language sadly intimates that Satan's test
   would leave him in need of repentance. As the one who perhaps exercised
   the strongest influence over the other ten apostles, Peter is exhorted
   to use his own bitter experience for their benefit and strengthening.]
   33 And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to
   prison and to death. ^a 33 But Peter answered and said unto him, ^b
   Although, { ^a If} all shall be offended in thee, ^b yet will not I. ^a
   I will never be offended. [Thus Peter repudiates the idea that he could
   not stand the test.] ^b 30 And Jesus saith { ^a said} unto him, Verily
   I say unto thee, ^c I tell thee, Peter, ^b that thou to-day, even this
   night, before the cock crow twice, ^c thou shalt thrice deny that thou
   knowest me. ^d Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not
   crow, ^c this day, ^d till { ^c until} ^d thou hast denied me thrice.
   [Mark speaks of two cock-crowings and shows that the denial of Peter
   occurred between them (Mark xiv. 68-72). But Matthew, Luke, and John
   speak of but one cock-crowing and place the denial before it. The
   discrepancy is not an important one. Luke and John look upon the night
   in its entirety and speak of the cock-crowing at three in the morning,
   the signal of the dawning day. Mark looks at the night in its details,
   and shows that the denials of Peter began at midnight, the time of the
   first cock-crowing, and were finished before the last, or about three
   in the morning. Peter appears to have been thunderstruck at this
   prediction, which showed the nature, the details, and the nearness of
   his sin. He lapsed into silence, and we hear no more from him during
   the discourses which followed. But he did not yield without one final
   protest, as the sequel shows.] ^b 31 But ^a Peter ^b spake exceedingly
   vehemently, ^a saith unto him, Even ^b If I must die with thee, I will
   not deny thee. And in like manner { ^a Likewise} also said all the
   disciples. [According to Matthew's account these accusations of our
   Lord and protestations of Peter were taken up again after Jesus left
   the upper room and was on his way to Gethsemane. The reader may
   therefore conceive of them as occurring again in the opening lines of
   [9]Section CXXIII.] ^c 35 And he said unto them, When I sent you forth
   without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? [See pp. 363,
   364.] And they said, Nothing. 36 And he said unto them, But now, he
   that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that
   hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. 37 For I say unto
   you, that this which is written [Isa. liii. 12] must be fulfilled in
   me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth
   me hath fulfilment. 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two
   swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. [In this passage our Lord
   draws a contrast between the favor with which his messengers had been
   received on their former mission and the trials and persecutions which
   awaited them in their future course. If they had prepared then to be
   received with joy, they were to prepare now to be opposed with
   bitterness; for the utter rejection of the Master would be followed by
   the violent persecution of the servants. The apostles took the words of
   Jesus literally, and showed two swords, and the Lord, for their future
   enlightenment, said, "It is enough," thus intimating that he did not
   mean a literal arming with carnal weapons, for had he done so, two
   swords would not have sufficed for twelve men.]

The Lord's Supper Instituted.

(Jerusalem. Evening Before the Crucifixion.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 26-29; ^B Mark XIV. 22-25; ^C Luke XXII. 19, 20; ^F I. Cor. XI.
23-26.

   ^a 26 And as they were eating, ^f the Lord Jesus in the night in which
   he was betrayed took bread; 24 and when he had given thanks, { ^b
   blessed,} ^f he brake it, ^a and he gave to the disciples, and said, ^b
   Take ye: ^a Take, eat; this is my body. ^f which is ^c given ^f for
   you: this do in remembrance of me. [As only unleavened bread was eaten
   during the paschal supper, that kind of bread must have been used by
   our Lord, and it is fitting that it should still be used by us in
   keeping the Lord's Supper, not only for propriety's sake, but because
   that bread which is emblematic of purity is most suitable to represent
   the body of the sinless Christ. The Catholics and some few others take
   our Lord's words literally when he says, "This is my body." On this
   they found the doctrine of transubstantiation, i. e., that the bread
   and the wine become literal body and blood when blessed by the priest.
   There are many weighty arguments against such a doctrine, but the main
   one for it is found in the words of our Lord. But Jesus could not have
   meant them literally, for his body was untouched and his blood unshed
   on this occasion when he spoke them. Moreover, in the twenty-fifth
   verse of Mark given below, Jesus calls the wine "the fruit of the
   vine," when, according to the theory of transubstantiation, it had been
   turned into blood and hence was not wine at all.] ^b 23 And he took a {
   ^c the} cup in like manner ^f also ^c after supper [Luke distinguishes
   between the cup taken during (see p. 646) and that taken after supper.
   The first belonged to the passover, this to the Lord's Supper. Wine,
   mingled with water, was drunk during the paschal supper. Jesus took a
   cup of this for his new institution. But the word "wine" is nowhere
   used in any of the accounts of the Lord's Supper, the terms "cup" and
   "fruit of the vine" being employed in its stead. Those, therefore, who
   choose to use unfermented grape juice are guilty of no irregularity.]
   ^a and gave thanks, and ^b when he had given thanks, he gave to them:
   24 And he said { ^a saying} ^b unto them, ^a Drink ye all of it ["All"
   refers to the persons and not to the wine. It was important that all
   the disciples participate in the cup, but not that all the wine should
   be used]; 28 for this is my blood of the covenant, ^c This cup is the
   new covenant in my blood [Jer. xxxi. 31-34. It was the practice of
   Eastern peoples to use blood in making any pact or covenant (Ex. xxiv.
   6-8). Christ represents himself as the victim from whence the blood was
   to be taken to ratify or seal the new covenant, and he makes the cup
   the symbol of that blood. A full discussion of the old and new
   covenants will be found in the Book of Hebrews. We may, however, sum
   them up by saying that the old covenant promised the land of Canaan and
   Christ in the flesh to the Israelites, while the new covenant promises
   heaven and Christ in glory to the Christian], ^b which is poured out
   for many. [It is explicitly stated elsewhere that Christ died for all
   (Heb. ii. 9; II. Cor. v. 14, 15), and the word "many" is used, not to
   contradict, but to emphasize the fact. When the persons included are
   contemplated individually, the term many is employed on account of the
   vast number of them; for no man can number the individuals for whom
   Christ died. But when they are contemplated under the feebler
   conception of the whole, the term all is employed.] ^a unto remission
   of sins. ^c even that which is poured out for you. [The prime object of
   Christ's death is here declared. It was to accomplish the forgiveness
   of sins. All other purposes which it served are subordinate to this,
   and all other blessings which it secures are consequent upon this--John
   i. 29; Eph. v. 2; Heb. vii. 27; I. John ii. 2; iv. 10; Isa. liii. 10;
   Rom. viii. 2; I. Cor. xv. 3.] ^f this do, as often as ye drink it, in
   remembrance of me. [The word "remembrance" comes as a refrain after
   both the loaf and the cup. The central purpose of the supper is to
   bring the sacrifice of Christ and all its blessed results vividly to
   mind.] 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye
   proclaim the Lord's death till he come. [This verse is a comment of
   Paul's upon the nature of the supper. In keeping the Lord's Supper we
   proclaim to our own souls and to the world our trust in the death of
   Christ, and our hope that he will return and fulfill the expectations
   begotten in us by it.] ^a 29 But ^b 25 Verily I say unto you, I shall
   no more drink { ^a shall not drink henceforth} ^b of the { ^a this}
   fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in ^b the kingdom
   of God. ^a my Father's kingdom. ^b and they all drank of it. [In
   speaking of this future drinking of the fruit of the vine Jesus does
   not mean literal wine, for he does not drink literal wine with his
   disciples in the kingdom as it now is, nor will he do so in the eternal
   kingdom. The term "drink," therefore, is used figuratively for that
   communion which Jesus has with his disciples while they are drinking
   the wine of the Lord's Supper. The term new is most naturally
   understood as modifying wine, but as the wine of the supper is not
   necessarily new wine, we think it rather indicates the new method of
   drinking wine just described.]

Farewell Discourse to Disciples.

(Jerusalem. Evening Before the Crucifixion.)

^D John XIV.-XVI.

   ^d 1 Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in
   me. [That one should betray him and one should deny him, that all
   should be offended, and that the Lord should depart, raised anxieties
   which Jesus here seeks to quiet. That they should go out as homeless
   wanderers without the presence of their Lord and be subjected to
   persecution, was also in their thoughts. But Jesus sustains their
   spirits by appealing to them to trust in the unseen Father, and his yet
   present self. As to the two verbs "believe," both may be either
   indicatives or imperatives.] 2 In my Father's house are many mansions
   [Many abiding places or homes. They were not to be homeless always]; if
   it were not so, I would have told you [That is to say, if heaven had
   been of such limited capacity that there was little or no hope that you
   could follow me, I should have dealt plainly with you, and should have
   disabused your mind of all vain hopes. But there is room (Luke xiv.
   22), and you may follow--John xiii. 36]; for I go to prepare a place
   for you. [We are familiar with the thought that the going, or death, of
   Jesus prepared a way for us by providing a fountain for the cleansing
   of our sin, and by rending the veil of the temple, "thus signifying
   that the way into heaven is now open." But the thought here is
   different. Jesus departed to prepare places for his own in the Father's
   house.] 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and
   will receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
   [The cause for the departure becomes the assurance of the return.] 4
   And whither I go, ye know the way. [My manner of life leads to the
   Father's house, and as ye know that manner of life, ye know the way.] 5
   Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know
   we the way? [Thomas looked for a way wherein one might walk with his
   feet.] 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the
   life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. [God is not approached
   by physical motion. Being spirit, we must draw near to him by spiritual
   simplicity, and this is revealed to us fully in the person of Christ,
   and an energizing power is imparted by Christ to enable us to attain
   unto it.] 7 If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also [the
   unity of nature and of character is so perfect that to know the Son is
   to know the Father also]: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen
   him. [This saying is the outgrowth of what is said in the sixth verse.
   Since we can only come to the Father's likeness by the imitation of
   Jesus, then the truth here uttered follows; viz.: that to see Jesus is
   to see the Father.] 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father,
   and it sufficeth us. 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time
   with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
   seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father? [As Thomas asked
   for a physical instead of a spiritual approach to God, so Philip asked
   for a physical instead of a spiritual revelation of him. The answer of
   Jesus tenderly rebukes Philip. The excellency of God is not physical,
   but spiritual. Righteousness, truth, love, holiness, etc. are all
   spiritual. A physical revelation of God, if such a thing had been
   practicable or even possible, would have been of little or no benefit
   to the apostles. All the physical demonstrations at Mt. Sinai did not
   prevent the manufacture and worship of the golden calf.] 10 Believest
   thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that
   I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me
   doeth his works. [The question of Jesus is a mild rebuke because Philip
   had been so slow to learn and to believe what the Lord had taught;
   viz.: his unity with the Father (p. 486), and that he did and taught by
   the will of his Father and not of himself--p. 456.] 11 Believe me that
   I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the
   very works' sake. [To ask Jesus to reveal the indwelling Father was
   much the same as to ask a man to reveal his own soul. Therefore Jesus
   asks Philip to take his word for the great fact, or, if that were not
   deemed sufficient, to believe it because of the works which Jesus
   wrought. Divine works testify to the presence of a divine spirit and
   power.] 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the
   works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he
   do; because I go unto the Father. [Jesus while in the world manifested
   sufficient supernatural power to give credibility to the statement that
   the Father worked through him. But he here declares that his return to
   the Father will be followed by yet fuller tokens and evidences of his
   union with the Father. The first of these evidences enumerated is the
   larger sphere of power granted to the believer. By this the Lord does
   not mean the disciples shall perform greater miracles, but that they
   shall produce moral and spiritual revolutions which are instinsically
   more divinely wonderful than miracles. For instance, at his death Jesus
   had converted about five hundred disciples, but at Pentecost the
   apostles converted three thousand in one day. The converts of Paul also
   greatly outnumbered those of Christ's own ministry.] 13 And whatsoever
   ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be
   glorified in the Son. 14 If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will
   I do. [The second token of Christ's union with the Father would be
   manifested in the efficacy of prayer made in his name. Hitherto prayer
   had not been thus made (John xvi. 24). God would glorify himself
   through Christ by answering prayer thus made.] 15 If ye love me, ye
   will keep my commandments. 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall
   give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, 17 even
   the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth
   him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and
   shall be in you. [The third token of Christ's union with the Father
   would be the sending of the Holy Spirit (Acts ii. 33). Since, however,
   the worldly-minded could neither receive nor behold the Spirit, the
   promise to send him to the disciples is prefaced by an appeal to them
   to keep his commandments, and thus avoid a worldly spirit such as would
   be compatible with the reception of the Holy Spirit. The word
   "Comforter" does not fully translate the Greek word Paraklete; no
   English word does. The word "Advocate" may be used, and "Helper" is as
   good if not better than "Comforter." He is called the Spirit of truth
   because of his many relationships to the truth (John xvii. 19; I. Cor.
   ii. 4; I. Thess. i. 5; Acts ii. 4; v. 32; Heb. ii. 4). That the gift of
   the Holy Spirit is conditioned upon belief and obedience is also taught
   elsewhere (John vii. 38; Acts ii. 38; v. 32). We should observe that by
   the use of the word "another" Jesus shows that he himself had been and
   would be a Paraklete. But earthly fellowship with him was about to be
   cut short, and therefore the Holy Spirit would come, with whom
   fellowship would never be interrupted. We should note, too, the
   distinction between the present "abideth with you," and the future
   "shall be in you." The Spirit, being present in the person of Christ,
   had been abiding with the apostles who followed him. Hereafter the
   intimacy of the relation would be increased, and the Spirit should
   abide within them.] 18 I will not leave you desolate [Literally,
   orphans. The expression breathes the spirit of a father, as at John
   xiii. 33]: I come unto you. 19 Yet a little while, and the world
   beholdeth me no more [the next day the world crucified him and sealed
   him in the tomb, and since then has seen him no more]; but ye behold me
   [the present tense here indicates a continued vision; it can not
   therefore refer to the appearances of Christ after the resurrection,
   for the terminated at the end of forty days]: because I live, ye shall
   live also. 20 In that day [we may take this either as the day of
   Pentecost, or the period which began on that day] ye shall know that I
   am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 21 He that hath my
   commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that
   loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
   manifest myself unto him. [The fourth and all-convincing token of
   Jesus' union with the Father would be his return in the spirit which is
   here described. It was not his temporary return after the resurrection,
   as is shown above, neither was it his final return to judgment, because
   it was one in which the world would not behold him, and at his final
   return "every eye shall see him." Jesus, therefore, speaks of his
   return in the spirit, and his inward manifestation of himself to his
   disciples wherein he energizes them with his own life. A coming,
   however, which, like that of the Holy Spirit, is conditioned upon the
   loving obedience of the disciples. The writings of Paul abound with
   expressions illustrating the nature of this coming of Christ. It is not
   to be confused with the coming of the Holy Spirit, though doubtless
   wholly concurrent with it.] 22 Judas (not Iscariot) [who had gone out.
   See table of apostles, p. 222, for this Judas, or Thaddæus] saith unto
   him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto
   us, and not unto the world? [The form of his question betrays the
   apostle's bewilderment. Expecting that Jesus would soon be an earthly
   king, he could not imagine how Jesus could so have changed his plans as
   to thus withdraw himself utterly from the world. The answer of Jesus
   gave Judas but little present light.] 23 Jesus answered and said unto
   him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love
   him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 24 He that
   loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not
   mine, but the Father's who sent me. [Jesus contents himself by pointing
   out to Judas the fact that loving obedience is the means by which the
   blessed indwelling is obtained. It was better that Judas should busy
   his heart and will about the means of blessing rather than his head
   about the mysterious and incomprehensible manner of it.] 25 These
   things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you. 26 But the
   Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
   he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
   said unto you. [The word "spoken" of the twenty-fifth verse stands in
   contrast with the word "teach" of the twenty-sixth . Jesus had uttered
   the truth, but because of the divine plan of salvation through the
   death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of our Lord was yet
   incomplete, all the words which he had spoken were but dimly
   understood, since they were related to and founded upon this
   incompleted plan. When the plan was completed the Holy Spirit would
   reveal or teach the meaning of the words by bringing them to
   remembrance after full comprehension of the plan to which they
   related.] 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as
   the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
   neither let it be fearful. [This legacy of peace is by no means to be
   confined to the period of doubt and fear which accompanied the
   crucifixion; in fact, it seems to overstep that period, and to begin
   after it, and continue throughout all the trouble ministry of the
   apostles. The breadth of the legacy also to be noted: 1. The quality of
   it; it was not the absolute unshaken peace of God, but the peace which
   Jesus himself possessed while upon the earth--peace with all things
   save the devil and his powers. 2. The nature of it; it was not peace
   from without, but from within. It was not such as promised to pacify
   and quell the persecutors, but a promise of inner calm amidst the
   storm. 3. The manner of it; it was no stinted, measured store such as
   the world bestows, but a full, free gift from the overflowing bounty of
   God.] 28 Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If
   ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for
   the Father is greater than I. [The departure of Jesus was not wholly a
   humiliation, as it might appear to them; but a real exaltation at which
   they might well rejoice, and that the more readily and freely since it
   would not mean to them the total separation which they anticipated,
   because he would return in the spirit. The word "greater" as here used
   does not refer to any difference in the nature or essence of the Son as
   related to the Father. It may well be true that there has been a
   certain subordination of the will of the Son to the will of the Father
   from all eternity, but even that, if it exists, is not referred to
   here. Jesus has in mind the utter humiliation to which his mediatorial
   office had brought him, and to even lower depths to which it was about
   to bring him. From all this his departure to the Father would in a
   large measure free him, restoring him in some degree to that state of
   equilibrium in glory, power and authority from which he had
   descended--Phil. ii. 6.] 29 And now I have told you before it come to
   pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe. [Jesus had told
   them fully of his return to the Father, that when they received the
   subsequent manifestation of it they might firmly believe it.] 30 I will
   no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he
   hath nothing in me; 31 but that the world may know that I love the
   Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. [In a few
   hours the earthly teaching of Jesus would be interrupted by the coming
   of Satan and would never be resumed save in occasional fragments. Satan
   would come in the persons of his servants and emissaries, but he would
   find nothing in Christ which would give him either right or reason to
   exercise power over him. The sorrows and sufferings of Christ would be
   entered upon of his own free will because by enduring them for our
   sakes he would please the Father and carry out his commandments, and
   thus manifest to the world the love which he bore the Father.] Arise,
   let us go hence. [Some think that Jesus then left the room, and that
   the next three chapters of John's Gospel contain matters spoken on the
   way to Gethsemane. But it is likely that the words of these chapters
   were spoken in the upper room after they had risen from the table and
   prepared to depart, and that John xviii. 1 marks the leaving of the
   upper room as well as the crossing of the Kidron.]

   XV. 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 2 Every
   branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every
   branch that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it [by pruning], that it may
   bear more fruit. [The use of the word "true" shows that Jesus refers to
   a typical vine. The Jewish people had been such a vine (Isa. v. 1; Ps.
   lxxx. 8-16; Jer. ii. 21). Yet it was but "a figure of the true" (Heb.
   ix. 24). God had now in Christ planted the true vine, and would
   dissever and cast off all that did not derive life from him, and would
   prune all that did. This vital connection with Christ is set forth by
   Paul under the figure of a body and its head (Eph. v. 23; Col. ii. 19).
   The fact that Jesus had just given them the fruit of the vine to drink
   as the symbol of his blood made the transition to this figure easy and
   natural, for the branches derive their juices from the vine.] 3 Already
   ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. [It is
   God in Christ who cleanseth the soul, but this cleansing is effected
   through hearing, believing and obeying the Word. The Word tells us what
   to do that we may be cleansed and saved--Eph. v. 26; Jas. i. 18.] 4
   Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
   except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
   5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in
   him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.
   6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
   withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
   are burned. [The whole parable is intended to teach us Christ's
   relationships. 1. Toward the Father--Husbandman and Vine. 2. Toward
   man--Vine and branches. 3. Toward good works--Vine, branches, and
   fruit. 4. The negative condition, or lack of relationship--the Vine,
   the dissevered branches, the fire.] 7 If ye had known me, ye would have
   known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
   [Though this verse stands somewhat in contrast to the warning in verse
   6, it is rather a statement of causation than a promise of reward. If
   by communion and the study of the word we abide in Christ, our prayers
   will be of such a nature that it will fully accord with the divine
   counsel to answer them, for they will be prayers tending toward
   fruitfulness.] 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
   fruit; and so shall ye be my disciples. [The spirit of Christ leads to
   those deeds which cause men to glorify God (Matt. ix. 8; Luke xvii.
   15), and whoso does those deeds causes such glorification (Matt. v.
   16). Moreover, the spirit of Christ leads to abundant fruitfulness, and
   he who has it, not only performs charitable deeds, but converts the
   sinner and begets a spirit of goodness in those about him (Matt. xiii.
   8-26; Phil. iv. 17); and this fruitfulness becomes an evidence or
   demonstration of true discipleship.] 9 Even as the Father hath loved
   me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love. 10 If ye keep my
   commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my
   Father's commandments, and abide in his love. [From the outward
   evidence of union with Christ, shown by the fruit, Jesus now turns to
   that inward bond of union which is the cause of fruitfulness. That bond
   is love. Love is, as it were, the sap which passes back and forth
   between the Vine and branch, and that love is kept active and vital by
   the most practical of means--obedience to commandments, a means which
   the Lord himself does not hesitate to describe as efficient between
   himself and the Father, only claiming for himself the love of the
   Father because of a like obedience to that which he prescribed. "And
   our obedience must be impartial," says Jay; "we must do 'whatsoever' he
   commands us."] 11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may
   be in you, and that your joy may be made full. [He had spoken the words
   of this discourse that the disciples might have a joy corresponding to
   his own. By perfect obedience he enjoyed a consciousness of the
   Father's presence and approval. By a like obedience the disciples might
   have a like sense of his presence and approval, and hence a like joy.]
   12 This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have
   loved you. 13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down
   his life for his friends. [Jesus gives, as his supreme commandment,
   this law of love. The disciples are to love one another as intensely as
   Jesus loved them, and the measure of the intensity of his love is
   prophetically set forth by an allusion to his death on their behalf.
   But he died for his enemies as well as for his friends--Rom. v. 6.] 14
   Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you. 15 No
   longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his
   lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard
   from my Father, I have made known unto you. [The commandments of Jesus
   were not to be obeyed in the spirit of bondmen, but in that of friends.
   Jesus had shown his friendship by receiving his apostles into
   confidence as to the things which he had heard from his Father.] 16 Ye
   did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should
   go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye
   shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. [Jesus shows
   the stability of the friendship existing between him and the disciples
   in that origin of it lies in himself and not in them. For he chose them
   as friends before they chose him, gave them their high places as
   apostles without their solicitation, prepared them to bring forth
   lasting fruits, and gave them the privilege of supplementing their
   personal deficiencies by prayer made effective through his name.] 17
   These things I command you [this includes all the precepts from the
   beginning of the chap. xiii.], that ye may love one another. 18 If the
   world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you.
   [While teaching the fullness and richness of love which is to exist
   within the circle of discipleship, Jesus warns them that in opposition
   to it the outer circle of unconverted and sensual--that circle known as
   the world--would manifest a spirit of hatred. Since this world-spirit
   hated him, the disciples need not be surprised to find that it hated
   them when manifesting his spirit.] 19 If ye were of the world, the
   world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I
   chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 20 Remember
   the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord.
   [John xiii. 16.] If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you;
   if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. [The apostles could
   rest assured that the messengers would receive like treatment with him
   who sent them. When, therefore, they found the world rejecting their
   message they could cheer themselves with the expectation that a few at
   least would receive it, since a few had always received the words of
   the Master.] 21 But all these things will they do unto you for my
   name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. [Christians in the
   early ages were persecuted for bearing the name of Christ by those who
   were ignorant of God. But this name, hateful to the world, was sweet to
   the disciples. For opposition to the name, see Acts v. 28; I. Pet. iv.
   14; Rev. iii. 8. For joy in it see Acts v. 41; II. Cor. xii. 10; Gal.
   vi. 17.] 22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had
   sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin. 23 He that hateth me
   hateth my Father also. 24 If I had not done among them the works which
   none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and
   hated both me and my Father. 25 But this cometh to pass, that the word
   may be fulfilled that is written in their law [Ps. xxxv. 19; lxix. 4],
   They hated me without a cause. [Though the great proof of the hatred of
   Christ was yet to come, it is spoken of as if it had passed. Jesus does
   not mean to say that the world would have committed no sin at all if he
   had kept away from it. The meaning is that it would not have been
   guilty of the sin of rejecting Jesus. They would have been excusable.]
   26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
   Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he
   shall bear witness of me: 27 and ye also bear witness, because ye have
   been with me from the beginning. [One of the principal offices of the
   Spirit is to testify of Christ (John xvi. 13-15). The Spirit testified
   through the apostles and other messengers (Acts ii. 4), so that in a
   sense the apostles were double witnesses. They themselves could testify
   as to what they had seen and heard. The Spirit could aid them to
   testify accurately, and with a full intelligence as to the real meaning
   of things. The Spirit also gave attention to apostolic testimony by
   enabling the apostles to work miracles.]

   XVI. 1 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
   caused to stumble. [Jesus warned his disciples of coming persecutions
   in order that those persecutions might not shake their faith.] 2 They
   shall put you out of the synagogues [see pp. 466, 467]: yea, the hour
   cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service
   unto God. [Persecutors would not only take away religious privileges,
   but even life itself, and they would do this as a religious act,
   esteeming Christians such enemies of God that God would take pleasure
   in their death. Paul gives us an illustration of this fanatical
   zeal--Acts xxvi. 9; Gal. i. 13, 14.] 3 And these things will they do,
   because they have not known the Father, nor me. 4 But these things have
   I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them,
   how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the
   beginning, because I was with you. [The disciples being but few, and
   finding the vast majority of the nation against them, and being but
   unlearned Galilæans, and finding the leaders--the wise, the cultured,
   the mighty--against them, would be tempted to doubt the correctness of
   their course, and to ask, "May we not, after all, be mistaken: may not
   those who know more be better judges in this matter than we who are so
   ignorant?" To forestall and prevent such questioning, Jesus asserts
   that the ignorance is with the rulers. Knowledge of himself and of his
   Father is the great and supreme knowledge, and the apostles having this
   were wiser than those with all other learning. It would also strengthen
   their faith to remember that the Lord's divine wisdom had foreseen all
   this trouble.] And these things I said not unto you from the beginning,
   because I was with you. [While he was with his disciples they were in
   no danger, for he himself bore the brunt of persecution. In the
   beginning, therefore, of his ministry he did not deem it expedient to
   dishearten his disciples by foretelling trials which were then remote.
   When he began to announce his approaching death, then he also began to
   declare that the disciple must be willing to lose his life if he would
   find it. See pp. 414-417. Some think that Matt. v. 10-12 forms a
   contradiction to our Lord's statement here. While the words in Matthew
   were spoken early enough to be classified as "from the beginning,"
   their import is to general to permit of their being brought into
   contrast with this direct and personal prediction of persecution.] 5
   But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither
   goest thou? 6 But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow
   hath filled your heart. 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is
   expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter
   will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. [The
   disciples had asked the Lord whither he was going (John xiii. 36; xiv.
   5), but their question had a very different meaning from that which
   Jesus here suggests to them. They asked it to ascertain whether his
   departure would involve a separation or whether it would be a
   withdrawal from the world in which they could accompany him. The
   question which he suggests has reference to the place to which he was
   about to journey, that place being the home and presence of his Father.
   The question asked was selfish, as if the apostles had asked, "What
   will your departure mean to us?" The question suggested was generous,
   intimating that the apostles should have asked, "What will this
   departure mean to you?" Viewing his departure from a selfish standpoint
   filled their hearts with sorrow; but viewing it from a generous
   standpoint would have filled them with sympathetic joy, because of the
   supreme happiness which it would bring to their Master (John xiv. 28).
   But even from a selfish standpoint the apostles would have had reason
   to rejoice because of the advantage which would accrue to them through
   the Lord's departure, for that departure would result in the advent of
   the Holy Spirit. Space does not permit us to discuss why the Spirit
   could not come until the Lord had departed, but the verses which follow
   give us one good and sufficient reason, for they show that his work had
   to do with the conviction of human hearts through the preaching of a
   completed gospel, and the ascension or return of Christ to heaven, and
   his enthronement in glory there, are essential parts of that completed
   gospel.] 8 And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect
   of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment [It would be the work of
   the Holy Spirit to take the truths respecting Christ, and, using the
   apostles as mouthpieces (Acts ii. 1-37), to convince the world as to
   these truths. This convincing work was entirely in relation to Christ,
   the sin of disbelieving him, the righteousness revealed in him, and the
   power of judgment conferred upon him]: 9 of sin, because they believe
   not on me; 10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye
   behold me no more; 11 of judgment, because the prince of this world
   hath been judged. [Sin, righteousness, and a day of judgment with its
   reward upon one and its punishment upon the other, are three cardinal
   doctrines of the gospel. The Spirit convinces the world that disbelief
   in Christ is its fatal sin, for belief in Christ leads to forgiveness,
   and to the unbelieving there is no forgiveness. The least sin is a sin
   unto death, and is a sin eternal unless forgiven. The greatest sin, if
   forgiven, becomes harmless and is as if it had never been. Until the
   world is convinced of this great truth it feels no need of a gospel.
   Again, Christianity teaches that righteousness is prerequisite to the
   attainment of the presence of God. Without righteousness we can never
   behold him, nor can we ever hope to stand before him. But this required
   righteousness was found in Jesus, for he returned to the Father, and
   abides with the Father, being seen by us no more. The Holy Spirit
   convinces the world that those who are found in Christ, having his
   righteousness, shall attain unto the presence of the Father (Phil. iii.
   3-14). Lastly, the Spirit convinces the world that Jesus is
   commissioned as its judge. Our Lord's resurrection is the assurance of
   this fact (Acts xvii. 31). The resurrection is such an assurance
   because it is an evidence of the judgment and condemnation of Satan,
   the head and leader in sinful rebellion against God, and he that hath
   power to judge the head thereby shows he has power to judge the body.
   Satan held the power of death over humanity, but Jesus judged him and
   brought him to naught by taking away this power (Heb. ii. 14, 15). The
   cross of Christ as the source of life asserted his superiority over all
   other powers (Col. ii. 14, 15), which implies an ability to judge
   them.] 12 I have yet many things unto say to you, but ye cannot bear
   them now. [The doctrines of the gospel were necessarily obscure and
   largely incomprehensible to the apostles until time had developed the
   gospel facts. Jesus, therefore, forbore to speak of many things at this
   time, lest by doing so he should confuse the minds of his followers.]
   13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you
   into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what
   things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare
   unto you the things that are to come. 14 He shall glorify me: for he
   shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you. [The Holy Spirit was
   to bring no absolutely new teaching. The Son of God here claims for
   himself all that the Spirit taught even to the declaration of things to
   come. The Spirit would bring to mind and republish in the minds of the
   apostles all the words which Jesus had spoken, and would add those
   things which, being now in the mind of Jesus, were really part of his
   teaching, but which he at this present forbore to utter, the apostles
   not being able to bear them.] 15 All things whatsoever the Father hath
   are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare
   it unto you. [The Son's unity of interest with the Father made him
   possessor of all the Father's truth, as well as all the Father's
   counsel as to the future. As Jesus, therefore, might at this time have
   uttered all which the Holy Spirit subsequently taught, he rightfully
   claimed all the teaching of the Spirit as his.] 16 A little while, and
   ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.
   [Having finished his digression about the Holy Spirit, Jesus here
   returns to his point of departure, the theme of verse 5 above. Of
   course the apostles would see Jesus after his resurrection, but the
   seeing here spoken of refers more especially to that spiritual
   communion with him previously mentioned--John xiv. 19-23.] 17 Some of
   his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith
   unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little
   while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? [John xiv.
   28.] 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little
   while? We know not what he saith. [Having been unable to entertain the
   idea of our Lord's burial and resurrection, no wonder the apostles were
   mystified by these allusions to it.] 19 Jesus perceived [by his divine
   insight--John ii. 24, 25; vi. 61; Matt. ix. 4] that they were desirous
   to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves
   concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and
   again a little while, and ye shall see me? 20 Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice:
   ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. [The
   death of Jesus truly brought gladness to his enemies (Luke xxii. 5),
   and sorrow to his friends (John xx. 11), but the sorrow was indeed
   turned to joy--Matt. xxviii. 8.] 21 A woman when she is in travail hath
   sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the
   child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is
   born into the world. [The simile here is very apropos, according with
   Scriptural ideals--Col. i. 18; Rev. i. 5.] 22 And ye therefore now have
   sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and
   your joy no one taketh away from you. [Luke xxiv. 52, 53. The joyful
   hopes which come to us through the resurrection of Jesus are beyond the
   reach of the despoiling hand of man.] 23 And in that day ye shall ask
   me no question. [The coming of the Spirit would make all things clear,
   and the mysteries about which the apostles now questioned would then be
   fully explained.] Verily, verily [these two words give emphasis and
   introduce a new thought], I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of
   the Father, he will give it you in my name. 24 Hitherto have ye asked
   nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
   made full. [Having spoken of his departure, and of what the Spirit
   would do during his absence, he now speaks of the work which he would
   himself do while absent. He entered heaven as our high priest (Heb. ix.
   24), and part of his priestly office is to make intercession for his
   people (Heb. vii. 24, 25). The use of Christ's name for intercessory
   purposes was new to the apostles, since it was only thus employed after
   his ascension.] 25 These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings:
   the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings,
   but shall tell you plainly of the Father. [This closing discourse was
   full of dark sayings which the disciples did not understand, but when
   the gospel facts were completed and when the Spirit came on the day of
   Pentecost, then Christ through the Spirit made all things plain to
   them.] 26 In that day ye shall ask in my name [fullness of knowledge
   would lead them to look readily to Christ as intercessor]: and I say
   not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you; 27 for the Father
   himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I
   came forth from the Father. 28 I came out from the Father, and am come
   into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.
   [Birth and death are alike beyond our control. That Jesus had a divine
   as well as a human nature is shown by the fact that his entrance into
   and exit from the world were both governed by his own violation, as was
   also his resurrection (John x. 17, 18). While the apostles did not
   believe in the voluntary exit of Jesus, it having not yet taken place,
   they did believe that he had come into the world as a divine being, and
   for this belief the Father loved them, and this love of the Father was
   not to be lost sight of in considering the mediatory work of Christ. In
   short, the Father must be looked upon as one who does not need to be
   interceded with because of a lack of love. Though, according to the
   divine plan and order, Jesus is intercessor (I. Tim. ii. 5; I. John ii.
   1, 2), yet the office is not self-assumed for the purpose of
   counteracting any spirit of severity in the Father, but is, on the
   contrary, undertaken by direct appointment of the Father, made because
   of the Father's love (John iii. 16). Failing to recognize the Father as
   the fountain and source of grace, love and mercy has led the Roman
   Church into gross errors. The Father being suspected of undue rigor, a
   like suspicion arose also as to the Son because of his nearness to the
   Father. Therefore the Virgin Mary was called in to intercede with and
   soften the obduracy of the Son. Since the deification of the Virgin
   Mary in 1853, she also has been looked upon with growing distrust, and
   the tendency has been to call upon Joseph to intercede with Mary to
   intercede with the Son to intercede with the Father. Thus that
   wonderful love of God which passes all understanding is made less than
   that of mere mortals who never manifested a measure of philanthropy
   above what is common. Against such errors Jesus guards us by causing us
   to understand that, if the love of the Father alone were to be
   considered, there would be no need for him to intercede at all.] 29 His
   disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark
   saying. [They now clearly understood that as Jesus came from heaven so
   would he return to heaven, but they did not understand the process by
   which this return would be effected.] 30 Now know we that thou knowest
   all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we
   believe that thou camest forth from God. [The miraculous manner in
   which he had just read their thoughts caused them to boldly declare
   their faith in his divinity.] 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now
   believe? 32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be
   scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am
   not alone, because the Father is with me. [He contrasts the faith which
   his disciples then professed with that utter lack of it which they
   would manifest in a few hours. All their confidence in his divinity
   would vanish when they saw him arrested, etc., and they would seek
   their own safety, leaving him to his fate. Much as he would feel their
   desertion, he would not be left utterly comfortless, because the Father
   would be with him. Paul speaks in a similar strain--II. Tim. iv.
   16-18.] 33 These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have
   peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
   overcome the world. [Christ's return to the Father and his throne is
   the Christian's source of peace. As none of the accumulations of evil
   which came upon Christ prevented him from attaining his goal, so the
   Christian feels that in the conquering power of Christ, he too shall
   rise superior to all his troubles, and this feeling brings him peace.]

CXXII.

The Lord's Prayer.

(Jerusalem. Thursday Night.)

^D John XVII.

   ^d 1 These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven [the
   action marked the turning of his thoughts from the disciples to the
   Father], he said, Father, the hour is come [see pp. 116, 440]; glorify
   thy Son, that the son may glorify thee: 2 even as thou gavest him
   authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he
   should give eternal life. [The Son here prays for his glorification,
   viz.: resurrection, ascension, coronation, etc., that through these he
   may be perfected as a Saviour and be enabled to give that eternal life
   unto millions, the bestowal of which will redound unto the glory of the
   Father. Moreover, the glorification of Christ revealed his divine
   nature, and the Father was glorified by its thus becoming apparent that
   he had bestowed upon the world so priceless a gift. The gift of
   authority was bestowed after the resurrection (Matt. xxviii. 18). All
   humanity was given into his hands that he might give life to that part
   of it which yielded itself to him in true discipleship.] 3 And this is
   life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him
   whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ. [God is revealed in Jesus
   Christ: Jesus had just prayed for his glorification that the Father may
   be fully revealed him him. The revelation of God is the first step
   toward the attainment of eternal life. The inner reception of that
   revelation by a daily conformity to it is the second step. As we
   actually live God's life we come to know him; but we cannot attempt to
   live his life without a revelation.] 4 I glorified thee on the earth,
   having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do. 5 And now,
   Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had
   with thee before the world was. [As the hour for finishing his work had
   arrived, Jesus speaks of it as already finished. As he had finished
   that for which he had emptied himself of his glory and entered the
   world, he asks that now, on his departure from the world, he may be
   reinstated and permitted to assume again that which he had laid aside.
   Paul's words are commentary on these two verses (Phil. ii. 5-11). Thus
   Jesus ends the first division of his prayer which is a petition for
   himself, for the glory of the Father, and the good of the world. The
   second division which follows is a fourfold plea for the disciples
   which he then had, followed by petitions in their behalf.] 6 I
   manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world:
   thine they were, and thou gavest them to me [As a first plea or reason
   why the Father should bless the disciples of the Son, the Son urges
   that they are his property by gift of the Father. The Father is
   possessor of all humanity as the Creator; the Son by gift from the
   Father possesses the believing portion of humanity as its redeemer];
   and they have kept thy word. 7 Now they know that all things whatsoever
   thou hast given me are from thee: 8 for the words which thou gavest me
   I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth
   that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
   [As a second reason for blessing the disciples Jesus pleads their
   reception and retention of the truth which the Father had sent him to
   reveal, and the resulting knowledge and faith. The truth revealed by
   Jesus was so palpably divine that the disciples could know that its
   bearer came from heaven. But whether that bearer came of his own
   volition or as a commissioned messenger of the Father they could not
   know. But where knowledge was impossible, they trusted to Jesus and
   believed.] 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those
   whom thou hast given me; for they are thine: 10 and all things that are
   mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them. [As a
   third plea he urges the joint possession which the Father held with him
   in the disciples, and the further fact that the Son was glorified in
   the disciples.] 11 And I am no more in the world, and these are in the
   world, and I come to thee. [As a last plea he urges the necessity of
   the Father's care over the disciples since the Son will be no longer in
   the world to care for them.] Holy Father, keep them in thy name which
   thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are. [Our Lord's
   first petition grows out of his last plea. His departure would tend to
   scatter the disciples; they had been united by faith in the name of
   Christ, that is, by the divine power given of God and revealed in
   Christ (Ex. xxiii. 21; Isa. ix. 6; Jer. xxiii. 6), and Jesus asks that
   they may be still so kept, and that their unity may be as perfect as
   that subsisting between the Father and the Son.] 12 While I was with
   them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded
   them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition
   [literally, son of perishing] ; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
   [Ps. xli. 9. Jesus emphasizes the fervency of his petition by urging
   his own conduct as to that which he asks. He asks the Father to care
   for those for whom he had himself been so painstakingly careful that
   not one had been lost, save him whom it was impossible to save, and
   whose loss the Scripture had predicted--a loss in no way chargeable
   against the loving fidelity of the Good Shepherd.] 13 But now I come to
   thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy
   made full in themselves. [Being about ready to depart from the world,
   Jesus had taught and prayed for his disciples that they might be
   brought into a oneness with the Father similar to that which he himself
   enjoyed, and the consequent joy which filled his own life might in some
   measure fill theirs also. This also was part of his care for them.] 14
   I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are
   not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [An additional reason
   for the Father's care is here presented. The reception of the Father's
   word had brought upon them the hatred of the world, thereby increasing
   their need of a heavenly blessing, as a counter-balance to the curse of
   the world. Jesus as advocate gives potency to his petitions as to the
   sufferings of his disciples by suggesting that he has himself shared
   them--Heb. ii. 10-18.] 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them from
   the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one. [The
   care which he asks in protection in, and not removal from, the world.
   It is best both for the Christian and for the world that he should
   remain in it. The world is blessed by the Christian's presence (Matt.
   iv. 14-16), and abiding in the world affords the Christian an
   opportunity of conquest and reward--Rom. viii. 37; Rev. ii. 26; iii.
   21.] 16 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. 17
   Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth. 18 As thou didst send me
   into the world, even so sent I them into the world. 19 And for their
   sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in
   truth. [To sanctify means to set apart to a holy use. As Jesus himself
   had been set apart as God's messenger to the world, so he had set apart
   the apostles as his messengers to it. This setting apart was not a
   formal, empty act, but was accomplished by God's imparting or
   developing a fitness in the one sanctified to perform the duties for
   which he was set apart. Fitness in this case would be imparted by
   imbuing the apostles with the Spirit of truth. Jesus had set himself
   apart (Heb. ix. 14), that the apostles might follow his example--II.
   Cor. v. 14-17 (and also the church--Phil. ii. 5; Rom. xii. 1, 2), that
   thereby the world might be saved. Our Lord's prayer as to the apostles
   is, therefore, a threefold petition, viz.: that they may be kept in
   unity, kept from the world and the devil, and that they may be set
   apart and equipped for the gospel service. We come now to the third
   division of the prayer wherein he asks for blessings upon future
   believers.] 20 Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that
   believe on me through their word; 21 that they may all be one; even as
   thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us:
   that the world may believe that thou didst send me. [Here again the
   first petition is for unity, and again the unity subsisting between the
   Father and the Son is designated as the kind desired. That future
   disciples may understand the nature of this unity, Jesus sets it forth
   in an amplified statement, which reveals the fact that he does not ask
   for a unity similar to that subsisting between the Father and the Son,
   but for that very unity itself enlarged and extended so as to become a
   triple instead of a dual unity by the comprehension of the disciples
   within its compass. As a reason why the Father should bring about this
   unity (and a reason also why all Christians should work for it), our
   Lord states that its attainment will result in the conversion of the
   world to the Christian faith.] 22 And the glory which thou hast given
   me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one
   [Jesus here states that to bring about the unity which he here prays
   for he has bestowed upon the disciples the glory which the Father had
   bestowed upon him. The glory mentioned was that of being the Son of God
   (Matt. iii. 17; John i. 14; Heb. i. 5; iii. 6), which glory Jesus
   imparts to his followers (John i. 12; I. John iii. 1). In other words,
   he made us his brethren that we might be united in one great household
   (Rom. viii. 29; Eph. i. 10; ii. 19; I. John iii. 9, 10; iv. 8, 16). A
   true comprehension of the Fatherhood of God and our brotherhood in
   Christ must result in unity]; 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they
   may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send
   me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. [He here states that the
   perfect unity of the church and the putting forth of its power in
   harmonious effort to convert the world will be equivalent to a
   demonstration of the truth of his divine mission. Verse 21 above
   asserts that the initial stages of unity will produce faith in the
   world, and this verse adds that the perfection of that unity will lead
   the world beyond faith into the realm of actual knowledge as to the
   divine mission of Christ. The context suggests that this unity will
   result in gracious manifestations of the Father's love. Possibly these
   manifestations may be of such a nature as to aid in bringing about the
   state of knowledge mentioned.] 24 Father, I desire that they also whom
   thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my
   glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the
   foundation of the world. [While Jesus prays that his disciples may
   enter the heavenly state, that state is not expressed as the end
   desired. He wishes them to be in that state that they may behold his
   glory. The glory of Christ is his Sonship, and the love which
   accompanies that relationship. To behold this is the height of
   spiritual exaltation. To know God is life eternal, and to behold God is
   joy ineffable. God is truly beheld subjectively. We must be like him to
   see him as he is (I. John iii. 2). The second petition of Jesus,
   therefore, in no way savors of a vainglorious desire that his disciples
   may behold him to lead them to admire him, but a wish that they may
   participate in the heavenly state, and know the Sonship of Jesus and
   all its attendant blessedness by, in some measure, participating in
   it.] 25 O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee;
   and these knew that thou didst send me; 26 and I made known unto them
   thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst
   me may be in them, and I in them. [In theses closing sentences Jesus
   blends his present and his future disciples. To his present disciples
   he had made known the Father's name, and to the future ones he would
   make it known. The knowledge which he had of the Father had been
   imparted to the disciples, and they had received it, and had thereby
   been in some measure fitted for the revelation of the glory for which
   he had just prayed. The world, on the contrary, had rejected Christ's
   revelation, and had refused to know God, and had thus become unworthy
   of the privilege here asked for the disciples. Jesus had revealed the
   Father while on earth that men might attain to the revelation of God in
   the hereafter, thus participating in the love which the Father has for
   the Son because the Son is spiritually in them. It is a significant
   fact that the two of the five petitions of this prayer are for
   Christian unity. It may be said generally of all the petitions that
   they ask the Father to complete that which the Son has already begin
   and completed to the limit of his present circumscribed power.]

CXXIII.

Going to Gethsemane, and Agony Therein.

(a Garden Between the Brook Kidron and the Mount of Olives. Late Thursday
Night.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 30, 36-46; ^B Mark XIV. 26, 32-42; ^C Luke XXII. 39-46; ^D John
XVIII. 1.

   ^d 1 When Jesus had spoken these words [the words contained in John
   xiv.-xvi.] , ^a 30 And when they had sung a hymn [the shadow of the
   cross did not quench the spirit of praise in Christ], they went out ^c
   39 And he came out, and ^d he went forth with his disciples ^c as his
   custom was, ^d over the brook Kidron, ^a into { ^b unto} the mount of
   Olives. ^d where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his
   disciples. { ^c and the disciples also followed him.} ^a 36 Then cometh
   Jesus with them ^b 32 And they come unto a place which was named { ^a
   called} Gethsemane [The name Gethsemane means a place of oil-presses,
   and hence it accords well with the name of the mountain at whose base
   it was situated. But the place was now a garden. It was about half a
   mile from the city, and from what Luke says here and elsewhere (Luke
   xxi. 37), it seems that Jesus often resorted to it while in Jerusalem
   at the festivals. Compare also John xviii. 2], ^c 40 And when he was at
   the place, he said { ^a saith} unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I
   pray. ^c Pray that ye enter not into temptation. [As the hour of trial
   and temptation came upon Jesus he fortified himself against it by
   prayer. And he bade his disciples do likewise, for his arrest would
   involve them also in temptations which he foresaw that they would not
   be able to withstand.] ^a 37 And he took { ^b taketh} with him Peter ^a
   and the two sons of Zebedee, ^b James and John, and began to be greatly
   amazed, ^a sorrowful and sore troubled. [While seeking heavenly aid in
   this hour of extremity, our Lord also manifested his desire for human
   sympathy. All the eleven apostles were with him in the garden, and the
   three most capable of sympathizing with him were stationed nearer to
   him than the rest.] ^c 41 And he was parted from them about a stone's
   cast [one hundred fifty to two hundred feet]; ^b 34 And ^a 38 Then
   saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: ^b
   abide ye here, and watch. ^a with me. [The sequel shows that the phrase
   "even unto death" was no figure of rhetoric. The nervous prostration of
   Jesus was such as to endanger his life, and the watching of the
   apostles may have been doubly needful. Not only did he require their
   sympathy, but he may also have looked to them to render him assistance
   in the case of a physical collapse.] 39 And he went forward a little,
   ^c and he kneeled down ^b and fell on the face, ^a and fell on his
   face, and prayed, ^b that, if it were possible, the hour might pass
   away from him. [This posture was expressive of the most intense
   supplication.] 36 And he said, { ^a saying,} ^b Abba, ^a My Father, if
   it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: ^b all things are
   possible unto thee; ^c if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: ^b
   howbeit ^a nevertheless, not as { ^b what} I will, ^a but as { ^b what}
   thou wilt. ^c not my will, but thine, be done. [Much of mystery is
   found in all life, so it is small wonder if the dual nature of Jesus
   presents insoluble problems. It perplexes many to find that the divine
   in Jesus did not sustain him better during his trial in the garden. But
   we must remember that it was appointed unto Jesus to die, and that the
   divine in him was not to interfere with this appointment, or the
   approaches to it. For want, therefore, of a better expression, we may
   say that from the time Jesus entered the garden until he expired on the
   cross, the human in him was in the ascendant; and "being found in
   fashion as a man," he endured these trials is if wholly human. His
   prayer, therefore, is the cry of his humanity for deliverance. The
   words "if it is possible" with which it opens breathe the same spirit
   of submissive obedience which is found in the closing words. Reminding
   the Father of the limitless range of his power, he petitions him to
   change his counsel as to the crucifixion of the Son, if his gracious
   purposes can be in any other way carried out. Jesus uses the words
   "cup" and "hour" interchangeably. They are both words of broad compass,
   intended to include all that he would undergo from that time until his
   resurrection. They embrace all his mental, moral, physical, and
   spiritual suffering which we can discover, together with an infinite
   volume of a propitiatory and vicarious nature which lies beyond the
   reach of our understanding. The submission of Jesus was no new fruitage
   of his character; the prayer of the garden had been the inner purpose
   of his entire life--John v. 30 and vi. 38.] 43 And there appeared unto
   him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 44 And being in an agony
   he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops
   of blood falling down upon the ground. [Commentators give instances of
   bloody sweat under abnormal pathological conditions.] 45 And when he
   rose up from his prayer, he came { ^a cometh} unto the disciples, and
   findeth { ^c found} them sleeping for sorrow, 46 and said unto them,
   Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. [The
   admonition which had at first been addressed to all the eleven is now
   spoken to the chosen three] ^a and saith unto Peter, ^b Simon, sleepest
   thou? couldest thou not watch one hour? ^a What, could ye not watch
   with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation:
   the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. [Peter, having
   boasted of his loyalty, has his weakness pointed out and is further
   warned to be on his guard, since the weakness of his nature will not
   stand the coming strain. The slumber of the disciples was not through
   indifference; but was caused by the prostration of grief. When we
   remember the excitement which they had endured that night, the tender
   words spoken by Jesus, the sadness of which was intensified by the
   atmosphere of mystery which pervaded them, the beautiful and touching
   prayer, and lastly this agony in the garden, it is not to be wondered
   at that the apostles, spurred by no sense of danger, should succumb to
   the long-borne tension and fall asleep. Had they comprehended how much
   the Lord needed their wakeful sympathy as he came again and again
   seeking for it, they would probably have kept awake.] ^b 39 And again
   ^a a second time he went away, and prayed, ^b saying the same words. ^a
   saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy
   will be done. [Jesus here speaks of draining the cup. The "cup" was a
   common Hebrew figure used to denote one's divinely appointed lot or
   fortune--Ps. xxiii. 5; lxxv. 8; Isa. li. 17; Ezek. xxiii. 31-33.] 43
   And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were ^b very
   heavy; and they knew not what to answer him. [They were ashamed of the
   stupor which had come upon them and knew not what apology to make for
   it.] ^a 44 And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third
   time, saying again the same words. ^b 41 And ^a 45 Then cometh he to
   the disciples, ^b the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
   and that your rest: it is enough; ^a behold, the hour is at hand, { ^b
   the hour is come;} ^a and ^b behold, the Son of man is betrayed into
   the hands of sinners. 42 Arise, let us be going: behold, he that
   betrayeth me is at hand. [Our Lord's words are paradoxical. In our
   judgment the saying is best understood by regarding the first part of
   it as spoken from the Lord's viewpoint, while the latter part is spoken
   from the disciple's viewpoint. It is as if he said, "So far as I am
   concerned, you may sleep on and take your rest, for the time to be of
   comfort or assistance to me has wholly passed. But so far as you
   yourselves are concerned, you must arise and be going, because Judas
   with his band of temple police is upon us."]

CXXIV.

Jesus Betrayed, Arrested, and Forsaken.

(Gethsemane. Friday, Several Hours Before Dawn.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 47-56; ^B Mark XIV. 43-52; ^C Luke XXII. 47-53; ^D John XVIII.
2-11.

   ^d 2 Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
   ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. [See p. 583.] 3 Judas
   then, having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief
   priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and
   weapons. ^b 43 And straightway, while he yet spake, ^a lo, Judas, one
   of the twelve, came, { ^b cometh,} ^a and with him a multitude with
   swords and staves, from the chief priests ^b and the scribes and the
   elders. ^a of the people. ^c behold, a multitude, and he that was
   called Judas, went before them [The presence of Judas is mentioned by
   each Evangelist. His treachery made a deep impression upon them. The
   arresting party which accompanied Judas consisted of the band of
   officers and men from the temple guard or Levitical police, Pharisees,
   scribes, servants, chief priests, captains of the temple and elders.
   They were well supplied with lights, for while the passover is always
   held when the moon is full, the moon at this time of night would be
   near setting, and the valley of the Kidron, in which Gethsemane lay,
   would be darkened by the shadow of the adjoining mountain] ; ^d 4 Jesus
   therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went
   forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? 5 They answered him, Jesus of
   Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed
   him, was standing with them. 6 When therefore he said unto them, I am
   he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. 7 Again therefore he
   asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 8 Jesus
   answered, I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these
   go their way: 9 that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of
   those whom thou hast given me I lost not one. [John mentions the
   foreknowledge of Jesus to remind us that he could have avoided the
   arrest had he chosen to do so. Even the foreknowledge of Elisha was
   difficult to deal with (II. Kings vi. 8-12). Jesus asked, "Whom seek
   ye?" (1) To openly and manfully declare his identity; (2) to make the
   Jewish rulers fully conscious that they were arresting him, an innocent
   man; (3) to confine the arrest to himself and thus deliver his
   disciples. The older commentators regard the falling to the ground as a
   miracle, but modern scholars look upon it as a result of sudden fear.
   Jesus merely manifested his dignity and majesty, and the prostration
   followed as a natural result.] ^a 48 Now he that betrayed him gave { ^b
   had given} them a token, ^a a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss,
   that is he: take him. ^b and lead him away safely. ^c and he drew near
   unto Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest
   thou the Son of man with a kiss? ^b 45 And when he was come, ^a
   straightway he came to Jesus, and said { ^b saith,} ^a Hail, Rabbi; and
   kissed him. 50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do that for which thou
   art come. [Some place this event before the preceding paragraph. It
   comports better with the fitness of things to place it here. Jesus made
   Judas feel his utter nothingness, and his worthlessness even as a
   betrayer. Before Judas can in any way identify Jesus, the Lord had
   twice declared himself to be the party whom they sought. When he
   approaches to carry out his contract, the Lord's question exposes him
   before all as a betrayer, and not a disciple as he wished to appear to
   be (for kissing was the common mode of salutation between men,
   especially between teacher and pupils), and when Judas brazenly
   persists in completing the sign, Jesus bids him do it, not as a friend,
   but as a traitor. Little did the betrayer think that the kiss of Judas
   would become a proverb in every nation.] Then they came and laid hands
   on Jesus, and took him. [The sight of Judas touching him no doubt
   reassured them, and they laid hands on Jesus.] ^c 49 And when they that
   were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite
   with the sword? ^b 47 But { ^a 51 And} behold, ^d 10 Simon Peter ^b a
   certain one of them that stood by ^a that were with Jesus ^d therefore
   having a sword ^a stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote
   { ^d struck} ^a the servant of the high priest, and struck { ^d cut}
   off his right ear. [We have seen that the apostles were but scantily
   armed, there being only two swords in their possession. See p. 657.
   Peter evidently carried one of these, and stood ready to make good his
   boast that he would suffer, and, if need be, die in his Lord's service.
   evidently struck a downward blow at Malchus' head, and Malchus would
   have been killed had he not dodged.] Now the servant's name was
   Malchus. [John knew the household of the high priest (John xviii. 16).
   He knew Malchus by name, and he also knew his kindred--John xviii. 26.]
   ^c 51 But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he
   touched his ear, and healed him. [Some think that Jesus spoke these
   words, "Suffer ye thus far," to those who held him, asking them to
   loose him sufficiently to enable him to touch the ear of Malchus. But
   the revision committee by inserting "them" make Jesus address his
   disciples, commanding them not to interfere with those who were
   arresting him, making it a general statement of the idea which the Lord
   addressed specifically to Peter in the next sentence.] ^a 52 Then ^d 11
   Jesus therefore said { ^a saith} ^d unto Peter, ^a Put up again thy {
   ^d the} sword into the sheath: ^a its place: for all they that take the
   sword shall perish with the sword. ^d the cup which the Father hath
   given me, shall I not drink it? [By the healing of Malchus' ear and the
   words spoken to Peter, Jesus shows that the sword is not to be used
   either to defend the truth or to advance his kingdom. Had he not thus
   spoken and acted, Pilate might have doubted his words when he testified
   that his kingdom was not of this world ( John xviii. 36). While we know
   better than to rely upon the aid of the sword for the advance of truth,
   we are often tempted to put undue trust in other "carnal weapons" which
   are equally futile. Wealth and eloquence and elaborate church buildings
   have but little saving grace in them. It is the truth which wins. By
   using the word "cup" John gives us an echo of the agony in Gethsemane,
   which suggests that he expects his readers to be conversant with the
   other Gospels. The other Evangelists, having shown that Jesus was fully
   resolved to drink the cup, do not regard it as necessary to repeat
   these words.] ^a 53 Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father,
   and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 54
   How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?
   [Jesus still addresses Peter. Had it accorded with the divine purpose
   that Jesus should resist this arrest, angels and not men would have
   been his proper and infinitely more effective rescuers. But, on the
   contrary, it was God's purpose that he should be arrested, as the
   Scripture had foretold.] 55 In that hour ^b Jesus answered and said
   unto them ^a the multitudes, ^c the chief priests, and captains of the
   temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as
   against a robber, with swords and staves? ^a to seize me? ^c 53 When ^a
   I sat { ^b was} daily with you in the temple teaching, ^c ye stretched
   not forth your hands against me: ^b and ye took me not: ^c but this is
   your hour, and the power of darkness. ^a 56 But all this is come to
   pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. [The
   party which came to arrest Jesus was large. The word "band" used by
   John to describe part of it is speira, which is the Greek name for the
   cohort, a division of the Roman army which in the time of Augustus
   contained 555 men. Ten cohorts, or a legion, were usually quartered in
   the castle Antonia, at the northwest corner of the temple enclosure.
   That the whole cohort was present is not likely (Matt. xxvii. 27), but
   there was a large enough body to represent it. The Evangelists
   therefore properly style it a great multitude. Moreover, it was a
   motley crowd. Its strength and diversity suggest the fear that Jesus
   might miraculously defend himself. Each part of the crowd found courage
   in the strength possessed by the other part, the priests relying upon
   the solidity of the soldiers, the soldiers superstitiously trusting to
   some spiritual power residing in the priests, etc. Now, because of
   these fears, the preparation was as great as if some band of robbers
   was to be taken. The questions of Jesus, therefore, show two facts: 1.
   By their extensive preparation the rulers bore an unintentional
   testimony to his divine power. 2. By their failure to arrest him openly
   in the temple, they bore witness to his innocence. With his divinity
   and his innocence, therefore, Jesus challenges them, referring to their
   own conduct for testimony thereto. In conclusion, he cites them to the
   Scriptures which they were fulfilling. Our Lord's dual reference to the
   Old Testament at this sacred time should cause us to handle them with
   awe and reverence.] ^b 50 And ^a Then all of the disciples left him,
   and fled. ^b 51 And a certain young man followed with him, having a
   linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on
   him; 52 but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked. [All the
   predictions of Jesus had failed to prepare the apostles for the terrors
   of his arrest. Despite all his warnings, each apostle sought his own
   safety. The young man who fled naked is usually presumed to be Mark
   himself, and it is thought that he thus speaks impersonally after the
   manner of Matthew and John. The manner of his description shows that he
   was not an apostle. As Mark's mother resided in Jerusalem ( Acts xii.
   12, 25), Canon Cook advances the theory that the Lord's Supper was
   eaten in the upper room of her house, and that when the disciples
   retired with Jesus from thence to Gethsemane, Mark slipped from his
   bed, threw his sindon about him, and followed after them. The sindon,
   or linen vestment, was very costly, not being worn even by the middle
   classes: no apostle would be thus attired.]

First Stage of Jewish Trial. Examination by Annas.

(Friday Before Dawn.)

^D John XVIII. 12-14, 19-23.

   ^d 12 So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews,
   seized Jesus and bound him, 13 and led him to Annas first; for he was
   father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. [For
   confusion in the priesthood, etc., see pp. 64 and 528.] 14 Now Caiaphas
   was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one
   man should die for the people. [See p. 528. John restates this fact to
   remind the reader that Jesus was about to be tried by those who had
   prejudged him and decided upon his death.] 19 The high priest therefore
   asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching. [We should note that
   John calls Annas high priest. The high priesthood was a life office.
   According to Moses, Annas was high priest, but the Romans had given the
   office to Caiaphas, so that Annas was high priest de jure, but Caiaphas
   was so de facto. As high priest, therefore, and as head of the
   Sadducean party, the people looked to Annas before Caiaphas, taking
   Jesus to him first. The influence of Annas is shown by the fact that he
   made five of his son and sons-in-law high priests. Annas is said to
   have been about sixty years old at this time. He questioned Jesus for
   the purpose of obtaining, if possible, some material out of which to
   frame an accusation.] 20 Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to
   the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all
   the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing. 21 Why askest
   thou me? Ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold,
   these know the things which I said. [Jesus indeed spoke some things
   privately (Matt. xiii. 10, 11), but he did not do so for the purposes
   of concealment (Matt. x. 27). Jesus was the light of the world;
   addressing his teachings to all flesh, he chose the most public places
   to utter them--places, however, dedicated to the worship of the true
   God. He who had said that heaven and earth would pass away, but that
   his word would not pass away, did not suffer his teaching to be held in
   contempt; he did not permit it to be made matter for cross examination.
   On the contrary, it was to be taken cognizance of among the things
   universally known and understood. The very officers who had arrested
   him could tell about it--John vii. 45, 46.] 22 And when he had said
   this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand,
   saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 23 Jesus answered him, If I
   have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest
   thou me? [Jesus was then under arrest, and as the trial had not yet
   opened there was ample time to add new matter to the charges against
   him. If, in addressing the high priest, he had just spoken words worthy
   of punishment, the officer who struck him should, instead, have
   preferred charges against him and had him punished in a legal manner.
   If the officer could not do this (and the point is that he could not),
   he was doubly wrong in striking him. Thus the Lord calmly rebuked the
   wrong-doer. Compare his conduct with that of Paul under somewhat
   similar circumstances (Acts xxiii. 1-3). Jesus exemplified his teaching
   at Matt. v. 39. "Christ," says Luther, "forbids self-defense with the
   hand, not with the tongue."]

CXXVI.

Second Stage of Jewish Trial. Jesus Condemned by Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.

(Palace of Caiaphas. Friday.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 57, 59-68; ^B Mark XIV. 53, 55-65; ^C Luke XXII. 54, 63-65; ^D
John XVIII. 24.

   ^d 24 Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
   [Foiled in his attempted examination of Jesus, Annas sends him to
   trial.] ^b and there come together with him all the chief priests and
   the elders and the scribes. ^a 57 And they that had taken Jesus led him
   away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, ^c and brought him into
   the high priest's house. ^a where the scribes and the elders were
   gathered together. [It is very likely that Annas had apartments in the
   same palace with Caiaphas, and that from these apartments Jesus was led
   into some hall large enough to hold the Sanhedrin, which was now
   convened. But this was not its formal session as a court; it was more
   in the nature of a caucus, or committee of the whole.] ^b 55 Now the
   chief priests and the whole council sought ^a false witness against
   Jesus, ^b to { ^a that they might} put him to death; 60 and they found
   it not, though many false witnesses came. ^b 56 For many bare false
   witness against him, and their witness agreed not together. ^a But
   afterward came ^b 57 And there stood up certain, ^a two, ^b and bare
   false witness against him, ^a 61 and said, { ^b saying,} ^a This man
   said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three
   days. ^b 58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made
   with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
   59 And not even so did their witness agree together. [What Jesus had
   really said will be found at John ii. 19-22. Though his words were
   misunderstood at that time, being applied, not to his body, but to
   Herod's temple, yet it is not unlikely that the Jewish rulers, hearing
   our Lord's prediction that he would rise from the dead after three days
   (Matt. xxvii. 62, 63), came to understand the import of his words. If
   so, the record itself shows the willingness of the Sanhedrin to receive
   false witnesses against Christ, for its judges received testimony which
   they knew to be utterly immaterial if rightly construed. The accounts
   of the two Evangelists, moreover, show how the witnesses failed to
   agree. A man could only be condemned on the testimony of two witnesses
   as to some fact or facts constituting a ground for condemnation--Deut.
   xvii. 6; xix. 15 .] ^a 62 And the high priest stood up, ^b in the
   midst, and asked Jesus, ^a and said unto him, { ^b saying,} Answerest
   thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? ^a 63 But
   Jesus held his peace. ^b and answered nothing. [While the testimony
   then before the court might be used to show that Jesus was recklessly
   boastful, it was insufficient to justify a sentence of blasphemy. A
   threat to destroy the temple might be thus construed (Jer. xxvi. 9-11;
   Acts vi. 13, 14); but a promise to rebuild the temple, if destroyed,
   was altogether different. The high priest, knowing this, sought to
   extort from Jesus some additional evidence. With great cunning and
   effrontery he assumes that the testimony is all that could be possibly
   desired, and demands of Jesus what he has to say in answer to it. But
   our Lord did not suffer himself to seem so easily deceived. He gave no
   explanation, since the future would explain his meaning, and speak the
   real truth to all who had ears to hear it.] ^a And ^b Again the high
   priest asked him, and saith { ^a said} unto him, ^b Art thou the
   Christ, the Son of the Blessed? ^a I adjure thee by the living God,
   that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God. [Seeing
   that Jesus was not to be lured into an answer, and well knowing his
   perfect frankness, Caiaphas resolved, in his desperation, to question
   Jesus plainly and bluntly. His question is twofold: 1. Art thou Christ?
   2. Art thou the Son of God? The latter of these would constitute
   blasphemy, and the former, by showing a boastful spirit, would tend to
   confirm the charge. Perhaps, too, Caiaphas anticipated the future, and
   foresaw how useful this claim to be the Messiah would prove when a
   hearing was had before Pilate (Luke xxiii. 2). Originally the Messiah
   was recognized as the Son of God (Ps. ii. 7), but if the Jews had ever
   generally entertained such an idea, they had lost it before Jesus' day,
   The Messiah might of course be called the Son of God in that secondary
   sense in which Adam was thus called (John i. 49; Luke iii. 38). But
   Jesus had used the term in an entirely different sense, and his usage
   had been extremely offensive to the Jews (John v. 17, 18; x. 30-39;
   Matt. xxii. 41-46). Caiaphas evidently wished Jesus to answer this
   question in that new sense which the Lord had given to the words.
   Caiaphas had no legal right to ask either of these questions. No man
   can be compelled to testify against himself, but he knew the claims of
   Jesus, and realized that if Jesus repudiated them he would be shamed
   forever, and if he asserted them he could be charged with blasphemy.
   Taking advantage, therefore, of the situation, Caiaphas put the
   question with the usual formula of an oath, thus adding moral power to
   it, for, under ordinary circumstances, one was held guilty if he
   refused to answer when thus adjured ( Lev. v. 1). When their own
   witnesses failed, these rulers called the "faithful witness"--I. Tim.
   vi. 13; Rev. i. 5.] ^b 62 And Jesus said, { ^a saith} unto him, Thou
   hast said: ^b I am: and ^a nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye
   shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming
   on { ^b with} the clouds of heaven. [Jesus freely confessed the truth
   which his church is called upon to confess. "Right hand of Power" was
   commonly understood to mean the right hand of God. By the words
   "nevertheless" and "henceforth" Jesus brings the present state of
   humiliation into contrast with his future state of glory. Hard as it
   might be for them to believe it, the day would come when he should sit
   in judgment and they should stand on trial before him.] 63 And ^a 65
   Then the high priest rent his garments, { ^b clothes,} and saith, { ^a
   saying,} He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of
   witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: 66 what think ye?
   [Though Jesus had given the very answer which the high priest was
   longing to hear, yet he hypocritically pretends to be shocked at it,
   and rends his clothes and feigns horror. Evidently he feared the effect
   of the clear, calm answer of Jesus and sought to counteract its
   influence on his colleagues.] They answered and said, He is worthy of
   death. ^b And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. [This was
   not the final, formal sentence, but the mere determination of the
   council at the preliminary hearing.] ^c 63 And the men that held Jesus
   mocked him, and beat him. ^b 65 And some began to spit on him, and to
   cover his face, ^a 67 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: ^c
   64 And they blindfolded him, ^a and some smote him with the palms of
   their hands, 68 saying, { ^b and [began] to say unto him,} ^a Prophesy
   unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee? ^b and the officers
   received him with blows of their hands. ^c 65 And many other things
   spake they against him, reviling him. [To spit in the face has been an
   insult in all ages and in all lands. See Num. xii. 14; Deut. xxv. 9;
   Job xxx. 10. Jesus, having stood out for examination, is now given back
   to the officers to be led away into the council chamber. These officers
   received Jesus with many indignities. They seek to make his high claims
   contemptible, and to make it appear that instead of being divine he is
   hardly worthy to be regarded as human.]

Peter Thrice Denies the Lord.

(Court of the High Priest's Residence. Friday Before and About Dawn.)

^A Matt. XXVI. 58, 69-75; ^B Mark XIV. 54, 66-72; ^C Luke XXII. 54-62;

^D John XVIII. 15-18, 25-27.

   ^a 58 But { ^d 15 And} Simon Peter followed Jesus [leaving Jesus in the
   palace of the high priest, we now turn back to the garden of Gethsemane
   at the time when Jesus left it under arrest, that we may follow the
   course of Simon Peter in his threefold denial of the Master], and so
   did another disciple. [This other disciple was evidently the apostle
   John, who thus speaks of himself impersonally.] Now that disciple was
   known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of
   the high priest [John's acquaintanceship appears to have been with the
   household as well as with the high priest personally, for we find that
   it is used as a permit at the doorway. It is likely that the high
   priest knew John rather in a business way--Acts iv. 13]; ^b 54 And
   Peter had followed him afar off, ^a unto the court of the high priest,
   ^d 16 but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other
   disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto
   her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. ^b even within, into the
   court of the high priest [For courts of houses see p. 182. It is still
   customary to have female porters at the houses of the great and rich.
   See Acts xii. 13. John would have shown a truer kindness to Peter had
   he let him stay out]; ^d 17 The maid therefore that kept the door saith
   unto Peter, Art thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am
   not. ^a and [Peter] entered in [The doorkeeper evidently recognized
   John as a disciple, and was therefore suspicious of Peter. The cowardly
   "I am not" of Peter is a sad contrast to the strong "I am he" of
   Jesus], ^d 18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there,
   having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming
   themselves: and Peter also was with them [they were gathered around a
   little smokeless charcoal fire], ^c 55 And when they had kindled a fire
   in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter ^a sat with
   the officers, ^c in the midst of them. ^a to see the end. [Though his
   faith in Christ was shaken, he still loved him enough to see what would
   become of him.] ^b and he was sitting with the officers, and warming
   himself in the light of the fire. ^c 56 And ^a 69 Now ^b as ^d Simon
   Peter ^a was sitting { ^d standing} ^a without ^b beneath in the court,
   there cometh { ^a came} unto him, ^c a certain ^b one of the maids of
   the high priest; 67 and seeing Peter ^c as he sat in the light of the
   fire, ^b warming himself, she looked { ^c and looking} stedfastly upon
   him, said, { ^b saith, ^a saying,} Thou also wast with Jesus the
   Galilaean. ^b the Nazarene, even Jesus. ^c This man also was with him.
   ^a 70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
   sayest. ^b I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: ^c Woman, I
   know him not. ^d They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his
   disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. ^b and he went out into the
   porch; and the cock crew. ^a 71 And when he was gone out into the
   porch, ^c after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art
   one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. ^b 69 And ^a another ^b the
   maid saw him, and began again to say { ^a saith} unto them that were
   there, ^b that stood by, This is one of them. ^a This man also was with
   Jesus of Nazareth. ^b 70 But { ^a 72 And} again he denied ^b it. ^a
   with an oath, I know not the man. [Peter's second denial was of a
   quadruple nature. He denied to four different parties, but in such
   quick succession that the event is regarded as one.] 73 And after a
   little ^c after the space of about one hour another confidently
   affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a
   Galilaean. 60 But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. ^b
   Again they that stood by ^a came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou
   also art one of them; ^b for thou art a Galilaean. ^a for thy speech
   maketh thee known. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
   ^d 26 One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him
   whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with
   him? ^b 70 But ^d 27 Peter therefore denied again: ^a 74 Then began he
   to curse and to swear, I know not the { ^b this} ^a man. ^b of whom ye
   speak. 72 And straightway ^c immediately, while he yet spake, ^b the
   second time the cock crew. [Exasperated by the repeated accusations,
   Peter loses his temper and begins to emphasize his denial by profanity.
   Desire to make good his denial is now supreme in his thoughts and the
   Lord whom he denies is all but forgotten.] ^c 61 And the Lord turned,
   and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered ^b And Peter called to mind
   the word, ^c of the Lord, ^a which Jesus had said, ^b how that he said
   unto him, ^a Before the cock crow, ^b twice, ^c this thou shalt deny me
   thrice. 62 And he went out, ^b And when he thought thereon, he wept. ^c
   bitterly. [When Peter remembered the loving tenderness of Jesus
   manifested when he foretold Peter's crime it formed a background
   against which the sin appeared in all its hideous enormity.]

CXXVIII.

Third Stage of Jewish Trial. Jesus Formally Condemned by the Sanhedrin and Led
to Pilate.

(Jerusalem. Friday After Dawn.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 1, 2; ^B Mark XV. 1; ^C Luke XXII. 66-23:1; ^D John XVIII. 28.

   ^a 1 Now when morning was come, ^c 66 And as soon as it was day, ^b
   straightway ^c the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered
   together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into
   their council, ^a all the chief priests and { ^b with} the elders ^a of
   the people ^b and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation,
   and ^a took counsel against Jesus to put him to death [Since blasphemy
   was by no means a criminal offense among the Romans, the Sanhedrin
   consulted together and sought for some charge of which the Romans would
   take notice. As we follow their course it will become evident to us
   that they found no new ground of accusation against Jesus, and, failing
   to do so, they decided to make use of our Lord's claim to be the Christ
   by so perverting it as to make him seem to assert an intention to rebel
   against the authority of Rome]: ^c saying, 67 If thou art the Christ,
   tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe [as
   experience had already proven--John viii. 59; x. 31]: 68 and if I ask
   you, ye will not answer. [Thus Jesus protests against the violence and
   injustice of his trial. His judges were asking him whether he was the
   Christ without any intention of investigating the truth of his claim,
   but merely for the purpose of condemning him by unwarrantedly assuming
   that he was not the Christ. They therefore asked in an unlawful spirit
   as well as in an unlawful manner. Jesus had a good right to ask them
   questions tending to confirm his Christhood by the Scripture, but had
   he done so they would not have answered--Matt. xxii. 41-45. Jesus
   appeals to them to try the question as to who he was, but they insist
   on confining the inquiry as to who he claimed to be, assuming that the
   claim was false.] 69 But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated
   at the right hand of the power of God. [See p. 698.] 70 And they all
   said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that
   I am. [The Hebrew mode of expression, equivalent to "Ye say it, because
   I am."] 71 And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we
   ourselves have heard from his own mouth. [Thus they unconsciously admit
   their lack of evidence against Jesus.] 1 And the whole company of them
   rose up, ^a 2 and they bound ^b Jesus, and carried { ^a led} him away,
   ^d 28 They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: ^c
   and brought him before Pilate. ^b and delivered him up to Pilate. ^a
   the governor. ^d and it was early; [The Sanhedrin could try and could
   condemn, but could not put to death without the concurring sentence of
   the Roman governor. To obtain this sentence, they now lead Jesus before
   Pilate in the early dawn, having made good use of their time.]
     __________________________________________________________________

CXXIX.

First Stage of the Roman Trial. Jesus Before Pilate for the First Time.

(Jerusalem. Early Friday Morning.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 11-14; ^B Mark XV. 2-5; ^C Luke XXIII. 2-5; ^D John XVIII.
28-38.

   ^d and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might
   not be defiled, but might eat the passover. [See p. 641.] 29 Pilate
   therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye
   against this man? 30 They answered and said unto him, If this man were
   not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee. [The
   Jewish rulers first attempt to induce Pilate to accept their verdict
   and condemn Jesus upon it, and execute him without a trial. If they had
   succeeded in this, Jesus would have been put to death as a blasphemer.
   But as Pilate had insisted upon trying Jesus, and as blasphemy was not
   a capital offense under the Roman law, Jesus was condemned and executed
   as the King of the Jews.] 31 Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him
   yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto
   him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 32 that the word
   of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner
   of death he should die. [As the Jews insisted on their own verdict,
   Pilate bade them pronounce their own sentence, declining to mix
   jurisdictions by pronouncing a Roman sentence on a Sanhedrin verdict.
   But the Jews responded that it is not in their power to pronounce the
   sentence for which their verdict called, since they could not put to
   death. Jesus could only be sentenced to death by the Roman court, and
   crucifixion was the mode by which its death sentence was executed.
   Jesus had predicted all this in the simple statement that he should die
   by crucifixion (John xii. 33, 34), but he also gave the details of his
   trial--Matt. xx. 18, 19; Mark x. 33, 34.] ^c 2 And they began to accuse
   him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to
   give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.
   [The Jews now profess to change their verdict into a charge, they
   themselves becoming witnesses as to the truth of the matter charged.
   They say "We found," thereby asserting that the things which they
   stated to Pilate were the things for which they had condemned Jesus.
   Their assertion was utterly false, for the three things which they now
   mentioned had formed no part whatever of the evidence against Jesus in
   their trial of him. The first charge, that Jesus was a perverter or
   seducer of the people, was extremely vague. The second, that he taught
   to withhold tribute from Cæsar, was a deliberate falsehood. See p. 599.
   The third, that he claimed to be king, was true, but this third charge,
   coupled with the other two, was intended to convey a sense which was
   maliciously false. Jesus was a spiritual King, and claimed to be such,
   and as such was no offender against the Roman government. But the
   rulers intended that Pilate should regard him as claiming to be a
   political king, which he had constantly refused to do--John vi. 15.] ^d
   33 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called
   Jesus, ^a 11 Now Jesus stood before the governor [Jesus is called from
   the guards who have him in custody and stands alone before Pilate that
   the governor may investigate his case privately]: ^b 2 And Pilate ^a
   the governor asked him, ^d and said unto him, { ^a saying,} Art thou
   the King of the Jews? [The Gospels are unanimous in giving this
   question as the first words addressed by Pilate to Jesus. The question
   expresses surprise. There was nothing in the manner or attire of Jesus
   to suggest a royal claimant. The question was designed to draw Jesus
   out should he chance to be a fanatical or an unbalanced enthusiast.]
   And Jesus ^b answering saith { ^c answered him and said,} ^b unto him,
   Thou sayest. ^d Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee
   concerning me? [Using the Hebrew form of affirmative reply (see p.
   698), Jesus admits that he is a king, but asks a question which forms
   the strongest negation that he is a king in the sense contained in the
   Jewish accusation. Had he been a king in that sense, Pilate would have
   been the one most likely to know it. The question also, by an indirect
   query as to the accuser, reveals to Pilate's mind that no Roman had
   accused him. He was accused of the Jews, and when he had that restless,
   rebellious people ever found fault with a man who sought to free them
   from the galling Roman yoke?] 35 Pilate answered,; Am I a Jew? [The
   strong, practical mind of the Roman at once caught the drift of
   Christ's question, and perceived that the title "King of the Jews" had
   in it a double meaning, so that it might be construed in some
   unpolitical sense. What this sense was he could not tell, for he was
   not a Jew. The mysteries of that nation were of no interest to him save
   where his office compelled him to understand them.] Thine own nation
   and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
   [Pilate concedes that the accusation against Jesus comes from an
   unexpected and suspicious source, and he asks Jesus to tell him plainly
   by what means he had incurred the enmity of the leaders of his people.]
   36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were
   of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
   delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. [Jesus
   answers Pilate's question indirectly. He had done something to incur
   the enmity of the rulers, and that was to have authority with and
   exercise influence over the people (John xii. 19). They objected to his
   kingly claims (Matt. xxi. 15, 16; Luke xix. 38, 39), but Jesus shows
   Pilate that these kingly claims, however distasteful to the Jews, were
   no offense to or menace against the authority of Rome. Further than
   this, Jesus did not define his kingdom, for Pilate had no concern in it
   beyond this. It was sufficient to inform him that it made no use of
   physical power even for purposes of defense. Such a kingdom could cause
   no trouble to Rome, and the bare fact stated by Jesus proved that it
   was indeed such a kingdom.] 37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou
   a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. [See p.
   698.] To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the
   world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of
   the truth heareth my voice. [Jesus here enlightens Pilate as to the
   nature of his kingdom. He, the King, was the incarnation of truth, and
   all those who derive the inspiration of their life from truth were his
   subjects. For the purpose of thus bearing witness to and revealing
   truth Jesus had been born, thus entering a new state of being, and he
   had come into the world in this changed condition, thus entering a new
   sphere of action. The words clearly imply the pre-existence of Christ
   and no doubt aroused that state of uneasiness or fear which was
   increased by the words of the Jewish rulers--John xix. 7, 8 .] 38
   Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? [This question has been regarded
   as an earnest inquiry (Chrysostom), the inquiry of one who despaired
   (Olshausen), a scoffing question (Alford), etc. But it is evident that
   Pilate asked it intending to investigate the case of Jesus further,
   but, suddenly concluding that he already knew enough to answer his
   purpose as a judge, he stifles his curiosity as a human being and
   proceeds with the trial of Jesus, leaving the question unanswered.] And
   when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto
   them, ^c unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in
   this man. ^d no crime in him. [The pronoun "I" is emphatic; as if
   Pilate said, "You, prejudiced fanatics, demand his death, but I, the
   calm judge, pronounce him innocent."] ^b 3 And the chief priests
   accused him of many things. ^a 12 And when he was accused by the chief
   priests and elders, he answered nothing. [When Pilate left the
   Prætorium to speak with the Jewish rulers, it is evident that Jesus was
   led out with him, and so stood there in the presence of his accusers.]
   ^b 4 And ^a 13 Then ^b Pilate again asked him, { ^a saith unto him,} ^b
   saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee
   of. ^a Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? ^b 5
   But Jesus no more answered anything; ^a 14 And he gave him no answer,
   not even to one word: ^b insomuch that Pilate ^a the governor ^b
   marvelled. ^a greatly. [Pilate was irritated that Jesus did not speak
   in his own defense. He had already seen enough of our Lord's wisdom to
   assure him that it would be an easy matter for him to expose the
   malicious emptiness of these charges--charges which Pilate himself knew
   to be false, but about which he had to keep silent, for, being judge,
   he could not become our Lord's advocate. Our Lord's silence was a
   matter of prophecy (Isa. liii. 7). Jesus kept still because to have
   successfully defended himself would have been to frustrate the purpose
   for which he came into the world--John xii. 23-28.] ^c 5 But they were
   the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout
   all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. [The Jews
   cling to their general accusation of sedition, and seek to make the
   largeness of the territory where Jesus operated overshadow and conceal
   the smallness of their testimony as to what his operations were.]

Second Stage of the Roman Trial. Jesus Before Herod Antipas.

(Jerusalem. Early Friday Morning.)

^C Luke XXIII. 6-12.

   ^c 6 But when Pilate heard it [when he heard that Jesus had begun his
   operations in Galilee], he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 7
   And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction [Herod was
   tetrarch of Galilee--Luke iii. 1], he sent him unto Herod, who himself
   also ["also" includes both Pilate and Herod, neither of whom lived at
   Jerusalem] was at Jerusalem in these days. ["These days" refers to the
   passover season. Pilate had come up from his residence at Cæsarea to
   keep order during the passover, and Herod had come from Tiberias to
   keep in favor with the Jews by showing his respect to their festival.
   Hearing that Jesus was a citizen of Herod's province, Pilate saw an
   opportunity to do two things: first, by sending Jesus to Herod he would
   either shift or divide the grave responsibility in which he was placed;
   second, he would show a courtesy to Herod which might help to remove
   Herod's enmity toward him, a courtesy which perhaps might be the
   reverse of the discourtesy which likely caused the enmity--Luke xiii.
   1.] 8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a
   long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and
   he hoped to see some miracle done by him. [As to Herod's previous
   knowledge of Christ, see Luke ix. 7-9.] 9 And he questioned him in many
   words; but he answered him nothing. 10 And the chief priests and the
   scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. [The rulers felt that their
   case had well-nigh failed before Pilate, so they became the more urgent
   in the presence of Herod, since Herod had less reason to fear them than
   Pilate. In the midst of this, Jesus stood silent, answering neither
   question nor accusation. Herod, as sated ruler, adulterer, and
   murderer, wished Jesus to turn juggler for his amusement; but the Son
   of God had nothing but silence for such a creature. The only
   contemptuous word which Jesus is recorded to have spoken had reference
   to this ruler--Luke xiii. 31, 32.] 11 And Herod with his soldiers set
   him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel
   sent him back to Pilate. [Herod took vengeance upon the silence of
   Christ by treating him with abusive contempt. But finding nothing in
   Jesus worthy of condemnation, he returned him to Pilate.] 12 And Herod
   and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before
   they were at enmity between themselves. [Thus Pilate gained but half
   his desire: Herod was now his friend, but the case of Jesus was still
   on his hands.]

CXXXI.

Third Stage of the Roman Trial. Pilate Reluctantly Sentences Him to Crucifixion.

(Friday. Toward Sunrise.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 15-30; ^B Mark XV. 6-19; ^C Luke XXIII. 13-25; ^D John XVIII.
39-XIX 16.

   ^a 15 Now at the feast [the passover and unleavened bread] the governor
   was wont { ^b used to} release unto them ^a the multitude one prisoner,
   whom they would. { ^b whom they asked of him.} [No one knows when or by
   whom this custom was introduced, but similar customs were not unknown
   elsewhere, both the Greeks and Romans being wont to bestow special
   honor upon certain occasions by releasing prisoners.] ^a 16 And they
   had then ^b 7 And there was ^a a notable prisoner, ^b one called
   Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in
   the insurrection had committed murder. [Josephus tells us that there
   had been an insurrection against Pilate's government about that time
   caused by his taking money from the temple treasury for the
   construction of an aqueduct. This may have been the affair here
   referred to, for in it many lost their lives.] 8 And the multitude went
   up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them. [It was
   still early in the morning, and the vast majority of the city of
   Jerusalem did not know what was transpiring at Pilate's palace. But
   they came thither in throngs, demanding their annual gift of a
   prisoner. Pilate welcomed the demand as a possible escape from his
   difficulties.] ^c 13 And Pilate called together the chief priests and
   the rulers and the people [He did not wish to seem to take advantage of
   our Lord's accusers by releasing him during their absence. Possibly he
   knew of the triumphal entry the Sunday previous, and thought that the
   popularity of Jesus would be such that his release would be
   overwhelmingly demanded, and so called the rulers that they might see
   that he had released Jesus in answer to popular clamor. If he had such
   expectations, they were misplaced], ^b 9 And ^a 17 When therefore they
   were gathered together, ^b Pilate answered them, saying, { ^c 14 and
   said} unto them, ^b Will ye that I release unto you the King of the
   Jews? ^c Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the
   people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in
   this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 15 no, nor yet
   Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of
   death hath been done by him. ^d 39 But ye have a custom, that I should
   release unto you one at the passover: ^c 16 I will therefore chastise
   him, and release him. ^d Will ye therefore that I release unto you the
   King of the Jews? ^a Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or
   Jesus who is called Christ? 18 For he knew { ^b perceived} ^a that for
   envy they ^b the chief priests had delivered him up. [Though Jesus had
   been declared innocent on the joint finding of himself and Herod,
   Pilate did not have the courage to deliberately release him. He sought
   to please the rulers by scourging him, and the multitude by delivering
   him to them as a popular favorite, and himself by an adroit escape from
   an unpleasant situation. But he pleased nobody.] ^c 18 But they cried
   out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us
   Barabbas:-- 19 one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and
   for murder, was cast into prison. [We see from Matthew's account that
   though the people had a right to name their prisoner, Pilate took upon
   himself the liberty of choosing which one of two it should be. By doing
   so he complicated matters for the Jewish rulers, asking them to choose
   between Jesus, who was held on an unfounded charge of insurrection, and
   Barabbas, who was notoriously an insurrectionist and a murderer and a
   robber as well. But the rulers were not to be caught in so flimsy a
   net. Without regard to consistency, they raised their voice in full
   chorus for the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of Jesus.] ^a 19
   And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him,
   saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have
   suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. [This message
   of Pilate's wife suggests that the name and face of Jesus were not
   unknown to Pilate's household. Pilate would be much influenced by such
   a message. The Romans generally were influenced by all presages, and
   Suetonius tells us that both Julius and Augustus Cæsar attached much
   importance to dreams.] ^b 11 But ^a 20 Now the chief priests and the
   elders persuaded { ^b stirred up} the multitude, { ^a multitudes} ^b
   that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. ^a that they should
   ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 21 But the governor answered and
   said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And
   they said, Barabbas. ^d 40 They cried out therefore again, saying, Not
   this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. ^c 20 And Pilate
   spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus; ^b 12 And Pilate
   again answered and said { ^a saith} unto them, What then shall I do
   unto Jesus who is called Christ? ^b him whom ye call the King of the
   Jews? ^c 21 but { ^b 13 and} they cried out { ^c shouted} ^b again, ^c
   saying, Crucify, crucify him. ^a They all say, Let him be crucified. ^b
   14 And Pilate said unto them, ^c the third time, Why, what evil hath
   this man { ^a he} done? ^c I have found no cause of death in him: I
   will therefore chastise him and release him. ^a But they cried out
   exceedingly, saying, ^b Crucify him. ^a Let him be be crucified.
   [Finding the mob cruelly persistent, Pilate boldly declines to do its
   will and turns back into the Prætorium declaring his intention to
   release Jesus. But he retires with the demands of the multitude ringing
   in his ears.] ^d 1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
   [Carrying out the program which he proposed, Pilate had Jesus removed
   from the Prætorium to the place of scourging, and inflicted that
   punishment upon him. We learn from Josephus and others that the law
   required that those about to be crucified should first be scourged. But
   Pilate hoped that scourging would suffice. He believed that the more
   moderate would take pity upon Jesus when they viewed his scourged body,
   for scourging was so cruel a punishment that the condemned person often
   died under its infliction. The scourge was made of thongs loaded at the
   extremity with pieces of bone or metal. The condemned person was
   stripped and fastened to a low post, this bending the back so as to
   stretch the skin. Blood spurted at the first blow.] 2 And the soldiers
   platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a
   purple garment; 3 and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the
   Jews! and they struck him with their hands. [The soldiers had no
   special malice against Jesus, but the Roman military system made men
   hard of heart. The occasion gave to these foreign legionaries a
   much-enjoyed opportunity to show their contempt for the Jews by mocking
   Jesus as their King. It is not known which one of the many thorny
   plants of Palestine was used to form the Lord's crown. See p. 330. The
   robe was designed to give Jesus a mock appearance of royalty, and it
   was likely some cast-off military coat or state garment of Pilate's.
   Pilate winked at the conduct of his soldiers since it favored his plan.
   If Jesus could be made sufficiently pitiable and contemptible, his
   enemies might relent. But Pilate little understood the venom of those
   enemies: they mocked and taunted Jesus upon the cross.] 4 And Pilate
   went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you,
   that ye may know that I find no crime in him. [Those having our modern
   sense of justice would have said that Pilate brought Jesus out thus
   because he had found no crime in him. But scourging was little thought
   of in that place and day (Acts xxii. 24). If Pilate had found Jesus
   guilty, he would have condemned him at once. As it was, he sought to
   return Jesus to the Sanhedrin as having committed no crime of which the
   Roman law could take note.] 5 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the
   crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them,
   Behold, the man! [It was Pilate's original proposition to scourge Jesus
   and let him go (Luke xxiii. 16). Having already scourged him, he now
   hoped to effect his release. Presenting our Lord in this state of
   abject humiliation, he feels that he has removed him from every
   suspicion of royalty. He speaks of Jesus as no longer a king, but a
   mere man. Pilate's words, however, have a prophetic color, somewhat
   like those uttered by Caiaphas. All those of subsequent ages have
   looked and must continue to look to Jesus as the ideal of manhood. The
   "Ecce Homo" of Pilate is in some sense an echo of the words of the
   Father when he said, "This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him." In Jesus
   we behold the true man, the second Adam.] 6 When therefore the chief
   priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him,
   crucify him! [Thus Pilate's expectation came to naught, for not one of
   the Jewish rulers ever wavered in their demand for crucifixion.] Pilate
   saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no
   crime in him. [In this sentence, "ye" and "I" are both emphatic; for
   Pilate wishes to draw a contrast between himself and the Jewish rulers.
   His words are not a permission to crucify, but a bit of taunting irony,
   as if he said: "I the judge have found him innocent, but ye seem to
   lack the wit to see that the case is ended. If ye are so much superior
   to the judge that ye can ignore his decision, proceed without him;
   crucify him yourselves."] 7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and
   by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
   [Perceiving that Pilate was taunting them, and practically accusing
   them of attempting to put an innocent man to death, they defended
   themselves by revealing the fact that in addition to the charges that
   they had preferred against Jesus, they had found him clearly guilty and
   worthy of death on another charge; viz.: that of blasphemy (Lev. xxiv.
   16). They had made no mention of this fact because Pilate was under no
   obligation to enforce their law; but they mentioned it now to justify
   their course. They probably felt sure that Jesus himself would convince
   Pilate of the truth of this latter accusation if Pilate questioned
   him.] 8 When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid
   [The words of Jesus at John xviii. 37 (see p. 707) and the message from
   his wife had already filled Pilate with fear, and this saying added to
   it because the Roman and Grecian mythologies told of many incarnations;
   and, influenced by the calm presence of Jesus, Pilate readily
   considered the possibility of such a thing]; 9 and he entered into the
   Praetorium again [taking Jesus with him for private examination], and
   saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
   [Pilate sought to know whether Jesus were of heaven or of earth; but
   Jesus did not answer, for the motive of the question was not right.
   Pilate did not wish an answer that he might give or withhold worship;
   but that he might know how strenuously he should defend Jesus. But
   innocent life is to be defended at all hazards, and it matters not
   whether it be human or divine. Pilate, therefore, already knew enough
   to enable him to discharge his duties.] 10 Pilate therefore saith unto
   him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to
   release thee, and have power to crucify thee? [Pilate intimates that
   Jesus should treat his questions with more courtesy since his good will
   and favor are not to be despised. But the words lay bare the corrupt
   heart of Pilate, and form a prophecy of the sin which he committed.
   Judges must hear and give sentence according to truth, uninfluenced by
   good will or favor. But Pilate, to please the Jews, crucified Jesus,
   reversing the sentence which he here suggests that he might render to
   please Jesus.] 11 Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power
   against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he
   [Caiaphas] that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. [Judas is
   spoken of as having delivered Jesus--John xviii. 2, 5 (the same word
   being translated both "betrayed" and "delivered"), but Judas did not
   deliver to Pilate, so Caiaphas as the representative of the Sanhedrin
   is here meant; and Pilate's sin is contrasted with that of the rulers.
   Both of them sinned in abusing their office (the power derived from
   above--Ps. lxxv. 6, 7; Isa. xliv. 28; Rom. xiii. 1); but Pilate's sin
   stopped here. He had no acquaintance with Jesus to give him the
   possibility of other powers--those of love or hatred, worship or
   rejection. The members of the Sanhedrin had these powers which arose
   from a personal knowledge of Jesus, and they abused them by hating and
   rejecting him, thereby adding to their guilt. Pilate condemned the
   innocent when brought before him, but the Sanhedrin searched out and
   arrested the innocent that they might enjoy condemning him.] 12 Upon
   this Pilate sought to release him [As we have seen, Pilate had before
   this tried to win the consent of the rulers that Jesus be released, but
   that which John here indicates was probably an actual attempt to set
   Jesus free. He may have begun by unloosing the hands of Jesus, or some
   such demonstration]: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release
   this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a
   king speaketh against Caesar. [Whatever Pilate's demonstration was it
   was immediately met by a counter one on the part of the rulers. They
   raise a cry which the politic Pilate can not ignore. Taking up the
   political accusation (which they had never abandoned), they give it a
   new turn by prompting Pilate to view it from Cæsar's standpoint.
   Knowing the unreasoning jealousy, suspicion and cruelty of the emperor,
   Pilate saw at once that these unscrupulous Jews could make out of the
   present occasion a charge against him which would cost him his
   position, if not his life.] 13 When Pilate therefore heard these words,
   he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place
   called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. [Pilate had already again
   and again declared Jesus innocent. He now mounts the judgment-seat that
   he may formally reverse himself and condemn him. The apostle as an
   eye-witness fixes by its two names the exact spot where this awful
   decision was rendered.] 14 Now it was the Preparation of the passover
   [see p. 647]: it was about the sixth hour. [It is likely that John uses
   the Roman method of counting time, and means six A. M. See p. 142. John
   notes also the exact hour day and hour.] And he saith unto the Jews,
   Behold, your King! [As he had tried to waken their compassion by
   saying, "Behold, the man!" so he now made a final attempt to shame them
   by saying, "Behold, your King!"] 15 They therefore cried out, Away with
   him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I
   crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but
   Caesar. [Carried away by the strong emotions of the moment, the
   official organs of the Jewish theocracy proclaimed Cæsar to be their
   only king, thus yielding with Jesus their claims to independence and
   their hopes in a Messiah. This is a most significant fact. When their
   ancestors rejected Jehovah as their king (I. Sam. xii. 12), their
   faithful prophet, Samuel, warned them what the king of their choice
   would do, and what they should suffer under him. Thus Jesus also
   foretold what this Cæsar of their choice would do to them ( Luke xix.
   41-44; xxiii. 27-31). They committed themselves to the tender mercies
   of Rome, and one generation later Rome trod them in the wine-press of
   her wrath.] ^c 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he
   might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. [They overcame Pilate's
   weak resistance by their clamor.] ^a 24 So when Pilate saw that he
   prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water,
   and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
   blood of this righteous man; see ye to it. 25 And all the people
   answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. [Pilate's
   act was symbolic, intended to show that he regarded the crucifixion of
   Jesus as a murder, and therefore meant to wash his hands of the guilt
   thereof. The Jewish law made the act perfectly familiar to the Jews
   (Deut. xxi. 1-9). Had the Jewish rulers not been frenzied by hatred,
   the sight of Pilate washing his hands would have checked them; but in
   their rage they take upon themselves and their children all the
   responsibility. At the siege of Jerusalem they answer in part for the
   blood of Christ, but God alone determines the extent of their
   responsibility, and he alone can say when their punishment shall end.
   But we know that it ends for all when they repentantly seek his
   forgiveness. The punishments of God are not vindictive, they are the
   awards of Justice meted out by a merciful hand.] ^b 15 And Pilate,
   wishing to content the multitude, ^c gave sentence that what they asked
   for should be done. ^a 26 Then released he unto them Barabbas; ^c him
   that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they
   asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. ^d 16 Then
   therefore ^b Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified [Mark
   mentions the scourging to show that it preceded the crucifixion, but we
   see from John's account that the scourging took place somewhat earlier
   in the proceeding], ^b he delivered him unto them to be crucified.
   [Pilate delivered Jesus to their punishment, but not into their hands;
   he was led forth and crucified by Pilate's soldiers, who first mocked
   him, as the next paragraph shows.] ^b 16 And ^a 27 Then the soldiers of
   the governor took Jesus, ^b led him away within { ^a into} the court,
   which is the Praetorium; and they called together ^a and gathered unto
   him the whole band. 28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet
   robe. ^b 17 And they clothe him with purple, ^a 29 And they platted {
   ^b platting} a crown of thorns, [and] they put it on him; ^a upon his
   head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him,
   and mocked him, ^b 18 and they began to salute him, ^a saying, Hail,
   King of the Jews! 30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed ^b 19
   And they smote his head { ^a and smote him on the head.} ^b with a
   reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. [After
   the sentence of death the soldiers take Jesus back into the Prætorium,
   and renew the mockeries and indignities which had been interrupted that
   Pilate might exhibit Jesus to the people, as John shows us. Moreover,
   the whole band, or cohort, are now gathered, where at first but a few
   took part. It is likely that the mock robe and crown were removed when
   Jesus was brought before Pilate to be sentenced, for it is highly
   improbable that a Roman judge would pronounce the death sentence while
   the prisoner was clothed in such a manner.]

CXXXII.

Remorse and Suicide of Judas.

(in the Temple and Outside the Wall of Jerusalem. Friday Morning.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 3-10; ^E Acts I. 18, 19.

   ^a 3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned
   [Judas, having no reason to fear the enemies of Jesus, probably stood
   in their midst and witnessed the entire trial], repented himself, and
   brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and
   elders, 4 saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.
   [There are two Greek words which are translated "repented," the one
   properly so translated, metanoeo, which means literally "to know after"
   and which therefore means a change of mind or purpose; and the other,
   metamellomai, which is used here and which means literally "to care
   after," indicates a sorrow for the past. The first should be translated
   "repent;" the second, "regret." Trench draws the distinction thus: "He
   who has changed his mind about the past is in the way to change
   everything; he who has an after care may have little or nothing more
   than a selfish dread of the consequences of what he has done."
   Considering the prophecy which had been uttered with regard to Judas'
   act (Matt. xxvi. 24), he had good reason to fear the consequences.
   While he testifies as to the innocence of Jesus, he expresses no
   affection for him.] But they said, What is that to us? see thou to it.
   [The rulers did not share with Judas the wish to undo what had been
   done. They have been censured for not receiving the testimony which
   Judas gave as to the innocence of Jesus. But as they condemned Jesus
   upon his own testimony, any evidence which Judas might give would be,
   from their standpoint, irrelevant and immaterial. Could Judas testify
   that Jesus was indeed the Son of God? If our Lord's own testimony to
   this effect was regarded as blasphemy, nothing which Judas could say
   would change the case. But the testimony of Judas, in the free,
   untechnical court of public opinion, is of vast weight and importance.
   It shows that one who had every opportunity of knowing Jesus, and who
   was sordid enough to betray him, was yet forced for conscience' sake to
   admit that there was no reason why he should have done so.] 5 And he
   cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed [Judas
   found the chief priests in the sanctuary. Having obtained from Pilate
   the condemnation of Jesus, they hastened back to the temple to
   discharge their morning duties. This gave the soldiers time to mock
   Jesus, and Pilate time to order and prepare the crucifixion. And so,
   though Jesus was sentenced at six o'clock in the morning (John xix.
   14), he was not crucified until the third hour, or nine o'clock (Mark
   xv. 25). Thus the priests were enabled to be present at the
   crucifixion, or at least very soon after the crosses were erected.
   Judas, finding that they would not receive his money, cast it down
   before them that his hands might be no longer burnt by holding it]; and
   he went away and hanged himself. 6 And the chief priests took the
   pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the
   treasury, since it is the price of blood. [The law of God made no
   provision as to the uses of blood money; it was the tradition of the
   elders which thus forbade to put it into the treasury. Theirs was a
   strange conscience indeed, which could take out the Lord's money (and,
   under the then existing Jewish theocratic government, all public money
   was the Lord's money) and spend it for blood, but when it was so spent
   they could not put it back! Moreover, theirs was a strange admission.
   If the money given to Judas was properly expended for the arrest of a
   real criminal, it was justice money, and not blood money at all.] 7 And
   they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury
   strangers in. [That is, the foreigners who died in Jerusalem. Whether
   rich or poor, they were not wanted in Jewish graveyards. The potter's
   field, being excavated for clay, would be of little value, and would
   sell cheap.] 8 Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood,
   unto this day. [This mark of time shows that Matthew's Gospel was
   written a good many years after the crucifixion.] 9 Then was fulfilled
   that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they
   took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced,
   whom certain of the children of Israel did price; 10 and they gave them
   for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. [This quotation is
   not found in any writings of Jeremiah which we have, and as there are
   no other indications of lost writings of that prophet, it is reasonable
   to suppose that Matthew refers to Zech. xi. 12, 13; and that early
   transcribers miscopied the name, which, in the Greek, could be done by
   changing only two letters; viz.: i for z and m for r. The prophecy is
   one of the third class described on p. 51.] ^e 18 (Now this man
   obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong,
   he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it
   became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their
   language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)
   [This parenthesis contains the words of Luke inserted in the midst of a
   speech made by Simon Peter to explain the meaning of his words. His
   account of Judas' death varies in three points from that given by
   Matthew, but the variations are easily harmonized. 1. Evidently Judas
   hung until his abdomen was partially decomposed; then his neck giving
   way, the rope breaking, or something happening which caused his body to
   fall, it burst open when it struck the ground. 2. Judas is spoken of as
   purchasing the field, and so he did, for the priests bought it with his
   money, so that legally it was his purchase. 3. The field was called
   "The field of blood" for two reasons, and each Evangelist gives one of
   them.]

The Crucifixion.

Subdivision A.

On the Way to the Cross.

(Within and Without Jerusalem. Friday Morning.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 31-34; ^B Mark XV. 20-23; ^C Luke XXIII. 26-33; ^D John XIX. 17.

   ^a 31 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the ^b
   purple, ^a robe, and put on him his garments [This ended the mockery,
   which seems to have been begun in a state of levity, but which ended in
   gross indecency and violence. When we think of him who endured it all,
   we can not contemplate the scene without a shudder. Who can measure the
   grace of God or the depravity of man?], ^d 17 They took Jesus
   therefore: ^b And they lead him out to crucify him. ^a and led him away
   to crucify him. ^d and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, ^a
   32 And as they came out, ^c when they led him away, ^a they found a man
   of Cyrene, Simon by name: ^b one passing by, coming from the country,
   the father of Alexander and Rufus, ^a him they ^c laid hold upon { ^b
   compel ^a compelled} to go with them, that he might bear his cross. ^c
   and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus. [Cyrene was a
   flourishing city in the north of Africa, having in it a large Jewish
   population, and Simon shows by his name that he was a Jew. The
   Cyreneans had one or more synagogues in Jerusalem (Acts ii. 10; vi. 9;
   xi. 20). There were many Cyreneans afterwards engaged in spreading the
   gospel (Acts xiii. 1), and since the sons of this man are spoken of as
   well known to Mark's readers it is altogether likely that Simon was one
   of them. This Rufus may be the one mentioned by Paul (Rom. xvi. 13).
   The Roman soldiers found Simon entering the city, and because he was a
   stranger and they needed a man just then, they impressed him after the
   manner mentioned on p. 245.] 27 And there followed him a great
   multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
   [Only the women bewailed him. They were not Galilæans, but women of
   Jerusalem.] 28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of
   Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your
   children. [Some of these women, and the children of others, would
   survive till the terrible siege of Jerusalem and suffer in it. Jesus
   bore his own suffering in silence, but his pity for those upon whom
   these days of anguish would come caused him to speak.] 29 For behold,
   the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren,
   and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
   [The proper blessedness of a matron is motherhood, but the horrors of
   the siege would reverse even so fixed a law as this.] 30 Then shall
   they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover
   us. [This language is figurative, describing one in extreme terror
   seeking impossible refuge. But there is a touch of literalness in the
   fulfillment, for Josephus tells us that at the end of the siege those
   in Jerusalem hid themselves in the subterranean recesses of the city,
   and that no less than two thousand of them were buried alive under the
   ruins of these hiding-places--Wars vi. 9. 4.] 31 For if they do these
   things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? [The language
   here is obscurely proverbial. Here, as elsewhere (Luke xix. 43; Matt.
   xxiv. 15), Jesus refers to the sorrows which the Romans were to bring
   upon the Jews, and the meaning may be, If the fiery persecution of Rome
   is so consuming that my innocence, though again and again pronounced by
   the governor himself, is no protection against it, what will that fire
   do when it envelopes the dry, guilty, rebellious city of Jerusalem? Or
   we may make the present and the future grief of the women the point of
   comparison, and interpret thus: If they cause such sorrow to the women
   while the city is like a green tree, how much more when, like a dry,
   dead tree, it is about to fall.] 32 And there were also two others,
   malefactors, led with him to be put to death. ^b 22 And they bring him
   unto the place ^d which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha: ^b which is,
   being interpreted, { ^a that is to say,} The place of a skull [Where
   this place was, or why it was so called, are matters of conjecture. All
   that we know certainly is that it was outside of, yet near, the
   city--Heb. xiii. 12; John xix. 20], ^c 33 And when they came unto the
   place which is called The skull, ^a 34 they gave { ^b offered} him wine
   ^a to drink mingled with gall: { ^b myrrh:} but { ^a and} when he had
   tasted it, he would not drink. ^b he received it not. [This mixture of
   sour wine mingled with gall and myrrh was intended to dull the sense of
   pain of those being crucified or otherwise severely punished. The
   custom is said to have originated with the Jews and not with the
   Romans. Jesus declined it because it was the Father's will that he
   should suffer. He would not go upon the cross in a drugged,
   semi-conscious condition.]

Jesus Crucified and Reviled. His Three

Sayings During First Three Hours.

(Friday Morning from 9 O'clock Till Noon.)

^A Matt. XXVII. 35-44; ^B Mark XV. 24-32; ^C Luke XXIII. 33-43; ^D John XIX.
18-27.

   ^b 25 And it was the third hour, and ^c there { ^d 18 where} ^c they
   crucified him. ^b 27 And ^a 38 Then are there crucified { ^b they
   crucify} ^a with him ^d two others, ^c the malefactors, ^a robbers, one
   on the right hand, and one { ^c the other} on the { ^b his} left. ^d on
   either side one, and Jesus in the midst. [These were doubtless robbers
   of the class of Barabbas. They were those who, led on by fanatical
   patriotism, had become insurrectionists and then outlaws. Large numbers
   of them were crucified during the Jewish wars (Jos. Wars, xiii. 2. 3).
   These two may have been crucified at this time for convenience' sake,
   but the fact that Jesus was placed between them suggests that they were
   crucified with him to heighten his shame and indignity. For, though
   Pilate had no personal ill will toward Jesus, he wished to show
   contempt for Judah's King.] ^c 34 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them;
   for they know not what they do. [Our Lord's prayer here reminds us of
   the word at Isa. liii. 12. It accords with his own teachings (Matt. v.
   44), and it was echoed by Stephen (Acts vii. 59, 60). Peter and Paul
   both speak of the Jewish ignorance (Acts iii. 17; I. Cor. ii. 8).
   Ignorance mitigates, but does not excuse, crime.] ^b 24 And they
   crucify him, ^d 23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified
   Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part
   [A quaternion or band of four soldiers did the work of the actual
   crucifixion. The Roman law awarded them the garments of the condemned
   as their perquisites] ; ^b and part { ^a parted ^c parting} ^b his
   garments among them, casting { ^c they cast} lots. ^b upon them, what
   each should take. [The sandals, girdle, outer robe, head-dress, etc.,
   of Jesus were divided into four parts and lots were cast of the parts.]
   ^d and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top
   throughout. [This was the tunic or undergarment. It reached from the
   shoulders to the knees. Ordinarily it was in two pieces, which were
   fastened at the shoulders by clasps; but Josephus tells us that the
   tunic of the high priest was an exception to this rule, being woven
   without seam (Ant. iii. 7. 4). Thus in dividing the Lord's garments,
   they found a suggestion of his high priesthood.] 24 They said therefore
   one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it
   shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They
   parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
   [See Ps. xxii. 18.] 25 These things therefore the soldiers did. [Even
   their small part was the subject of minute prophecy.] ^a 36 and they
   sat and watched him there. [They were on guard to prevent any attempt
   at rescue.] ^d 19 And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the
   cross. ^c over him, ^a 37 And they set up over his head ^b the { ^c a}
   superscription ^b of his accusation written, ^a And there was written,
   ^c THIS IS ^a JESUS ^d OF NAZARETH, ^b THE KING OF THE JEWS. [It was a
   well-established Roman custom to thus place a writing above the heads
   of the crucified to indicate the cause for which they died. Pilate
   writes the accusation so as to clear his own skirts before Cæsar and so
   as to show his contempt for the Jewish people. They had forced him to
   crucify an innocent man, and he retaliates by giving to that man the
   title which his enemies accused him of professing.] ^d 20 This title
   therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was
   crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and in
   Latin, and in Greek. [These three languages were respectively those of
   religion, law and philosophy; but Pilate made use of them because all
   three were spoken by people then in Jerusalem.] 21 The chief priests of
   the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but
   that he said, I am King of the Jews. 22 Pilate answered, What I have
   written I have written. [The rulers smarted under this title which
   Pilate had tauntingly written. They had insisted that Jesus' kingship
   was dangerous enough to justify his crucifixion; but now (if
   politically and temporally interpreted) they admit that his kingship
   was an idle claim, a mere matter of words.] ^c 35 And the people stood
   beholding. [The scene had an awful fascination which they could not
   resist.] ^a 39 And they that passed by [Jesus was evidently crucified
   near the highway] railed on him, wagging their heads, 40 and saying, ^b
   Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 30
   save thyself, ^a if thou art the Son of God, ^b and come down from the
   cross. 31 In like manner also the chief priests ^c And the rulers also
   scoffed at him, ^b mocking him among themselves with the scribes ^a and
   elders, said, { ^c saying,} He saved others; ^b himself he cannot save.
   ^c let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. ^a
   He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we
   will believe on him. ^b 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come
   down from the cross, that we may see and believe. ^a 43 He trusteth on
   God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the
   Son of God. ^c 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him,
   offering him vinegar, 37 and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews,
   save thyself. [Thus one and all unite in mocking Jesus, using both word
   and gesture. They bring forth echoes from the trial of Jesus and take
   other incidents from his life, little dreaming the deep significance of
   what they utter. They reminded Jesus of his words about destroying the
   temple, when they were committing that very act. They speak of his
   building it again when Jesus was about to die that he might rise. They
   taunt him with saving others, yet being unable to save himself, which
   is the great truth of the atonement which the Lord was then making.
   They promised to believe if he will come down from the cross, yet his
   being lifted upon the cross was the very act which would convince
   them--John viii. 28.] ^a 44 And the robbers also that were crucified
   with him ^b reproached him. ^a cast upon him the same reproach. ^c 39
   And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art
   not thou the Christ? save thyself and us. 40 But the other answered,
   and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in
   the same condemnation? 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
   reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 42 And he
   said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom. 43 And he
   said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in
   Paradise. [It seems that at first both robbers reviled Christ, but one
   repenting spoke in his favor and prayed to him. It is not likely that
   this robber had any conception of the spiritual kingdom of Jesus, but
   he somehow arrived at the conclusion that Jesus was the Messiah, and
   would come into his kingdom despite his crucifixion. Jesus answered his
   prayer by a solemn promise that they would, that day, be together in
   that portion of the invisible world where those who are accepted of God
   await the resurrection. Many thoughtlessly make this dying robber the
   model of death-bed repentance, arguing that others may also be saved in
   this irregular manner. But Christ had not yet died, and the new
   testament or covenant was not sealed. Jesus then could change its terms
   to suit the occasion. It is therefore no evidence whatever that after
   his death and in his present glorified state our Lord will in any way
   change the covenant so as to do away with a single one of the terms
   required for obtaining remission of sins (Heb. ix. 15-18). Moreover,
   the example of the penitent robber is a difficult one to follow; he
   professed faith in Christ and his kingdom when there was no other voice
   in the whole wide world willing to do such a thing. Any one having such
   a faith in Christ will not put off his confession until the hour of
   death.] ^d But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother,
   and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
   [For comment on these four women, see note on p. 225.] 26 When Jesus
   therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved,
   he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 27 Then saith he to
   the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took
   her unto his own home. [By using the title "woman" Jesus addressed his
   mother at the end of his ministry with the same word which he had used
   at its beginning (John ii. 4). Thus he cut her off from all parental
   authority over him. In this last hour our Lord bestows upon his
   helpless mother the disciple whom he loved, who was then in the flower
   of his manhood. All of Christ's disciples are thus appointed by him
   protectors of the helpless, but few recognize the behest as John did.]

Darkness Three Hours. After Four More Sayings,

Jesus Expires. Strange Events Attending His Death.

^A Matt. XXVII. 45-56; ^B Mark XV. 33-41; ^C Luke XXIII. 44-49; ^D John XIX.
28-30.

   ^c 44 And it was now about the sixth hour, ^b 33 And ^a 45 Now ^b when
   the sixth hour was come, there was ^c a darkness came ^a over all ^b
   the whole land ^a from the sixth hour ^b until the ninth hour. ^c 45
   the sun's light failing [The darkness lasted from noon until three
   o'clock. It could not have been an eclipse, for the moon was always
   full on the first day of the passover. Whether the darkness was over
   the whole world, or simply all of Palestine, is uncertain, as,
   according to the usage of Bible language, the words would be the same]:
   ^b 34 And at { ^a about} the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
   saying, Eli, Eli { ^b Eloi, Eloi,} lama sabachthani? which is, { ^a
   that is,} ^b being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
   me? [We can imagine what it would mean to a righteous man to feel that
   he was forsaken of God. But the more we feel and enjoy the love of
   another, the greater our sense of loss at being deprived of it.
   Considering, therefore, the near and dear relationship between the Son
   and Father, it is evident that we can never know or fathom the depth of
   anguish which this cry expressed. Suffice it to say, that this was
   without doubt the most excruciating of all Christ's sufferings, and it,
   too, was a suffering in our stead. The words of the cry are found at
   Ps. xxii. 1. Eli is Hebrew, Eloi Aramaic or Syro-Chaldaic for "My God."
   The former would be used by Jesus if he quoted the Scripture, the
   latter if he spoke the language of the people.] 35 And some of them
   that stood by, { ^a this man} when they heard it, said, ^b Behold, he {
   ^a this man} calleth Elijah. ^d 28 After this Jesus, knowing that all
   things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished,
   saith, I thirst. 29 There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: ^a 48
   And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with
   { ^b and filling a sponge full of} vinegar, ^a and put it on a reed,
   and gave him to drink. ^d so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon
   hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. ^b saying, { ^a 49 And the rest
   said,} Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh ^b to take him down. ^a
   to save him. [Jesus had now been upon the cross for six hours, and
   fever and loss of blood and the strain upon the muscles of his chest
   had rendered his articulation difficult and indistinct. For this reason
   some of those who stood by, though perfectly familiar with the
   language, misunderstood him and thought that he called upon Elijah.
   Immediately afterwards Jesus speaks of his thirst, and vinegar is given
   to him to remove the dryness from his throat. Those who give the
   vinegar and those who stand by, unite in saying "Let be." This phrase
   has no reference to the vinegar; it is a general expression, meaning,
   "Let us do nothing to prevent him from calling upon Elijah, or to
   prevent Elijah from coming."] ^b 37 And ^d 30 When Jesus therefore had
   received the vinegar, ^a Jesus cried again with { ^b uttered} a loud
   voice, ^d he said, It is finished [He had come, had ministered, had
   suffered, and had conquered. There now remained but the simple act of
   taking possession of the citadel of the grave, and the overthrowing of
   death. By his righteousness Jesus had triumphed in man's behalf and the
   mighty task was accomplished]: ^c 46 And Jesus, crying with a loud
   voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit [Ps. xxxi. 5]:
   and having said this, ^d he bowed his head, and gave up { ^a yielded
   up} ^b the ghost. ^a his spirit. [None of the Evangelists speaks of
   Jesus as dying; for he yielded up his spirit voluntarily--John x. 18.]
   51 And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two ^c in the midst.
   ^b from the top to the bottom. [The veil was the heavy curtain which
   hung between the holy and the most holy places in the sanctuary. By
   shutting out from the most holy place all persons except the high
   priest, who alone was permitted to pass through it, and this only once
   in the year, it signified that the way into the holiest--that is, into
   heaven--was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was
   standing (Heb. ix. 7, 8). But the moment that Jesus died, thus making
   the way manifest, the veil was appropriately rent in twain from top to
   bottom, disclosing the most holy place to the priests who were at that
   time offering the evening incense in the holy place.] ^a and the earth
   did quake; and the rocks were rent; 52 and the tombs were opened; and
   many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; 53 and
   coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into
   the holy city and appeared unto many. [The earthquake, the rending of
   the rocks, and the consequent opening of the graves, occurred at the
   moment Jesus died, while the resurrection and visible appearance in the
   city of the bodies of the saints occurred "after his resurrection," for
   Jesus himself was the "first-born from the dead" (Col. i. 18). Matthew
   chooses to mention the last event here because of its association with
   the rending of the rocks, which opened the rock-hewn sepulchres in
   which the saints had slept. There has been much speculation as to what
   became of these risen saints. We have no positive information, but the
   natural presumption is, that they ascended to heaven. These
   resurrections were symbolic, showing that the resurrection of Christ is
   the resurrection of the race--I. Cor. xv. 22.] ^b 39 And when the
   centurion, who stood by ^a watching Jesus, ^b over against him, saw
   that he so gave up the ghost, ^a saw the earthquake, and the things
   that were { ^c what was} done, he glorified God, saying, { ^b he said,}
   ^c Certainly this was a righteous man. ^a 54 Now the centurion, and
   they that were with him feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this ^b man
   was the Son of God. [The conduct of Jesus upon the cross and the
   disturbances of nature which accompanied his death convinced the
   centurion that Jesus was a righteous man. But knowing that Jesus
   claimed to be the Son of God, and this claim was the real cause for
   which the Jews were crucifying him, he concludes, since he concedes
   that Jesus is righteous, that he is also all that he professed to
   be--the Son of God. There is no just reason for minimizing his
   confession, as though he had said, "A son of the gods;" for he said
   nothing of that kind, and those err as to the use of Scriptural
   language who think so. Like the centurions of Capernaum (Matt. viii.
   10) and Cæsarea (Acts x. 1, 2), this Roman surpassed in faith those who
   had better opportunities. But in this faith he was not alone.] ^c 48
   And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they
   beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts. [The
   people who had acted under the influence of the priests now yielded to
   superior influences and began to experience that change of sentiment
   which led so many to repent and confess Christ at Pentecost.] 49 And
   all his acquaintance, ^a 55 And many women ^b also ^a were there
   beholding ^c the women that { ^a who} had followed ^c with ^a Jesus
   from Galilee, ministering unto him: ^c stood afar off, ^a beholding
   from afar, ^c seeing these things. ^b among whom were both Mary
   Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
   Salome; ^a the mother of the sons of Zebedee. ^b 41 who, when he was in
   Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women
   that came up with him unto Jerusalem. [John has already mentioned this
   group of women (see p. 729), and has shown that he stood with them. The
   women, being unable to bear arms in an insurrection, had little to
   fear. They were not likely to be complicated in the charges against
   Jesus. But the men were conspicuously absent. They appear to have stood
   quite close to the cross at one time just before the darkness. Probably
   they feared violence in the darkness, and so withdrew and viewed from
   afar off the scene as lighted by the torches which the Roman soldiers
   would be obliged to procure in order to effectually guard their
   prisoner (Acts xvi. 29). The synoptists, who make mention of the women
   toward the close of the crucifixion, do not mention the mother of Jesus
   as any longer among them. It is likely that she had withdrawn with
   John, being unable longer to endure the sight. As to the ministering of
   these women, see p. 297, 298.]

Jesus Found to Be Dead. His Body

Buried and Guarded in the Tomb.

^A Matt. XXVII. 57-66; ^B Mark XV. 42-47; ^C Luke XXIII. 50-56; ^D John XIX.
31-42.

   ^d 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the
   bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of
   that sabbath was a high day ), asked of Pilate that their legs might be
   broken, and that they might be taken away. [According to rabbinical
   writing a few hours before the Sabbath were called the Preparation; but
   afterwards the term was applied to the entire day preceding the
   Sabbath. The Romans left the bodies of criminals hanging upon the cross
   until beasts and birds of prey, or putrefaction, removed them. But the
   Jewish law forbade that a body should hang over night; for a dead body
   was accursed, and so the day following might be polluted by the curse
   which attached to it (Deut. xxi. 23; Josh. viii. 29; x. 26; Jos. Wars
   iv. 5. 2). The context suggests that the Jews had grown lax with regard
   to this law on account of the trouble of obtaining the consent from the
   Romans required to carry it out. But as the Sabbath in this instance
   was that of the passover week, and as they were ready enough to do
   anything to show that Jesus was an extraordinary criminal, they asked
   Pilate that their law might be observed. Instead of killing the
   criminals, they broke their legs, which rendered recovery impossible,
   since putrefaction almost immediately set it.] 32 The soldiers
   therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that
   was crucified with him: 33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he
   was dead already, they brake not his legs: 34 howbeit one of the
   soldiers with a spear pierced his side [to insure death in case they
   might be mistaken], and straightway there came out blood and water. 35
   And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and
   he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe. [Many able men
   have argued learnedly that this flow of blood and water was evidence
   that Jesus died of a ruptured, or literally broken, heart; but they
   confess themselves involved in difficulties, for it is hard to
   reconcile the idea that Jesus died a voluntary death with the idea that
   he died of any natural cause whatever. Can anything be at once natural
   and supernatural? However, John's asservation that he was an
   eye-witness of this shows that he attached importance to it. To him the
   body of Jesus gave evidence that it differed from other dead bodies. We
   enter with hesitancy the realm of symbolism, knowing how flagrantly it
   is abused, but we offer this as a suggestion. Jesus died for our sins,
   and his death was therefore to provide a means for the cleansing of
   sin. But, under the terms of his gospel, sins are visibly and
   physically washed away by water, and invisibly and spiritually by blood
   (Heb. x. 22). Now, since both these means were seen by a faithful
   witness to issue from the side of our crucified Lord, contrary to the
   ordinary law and course of nature, we have additional reason to believe
   that things out of the course of nature, namely, the cleansing of sin,
   etc., were accomplished by his crucifixion.] 36 For these things came
   to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not
   be broken. [ Ps. xxxiv. 20.] 37 And again another scripture saith, They
   shall look on him whom they pierced. [Zech. xii. 10. Even after his
   death divine power went on fulfilling the prophecies concerning Jesus.
   He hangs upon the cross as one of a group of three, yet, in the
   twinkling of an eye, he is separated from the other two by the
   fulfillment of a brace of prophecies which point him out as the chosen
   of God.] 38 And after these things ^b when even was now come, because
   it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, ^c behold,
   ^a there came a rich man from Arimathaea, ^c a city of the Jews, ^a
   named Joseph, ^b of Arimathaea, ^c who was a councillor, ^b of
   honorable estate, ^c a good and righteous man 51 (he had not consented
   to their counsel and deed), ^b who also himself was looking for the
   kingdom of God; ^a who also himself was Jesus' disciple: { ^d being a
   disciple of Jesus,} but secretly for fear of the Jews [John xii. 42,
   43], ^a 58 this man ^b boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the
   body of Jesus. ^d asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of
   Jesus [Joseph's town has been variously identified with Ramleh in Dan,
   Ramathaim in Ephraim (I. Sam. i. 1), and Ramah in Benjamin (Matt. ii.
   18). It was a fulfillment of prophecy that the one who buried Jesus
   should be rich (Isa. liii. 9). It is strange that those who were not
   afraid to be disciples were afraid to ask for our Lord's body, yet he
   who was afraid to be a disciple feared not to do this thing]: ^b 44 And
   Pilate marvelled if he were already dead [instances are cited where men
   lived one whole week upon the cross, and men rarely died the first
   day]: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had
   been any while dead. 45 And when he learned it of the centurion, ^a
   Then Pilate ^b granted the corpse to Joseph. ^a commanded it to be
   given up. ^d and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took
   away his body. 39 And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first
   came to him by night [John iii. 2], bringing a mixture of myrrh and
   aloes, about a hundred pounds. [Myrrh was a resin and the aloe was
   pulverized wood. Both were aromatic--Ps. xlv. 8.] ^a 59 And Joseph ^b
   bought a linen cloth [a sindon--see p. 693], ^c 53 And he took ^a the
   body, ^c down, ^b and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, {
   ^a and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,} ^d 40 So they took the body
   of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom
   of the Jews is to bury. [As to the swathing of dead bodies, see p. 526,
   also Acts v. 6. The spices were wrapped between the folds of the linen
   in order to partially embalm the body. Thus two members of the
   Sanhedrin unite to bury Jesus, each showing his reverence in his own
   way: Joseph by buying a sindon instead of cheaper cloth, and Nicodemus
   by a wonderful wealth of spices--twelve hundred ounces. Possibly the
   heart of Nicodemus smote him for his tardiness in honoring Christ, and
   he desired to appease his conscience by giving the Lord a royal
   burial--II. Chron. xvi. 14.] 41 Now in the place where he was crucified
   there was a garden [belonging to Joseph]; and in the garden a { ^a his
   own} new tomb which he had { ^c that was ^b which had been} ^c hewn in
   stone, ^b out of a { ^a the} rock: ^d wherein was never man yet laid. {
   ^c where never man had yet lain.} [To the sindon Joseph adds the honor
   of a burial in his own tomb. The unused state of the tomb is mentioned
   to show that there is no shadow of doubt as to whose resurrection
   opened it.] 54 And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath
   drew on. ^d 42 There then because of the Jews' Preparation (for the
   tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus. ^a and he rolled a great stone
   to { ^b against} the door of the tomb. ^a and departed. ^c 55 And the
   women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld
   the tomb, and how his body was laid. ^a 61 And Mary Magdalene was
   there, and the other Mary, ^b the mother of Joses ^a sitting over
   against the sepulchre. ^c and beheld the tomb, ^b where ^c and how his
   body was laid. 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
   And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment. [As Jesus
   died about three o'clock in the afternoon, and as all work had to stop
   at sunset, which was the beginning of the Sabbath, Joseph was much
   hurried in his efforts to bury Jesus. The context, therefore, shows
   that our Lord was not completely embalmed by him. The body of Jesus
   might have been kept elsewhere until after the Sabbath; but because the
   tomb was near it appears to have been used temporarily, and the
   preparation of spices by the women shows that even that part of the
   burial was not, in their estimation, completed. This unfinished burial
   led the women back to the tomb early on the first day of the week, and
   thus brought to the disciples the glad news of the resurrection without
   any needless delay.] ^a 62 Now on the morrow, which is the day after
   the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
   together unto Pilate [This was not the whole Sanhedrin, but members of
   it. When did they come to Pilate? Meyer, Cook, etc., say that the Greek
   word translated "morrow" precludes any other idea than it was after
   daylight Saturday morning, but Michaelis, Paulus, Kuinoel, etc., say
   that they came Friday night, and we think their view is correct. The
   word translated "morrow" also means "the next day." As the Jewish day
   began at sunset, we know of no other Greek adverb by which Matthew
   could have expressed the beginning of a day. Had it been the Sabbath
   morning there is no reason why Matthew should not have said so. By
   mentioning, instead, the Preparation, he draws the mind back to what we
   would call Friday night. It is highly improbable that the Jews would
   leave the tomb of Jesus unguarded for one whole night. Their gathering
   thus to Pilate in the shades of evening presents a gruesome picture],
   63 saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet
   alive, After three days I rise again. [For this saying, see John ii.
   19; Matt. xii. 39, 40.] 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made
   sure until the third day [Had the phrase "after three days" meant three
   full days to them, they would have said "until the fourth day." For the
   Jewish method of counting days see p. 306], lest haply his disciples
   come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the
   dead: and the last error will be worse than the first. [The marvelous
   signs accompanying the death of Jesus appealed to men's fear rather
   than to their love, and were, therefore, calculated to make a far
   deeper impression upon his enemies than upon his friends. We find,
   therefore, these Jewish rulers full of active interest in the dead
   Christ while his apostles and friends are listless in despair. They, of
   course, did not think it possible that Jesus could indeed rise, but,
   seeing the profound impression which the portents attending the
   crucifixion had made upon the multitude (Luke xxiii. 48), and judging
   the disciples of Jesus by themselves--full of all subtlety and
   cunning--they grasped at once the idea that the disciples could make a
   great stir among the people by stealing the body and proclaiming the
   predicted resurrection. The apostles, on the other hand, when the
   actual resurrection had taken place, did not learn for fifty days what
   use to make of it, thus showing they could not have planned a pretended
   resurrection.] 65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard [The Greek
   here may be the indicative or the imperative; it is clearly the latter.
   If the Jews had possessed a guard, they would not have asked for one.
   Pilate consents to their request by saying, "Have ye a guard:" thereby
   fully sanctioning their idea]: go, make it as sure as ye can. 66 So
   they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard
   being with them. [They sealed the stone by drawing a string or tape
   across it and fastening the ends with wax or clay to the surface of the
   rock on either side. If either seals were broken, that fact would show
   that the tomb was entered from without.]

Angels Announce the Resurrection to Certain Women. Peter and John Enter the
Empty Tomb.

(Joseph's Garden. Sunday, Very Early.)

^A Matt. XXVIII. 1-8; ^B Mark XVI. 1-8; ^C Luke XXIV. 1-8, 12; ^D John XX. 1-10.

   ^c 1 But ^a 1 Now late on the sabbath day, ^b 1 And when the sabbath
   was past, ^c on the first day of the week, { ^a as it began to dawn
   toward the first day of the week,} ^c at early dawn, ^d while it was
   yet dark, cometh { ^a came} ^d Mary Magdalene early ^a and the other
   Mary ^b the mother of James, and Salome, ^c unto the tomb, bringing {
   ^b brought} ^c the spices which they had prepared. [Luke xxiii. 56.] ^a
   to see the sepulchre. ^b that they might come and anoint him. ^a 2 And
   behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord
   descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon
   it. 3 His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 4
   and for fear of him the watchers [the Roman soldiers on guard] did
   quake, and became as dead men. [The angel sat upon the stone that the
   Roman guards might make no attempt to reclose the tomb.] ^b 2 And very
   early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun
   was risen. 3 And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us
   away the stone from the door of the tomb? ^c 2 And they found the stone
   rolled away from the tomb. ^b 4 and looking up, they see { ^d [Mary
   Magdalene] seeth} ^b that the stone is rolled back: { ^d taken away
   from the tomb.} for it was exceeding great. ^c 3 And they ^b entering
   into the tomb, { ^c entered in,} and found not the body of the Lord
   Jesus. [John mentions Mary Magdalene alone, though she came with the
   rest of the women. As she was the one who reported to John and Peter,
   he describes her actions, and makes no mention of the others.] ^d 2 She
   runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple
   whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord
   out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. [Though Mary
   came with the other women, she departed at once, while the others
   tarried, as the sequel shows. The narrative proceeds to tell what
   happened to the other women after Mary had departed.] ^c 4 And it came
   to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by
   them in dazzling apparel: ^b they saw a young man sitting on the right
   side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed. ^c 5 and as they
   were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto
   them, { ^b he ^a the angel} answered and said unto the women, Fear not
   ye; ^c Be not amazed: ^a for I know that ye seek Jesus, ^b the
   Nazarene, who hath been crucified: ^c Why seek ye the living among the
   dead? 6 He is not here, but { ^a for} he is risen, even as he said. ^c
   remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 7 saying
   that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men,
   and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 8 And they remembered
   his words [For the words referred to, see Matt. xvii. 22, 23. The angel
   continues his speech as follows], ^a Come, ^b behold, the place where
   they laid him! ^a see the place where the Lord lay. [Here is a double
   wonder, that men should put the Son of God in a grave, and that he
   should consent to be put there.] ^b 7 But { ^a 7 And} go quickly, and
   tell his disciples, ^b and Peter, ^a He is risen from the dead; and lo,
   he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: ^b as he said
   unto you. ^a lo, I have told you. [The women were told to hasten, for
   the disciples were not to endure their sorrow a moment longer than was
   needful. Peter was mentioned by name that he might know that he was not
   cast off for his denial. The Lord appeared to some chosen few in Judæa,
   but the large body of his disciples were to see him in Galilee; see
   [10]Section CXLI. Jesus had appointed a place of meeting; but we are
   not told where it was nor when he appointed it.] 8 And they departed
   quickly ^b 8 And they went out, and fled from the tomb; ^a with fear
   and great joy [fear, because of the heavenly messengers; joy, because
   of their message], and ran to bring his disciples word. ^b for
   trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to
   any one; for they were afraid. [They told none whom they met, but
   reserved the message for the apostles.] ^c 12 But Peter ^d therefore ^c
   arose, ^d went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the
   tomb. ^c and ran unto the tomb [John shows that he and Peter started
   for the tomb as soon as they received the message of Mary Magdalene
   given above, but Luke is less exact, blending her message with that of
   the other women, as will be seen in the latter part of [11]Section
   CXXXV.]; ^d 4 And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran
   Peter [it is generally accepted that John was younger, and hence more
   active than Peter] , and came first to the tomb; 5 and stooping and
   looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. 6
   Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the
   tomb; ^c and stooping and looking in, he seeth ^d and he beholdeth the
   linen cloths lying; ^c by themselves; ^d 7 and the napkin, that was
   upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a
   place by itself. ^c and he departed to his home, wondering at that
   which was come to pass. [The impulsive, thoroughgoing nature of Peter
   was not content with a mere look; he entered the tomb, neither
   reverence nor awe keeping him out. The sight which he saw puzzled him.
   Why should those who removed the body pause to unswathe it? why should
   they unswathe it at all? why should they fold the napkin and place it
   aside so carefully? But Peter left the tomb with these questions
   unsolved.] ^d 8 Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who
   came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. 9 For as yet they
   knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 10 So the
   disciples went away again unto their own home. [Assured that the grave
   was now empty, and emboldened by the example of Peter, John now
   enteredit, and as he looked upon its evidences of quietude and order,
   the truth flashed upon his mind that Jesus himself had removed the
   bandages, and had himself departed from the tomb, as the firstborn from
   the dead. Here, then, was the first belief and the first believer in
   the resurrection; it is important to note that the Scripture did not
   suggest the fact, but the fact illumined the Scripture. Ps. xvi. 10 and
   Isa. liii. 10 , and many other passages set forth the resurrection of
   our Lord; his own words, too, had plainly foretold it, yet among the
   disciples it was so much beyond all expectation that the prophecies had
   no meaning until made clear by the event itself. Yet these are the men
   whom the Jews accused of inventing the story of a resurrection!]

First and Second Appearances of the Risen Christ. The Resurrection Reported to
the Apostles.

(Jerusalem. Sunday Morning.)

^A Matt. XXVIII. 9, 10; ^B Mark XVI. 9-11; ^C Luke XXIV. 9-11; ^D John XX.
11-18.

   [The women, having received the message of the angels, and remembering
   that the message accorded with the words of Jesus himself, made haste.]
   ^c 9 and returned from the tomb, ^b 9 Now when he was risen early on
   the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from
   whom he had cast out seven demons. [Mark here agrees with John that
   Mary separated from the other women. As to Mary Magdalene, see pp. 291,
   297. After telling Peter and John about the empty tomb, Mary followed
   them back to it, and evidently reached it after they had left it. She
   found no one at the tomb.] ^d 11 But Mary was standing without at the
   tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; 12
   and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one
   at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. [This picture is
   intensely natural. The Lord's death had been sorrow enough, but to be
   deprived of the poor privilege of embalming the body seemed a veritable
   sorrow's crown of sorrow; and so Mary wept. But it suddenly occurs to
   her that in her haste she had not yet looked into the tomb at all,
   having jumped to the conclusion that it was empty because she saw it
   open; she therefore looks in. Her grief at the loss of the Lord is so
   great that she forgets to be frightened at the angels; just as a mother
   in her anxiety for the sick child forgets to fear its fever, no matter
   how virulent. The angels were placed like cherubim upon the ark, as
   though the grave of Christ was a new mercy seat, which indeed it was.]
   13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them,
   Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
   laid him. 14 When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and
   beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. [Before the
   angels can speak the glad news to Mary, Jesus himself becomes his own
   messenger. That Mary did not recognize him may be due to her grief, for
   tears blind our eyes to many of the tender providences of God; but to
   reason by analogy it seems more likely that her eyes "were holden"
   (Luke xxiv. 16), lest the shock of his sudden appearance might be too
   much for her, as it was for even his male disciples (Luke xxiv. 37).
   Conversation with him assured her that he was not a disembodied
   spirit.] 15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
   thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if
   thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will
   take him away. [Christ's first question expressed kindly sympathy; the
   second suggested that he knew the cause of her grief, and might be able
   to help her find what she sought. Thus encouraged, Mary at once assumes
   that the gardener himself had removed the body, probably under
   instructions from Joseph, and hope lightens her heart. In her effort to
   remove the body, she doubtless counts upon the help of her
   fellow-disciples.] 16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. [Her eyes and ears
   were no longer held; she knew him. It was the same way he used to
   speak, the same name by which he used to call her. The grave had
   glorified and exalted him, but had not changed his love.] She turneth
   herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say,
   Teacher. [Seasons of greatest joy are marked by little speech. Jesus
   and Mary each expressed themselves in a single word.] 17 Jesus saith to
   her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go
   unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your
   Father, and my God and your God. [This passage is one of well-known
   difficulty, and Meyer or Ryle may be consulted by those wishing to see
   how various commentators have interpreted it. We would explain it by
   the following paraphrase: "Do not lay hold on me and detain yourself
   and me; I have not yet ascended; this is no brief, passing vision; I am
   yet in the world, and will be for some time, and there will be other
   opportunities to see me; the duty of the moment is to go and tell my
   sorrowing disciples that I have risen, and shall ascend to my Father."
   Jesus does not say "our Father." Our relation to God is not the same as
   his. While, however, our Lord's language recognizes the difference
   between his divine and our human relationship to the Father, his words
   are intended to show us our exaltation. We have reason to believe that
   next to our Lord's title as Son our title as sons of God by adoption is
   as high in honor as any in the universe.] 18 Mary Magdalene cometh and
   telleth { ^b went and told} ^d the disciples, ^b them that had been
   with him, as they mourned and wept. [The poignancy of the disciples'
   grief, even after the intervention of the Sabbath day, explains why the
   Lord and his angels were so eager to bring them word of the
   resurrection.] ^d I have seen the Lord; and that he had said these
   things unto her. ^b 11 And they, when they heard that he was alive, and
   had been seen of her, disbelieved. [It is likely that Mary brought the
   first word, for we shall see below that Luke places her first in the
   catalogue of witnesses. The narrative now turns back to take up the
   account of the other women.] ^a 9 And behold, Jesus met them, saying,
   All hail. [This was a customary salutation. But the old formula took on
   new significance, for it means "rejoice."] And they came and took hold
   of his feet, and worshipped him. [This delay, permitted to them, and
   denied to Mary, probably explains why she became the first messenger,
   though the other women were first to leave the tomb.] 10 Then saith
   Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into
   Galilee, and there shall they see me. [The repetition may be due to the
   reticence of the women remarked by Mark in the last section by the key
   words "and they said nothing to any one." The women may have been
   hesitating whether they should tell the disciples. Thus Jesus
   reiterates the instruction already given by the angel. This is the
   first time the word "brethren" is applied by our Lord to his
   disciples.] ^c and [they] told all these things to the eleven, and to
   all the rest. 10 Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the
   mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto
   the apostles. 11 And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk;
   and they disbelieved them. [Lamar well says that this very incredulity
   on the part of the apostles "enhances the value of their testimony to
   the fact of the resurrection. They were not expecting it; they were no
   visionary enthusiasts, prepared to welcome and credit any story that
   might be told them; nor would they be satisfied with any proof short of
   palpable and ocular demonstrations."]

CXXXVI.

Some of the Guards Report to the Jewish Rulers.

^A Matt. XXVIII. 11-15.

   ^a 11 Now while they were going [while Joanna and the group of women
   with her were on their way to tell the apostles that they had seen
   Jesus], behold, some of the guard [not all] came into the city, and
   told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.
   [Esteeming it folly to guard an empty tomb, the soldiers went to their
   barracks, while their officers returned to those who had placed them on
   guard to report what had happened. They rightly judged that the plain
   truth was their best defense. They could not be expected to contend
   against earthquakes and angels. Their report implies that they saw
   Jesus leave the tomb, and after the angel opened it. [12] ] 12 And when
   they [the chief priests] were assembled with the elders, and had taken
   counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers, 13 saying, Say ye, His
   disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. [This was
   evidently not a full, but a select, council of the Sanhedrin hastily
   summoned. They willfully shut their eyes to the fact that Jesus had
   risen, and proceed to purchase a lie to subvert the truth. Unrepentant,
   despite the many evidences that they had done wrong, they proceed to
   further invoke the wrath of God. Their lie is doubly apparent upon its
   face. 1. It would have been practically impossible for men to have
   rifled such a tomb without waking a guard set to protect it. 2. It is
   absolutely impossible for men to have known what had occurred while
   they were asleep.] 14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will
   persuade him, and rid you of care. [It was a capital offense for a
   Roman soldier to sleep while on guard; therefore, if Pilate heard that
   they had done this thing, it would require "persuasion" to make him
   overlook the offense. Possibly the Jews thought that Pilate was
   sufficiently involved with them to be ready to aid them to hush the
   story of the resurrection, especially if they confessed to him that
   they themselves had invented the lie which the soldiers told.] 15 So
   they took the money, and did as they were taught [the lesson was short
   and simple; the reward, large and desirable]: and this saying was
   spread abroad among the Jews, and continueth until this day. [The words
   seem to indicate that it was published more largely than simply within
   the walls of Jerusalem. In his dialogue with Trypho, which was written
   about a.d. 170, Justin Martyr says that the Jews dispersed the story by
   means of special messengers sent to every country. The fear which they
   expressed to Pilate (Matt. xxvii. 64), lends credibility to this
   statement.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] * NOTE.--We fail to see any such implication. In our opinion Jesus
   had already departed from the tomb when the angel came. The tomb was
   not opened to let the Lord out, but to let the disciples in, that they
   might see as soon as possible one of the chief evidences of his
   resurrection (John xx. 8; Matt. xxviii. 6). Jesus did not need that one
   open doors for him (John xx. 19, 26), but the disciples had such a need
   (Mark xvi. 3). But it seems to us contrary to Scripture precedent that
   these unbelieving soldiers should see the risen Christ, for he did not
   appear to the unbelieving so far as the record shows, and the
   implication is that the same principle which made Jesus refuse the
   testimony of demons made him also decline to let unbelievers become
   witnesses to his resurrection (Acts x. 40, 41).--P. Y. P.

Third and Fourth Appearances of Jesus.

(Sunday Afternoon.)

^B Mark XVI. 12, 13; ^C Luke XXIV. 13-35; ^E I. Cor. XV. 5.

   ^b 12 And after these things he was manifested in another form [i. e.,
   another manner] unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the
   country. ^c 13 And behold, two of them were going that very day to a
   village named Emmaus [Several sites have been suggested, but the
   village of Emmaus has not yet been identified beyond dispute. Its
   location is probably marked by the ruins called el Kubeibeh, which lies
   northwest of Jerusalem], which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.
   [el Kubeibeh is distant seven and thirteen-sixteenths of a mile, or
   sixty-two and one-half furlongs, from Jerusalem.] 14 And they communed
   with each other of all these things which had happened. 15 And it came
   to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus
   himself drew near, and went with them. 16 But their eyes were holden
   that they should not know him. [Jesus himself designedly restrained
   their vision, that, unlike John (John xx. 8, 9), that might see the
   resurrection of Jesus in the Scriptures before they saw it in reality.]
   17 And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have
   one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. [Our
   Lord's abrupt question brought them to a standstill. We may well
   imagine that they considered his interruption very unwelcome. But his
   kindly mien won their confidence and they tell him all.] 18 And one of
   them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn
   in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in
   these days? [Of Cleopas nothing further is known. It has been suggested
   that the other disciple was Luke himself. This is possible, for the
   other Evangelists mention themselves thus impersonally. The preface to
   Luke's Gospel in no way forbids us to think that he had a personal
   knowledge of parts of Christ's ministry. Cleopas marveled that there
   could be a single man in Jerusalem who had not heard concerning the
   crucifixion, etc.] 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said
   unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet
   mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 20 and how the
   chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death,
   and crucified him. 21 But we hoped that it was he who should redeem
   Israel. [To Cleopas, redeeming Israel meant freeing the nation from the
   Roman yoke.] Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since
   these things came to pass. 22 Moreover certain women of our company
   amazed us, having been early at the tomb; 23 and when they found not
   his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of
   angels, who said that he was alive. [Rationalists might see their own
   reflection in these two disciples, who suppressed the statement of the
   women that they had seen the Lord as too idle to be repeated, and told
   the least marvelous part of their story--that about the angels--as too
   visionary to be credited. Thus the renowned Renan held that the
   resurrection was a story or fabrication which grew out of the
   hallucination of Mary Magdalene. But these two men on the way to Emmaus
   had less use for feminine hallucinations than even M. Renan. But in the
   end they believed in the resurrection because they themselves had
   substantial evidence of it.] 24 And certain of them that were with us
   [Peter and John] went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women
   had said: but him they saw not. [The last clause unconsciously suggests
   the omitted fact that the women had professed to see Christ.] 25 And he
   said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that
   the prophets have spoken! 26 Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these
   things, and to enter into his glory? 27 And beginning from Moses and
   from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the
   things concerning himself. [The counsel of the Father revealed in the
   Scriptures shows that Jesus should enter into his glory through
   suffering. The books of Moses foretell Christ largely in types, such,
   as the passover, the rock in the wilderness, Abraham's sacrifice of
   Isaac, the day of atonement, etc., but the prophets show him forth in
   clear-cut predictions and descriptions. Jesus evidently applied both
   these divisions of Scripture to himself, making it plain to these two
   who were both thoughtless in mind and slow in heart. Those lacking in a
   knowledge of the Christology of the Old Testament are slow to believe
   in it. Those who know that Christology, and yet doubt the Old
   Testament, do so because they lack faith in the Christ therein
   portrayed.] 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were
   going: and he made as though he would go further. 29 And they
   constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and
   the day is now far spent. [They were loth to part with this delightful
   stranger who by his wonderful use of the Scriptures revived their
   failing faith and hope in Jesus.] And he went in to abide with them. 30
   And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took
   the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them. 31 And their
   eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their
   sight. [While he was breaking the bread to supply their bodies he
   opened their eyes and revealed to them that it was he also who had just
   been feeding their hungry hearts with the truth and consolation of the
   divine word.] 32 And they said one to another, Was not our heart
   burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to
   us the scriptures? [Thus they admit to each other that the joy of
   beholding the risen Lord was but the consummation of a joy already
   begun through a right understanding of the truth contained in
   Scripture. The sight of the Lord was sweeter because it was preceded by
   faith that he ought thus to rise.] 33 And they rose up that very hour,
   ^b 13 And they went away ^c and returned to Jerusalem [their news was
   too precious to keep. They could not sit still till the disciples in
   Jerusalem knew it], and found the eleven gathered together, and them
   that were with them [the women and some of the one hundred and
   twenty--Acts i. 15], 34 saying, The Lord is risen indeed [his
   resurrection is not an hallucination of the women], and hath ^f
   appeared to Cephas; { ^c Simon.} [Paul and Luke both mention this
   appearance, but we have none of the details of it.] 35 And they
   rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of
   them in the breaking of the bread. [This does not mean that they knew
   Jesus because of any peculiar way in which he broke the bread; it means
   that he was revealed at the time when he broke it.] ^b neither believed
   they them. [They now believed that Jesus had risen, but they did not
   believe that these two had walked and talked with him without
   recognizing him. [13] ]

   [13] * NOTE.--Here again we dissent. So general a statement of unbelief
   would not be used when there was a mere doubt as to some of the
   narrated details. We prefer in our original comment to this
   substitution, and it was this: Mark shows us that little dependence can
   be placed upon the apparently strong admission which Luke records.
   Unable to contradict the testimony of Peter, they said, "The Lord is
   risen indeed;" but their hearts were, nevertheless, full of doubt. Luke
   himself shows this in the next section, for these professedly believing
   apostles took Jesus for a spirit when they saw him.

CXXXVIII.

Fifth Appearance of Jesus.

(Jerusalem. Sunday Evening)

^B Mark XVI. 14; ^C Luke XXIV. 36-43; ^D John XX. 19-25.

   ^b 14 And afterward ^c as they spake these things [while the two from
   Emmaus were telling their story] , ^b he was manifested unto the eleven
   themselves as they sat at meat; ^d 19 When therefore it was evening, on
   that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where
   the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus ^c himself ^d came and
   stood in the midst, ^c of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
   37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
   beheld a spirit. [His entrance through a bolted door lent weight to
   their idea that he had no corporeal body. They knew nothing of the
   possibilities of a resurrected body.] ^b and he upbraided them with
   their unbelief and hardness of heart [here, as in the previous section,
   Jesus shows that the heart has much to do with the belief], because
   they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen. [They had
   had the testimony of three men and perhaps a half dozen women; they had
   not lacked evidence.] ^c 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?
   and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart? 39 See my hands and
   my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
   flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. 40 And when he had said this,
   he showed them his hands and his feet. ^d and his side. [These members
   not only showed that he was not a disembodied spirit, but they served
   to identify his body with that which they had seen crucified, and hence
   the person who now spoke was the Jesus whom they had known and lost.]
   ^c 41 And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said
   unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? 42 And they gave him a piece
   of a broiled fish. 43 And he took it, and ate before them. [Thus at
   last satisfying them that he was not a ghost.] ^d The disciples
   therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus therefore said to
   them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send
   I you. 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith
   unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit: 23 whose soever sins ye forgive,
   they are forgiven unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are
   retained. [Now that the apostles knew their Master, he repeats his
   blessing, and as the New Testament is now sealed in his blood according
   to the commission under which he came, he, in turn, commissions the
   twelve to go forth and proclaim its provisions. Symbolic of the baptism
   which they were to receive at Pentecost, he breathes upon them, and,
   having thus symbolically qualified them, he commissions them to forgive
   or retain sin, for this was the subject-matter of the New Testament.]
   24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus [see p. 244], was not
   with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said unto
   him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see
   in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I
   will not believe. [The apostles had undoubtedly seen and talked with
   someone, but the question was, Who? They said that it was Jesus, and
   Thomas, holding this to be impossible, thought that it must have been
   someone else whom they mistook for Jesus. But he would not be deceived;
   he would thoroughly examine the wounds, for these would identify Jesus
   beyond all doubt--if it were Jesus.]
     __________________________________________________________________

CXXXIX.

Sixth Appearance of Jesus.

(Sunday, One Week After the Resurrection.)

^D John XX. 26-31; ^E I. Cor. XV. 5.

   ^d 26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
   with them. ^f then he appeared to the twelve; ^d Jesus cometh, the
   doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
   [He came in the same manner and with the same salutation as formerly,
   giving Thomas a like opportunity for believing.] 27 Then saith he to
   Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach hither thy
   hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
   [Thomas had proposed an infallible test, and Jesus now cheerfully
   submits to it.] 28 Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my
   God. [We have here the first confession of Christ as God. It should be
   said in Thomas' favor that if his doubts were heaviest, his confession
   of faith was fullest. He had more doubts as to the resurrection because
   it meant more to him; it meant that Jesus was none other than God
   himself.] 29 Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast
   believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
   [Thus, while rejoicing in the belief of Thomas, Jesus pronounces a
   beatitude upon the countless numbers of believers in his resurrection,
   who are not witnesses of it.] 30 Many other signs therefore did Jesus
   in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:
   31 but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name. [This
   sounds like an ending to the Gospel, but it is like some of Paul's
   apparent but not real endings. Starting it with the proposition that
   Jesus, as the Word, was God, he comes here to the climax of Thomas'
   confession that Jesus is God, and the beatitude of Jesus upon those of
   a like faith. He then declares that he has written his book that men
   might have this faith, and the eternal life to which it leads.]
     __________________________________________________________________

CXL.

Seventh Appearance of Jesus.

(Sea of Galilee.)

^D John XXI. 1-25.

   ^d 1 After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples
   at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself on this wise. 2 There
   was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of
   Cana in Galilee [see p. 111], and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of
   his disciples. 3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. [As
   usual, Peter was the leader.] They say unto him, We also come with
   thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they
   took nothing. [These apostles, thinking that their apostleship had
   terminated, had returned to their old like as fishermen. [14] ] 4 But
   when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples
   knew not that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus therefore saith unto them,
   Children, have ye aught to eat? [Jesus does not use the affectionate
   teknia--"children," but the familiar and colloquial paidia--"boys." His
   question was like that of a stranger, or neighbor, who wished to buy
   fish.] They answered him, No. [Their brevity bespeaks their
   disappointment at having a purchaser, but nothing to sell him.] 6 And
   he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye
   shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it
   for the multitude of fishes. [The movements of large bodies of fish in
   the waters of Galilee are frequently visible to one standing on the
   shore. Supposing that the stranger thus saw fish upon the right side of
   the boat, the disciples readily obeyed his command, without suspecting
   who it was that gave it.] 7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved
   saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. [Even the wonderful draught of fishes
   did not at once arouse all the disciples to realize that a miracle had
   been wrought, and that Christ stood upon the shore. But John, having
   believed in the resurrection of Jesus even before he had seen the risen
   Lord, may rightly be presumed to have had a livelier expectation of
   meeting him in Galilee, and this expectation made him more alert for
   signs of the Lord's presence. During the night he had probably thought
   much of that other night when they took nothing, and of the day which
   followed and on which the Lord filled their nets for them. At any rate,
   the similarity of the two occasions now flashed through John's mind,
   and he recognized that it was Christ who had but now bade them cast the
   net.] So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat
   about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. [The
   arduous task of fishing had caused Peter to lay aside his upper
   garment; but as he prepares to meet the Lord he puts it on, moved by
   reverence and respect for the Master, though it encumbered him greatly
   in his efforts to swim.] 8 But the other disciples came in the little
   boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits
   off), dragging the net full of fishes. [The other disciples restrained
   their emotions, and attended to the duties of the hour. They were about
   a hundred yards from the land.] 9 So when they got out upon the land,
   they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. [The
   sight gave a new meaning to the Lord's question in verse 5; he had not
   come to buy, but to supply.] 10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the
   fish which ye have now taken. 11 Simon Peter therefore went up, and
   drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and
   three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent. [Peter,
   being already wet, could lend material assistance in bringing the net
   to shore. John tells us the exact number of the fishes to show the
   magnitude of the miracle, both as to the catch and as to the unbroken
   nets. The latter form a sharp contrast to the broken nets of Luke v. 6.
   Possibly when the hour approached when they would become fishers of
   men, Jesus meant to show them that a greater and fuller miraculous
   power would attend and bless their efforts.] 12 Jesus saith unto them,
   Come and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of
   him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. [It was not, as some
   suppose, because they stood in a new and special awe of him, that they
   durst not question him, but it was the nature of the question itself.
   They feared a mild rebuke like that once administered to Philip--John
   xiv. 9.] 13 Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and
   the fish likewise. [Thus he gave to them when he fed the multitude and
   thus it may be hundreds of times he had given to them when they sat at
   meat together--Luke xxii. 17-20; John xiii. 26.] 14 This is now the
   third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he
   was risen from the dead. [It was his seventh appearance, but his third
   appearance to a group of disciples, and the third appearance witnessed
   by John. John counts as follows: 1. An appearance to the apostles
   without Thomas; 2. an appearance to them with Thomas; 3. this
   appearance.] 15 So when they had broken their fast [after the eating of
   a meal together had calmed and quieted the excitement of the disciples,
   and made them susceptible of teaching], Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
   Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? [Jesus here means:
   Do you love me more than these fishes and this fishing business? [15] ]
   He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith
   unto him, Feed my lambs. 16 He saith to him again a second time, Simon,
   son of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
   that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep. [For if you love me
   [better than fishing, you are a fisherman no longer, but a shepherd.
   [16] ] 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest
   thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,
   Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things;
   thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
   [The Greek here has subtle shades of meaning which the English does not
   express. In the first two questions addressed to Peter our Lord uses
   the strong verb agapan, and Peter replies by the weaker verb philein.
   See p. 519. Peter, as we have seen, had professed the most unparalleled
   devotion for the Master, but when the Lord now asks him if he has that
   devotion, he humbly describes his love as of a far weaker order--a mere
   instinctive affection or strong attachment, but nothing approaching
   adoration. In his third question, Jesus drops the agapan and takes
   Peter's own word--philein: as if he said, "Peter, are you even sure
   that you have a high regard for me?" It grieved Peter to have the Lord
   thus apparently doubt that he had even a tender regard for him, and he
   appealed to Christ himself as a searcher of hearts to bear witness
   that, poor and meager as his love was, it was at least as intense as he
   had represented it to be. In response to each of Peter's professions of
   love Jesus lays a command on him, as if he had said, "If you love me as
   you say, prove it thus." These three commands also contain subtle
   linguistic distinctions which, however, are fairly represented by the
   English. Lambs and sheep are to be fed, and sheep are to be tended. The
   former means that young and old in the church are to be provided for,
   and, since the word "tends" mean to be shepherd unto, the latter may
   mean that Peter is to play the shepherd to the wandering and the
   erring, bringing them into the fold. Before leaving this scene, we
   should note that it has close relationship to other incidents in the
   life of Peter: 1. Jesus here calls him by the name by which he had
   first called him, noting the more honorable name which he had given
   him. 2. Jesus recalls Peter under circumstances very similar to his
   first call. Compare verses 1-14 with Luke v. 1-11. 3. In a group around
   a fire of coals Peter here thrice professes his love for Christ, thus
   revoking the threefold denial which he had made under similar
   circumstances--Luke xxii. 54-62.] 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
   When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
   wouldest [Peter had just shown this freedom by girding himself and
   plunging into the sea]: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch
   forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither
   thou wouldest not. [Thus our Lord, by delicate but unmistakable
   suggestion, shows Peter that the freedom which he now enjoyed would be
   taken from him, and that he would lift his hands to permit others to
   bind him that they might lead him to martyrdom to which his flesh
   (though not his spirit) would go unwillingly.] 19 Now this he spake,
   signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. [John, who
   wrote after Peter's death, tells us what the words of Christ meant. His
   words show that tradition is true in saying that Peter suffered
   martyrdom, but it is no voucher that tradition is true as to the time
   (about thirty-four years after this), place (Rome), or manner
   (crucified head downward) of Peter's death. There is certainly no
   trustworthy evidence that Peter was ever at Rome.] And when he had
   spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. [This saying bore the usual
   double sense in which Jesus employed it. Peter was to follow him now
   (and he did arise and follow), and he was also to follow Jesus to a
   violent death and a glorious immortality.] 20 Peter, turning about,
   seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved [John] following; who also leaned
   back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that
   betrayeth thee? [John xiii. 25.] 21 Peter therefore seeing him saith to
   Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? [Peter and John were near
   friends (Acts iii. 1), and understanding that the Lord had prophesied a
   violent death for himself, Peter was naturally interested in the fate
   of his dear companion.] 22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he
   tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. [It was none
   of Peter's business whether John's earthly lot was easier or harder
   than his own; his business was to be faithful in the pathway whither
   the Lord led him.] 23 This saying therefore went forth among the
   brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto
   him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come,
   what is that to thee? [Our Lord's words were a puzzle when John wrote
   his Gospel, and to many they are a puzzle still. For an able treatment
   of the various interpretations of this difficult passage, see B. W.
   Johnson's Commentary on John. There is no question that John died. The
   site of his grave at Ephesus was well known to early Christians. The
   coming of the Lord for which he tarried was that in the isle of Patmos,
   of which he tells us in the Book of Revelation. This passage,
   therefore, shows that John wrote his Gospel before his exile in
   Patmos.] 24 This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things,
   and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true. 25 And
   there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they
   should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would
   not contain the books that should be written. [Since the "we know"
   differs from the "he knoweth" of John xix. 35, most of the critics hold
   that this verse was added by the elders of Ephesus to whom John
   committed his Gospel, and that it is the attestation of the church
   there to the truth and authenticity of the Gospel. But the first person
   singular, "I suppose," of verse 25 is hard to account for such an
   hypothesis. Besides, none of the elders at Ephesus could suppose any
   such thing. Only an eye-witness who saw the fullness of our Lord's
   ministry would be led to pen these words. We find in the first Epistle
   of John a condition of affairs similar to these two verses. The first
   chapter opens with and continues to use the editorial plural, while the
   second chapter drops in the first person singular. We think, then, that
   John finished his own book. Considering the wilderness of literature
   which has accumulated around the sayings and doings of our Lord
   contained in the brief Gospels, it is little wonder that John thought a
   full record of the Lord's life would fill the world with books.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] * NOTE.--We can not agree in this. Jesus had said too many things
   indicating his future need of the apostles for them to think that he
   was through with them (Matt. xvi. 19; xxiv. 9-13; Luke xxii. 32; John
   xv. 16, 20, 27; xvi. 1-3). He had told the apostles to go to Galilee,
   and that he would appear to them there; they had done this and were
   waiting for his appearance. Peter, because of his denials, may have
   wavered in his loyalty, but the others surely did not. By going
   a-fishing they did not mean to abandon their apostleship; they were
   merely putting in the time, while they waited for developments; but by
   thus returning to their old occupation they were subjecting themselves
   to strong temptation (Luke ix. 62).--P. Y. P.

   [15] * NOTE.--Here again we dissent. See Hengstenberg, Alford, Meyer,
   etc. and especially Godet. Peter had boasted of a love toward Jesus
   superior to that of any of the other disciples (Matt. xxvi. 33; Mark
   xiv. 29; John xiii. 37), and by refusing to have Jesus wash his feet,
   by being the first to draw a sword in his Master's defense, and by even
   now conspicuously deserting the others to swim to meet Jesus, he had
   endeavored to prove his boast. Jesus therefore asks him if it is indeed
   true that his love is greater than that of his fellow-disciples--"Do
   you love me more than these love me?"--P. Y. P.

   [16] * NOTE.--Rather, "If you love me better than the others do, take
   the place which I have assigned you as chief servant of the
   flock"--Matt. xvi. 18, 19; Luke xxii. 26.--P. Y. P.

CXLI.

Eighth Appearance of Jesus.

(a Mountain in Galilee.)

^A Matt. XXVIII. 16, 17; ^E I Cor. XV. 6.

   ^a 16 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain
   where Jesus had appointed them. ^f 6 then he appeared to above five
   hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now,
   but some are fallen asleep; ^a 17 And when they saw him, they
   worshipped him; but some doubted. [Though Matthew speaks of only eleven
   being present at this appearance, yet as it was the oft-promised
   meeting by appointment and as the women and disciples generally shared
   in the promise (Matt. xxviii. 7-10), we have no doubt that it was the
   meeting mentioned by Paul the account of which we have here blended
   with Matthew. As to the doubts, we may explain them in three ways: 1.
   Among so large a number as five hundred some would likely be skeptical.
   2. It would take Jesus some time to draw near enough to all to convince
   each one of his identity. Some, therefore, would doubt until they were
   thus convinced by Jesus coming to them and speaking to them, as the
   first clause of the next section shows that he did. 3. Matthew records
   no other appearance to the apostles save this one, and it seems to us
   reasonable to think that he here notes the doubts of Thomas, and
   connects them with the appearance of Jesus generally. He could not well
   say "had doubted," for he records no other appearance where they had
   opportunity to doubt. The history of the eleven sustains this view, for
   there were no doubters among them at Pentecost. According to Paul, many
   of these brethren were still alive when he wrote his epistle to the
   Corinthians, which is commonly accepted to have been in the spring of
   a.d. 57.]

The Great Commission Given.

(Time and Place Same as Last Section.)

^A Matt. XXVIII. 18-20; ^B Mark XVI. 15-18; ^C Luke XXIV. 46, 47.

   ^a 18 And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority
   hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. ^b 15 And he said unto
   them, Go ye ^a therefore, ^b into all the world, and preach the gospel
   to the whole creation. ^a and make disciples of all the nations,
   baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Spirit: 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
   commanded you: ^b 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
   but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. ^c Thus it is written,
   that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third
   day; 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
   his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [The verses
   from Luke are taken from a later conversation, which will be handled in
   our [12]next section. They are inserted here because they are an
   indicative statement of the commission which Matthew and Mark give in
   the imperative, and a section professing to embrace the commission
   would be imperfect without them. The first word of the commission is
   significant, and should be remembered. We have no right to wait for
   sinners to come and hear the gospel; we must carry it to them. The
   "therefore" with which it opens shows that Jesus rests this command on
   his divine authority; but neither the word "power" nor the word
   "authority" adequately translated Christ's word. It means all the right
   of absolute authority, and all the force of absolute power. It is a
   most transcendent claim which Jesus utters here. All authority in
   heaven! Paul's qualification of these words, or their counterpart in
   Ps. viii. 6 (I. Cor. xv. 27, 28), magnifies instead of detracting from
   their wonderful import, for he deems its necessary to state that the
   Father himself is not subject to the Son. Surely in connection with
   this marvelous celestial power, his dominion over out tiny earth would
   not need to be mentioned if it were not that we, its inhabitants, are
   very limited in our conception of things, and require exceedingly plain
   statements. The command calls for the Christianizing of all nations. If
   we realized better that authority with which Christ prefaces his
   commission, the conquest of the nations in his name would seem to us a
   small matter indeed, and we should set about it expecting to witness
   its speedy accomplishment. The structure of the sentence in the
   original Greek shows that it is the disciples and not the nations who
   are to be baptized; according to the commission, therefore, one must be
   made a disciple before he can be baptized. Baptism brings us into
   divine relation to God. Being a part of the process of adoption, it is
   called a birth (John iii. 5). The baptized Christian bears the name
   into which he is baptized (Rom. ii. 24; Jas. ii. 7). Luke sums up the
   whole commission by recording the words of Christ, wherein he states
   that he suffered that it might be preached to all nations that if men
   would repent, God could now forgive (Rom. iii. 26). From Luke's record
   we also learn that the preaching of these glad tidings was to begin at
   Jerusalem.] ^b 17 And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in
   my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
   18 they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it
   shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they
   shall recover. [The Book of Acts gives examples of each one of these
   except the fourth, and though we have no record of a disciple escaping
   the effects of drinking poison, there is little doubt that in the many
   persecutions such cases did occur.] ^a and lo, I am with you always,
   even unto the end of the world. [This is a promise not of bare
   companionship, but of full sympathy and support (Isa. xliii. 2; Ex.
   xxxiii. 15; Josh. i. 5). The duration of this promise shows that it is
   intended for all disciples.]

Ninth and Tenth Appearances of Jesus.

(Jerusalem.)

^C Luke XXIV. 44-49; ^E Acts I. 3-8; ^F I. Cor. XV. 7.

   ^f 7 then he appeared to James [of this appearance also we have no
   details]; then to all the apostles; ^e 3 To whom he also showed himself
   alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the
   space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of
   God [this shows us that Jesus spoke many things at his appearances
   beside the brief words which are recorded] : 4 and, being assembled
   together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but
   to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me
   [John xiv. 16, 26; xv. 26]: 5 For John indeed baptized with water; but
   ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence. [This
   promised baptism came ten days later, at Pentecost.] ^c 44 And he said
   unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet
   with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in
   the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.
   [That is, these recent events are simply what I told you should come to
   pass according to the Scriptures, but ye did not understand. The
   phrase, "while I was yet," etc., shows that in the mind of Jesus, he
   was already parted from them, and his presence was the exception and
   not the rule.] 45 Then opened he their mind, that they might understand
   the scriptures [some think that this illumination was of a miraculous
   nature, and confound it with what the Lord is said to have done at John
   xx. 22, but the next verse suggests that he did it by discourse, just
   as he had done it already to the two on the way to Emmaus--Luke xxiv.
   27]; 46 and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ
   should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day [Both the
   written prophecy and the unwritten nature of things required that
   Christ should do as he had done. The saying forms an important
   credential for the Book of Jonah; where else have we the period of
   three days fixed as the time between our Lord's burial and
   resurrection?--Matt. xii. 38-40]; 47 and that repentance and remission
   of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning
   from Jerusalem. [See [13]previous section.] 48 Ye are witnesses of
   these things. 49 And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon
   you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on
   high. ^e 6 They [the apostles] therefore, when they were come together,
   asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to
   Israel? [Despite all that they had seen and heard, the apostles were
   still expecting that Jesus would revive the old Jewish kingdom, and
   have himself enthroned in Jerusalem as the heir and successor of
   David.] 7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or
   seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority. 8 But ye
   shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye
   shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria,
   and unto the uttermost part of the earth. [Jesus enlightens them as to
   their duty, and not as to the kingdom; Pentecost would make all clear
   as to the nature of Christ's rule and dominion.]

The Ascension.

(Olivet, Between Jerusalem and Bethany.)

^B Mark XVI. 19, 20; ^C Luke XXIV. 50-53; ^E Acts I. 9-12.

   ^b 19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, ^e 9 And
   when he had said these things, ^c he led them out until they were over
   against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 51 And
   it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them [it is
   significant that our Lord's gesture, when last seen of men, was one of
   blessing], and ^e as they were looking, he was taken { ^c carried ^b
   received} ^c up into heaven. ^a and a cloud received him out of their
   sight. ^b and [he] sat down at the right hand of God. ^c 52 And they
   worshipped him, ^e 10 And while they were looking stedfastly into
   heaven as he went, behold, two men [angels in human form] stood by them
   in white apparel; 11 who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
   looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into
   heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
   [Thus the angels add their testimony to the sureness of our Lord's
   promise that he will return.] 12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from
   the mount called Olivet, ^c with great joy; 53 and were continually in
   the temple, blessing God. ^b 20 And they went forth, and preached
   everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the
   signs that followed. Amen.

CXLV.

Our Lord Appears After His Ascension.

^F I. Cor. XV. 8.

   ^f 8 and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me
   also. [Since Paul reckons this among the bodily appearances of our
   Lord, we have included it in our work; but it borders upon those
   spiritual appearances which belong rather to apostolic history and may
   be classed with the vision of Stephen (Acts vii. 55) and John (Rev. i.
   9-17), to which it was near kin. Accounts of the appearance will be
   found in the ninth, twenty-second and twenty-sixth chapters of Acts.
   For completeness' sake we might also add the words of Jesus at Acts xx.
   35, viz.: It is more blessed to give than to receive. These words
   quoted by Paul are not found in the gospel. The earthly life of Jesus
   shades off into the celestial, but we think that he have now given all
   that may be rightly included in the former.]
