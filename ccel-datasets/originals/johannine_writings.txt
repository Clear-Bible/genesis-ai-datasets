PREFACE

   IN the German edition, the present work comprises three parts (8, 10,
   and 12) of the well-known "Religionsgeschichtliche Volksbücher." The
   present edition gathers these discussions of the Johannine (and
   incidentally of the Synoptic) problem into a single volume. It has the
   further advantage--through the kindness of Prof. Schmiedel--of
   incorporating many manuscript improvements in and additions to the
   German text. For instance--not to mention smaller additions--§§ 26 and
   27 in Pt. I. Chap. III. (pp. 130-136), the second and third paragraphs
   of § 13 in Pt. II. Chap. V. (pp. 255-257), and the second note in the
   Appendix (pp. 270-277) are entirely new. In fact, in this, as in other
   matters, Prof. Schmiedel has spared himself no trouble in order to lay
   the results of his studies in as complete a form as possible (having
   regard, of course, to the limitations imposed by a popular German
   series) before his English readers. In the List of Books at the end of
   the volume references will be found to some of the author's
   contributions to the "Encyclopaedia Biblica "which bear directly upon
   the subject under consideration. It is hoped that the present work will
   serve as an introduction, and in some respects as a supplement, to
   Prof. Schmiedel's famous "Encyclopaedia" articles.

  THE FOURTH GOSPEL IN COMPARISON WITH THE FIRST THREE GOSPELS.
     __________________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION.

   THOSE whose knowledge of the Life of Jesus has been acquired merely
   from Religious Instruction or from attendance at church services, or
   from a "Bible History" designed for use in schools, do not realise how
   much of it is based entirely upon the Fourth Gospel. If we did not
   possess this, we should know nothing at all about the marriage-feast at
   Cana, about the cure of the sick man who had lain for thirty-eight
   years by the Pool of Bethesda, about the gift of sight to the man who
   was born blind, about the raising of Lazarus, about the washing of the
   disciples' feet on the last evening of Jesus' life, and about the spear
   being thrust into the side of the crucified Lord. As regards the
   expulsion of the dealers and money-changers from the fore court of the
   Temple, our knowledge would be to the effect that it happened not at
   the beginning, but at the end, of Jesus' public ministry. Of Jesus'
   capture we should only have the report that it was effected by a band
   of armed men despatched by the Jewish authorities, not that it was
   carried out by the Roman soldiers. The day of Jesus' death would be
   known to us as the day after, not the day before, the evening on which
   the Jews ate the paschal lamb. In the case of the crucifixion of Jesus,
   we should know no more than that, of all his followers, only a number
   of women looked on from a distance; we should not be aware that his
   mother and his beloved disciple stood by the cross and received a
   message from his lips.

   These few observations are sufficient in themselves to give us pause to
   think. Why do the first three Evangelists tell us nothing of all that
   the Fourth is able to report? Did these things not come within the
   range of their experience? Yet at most of the events we have mentioned
   all those are reported to have been present who after wards became
   apostles; about the others also they must have received very soon
   afterwards quite definite information, and through them in due course,
   or through intermediaries, the authors of our Gospels. Or can it be
   that they had some reason for passing over the information in question?
   And yet how gladly would they have incorporated it in their books! This
   same information would surely have served the purpose which they had in
   view in the whole of their literary undertaking--that of making the
   figure of their Master shine forth in the brightest light--better
   almost than all that they have included in their narratives!

   Why then did they not introduce it? Did they really have no experience
   of these episodes, though not indeed because they did not happen? We
   cannot avoid the question. Nor can we dispose of it off-hand, either in
   the affirmative or in the negative, by a few considerations. Nothing
   but a general review of the differences between the Fourth Gospel and
   the first three will enable us to supply the answer. And, first, these
   differences must be determined without any prepossessions whatever in
   favour of one or the other story; secondly, attempts to reconcile the
   two accounts, in spite of their divergences, must be made and tested;
   and then only after such attempts have failed shall we be called upon
   to decide definitely which of the two is the more trustworthy.

   We say more trustworthy. The obvious thing to say would seem to be,
   Which account deserves to be trusted altogether? But that would not
   only be unwise for general reasons--because, for instance, an
   untrustworthy account is not always the necessary alternative to a
   thoroughly trustworthy one--but also because the matter is not really
   presented to us in this way. Should the scales turn in favour of the
   first three Gospels, we are still obliged to bear in mind continually
   such evidence as that produced by Wernle, for example, in the first
   number of this series (Religionsgeschichtliche Volksbücher), concerning
   the Sources for the Life of Jesus, which shows that none of these was
   composed by a man who saw Jesus' ministry with his own eyes, and that
   their trustworthiness is subject to considerable limitations. If the
   Fourth Gospel deserve preference, its author would certainly appear to
   have been an eyewitness of the work of Jesus. But even then the
   possibility arises--and those who accept this view fully avail
   themselves of it--that in his recollection of events much of his
   material became dislocated or was more or less seriously obscured.

   After comparing the Fourth Gospel with the first three as regards its
   trustworthiness, our study must advance to an ever wider investigation
   of its peculiar character, and must then bring to light its deeper
   roots in the conceptions and ideas prevailing at the time. Later, in
   Part II. of the present work, we shall have to come to some conclusion
   as to the author, and the time in which this book and the writings
   related to it--all supposed to have been written by the same Apostle
   John--were composed. Finally, we shall have to show the abiding value
   of these works. Thus, at first we have to enter upon an enumeration of
   those special points in which the Fourth Gospel differs from the other
   three. This enumeration might easily be thought a somewhat external
   matter. The task, however, cannot be avoided because it is of primary
   importance to find our general bearings. Only gradually can the special
   peculiarities of the book from higher points of view be summed up in
   such a way as to present consistent pictures. As regards each
   particular narrative of the Gospel, therefore, we cannot say at once
   all that is to be said about it. On the contrary, many narratives will
   come up for discussion in very many places, our purpose being to show
   at each stage of our inquiry some new phase which helps to elucidate
   the question under consideration.

   But, on the whole, we are concerned with nothing less than the
   question, What picture ought we ourselves to form of Jesus? The Fourth
   Gospel sketches the picture in a very pronounced and quite peculiar
   way, and no one can pass on without deciding for or against it. The
   main question with regard to this is whether its features accord with
   the figure of Jesus as he really existed upon earth, or whether such
   have been added as were derived from a different, and perhaps even a
   non-Christian, type of piety and view of the world. Here we have the
   reasons for including in the present series of books on the history of
   religion a particularly detailed, treatment of this remarkable book,
   which has already been called the most wonderful riddle--that is to
   say, the riddle most replete with what is inconceivable--of all the
   books of the New Testament.

   Turning now to our actual investigation, in accordance with general
   usage we shall gladly retain the name John (shortened to Jn.) to
   describe the author, just as in the case of the three other Evangelists
   we keep the names Matthew (Mt.), Mark (Mk.), Luke (Lk.). Strictly
   speaking, we should have always to put these names in quotation marks;
   but that would certainly prove wearisome. Mt., Mk., and Lk. have
   received in scientific theology the common name "Synoptics," because
   their gospels, in virtue of their far-reaching agreement, may be
   regarded or "viewed together" with one glance (Synopsis means "common
   view"). But even as regards this, it will be borne in mind that the
   agreement is by no means complete. Only on the whole, and only in
   comparison with Jn., is it apparent. Where it is found on a particular
   point, for the sake of simplicity we shall refer only to the Evangelist
   who gives what is presumably the most original form of a report, that
   is to say in most cases (though not always) Mk., as representing that
   which appears in all three Synoptics, Mt. being referred to mostly for
   those discourses of Jesus not preserved in Mk., or given by Mk. in a
   less original form. From Lk., therefore, for the most part, only such
   sections will be cited as are not found in Mk. and Mt.

   The parallel passages from the other Gospels, which we do not quote,
   will be found on the margin of most Bibles, either by the side of the
   verse itself which forms part of a discourse, or at the head of a
   section to which it belongs. In a more convenient form they may be seen
   at a glance in a "Synopsis," where they are always printed side by side
   (see the appended list of books). In addition, however, a copy of the
   New Testament will be indispensable, because, as one can easily
   understand, in a Synopsis the context in which a passage stands in the
   Gospel of which it forms part is not always clear.

   At the least, it seems to us to be a matter of urgent necessity that
   the reader should have a New Testament by his side. Nothing could be
   further from our wishes than that people should be prepared, or think
   themselves condemned, to believe our assertions without testing them.
   And yet it is not possible always to print the whole section of the
   Bible on which they are based.

   By inserting the number of the chapters and verses in the text of this
   book, we shall, we believe, be studying the reader's convenience better
   than by giving the references at the foot of the page or at the end of
   the work. Those who are not interested in them will not, we hope, allow
   themselves to be distracted by them or think that for their own
   convenience they should have been omitted altogether, but will be
   prepared to pass over them. There are some readers--and we hope they
   are many--who will wish to turn them up, and it may even happen that
   one of those who in the first instance has felt the numbers to be
   distracting will suddenly have to be included in the other class of
   readers. If we had done as he at first wished he would now find himself
   obliged to search rather helplessly in a Bible with which he is perhaps
   not very familiar.--An f. after a verse-number refers only to the
   following verse. [1]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] The headings to the subdivisions of chapters were added after the
   book was already in print, to make it more convenient for readers to
   use. Consequently, the first words of a new section often follow
   immediately upon the last words of the preceding section without any
   regard to the heading.

CHAPTER I.

  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST THREE GOSPELS AND THE FOURTH.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. DURATION OF JESUS MINISTRY.

   ONE of the first points on which one wishes to be clear, if one would
   obtain a general view of the stories of Jesus' life, is this--How long
   did Jesus' public ministry last? As regards this, Jn. gives us
   information which is quite clear. The expulsion of the dealers and
   money-changers from the fore-court of the Temple, which was only
   preceded by the presence of Jesus at the marriage feast at Cana in
   Galilee, took place when Jesus had gone up (ii. 13) to Jerusalem to
   keep the Passover feast, our Easter Festival. Shortly before a second
   Passover festival, in Galilee by the Lake of Gennesareth he fed the
   five thousand (vi. 4). At a third Passover feast (xi. 55; xii. 1; xiii.
   1) Jesus met his death. Between these there is mention of three other
   feasts. Between the first and second Passover, a "feast of the Jews,"
   which is not more closely identified (v. 1); between the second and
   third Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles in October (vii. 2), and the
   Feast of the Dedication of the Temple in December (x. 22). The
   references being so definite, it is quite unlikely that a Passover
   feast has been passed over. We may therefore calculate that the public
   ministry of Jesus lasted, according to Jn., somewhat over two years
   (not, as is commonly said, three years).

   The Synoptics, on the other hand, do not allow us to fix its duration.
   They know of no festival except that of the Passover on which Jesus
   died. The natural thing to do of course would be to supplement them on
   this point from Jn. But they tell us just as little of any one of the
   journeys which Jesus is supposed to have made at so many of these
   festivals. So that if we wished to bring them into agreement with Jn.,
   the effort to do so would give rise to a complaint all the more
   serious, that they are silent about such important matters. If we are
   bent on discovering, by means of a calculation which is quite
   uncertain, how long the public ministry of Jesus is supposed to have
   lasted, we shall hardly find that it lasted more than one year; in
   fact, a few months would perhaps suffice to cover all that the Gospels
   relate.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. SCENE OF JESUS' MINISTRY.

   We have already had to touch upon another main point in which the other
   Gospels differ from Jn. It affects the scene of Jesus' ministry.
   According to the Synoptics, Jesus did not come to Jerusalem or to
   Judaea at all--the most southern of the three parts of the Jewish land
   lying between the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan,
   which flows from the north to the south into the Dead Sea--until a few
   days before his death. Previously he stayed uninterruptedly in Galilee,
   the northernmost of these three parts. The shores of the Lake of
   Gennesareth are here the chief scene of his ministry. On one occasion
   he journeyed outside of the land far to the north-west into the regions
   of Tyre and Sidon and back to the east shore of the Sea of Galilee (Mk.
   vii. 24, 31); afterwards he went once to the other side of the northern
   boundary of Galilee into the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi (Mk.
   viii. 27). His journey to Jerusalem led him eastward of Jordan through
   Peraea (Mk. x. 1); Samaria, which lay west of this, midway between
   Galilee and Judaea, which would have been his nearest way, was avoided
   because an old feud had made the Samaritans unfriendly in their
   attitude towards the Jews, especially when these were making
   pilgrimages to Jerusalem (Lk. ix. 52 f., Jn. iv. 9).

   Nevertheless Lk., and he alone, does represent this journey as having
   been made through Samaria; in fact his account of it extends over nine
   whole chapters (ix. 51-xviii. 34). But he leads us to realise fully
   that he is not clear as to the facts of his story. Not very far from
   the end of it, for instance, he repeats (xvii. 11) that Jesus was on
   the way to Jerusalem, and adds that in the course of it he passed
   through the midst of Samaria and Galilee, whereas Galilee must have
   been left behind, if his purpose was to reach Jerusalem by way of
   Samaria. In xiii. 31 Jesus is warned against the snares of Herod
   Antipas, whose jurisdiction he had already avoided by leaving Galilee
   for Samaria. Further, on this journey Jesus is supposed on several
   occasions to have met Pharisees (xv. 2; xvii. 20), and is even said to
   have been invited to sit at meat with two of them (xi. 37; xiv. 1). But
   it is certain that no Pharisee could stay in Samaria, where he would
   come into daily contact with a people which did not observe the strict
   injunctions of the Jewish Law, and so would, of course, be continually
   defiled in such a way that no amount of washings and other observances
   would have availed to make him clean. Lk.'s story of Jesus journey
   through Samaria has therefore no claim to trustworthiness; it must be
   left entirely on one side.

   In Jn. then the most important thing is this, that Jesus real and
   abiding dwelling-place during his ministry is Judaea and especially
   Jerusalem. To Galilee he came only on rare occasions and only for a
   short time: in ii. 1-12 to Cana at the marriage-feast and to Capernaum,
   where however he remained "not many days"; in iv. 43-v. 1 to Cana
   again, as regards which visit only the cure of the son of the royal
   official from Capernaum is signalised as a (special) event; finally in
   vi. 1 Jesus crosses the Lake of Galilee without its being said how he
   came there from Judaea; he feeds the five thousand, on the following
   night walks across the Lake, on the ensuing day teaches the people; and
   soon after the Feast of Tabernacles is again near at hand (vii. 2), for
   which he goes to Jerusalem without returning to Galilee. In the case of
   the last journey but one to Galilee we learn also where, according to
   Jn., Jesus original home really was, "Jesus himself testified that a
   prophet has no honour in his own country; when then he came to Galilee,
   the Galileans received him kindly" (iv. 44 f.). What is here meant by
   Jesus country? Judaea is intended, just as certainly as in the
   Synoptics his father's town Nazareth in Galilee is; for it was in
   Nazareth, as every one knows from Mk. (vi. 4), Mt., and Lk., that he
   uttered this saying (the Greek word patrís means both father's land and
   father's town). In i. 45 f.; vii. 41 f., 52, it is true, Jn., like the
   Synoptics, presupposes that Galilee, especially Nazareth, is Jesus
   native place, but in spite of this, iv. 44 f. implies the contrary.
   Moreover, vii. 42 suggests that Jn. may have believed that at least the
   birth of Jesus took place in Bethlehem, and so in Judaea.

   As to the journeys northward from the Lake of Galilee, Jn. is entirely
   silent. Jesus comes to Peraea shortly before the last Passover
   according to Jn. also, but on this occasion not by the pilgrimage route
   from Galilee to Jerusalem, but from Jerusalem (x. 40), where he has
   stayed since the Feast of Tabernacles (vii. 2, 10), and so without
   break since October. But, besides this, according to Jn,, on the second
   excursion also which he makes from here to Galilee (not as in Lk. on
   the last journey to Jerusalem in the opposite direction), he comes to
   Samaria (iv. 1-4), and follows up the success which he has here with
   the woman at Jacob's Well and all the inhabitants of her town, by
   holding out the greatest expectations of extensive missionary work on
   the part of his disciples (iv. 35-38), though according to Mt. x. 5 he
   expressly forbids these same disciples to carry on mission work among
   the Samaritans. In short, a greater difference with regard to the scene
   of his ministry can hardly be imagined.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. THE CLASSES OP PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM JESUS MOVED.

   With whom then had Jesus to deal when he came forward to teach in
   public? In the Synoptics with the most different classes of people.
   Here we find crowds of people following him into the wilderness to
   listen to him for days together. The sick come and ask for healing,
   sometimes abashed like the woman with an issue of blood, who, with out
   being seen, hoped to be able to touch the hem of his garment (Mk. v.
   25-34), sometimes, like blind Bartimaeus at Jericho, crying aloud (Mk.
   x. 46-48). A rich man desires to learn from the Master what he must do
   in order to attain everlasting life (Mk. x. 17); a scribe wishes to
   know which is the most important commandment in the Law of Moses (Mk.
   xii. 28); another would like to follow him, but does not reflect that
   Jesus has no place where he can lay his head (Mt. viii. 19 f.); others
   again desire to follow him, but would first bury their fathers (Mt.
   viii. 21 f.) or take solemn farewell of their friends (Lk. ix. 61 f.);
   yet another has a legacy dispute with his brother, and Jesus is to
   settle it (Lk. xii. 13 f.); the chief tax-gatherer Zacchaeus climbs up
   a mulberry-tree in order to see Jesus as he passes by (Lk. xix. 1-10).
   Another tax-gatherer, who may have been called Levi (so Mk. ii. 14 -
   Lk. v. 27) or Matthew (so Mt. ix. 9), at the beck of Jesus leaves his
   business to follow him, and at the meal which he prepares afterwards we
   find Jesus in the midst of the tax-gatherers and their whole company,
   which was regarded as sinful, but which he so much cultivated that it
   came to be said, he is "a glutton and a wine-bibber, an associate of
   publicans and sinners" (Mt. xi. 19). It was at Levi's meal that the
   Pharisees and scribes, with long fringes to their garments (Mt. xxiii.
   5) in token of a singular piety, were present to find fault with Jesus,
   just as they opposed him everywhere else, raising objection in the name
   of the Law of Moses to his disciples plucking ears of corn on the
   Sabbath or to his doing work on the Sabbath by healing a sick man (Mk.
   ii. 23-iii. 6), or to his declaring that the sins of the paralytic man
   were forgiven (Mk. ii. 1-12). And he on his part is never tired of
   pronouncing against that hypocrisy and affectation of holiness of
   theirs through which they allow themselves to be surprised at prayer in
   the street, that they may keep their piety well in evidence, and at the
   same time consume the houses of widows and declare it to be a work well
   pleasing to God to give to the Temple something which is needed for the
   support of one's own poor parents (Mk. vii. 11-13; Mt. vi. 5 and chap.
   xxiii.). In return they try to set snares for him and by captious
   questions to entice from him an utterance on the strength of which
   proceedings may be taken against him. And the Sadducees, the
   aristocratic priestly party, which gave itself up to the joys of life,
   but held firmly to its position of authority and was relentless in
   matters of the law, also associated themselves with these efforts (Mk.
   xii. 18-27).

   Where is all this varied picture in Jn.? Only a few of its features
   confront us there. In Jn. also the Pharisees vigilantly enforce the
   command that the Sabbath shall not be profaned by any work (ix. 14-16).
   But what Jesus finds fault with in them, apart from this, is not their
   factitious holiness, but only their unwillingness to believe in him. In
   Jn. not only do the Scribes not appear, but--and this is far more
   important--the publicans and sinners, the poor and oppressed, are
   missing also. As the particular persons with whom Jesus had to do,
   apart from his disciples and the sick persons whom he healed, mention
   can be made only of his mother (at the marriage feast of Cana, ii.
   1-11, and at the cross, xix. 25-27), Nicodemus (iii. 1-21; vii. 50-52;
   xix. 39-42), the woman of Samaria (iv. 7-30), and Martha and Mary (at
   the raising of their brother Lazarus, xi. 1-44, and at the anointing of
   Jesus, xii. 1-8).

   For the rest, Jesus is confronted only by a single class of men, "the
   Jews." Over thirty times this expression recurs in the first eleven
   chapters. Of course in the Synoptics also they are all Jews with whom
   Jesus holds intercourse; but in them a distinction is actually made
   between Jews and Jews, which is not made here. Every thing remains
   indefinite. To the sick man who was healed at the Pool of Bethesda,
   "the Jews" say, "it is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to
   carry thy bed" (v. 10). After he has learned who healed him, he tells
   "the Jews," it was Jesus (v. 15). Was he not himself a Jew then? And
   was not Jesus also a Jew? The Gospel of Jn. is very liable to make us
   forget this. Jesus journeys to Jerusalem not for this and that feast,
   which since he was a child of his people was a festival for him also,
   but to "the feast of the Jews"; with the exception of the Feast of the
   Dedication of the Temple (x. 22) all the feasts mentioned in Jn. and
   referred to above (p. 9 f.) are described in this way. Jesus says to
   the Pharisees, and another time to "the Jews," "in your law it is
   written" (viii. 17; x. 34); for Jesus himself, then, this Law is not
   valid. We even read in vii. 11-13 that at Jerusalem "none spake openly
   about him for fear of the Jews." Here by the Jews cannot be meant the
   whole population, but only the authorities whose attitude was
   particularly hostile to Jesus. The strange expression indicates,
   however, that the same hostile feeling is imagined to prevail among the
   whole people.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. COURSE OF JESUS' MINISTRY.

   In accordance with this, as far as the course of Jesus' ministry is
   concerned it might now be expected to have a very speedy and a violent
   termination. In particular, it was the expulsion of the dealers from
   the fore-court of the Temple that, according to the account of the
   Synoptics, sealed Jesus fate. And, as a matter of fact, no officials
   could allow their sacred rights to be interfered with in this way
   without letting all authority slip out of their hands. But in Jn. the
   expulsion takes place at the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, and
   it happens with out bringing upon him any serious consequences. This is
   all the more remarkable since in this Gospel no difficulties seem to be
   felt at all when Jesus is represented as about to be taken prisoner
   without any clear legal grounds for the action. The High-priests and
   Pharisees only need to give their agents command to effect the capture
   (vii. 32). It is not effected, it is true. But why not? Their agents
   allow themselves to be withheld from obeying their instructions by the
   power of Jesus' words, and the authorities quietly abandon their object
   (vii. 45-49). We are told repeatedly that "they" (or "the Jews") sought
   to take him or to kill him (v. 18; vii. 1; viii. 37, 40; x. 31), but
   the result is always: "none laid hand upon him" (vii. 30), "he escaped
   from their hands" (x. 39), or when they wished to stone him, "he hid
   himself and escaped from the Temple place" (viii. 59). And the reason
   given is that "his hour was not yet come" (vii. 30; viii. 20).

   Now certainly it must not be overlooked that in the Synoptics also (Mk.
   iii. 6) the Pharisees with the party of Herod took counsel together how
   they might destroy Jesus after his first cure of a sick man on a
   Sabbath. On the whole, however, events run their course here in a much
   more intelligible way. Jesus comes forward in Galilee and finds
   favour--even an enthusiastic welcome--among the people for a whole
   period. The intervention of the Pharisees is powerless to check this.
   When Jesus leaves Jewish territory on the north, he does so expressly
   in order to escape the pressure now becoming too great (Mk. vii. 24).
   Only in the end does there come a time when he finds himself called
   upon to go up to Jerusalem, and there, by means of a solemn entry into
   the city, to force a decision of the question whether people would see
   in him the Saviour (Mk, xi. 1-11). The decision follows within few
   days, and is hastened chiefly by the expulsion of the dealers from the
   fore-court of the Temple.

   In the Fourth Gospel, on the other hand, although the circumstances
   urgently require an immediate settlement of the question, it is
   deferred again and again; and, finally the decision is caused by an
   event of which the Synoptics know nothing at all--by the raising of
   Lazarus. The greatest of all miracles leads the High Council, the
   highest authority among the Jewish people, to meet together and
   definitely contemplate Jesus' removal (xii. 47-53, 57). Thus the two
   accounts do not agree even to what really provided the occasion for the
   overthrow Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. JESUS' WORKS OF WONDER.

   As to the fact that Jesus worked miracles, it is true, they are all
   agreed. And it is only on the surface that the number, according to
   Jn.'s account, has to be thought of as somewhat limited. He, as a
   matter of fact, continually presupposes that it was large (ii. 23; iv.
   45; vi. 2; vii. 31; xi. 47; xii. 37; xx. 30), and in xx. 31 expressly
   says that he has only included a selection of them in his book. And yet
   it is significant that among these that class of miracles is not found
   which not only, according to the Synoptics, was the most common, but
   also (according to the general agreement of modern historians and
   theologians of every school) least deserves to be doubted--we mean the
   cure of so-called possessed persons or demoniacs, that is to say, of
   the mentally sick, a cure which is effected by physicians fairly often
   even in our own times.

   Next, it must certainly appear strange that the miracles reported in
   Jn. are often more marvellous in their character than those in the
   corresponding narratives of the Synoptics. Amongst the stories of cures
   in the Synoptics we do not hear of a man being healed by Jesus who had
   been ill for thirty-eight years; nor amongst the references to blind
   men, of sight being given to one who was born blind. The daughter of
   Jairus, according to Mk. v. 22-43, was raised very soon after her
   death; the young man at Nain, according to Lk. vii. 11-17, on the way
   to burial, which in the hot climate of Palestine took place on the very
   day of death, or, according to the story of Ananias and Sapphira in the
   Acts of the Apostles (v. 5 f., 10), immediately after death (cp. also
   Tobit viii. 10-16). To understand what a difference is implied when we
   are told that Lazarus was not resuscitated until the fourth day after
   his death, we must bear in mind the Jewish idea that the soul hovered
   about a dead body for three days after death and was ready to return to
   it. On the fourth day it finds the appearance of the dead person so
   completely altered that it forsakes it once and for all.

   It would also be a great mistake to suppose that the description of the
   walking on the Lake of Galilee is more easy to accept in Jn.'s account
   (vi. 16-21) than in that of the Synoptics (Mk. vi. 45-52), because it
   is supposed to admit of a perfectly natural explanation. Thus stress is
   laid on the fact that the Greek words, Jesus walked "upon the sea,"
   might also mean "by the sea," and it is assumed that the disciples with
   their boat, without noticing it, kept quite near the shore or had come
   near it again; Jesus passed close by the water's edge, and it was only
   the high waves that made it appear as if he walked upon the water. This
   conception is supposed to find further support in the concluding words
   (Jn. vi. 21), "they wished then to take him into the ship, and
   immediately the ship struck the land." On this view there is only one
   thing omitted, and that is the chief point we mean the four words which
   follow, "to which they steered." By this, as we are expressly told in
   vi. 11 is meant the opposite shore of the sea. The Evangelist,
   therefore, really emphasises the fact that Jesus walked across the
   whole sea and did not need to be taken into the boat, as in the
   Synoptics.

   Yet another view is suggested by the changing of the water into wine at
   the marriage-feast at Cana (Jn. ii. 1-11). This miracle is one which
   Jesus performed not on a man but on an inanimate object, and hardly any
   one can say that it was prompted by heartfelt compassion for suffering
   humanity. The Evangelist also assigns to it a quite different meaning:
   "this was the first sign which Jesus did and whereby he announced his
   majesty." Not every work of wonder is in itself a "sign" of this kind.
   Any one of them of course may be such a "sign," if its purpose is to
   accredit the divine power of the worker; and many works of wonder must
   necessarily be regarded as "signs" in this sense, because no other
   purpose can be recognised in them.

   Now the Synoptics also report certain works of wonder of this kind, for
   example the withering of the fig-tree after Jesus had cursed it (Mk.
   xi. 12-14, 20 f.), and we must certainly assume that other miracles of
   Jesus as well, works of wonder done from compassion, seemed to them to
   be "signs" quite as much as anything else. Nevertheless, the
   distinction still holds good that compassion as the ruling idea of the
   wonder-works of Jesus is in these as much in the foreground as it is in
   the background in Jn. The latter mentions not merely, as we have just
   noted, that the turning of the water into wine at Cana was the first
   miracle, but also says expressly that the healing of the son of the
   royal official of Capernaum was "the second sign which Jesus did in
   Galilee" (iv. 54); in fact he uses the word "sign" continually for
   Jesus' works of wonder, and in this Gospel Jesus emphasises the idea
   (v. 36; x. 25) that these "works," by which he means his works of
   wonder, are witnesses that he has been sent by God, and that though one
   refuses to believe his words, one must believe his "works" (x. 38; xiv.
   11).

   Now the view thus taken by Jn. is directly opposed to an utterance of
   Jesus preserved to us in the Synoptics. When the Pharisees wish to see
   a "sign" from him, he answers "there shall no sign be given unto this
   generation." So Mk. viii. 11-13. In Mt. (xii. 39; xvi. 4) and Lk. (xi.
   29) he adds "except the sign of the prophet Jonah." It almost seems as
   if this addition were in full contradiction with Mk.'s account. But
   appearances are deceptive. That is to say, by the "sign of Jonah" is
   meant something which is really no sign at all--in fact the contrary of
   a sign. This unusual mode of expression is very effective. An
   illustration will make this clear at once. Suppose that a conqueror
   suddenly invades a country, that the inhabitants send ambassadors to
   him and ask for credentials to justify his raid, and that he answers,
   "no credentials shall be given to you but the credentials of my sword."
   And the idea in Jesus' words about the sign of Jonah is really similar,
   for he says in continuation, "the people of Nineveh shall rise up in
   judgment with this generation (with which I have to deal), and shall
   condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a
   greater than Jonah is here "in my person (Mt. xii. 41). Here we are
   actually told in what the sign of Jonah consists: it is his preaching.
   And what Jesus has to offer--though in a more perfect form--is of
   course also preaching. He desires merely to preach, not to do "signs."
   Nor is this a principle which he sets before himself one day and
   ignores the next. The generation of the Pharisees was not unworthy one
   day and worthy the next to see a "sign" from him. Here then we have
   evidence of priceless value to show that Jesus declined on principle to
   do, not all works of wonder, but all such as might be supposed to serve
   the purpose of accrediting his exalted rank. And he must really have
   uttered these words, for none of all his recorders who believed that
   Jesus really did works of wonder with this intention would have
   invented them.

   In order to emphasise fully the importance of such passages, we
   describe them as foundation-pillars of a really scientific Life of
   Jesus. That is to say, every historian in whatever field he may work,
   in a story which shows that the author worshipped his hero, follows the
   principle of regarding as true anything that runs counter to this
   worship, because it cannot be due to invention. Since we possess
   several Gospels, we are in a position to note, in addition, how one or
   more of them will sometimes remodel, sometimes remove altogether,
   passages of this nature because they were too offensive to one who
   worshipped Jesus. In their original form, therefore, such passages show
   us most certainly how Jesus really lived and thought, that he did so in
   a way which we--though we fully recognise in him something divine--must
   describe as truly human. Secondly, if it were not for such passages we
   could not be sure that we may, to some extent at least, rely upon the
   Gospels in which they are found, that is to say upon the first three.
   If they were entirely wanting in them it would be difficult to reply to
   the claim that the Gospels nowhere present to us anything but the
   figure of a saint delineated on a background of gold, and that we
   cannot know how Jesus really lived and worked, nor perhaps whether he
   even lived at all. The foundation-pillars on which, in addition to that
   mentioned above, we may lean in our effort to gain a correct idea of
   the wonder works of Jesus, will be discussed on p. 41, and in Chap.
   III., §§ 18 and 19; the rest which are important for other sides of
   Jesus character, on pp. 24 f., 26 f., 27 f., 29 and 43.

   Naturally all that we find to be trustworthy in the Synoptics is by no
   means limited to these nine "foundation-pillars." It is one of the
   chief duties of a historian to show that the success which a great
   character has had in history can be understood from his words and
   works. But in the case of Jesus the success has been so great that even
   an inquirer who is quite sober in his attitude towards him must search
   out and accept as true everything that was calculated to establish his
   greatness and to make the worship which was offered to him by his
   contemporaries intelligible, provided that it is not in conflict with
   the picture of Jesus presented by the foundation- pillars, and does not
   for other reasons arouse in us doubts which are well founded.

   Coming back to Jesus' words about the "sign of Jonah," after what has
   already been said about it, it may be gathered how lacking in
   intelligence the man must have been who inserted, between the saying
   about the sign of Jonah and that about the people of Nineveh, the
   sentence "for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of
   the whale, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in
   the heart of the earth." Moreover, this insertion is found only in Mt.
   xii. 40, not in Mt. xvi., nor in Lk. and Mk. What then is meant? The
   day will come when the Pharisees shall see the miracle of Jesus
   resurrection. And then we are told further in Mt. that "the people of
   Nineveh . . . repented at the preaching of Jonah." Did Jonah preach to
   them about his coming forth from the belly of the fish? And if he had
   done so, could it have made much impression upon them? A miracle one
   wishes to see with one's own eyes, not merely to hear about. But,
   besides this, we are told quite correctly, in agreement with the Old
   Testament book which deals with Jonah, what it was that he preached to
   the people of Nineveh: it was repentance. Thus the idea introduced,
   that Jesus told the Pharisees they would one day see the miracle of his
   resurrection, is not appropriate here.

   Why do we spend so much time on this point which is not found at all in
   the Fourth Gospel? The reason is that in this too (ii. 18-22) Jesus is
   asked to show a "sign" (in proof that he has the right to drive the
   dealers from the fore-court of the Temple), and that he does not
   decline to do so as in the Synoptics, but points to his future
   resurrection, just as he does in the inappropriate insertion in Mt.;
   this event will prove his right to have driven the sellers--two years
   previously--from the Temple court.

   As regards the miracle at Cana we have still to note the rôle played in
   it by Jesus mother. Although down to this time Jesus has never worked a
   miracle (Jn. ii. 11), his mother foresees that he will do one, and says
   to the servants, even after she has been rebuked by Jesus, "whatsoever
   he shall command you, that do." How entirely different is the
   presentation of Mary in Mk.! Here (iii. 21 ) Jesus' friends go out to
   seize him because they think him mentally distraught. Who these friends
   are we are very soon told in Mk. (iii. 31-35); his mother and his
   brethren come and send some one to summon him from the house; and only
   their intention to withdraw him from his active work and banish him to
   his parents house will explain his gruff answer, "Who is my mother and
   my brethren? Whosoever doeth the will of God, he is my brother and
   sister and mother." We may take it for granted that when Mk. tells us
   of this intention, and of the idea that Jesus was mentally distraught,
   he was relying upon unimpeachable information. This is clear when we
   look into Mt. and Lk. They do not say a word about these two
   things--and why, unless it was because they dare not believe anything
   of the kind?--and give only Jesus' gruff answer, without of course
   reflecting what an unfavourable light is thrown upon Jesus, if it was
   not provoked by conduct on the part of his mother and his brethren
   which was quite intolerable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. THE GENERAL PICTURE OF JESUS.

   The conception which we have formed of Jesus as a worker of wonders
   will affect to an important extent the picture of him which is formed
   as a whole. Here again it will not be forgotten that the Synoptics
   agree with Jn. in sketching it with a grandeur which raises Jesus to a
   marked extent above the standard of what is human. Yet they report that
   he also, like others, was baptized by John. In the Fourth Gospel we
   look in vain for this information. Here we find only the later report
   of the Baptist, that lie saw the Holy Spirit coming down upon Jesus
   from heaven like a dove; and even this is supposed to have happened,
   not for the sake of Jesus, but only of the Baptist the purpose being
   that by this sign which God had already announced to him, he might be
   able to recognise in the person who stood before him the Son of God
   whom he did not already know (i. 32-34).

   In Jn. also the fact recorded by the Synoptics (Mt. iv. 1-11), that
   Jesus was tempted by the devil, is entirely omitted. And to this
   Evangelist the report in Mk. (x. 17 f.) and Lk., that Jesus, when a
   rich man said to him, "Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal
   life?" answered, "Why callest thou me good? None is good but God alone"
   would have been equally unacceptable. And yet without doubt this answer
   came from Jesus lips. How little any of those worshippers who noted
   down the records in the Gospels could have invented it is shown by Mt.
   In Mt. (xix. 16 f.) the rich man says, "Master, what good thing must I
   do in order to have eternal life?" And Jesus answers, "Why askest thou
   me concerning what is good? One is the good." How in this passage does
   Jesus come to add the last four words? Should he not, since he was
   questioned about the good, have continued, "one thing is the good"? And
   this would have been the only appropriate reply, not only in view of
   what precedes, but also on account of what follows, for Jesus says
   later, "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." Thus
   it is in the keeping of the commandments, Jesus thinks, that that good
   thing consists about which he was asked. How does Mt. get the words,
   "one is the good"? Simply by having before him, when he wrote, the
   language of Mk. Here we have a practical example of the way in which
   Mt. deliberately tried so to change this language at the beginning as
   to make it inoffensive, while at the end, in spite of his purpose, he
   left unchanged a few words of it which reveal to us what has happened
   and how it arose. But by removing in this way the words of Jesus to the
   effect that he did not deserve to be called good, Mt. has only
   anticipated the Fourth Gospel in which Jesus exclaims triumphantly
   (viii. 46), "Which of you convicteth me of sin? "

   In the Synoptics (Mk. xiv. 32-39) we are told that in the Garden of
   Gethsemane Jesus prayed insistently that the cup of death might pass
   from him. In Jn. we seek for this information in vain. The words about
   the cup, familiar to us from the Synoptics, are used by Jesus in Jn.
   also, but in the contrary sense, "the cup which the Father hath given
   me, shall I not drink it?" (xviii. 11). We find in a much earlier
   passage (xii. 27) the only thing that can be compared with the deep
   emotion of Jesus in Gethsemane. Several days before his death Jesus
   says here, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? "But no more
   unsuitable continuation could be imagined than the following words when
   they are mistranslated, "Father, deliver me from this hour." How can
   the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel think of asking the Father in heaven to
   deliver him from death? He actually gives up his life of his own accord
   (x. 17 f.). The sentence can therefore only be meant as a question:
   "What ought I to say? Ought I to say, Father, deliver me from this
   hour?'" This alone makes the following words also appropriate, "but for
   this cause came I unto this hour"; therefore I say, "Father, glorify
   thy name," by letting me go to my death. [2]

   Mk. (xv. 34) and Mt. at any rate have the saying of Jesus from the
   cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" In Jn., as well as
   in Lk., we fail to find it. And yet we may be quite certain that it was
   no more invented than the saying about the sign of Jonah. An indication
   of weakness in the Crucified Lord might be found in the saying in Jn.
   xix. 28, "I thirst," which, in turn, is not found in the Synoptics. But
   the author has been careful at the outset to exclude this
   interpretation. He says expressly that Jesus spoke the word in order
   that a prophecy of the Old Testament (Ps. xxii. 16) might be fulfilled;
   we are not therefore meant to suppose that Jesus was really thirsty.

   Furthermore, we read frequently in the Synoptics that Jesus prayed to
   his heavenly Father, and that he sought solitude for this purpose
   (e.g., Mk. i. 35). How Jn. thinks of Jesus as praying is clear when he
   is represented as standing before the open sepulchre of Lazarus (xi. 41
   f.) and saying, "Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. And I know
   that thou hearest me always; but because of the multitude which
   standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send
   me." From this it appears that Jesus did not need to pray for his own
   sake, but only for that of the people; and this he even explains to God
   in a prayer. Here that power of his to do wonders, with which we
   started, is first revealed in its fullest light.

   To this may now be added the continual examples of his omniscience.
   Nathanael, who has only just come to him, Jesus has already seen under
   the fig-tree before Philip called him to Jesus (i. 48). He did not
   trust himself to those who believed on him at the first Passover feast
   in Jerusalem, because he knew them all (ii. 24 f.). He was able to tell
   the woman of Samaria, that she had had five husbands, and that he whom
   she now had was not her husband, and she was obliged to admit on the
   strength of this that Jesus was a prophet (iv. 16-19). As regards
   Lazarus he received a message merely to the effect that he was sick.
   But Jesus knew that in the meantime he had died (xi. 3 f. 11-14; see p.
   32). He knew "from the beginning" that Judas Iscariot would betray him
   (vi. 64; xiii. 18), In the Synoptics, on the other hand, we find him
   expressly declaring that (Mk. xiii. 32) "of that day," that is to say,
   the day on which he would come down from heaven, in order to set up the
   Kingdom of God upon earth, "or of that hour knoweth no one, not even
   the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father"--another of the
   sayings which, we may be sure, none of his worshippers has invented.
   Lk. omits it altogether; Mt. (according to what is probably the
   original text) omits at least the all-important words "neither the
   Son."

   We may add further the continual examples of that inviolability of his,
   which we have already referred to (above, p. 17): they wished to seize
   him, but he suffered no harm. It will have become clear in the meantime
   that the expression which occurs here, "he hid himself" (viii. 59; also
   xii. 36), certainly cannot mean that Jesus concealed himself, but
   only--as his dignity would require--that he made himself invisible in a
   miraculous way, because "his hour had not yet come."

   When, however, his hour came, he gave himself up of his own accord.
   Once more we read that the soldiers could do him no harm; at his words.
   "It is I" whom ye seek, they go back and fall to the ground (500, if
   not 1000, Roman soldiers). Judas, since it was dark, according to the
   Synoptics (Mk. xiv 44 f.) requires to point him out first by kissing
   his hand; in Jn. he does not need to do so, he stands idly by (xviii.
   3-6). Jesus of his own accord, by dipping a morsel in the sop and
   giving it to Judas at the Last Supper, made the devil enter into him,
   and himself bade him hasten his evil deed (xiii. 26 f.) and of this
   again the Synoptics know nothing.

  7. GENUINE HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS IN JESUS?

   But, this being so, does the description of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel
   embody no genuinely human characteristics? It is significant that even
   those who still place this Gospel on a higher level than the other
   three would rather the picture of Jesus were not so like a God as it is
   in the description we have just given, following faithfully the real
   idea of the author But of all that they can point to, the only thing
   which is at all worthy of consideration is found in the words (xi. 35),
   "Jesus wept"--the occasion being when he came near to the grave of
   Lazarus. And the idea that we have here an instance of real human
   emotion on the part of Jesus seems, further, to be confirmed expressly
   by the following words: "The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved
   him.'" But this of itself is necessarily startling. We shall very soon
   (p. 44 f.) have to explain that what the Jews say in reply to a
   declaration by Jesus is in the Fourth Gospel regularly based upon a
   misunderstanding. But, further, the author has taken care to make it
   clear to every one who is at pains to understand him that the words of
   the Jews are shown by the context of the passage itself to be a
   misunderstanding. Before this it has been said (xi. 33): "When Jesus
   therefore saw Mary weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with
   her, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled." After the words of the
   Jews, "Behold, how he loved him," we are told further, "But some of
   them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of him that was
   blind, have caused that this man also should not die?'" Jesus, again
   groaning in his spirit, now goes to the grave. Why did he groan in this
   way? Now this second time we are clearly told, it was because the Jews
   who are here speaking did not think that his power to raise Lazarus was
   to be regarded as something which he possessed quite as a matter of
   course. But why should he have groaned the first time? Surely because
   of something of the same nature, that is to say, simply because Mary
   and the Jews wept instead of confidently expecting that the dead man
   would be raised by Jesus. And when we are told, in the interval, that
   he wept, it should not really be so difficult to see that his tears
   were not on account of the loss of his friend and the mourning of
   Lazarus' kinsfolk--he knew well enough that at the next moment both
   would be obliterated by the raising of Lazarus--but simply because they
   did not believe in his power to work miracles.

   Or if this cannot really be seen here, can it not be recognised even at
   the beginning of the narrative? If we were to read it aloud simply as
   far as the words in xi. 5 f., "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister,
   and Lazarus. When therefore he heard that he was sick," certainly every
   listener would expect us to proceed, "then he went to him immediately."
   Instead of this we actually find the words, "he abode at that time two
   days in the place where he was." Why? Unless we are willing to believe
   that he feared the snares of the Jews, against which his disciples warn
   him in xi. 8 two days later--he himself refusing to take warning--we
   can only say that this delay was to all appearances due to an
   indifference or inhumanity which is superior to all genuinely human
   feeling. But it would be quite unfair to make his conduct a subject of
   moral criticism. The author of the Gospel has taken care to show that
   we may not, as a matter of fact, expect to find any genuinely human
   feeling in the Jesus of his story. After two days have passed, Jesus
   says to his disciples openly (xi. 14 f.): "Lazarus is dead; and I am
   glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may
   believe." In what? This we have been told already, in xi. 4, where
   Jesus receives news of the illness of Lazarus: "This sickness is not
   unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be
   glorified thereby."

   The words at the beginning of this sentence mean, not that this
   sickness will not cause the death of Lazarus, but that it will not lead
   to his remaining dead, for, as the concluding words show, Jesus knew
   beforehand that he would raise Lazarus, and that the miracle would
   serve for his own glorification. And he could only effect this and
   exceed all other miracles if he allowed the fourth day to come before
   he arrived at the sepulchre, since only then could any return to life
   be considered out of the question (see p. 19). Here then we have the
   real reason why he delayed his journey for two days.

   In this case we can prove something more. Since the journey to Bethany
   takes at most two days, and Jesus did not arrive there until the fourth
   day after Lazarus' death, Lazarus was already dead by the time the
   messengers reached Jesus, and the Fourth Gospel presupposes that Jesus
   already knew this, by means of course of that omni science with which
   it supposes him to be endowed. The sorrow of the sisters, their longing
   for a word of comfort, their anxious waiting for one who might have
   arrived long ago--all this is nothing to him; he is only concerned
   about the miracle and his own glorification. Here we can see whether
   the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel has any human characteristics.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. DEVELOPMENT OF JESUS IN THE COURSE OF HIS WORK.

   In the character of Jesus as described by the Synoptics we are allowed
   to see further that he developed both in thought and action. It would
   of course be a very great mistake to suppose that they themselves were
   conscious of any such development or believed in it. But they at any
   rate make such statements as enable us, when we carefully examine them,
   to discover this truth. It is at a relatively late date that Jesus in
   these Gospels is recognised by his disciples to be the ardently
   hoped-for deliverer of his people, the God-sent inaugurator of the
   kingdom of God, the Saviour, to use a popular term, or, as the Jewish
   name "Messiah" and the Greek name "Christus" mean, the "Anointed" of
   God. They do not report it, that is to say until the public ministry of
   Jesus had continued for a fairly long time, not until after he had
   found occasion to withdraw for the second time beyond the northern
   boundary of Galilee (Mk. viii. 27-30). The confession which Peter now
   made in Caesarea Philippi, in the name of the other disciples as well,
   was, according to the Synoptics, one of the most important
   turning-points. According to Jn., Peter made the corresponding
   pronouncement (vi. 66-69), not on foreign territory, but at Capernaum
   (Jn. knowing nothing of the journey farther north); but--and this is
   the chief point--it is not represented as a new discovery and
   announcement and as made for the first time. In truth, it cannot be
   such, for in this Gospel John the Baptist already knows, when he sees
   Jesus approaching him for the first time, that he is the Lamb of God
   which taketh away the sins of the world, and that he has existed before
   him (i. 29 f.) And Andrew, after he has been a day with Jesus, and even
   before Jesus' public appearance, is able to say to his brother Peter,
   "we have found the Messiah" (i. 38-41).

   Next, in the Synoptics we find Jesus saying at one time that he has not
   come to destroy the Law of Moses, but only to fill it with its true
   import, and so to deepen it (Mt. v. 17) in a manner which is more
   precisely exemplified in Mt. v. 21 f. 27 f.; and at another time making
   such statements as, "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
   Sabbath" (Mk. ii. 27), or "whatsoever from without goeth into the man,
   it cannot defile him, but only evil thoughts which proceed out of the
   heart" (Mk. vii. 18-23). Such declarations as these brush aside the
   whole Law, if we think of the literal meaning of its particular
   precepts. There is hardly any other way of reconciling the two classes
   of utterance but to suppose that Jesus expressed himself in the one way
   at an earlier period, and in the other at a later date.

   Or when we read that Jesus went into foreign territory that he might
   remain unrecognised, and that at first he roughly repulsed the
   Phoenician woman who cried after him, beseeching him to heal her sick
   daughter, but after wards paid attention to her (Mk. vii. 24; Mt. xv.
   21-28), certainly the natural explanation is that at first he seriously
   meant what he said to her: that it would be wrong to take the
   bread--that is to say, the power to heal, with which he was
   endowed--from the children (of the chosen people) and to give it to the
   dogs, that is to say, to the Gentiles, to whom she also belonged. It
   was only the affecting and very appropriate retort of the anxious
   mother, "even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs,"
   that could convert him, if this version is correct, and so prepare him
   to alter all his ideas about the extension of his lifework to the
   Gentiles.

   Jn. does not give us the slightest clue to any such changes; Jesus in
   this Gospel suffers no alteration; he is the same from beginning to
   end.

  9. FORM OF JESUS DISCOURSES.

   The same contrast is seen again in a particularly clear way in Jesus'
   discourses. Here indeed the difference, as compared with the Synoptics,
   is perhaps most clearly marked. It is apparent even in the form. In the
   first three Gospels we have short, pithy utterances: "Blessed are the
   pure in heart, for they shall see God"; "ye have heard that it was said
   to those of old . . . but I say unto you . . ."; "they that are whole
   need not a physician, but they that are sick"; "what shall it profit a
   man if he gain the whole world and suffer loss of his own life" (Mt. v.
   8, 21 f.; Mk. ii. 17; viii. 36). We might go on quoting utterances of
   this kind almost without end. Even where the discourses are longer, as
   in the Sermon on the Mount, or on the occasion when he sent forth the
   disciples, or in his address to the Pharisees (Mt. v.-vii., x.,
   xxiii.), we can easily see that they are really compilations of such
   pithy utterances as these, each of which has a meaning and force of its
   own. In Jn. no more than a few of these utterances reappear. Everywhere
   else in this Gospel we find long spun-out discourses about certain
   thoughts, which, moreover, are repeated on the most varied occasions.
   In order to gain some idea of their style, read for instance Jn. iii.
   11-21; v. 19-47; viii. 12-59; or vi. 26-58.

   Jesus parables are special gems in his discourses. We never cease to be
   charmed by their vividness, the freshness of their colouring, and their
   appropriate application to the religious and moral problems of life,
   and we feel that they really must have been the best means of bringing
   eternal truths home to simple people in whom dwells half unconsciously
   so deep a desire for them. The Fourth Gospel does not contain a single
   parable. The only passage that approaches the parabolic form is that in
   which Jesus compares himself to a vine and his disciples to the
   branches (xv. 1-8); but this is only a figurative discourse, not a
   story in which some action is represented as going on before our eyes,
   such as that of the sower scattering seed or the shepherd going in
   search of his lost sheep. Elsewhere we have in Jn., besides this, only
   the instances in which Jesus calls himself the good shepherd and the
   door of the sheepfold (x. 11-16; x. 1-10). The first is as beautiful as
   the second is peculiar. Who can think of Jesus as the door? The thought
   is employed here for the purpose of distinguishing two classes of
   teacher: the shepherds who come to their sheep by entering the door,
   and robbers who climb in by another way. But how Jesus can here
   represent the door cannot be made clear, and much less when he is
   immediately afterwards compared (x. 11-16), not to the door, but to the
   good shepherd the good shepherd, by whom we have just been led to think
   (x. 2-5) some one else was intended.
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. SUBJECT OF JESUS' DISCOURSES.

   And with what do the discourses of Jesus deal? In the Synoptics almost
   exclusively with the question, What must one do to gain admittance into
   the Kingdom of God? And the answer to the question is well-nigh
   exhausted when it is summed up in the words, "Be pure in heart, love
   God and your neighbour, do God's will" (Mt. v. 8; xxii. 37-39; vii.
   21). According to the circumstances, and the persons to whom it was
   given, it took on different occasions the most varied forms; but the
   point was always that what is required is moral conduct based on the
   fear of God. This is so, even where Jesus speaks of his own person and
   says that one must follow him, one must listen to him (for instance, in
   Mt. x. 37-40). He does not say this for his own sake, but on account of
   those whom he wishes, by speaking thus, to lead into the right path,
   which of course no one knew so well as he. Words which go beyond this
   and require people to recognise his exalted nature, such as, "every one
   who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my
   Father which is in heaven" (Mt. x. 32 f.) play a quite subordinate
   part. Jesus speaks about himself very seldom.

   He does so all the more frequently in the Fourth Gospel. Here his
   person and its divine nature is almost the only subject of his
   discourses. Jesus' words to the sick man at Bethesda after his cure,
   "Sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee" (v. 14) are indeed spoken
   for the sufferer's sake; but the whole discourse which follows down to
   the end of the chapter serves to elaborate the thought, that Jesus has
   been sent by God and that God through his miracles, as well as through
   the prophecies found in the Old Testament, bears witness to Jesus as
   His son. It is true that we find again in this chapter something which
   is said on account of Jesus' hearers, "He that heareth my word, and
   believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life" (v. 24); but this word
   of Jesus to which they are to listen, according to the immediately
   preceding verse amounts to this, that all ought to honour the Son as
   they honour the Father in heaven. The man born blind is healed, but no
   word is said to him that might be helpful for the nurture of his
   soul--his only gain is this, that he learns step by step who it was
   that healed him; and this again, to say the least, subserves the
   purpose of Jesus glorification of himself. At the very beginning of the
   cure (ix. 5), Jesus calls himself the Light of the World. This thought,
   to which he has already given expression in viii. 12, is amplified
   throughout chapter viii., and here the discourse frequently harks back
   to what we have mentioned from chapter v., the idea that God bears
   witness to Jesus as His son. In chapter vi. (26-58), it is true that it
   is in the interest of Jesus' hearers when we are told that they are to
   receive the true bread of life, but the important point on which the
   whole discourse turns is this, that Jesus himself is this bread of
   life.

   And what are known as the Farewell-discourses of Jesus (chaps.
   xiii.-xvii.) are not at bottom different in character. They deal with
   the idea that, to help the followers of Jesus after his death, the Holy
   Spirit will come upon them, and guide them to the whole truth (xiv. 26;
   xvi. 13); but at least of equal importance is the other point, that it
   is not only God (so xiv, 16 f.), but also Jesus himself, who will send
   this Holy Spirit (xv. 26; xvi. 7), and even that he himself, regarded
   from another point of view, is this Holy Spirit (xiv. 18, identical
   with xiv. 17; also xiv. 28). Moreover, these chapters are full of
   sayings which expressly serve the purpose of Jesus own glorification:
   "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (xiv. 9, exactly as in xii.
   45); "all things whatsoever the Father hath are mine" (xvi. 15); "I
   came out from the Father, and am come into the world" (xvi. 28). It may
   be nothing more than external corroboration of this, but it is
   significant all the same, that in the discourses of Jesus in Jn. the
   word "my" occurs much more than twice as often as in Mt., and the word
   "I" more than six times as often.

   There is only one narrative in the Fourth Gospel in which the
   utterances of Jesus do not serve the purpose of his own glorification,
   but are spoken entirely for the sake of the persons with whom he is
   dealing; this is the story of the woman who was taken in adultery and
   brought to Jesus (vii. 53-viii. 11). "He that is without sin among you,
   let him first cast a stone at her"; and after her accusers have slunk
   away one after another, "Neither do I condemn thee; go thy way, from
   henceforth sin no more." These utterances read, in fact, as if Mk.,
   Mt., or Lk. lay open before us. But, apart from this, there is hardly a
   scholar who does not agree that this narrative was not found originally
   in the Gospel of Jn. It is missing in copies which were made as late as
   in the fourth century or still later, and many particular words are
   found in it for which elsewhere Jn. regularly uses quite different
   terms.
     __________________________________________________________________

  11. DEMANDS MADE BY JESUS IN His DISCOURSES.

   What demands does Jesus make of his hearers in those discourses which
   were really penned by the Fourth Evangelist? These can be expressed in
   a few words. "Believe in my person and its divine character." The man
   who was born blind, after he has been healed, gradually arrives at the
   conviction that he who has healed him must be a God fearing man, one
   who does God's will; he must be "from God," otherwise God would never
   have given him power to make a blind man see (ix. 31-33). But this
   alone is not sufficient. Jesus asks him afterwards: "Dost thou believe
   in the Son of Man?" And when he replies, "And who is he, Lord, that I
   may believe in him?" Jesus says, "He that speaketh with thee is he."
   And not until now is that point reached which was bound to be reached.
   The man exclaims, "Lord, I believe it," and offers worship to Jesus
   (ix. 38). On the other hand, the only reason for the enmity existing
   between Jesus and his many opponents is that they have no faith in him.
   They reproach him for ascribing to himself a rank which he does not
   possess, that is to say, for making himself equal to God by calling Him
   his Father in the sense that he came from Him as a man comes from his
   human father (v. 18); and he, on his side, reproaches them for having
   an evil will and refusing to recognise his divine origin (v. 40; viii.
   45 f.).

   In the Synoptics also Jesus requires faith. He says to Jairus on their
   way to his daughter, whose death has just been announced to him, "Fear
   not, only believe" (Mk. v. 36). But the faith referred to here and
   nearly everywhere else in these Gospels relates only to Jesus power of
   doing a saving act which will result in some one being restored to
   health. We have an example of this when it is said so often at the
   conclusion of a story of healing: "Thy faith hath saved thee" (Mk, v.
   34, &c.). This is something essentially different from the belief in
   Jn., that Jesus has come down from heaven to earth. In the Synoptics we
   might translate the word more appropriately "trust" instead of "faith,"
   whereas in the Fourth Gospel it is clear that this would be quite
   unsuitable. Moreover, according to the accounts in the Synoptics, Jesus
   hardly ever needs to ask for this trust in the way that he is
   continually obliged to in Jn.; it is offered to him spontaneously.

   We have in fact unimpeachable evidence to show that when it was not
   cherished spontaneously, he never thought of asking people for it. When
   he came forward publicly in his native town, Nazareth, people scorned
   him because they knew whose son and brother he was, and he had to
   experience the truth that a prophet has no honour in his own country.
   Now we are further told in Mk. (vi. 5 f.): "And he could there do no
   mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and
   healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief." He could not!
   Here again we have a report like that about the sign of Jonah (see p.
   21 f.). We may be quite sure that it would not have found a place in
   our Gospels, if it had not been made by one who had himself observed
   the fact, and been handed on without alteration. How unacceptable it
   must have been to those later chroniclers who were all, Mk. not
   excepted, convinced of the power of Jesus to work miracles, is shown by
   Mt., in which it reads thus (xiii. 58): "And he did not many mighty
   works there because of their unbelief."

   In the Synoptics, in yet another sense Jesus asks for faith, even if
   the word "faith" does not occur. According to our way of expressing it,
   it is faith that he asks for when he says, for instance, "Follow me,
   and I will make you fishers of men" (Mk. i. 17), or "Ye have heard that
   it was said to them of old . . . but I say to you . . ." (Mt. v. 21
   f.). But again the faith here meant is not, as in Jn., faith in the
   fact of Jesus descent from heaven, but simply confidence in his
   knowledge of the right way that leads to salvation.

   Quite different from the Synoptics then is the method of Jn. when he
   makes the person of Jesus and its divine origin the central feature in
   Jesus' discourses. The language agrees fairly well with theirs when the
   Fourth Gospel also represents Jesus as requiring people to hear his
   words and to keep them (viii. 31, 51; cp. Mt. vii. 24; xxiv. 35); but
   what he asks of people in these words of his is not, as in the
   Synoptics, moral conduct, but acceptance as true of his assurance that
   he has come from heaven. This acceptance is even described as "the work
   "required by God (vi. 29). It is not a question of the kingdom of God
   and the way to reach it, but of Jesus person and the acknowledgment of
   his exalted nature. On one point certainly all the Gospels agree--in
   saying that love is the highest commandment (Mk. xii. 30 f.; Jn. xiii.
   34 f.). The difference, however, is this, that, according to Jn., if
   love is not accompanied by this faith in the heavenly origin of Jesus,
   it can be of no value and can never be the path by which entrance is
   made into the kingdom of God. That is made quite clear by the saying of
   Jesus in Jn. (iii. 18): "He that believeth on him (the son of God) is
   not judged; he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he
   hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God."

   In Jn. therefore Jesus knows of nothing more important than his own
   person; do people believe in its divine origin or not?--the answer to
   this question decides whether men are to be saved or lost for time and
   eternity. In the Synoptics he knows of something higher. He says in Mt.
   xii. 31 f.: "All sins and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but
   blasphemy against the Spirit will not be for given. And whosoever shall
   speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but
   whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven
   him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come." Thus he
   regards his own person as subordinate to the Holy Spirit, or in other
   words to the sacred cause which he represents. And he must really have
   said this; for no one would have invented it. Indeed Mk., who in this
   passage (iii. 28 f.) by no means preserves the original language, has
   obviously changed it with a definite purpose. He has retained the
   phrase "Son of man," but no longer uses it in such a way as to mean
   that the person of Jesus suffers the blasphemy; he applies it, in the
   plural, to the persons who utter it: "All their sins shall be forgiven
   unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
   blaspheme; but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath
   never forgiveness."
     __________________________________________________________________

  12. MISUNDERSTANDINGS AS REGARDS JESUS' DISCOURSES.

   The large measure of uniformity in the discourses of Jesus in the
   Fourth Gospel means that these in themselves very soon reach their end.
   Nevertheless, some misunderstanding, on the part of his hearers, gives
   Jesus remarkably frequent occasion to prolong them. Sometimes indeed it
   is not surprising that his hearers do not understand him for example,
   when he tells them that he is the bread come down from heaven (vi. 41
   f.), that he will give them his flesh to eat (vi. 52), that Abraham has
   already seen him (viii. 56 f.), etc.

   In other passages, however, we are obliged to ask, on the contrary,
   whether the intelligence of his hearers could really have been so
   feeble. Nicodemus--to give a single instance--is said to have been a
   teacher in Israel (iii. 10), and yet he does not understand Jesus when
   he says, "whosoever is not born from above, cannot see the kingdom of
   God." He asks in astonishment, "How can a man be born when he is old?
   Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" (iii. 3
   f.).

   But perhaps we have not been fair to him. We have rendered the words of
   Jesus according to their real sense: from above, that is to say from
   God, must he be born, by God must he be destined and endowed, who is to
   have admittance into the kingdom of God. But the words admit of another
   translation: "If any one is not born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God." This is evidently the meaning which Nicodemus attaches to the
   words when he puts his counter-question, and this, at least externally,
   is not so senseless. Such ambiguity in Jesus language is no accident;
   it occurs again on very many occasions. When, as we have just
   mentioned, Jesus promises to give bread or meat to his hearers, on
   first thoughts and until we have realised that there is a deeper
   meaning in the words, we cannot help thinking that he really means
   ordinary food. It is the same with the water, which, as he sits by a
   well, Jesus promises to give the woman of Samaria, and of which he says
   that, after tasting it, she will never thirst again (iv. 13-15); and
   other instances occur frequently (e.g., iv. 31-34; vii. 33-36; viii.
   31-33; xi. 11-14; xii. 32-34). We see that it is a peculiarity of these
   discourses, that in them Jesus chooses an expression with more meanings
   than one, and thus intentionally provokes misunderstanding, in order
   that he may afterwards explain the matter more precisely.

   But at the same time another purpose is served. How can Philip, who has
   spent two years with Jesus, desire him to show him the heavenly Father
   (xiv. 8 f .)? This seems inconceivable even if he did not understand
   the words spoken by Jesus immediately before: "If ye had known me, ye
   would have known my father also; from henceforth ye know him, and have
   seen him." But we ourselves are perhaps surprised at the further
   statement which Jesus makes in reply to Philip's request, "Have I been
   so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? He that hath
   seen me hath seen the Father." We ourselves might still have thought
   perhaps that the recognition of the Father, as Philip may be supposed
   to have reached it from his acquaintance with Jesus, consisted in
   gaining a true idea of God's attributes, of His power, His wisdom, His
   goodness. Instead of this, however, Jesus thinks that we ought not to
   conceive of God here as a Being who has an existence independent of and
   separate from other beings, but ought to see Him presented to our
   objective vision in the person of Jesus himself. This in fact goes
   beyond all that we are accustomed to think we know about God. And so
   Philip's misunderstanding--as well as many others in Jn.--serves the
   further purpose of revealing in a particularly clear manner, on the one
   hand the lack of intelligence on the part of Jesus' hearers and even of
   his disciples, and on the other the infinite depth and unsuspected
   novelty of Jesus interpretations.

   That the lack of intelligence in Jesus' hearers and even in his
   disciples was not slight, is indicated often enough by the Synoptics
   also. On the other hand, their books do not suggest that Jesus teaching
   contained such unfathomable secrets, nor are they aware that he was so
   continually misunderstood, or that he himself provoked these
   misunderstandings by using expressions with more meanings than one.

CHAPTER II.

  ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THE FIRST THREE GOSPELS WITH THE FOURTH.

   WE might have shown many other differences between the Synoptics and
   Jn. But it will be better to notice them at a later stage. We shall
   therefore pause here to deal with a question which must have occurred
   to many of our readers long before this: Are the accounts in the four
   Gospels really so fundamentally different? Is there no way of
   reconciling them?
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. EARLIER ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THEM COMPLETELY.

   This question was quite urgent in the days when people felt obliged to
   cherish the belief that every letter in Holy Scripture was dictated by
   the Holy Spirit. In those days it had to be answered in the affirmative
   at any cost. And, as a matter of fact, the cost was not light--it did
   not involve merely effort and ingenuity, but meant giving up what seems
   obvious when the Bible is understood in a natural and unsophisticated
   way. And yet the attempt to establish complete harmony between the four
   Gospels (or, as was thought, simply the art of exhibiting this
   harmony), the nature of which suggested the name "Harmonics," was for
   many centuries one of the chief pursuits of theological science.

   Strictly speaking, there are only two courses open to us, If one and
   the same event seems to be reported in more Gospels than one, but in a
   more or less different way, we must either show that the difference in
   the statement is only apparent, or we must say that each account treats
   of a distinct event. The more seriously we regard the language, the
   more frequently will the second course be the one we shall have to
   take. Strict Harmonics, too, with quite special frequency arrives at
   this result by starting with the presupposition that each Evangelist
   not only tells us a story correct in every word, but also gives each
   particular event and utterance in the life of Jesus in its right order,
   though--and this could not be denied under any circumstances--he omits
   many things which are preserved in the other Gospels.

   Thus, for example, it was necessary to show in each of the first three
   Gospels at what point each of those journeys of Jesus to a feast
   reported only in Jn. could be fitted in. In Jesus' walking on the sea,
   Jn. (vi. 16-21), we are told, has not in mind the same event as the
   Synoptists have, for in the Synoptics Jesus is taken into the boat in
   the middle of the Lake (Mk. vi. 51), but in Jn. is not (see above, p.
   19 f .). Again, the Feeding of the Five Thousand reported by Jn. (vi.
   1-13) must be a different event from the Feeding spoken of by the
   Synoptics (Mk. vi. 35-44) for in all the Gospels we are told that such
   a feeding took place on the day preceding the night on which Jesus
   walked on the sea (with the exception of Lk. who does not report the
   walking on the sea). But how? It is not permissible even to regard the
   Feeding reported in all three Synoptics as one and the same event; for
   in Mt. (xiv. 21) those who are fed are more numerous--besides the 5000
   men there are women and children the number of whom is not given.
   Consequently, there are three Feedings instead of one, in which the
   number 5000 figures: one in Mk. = Lk., another in Mt., a third in Jn.
   On each occasion there are only five loaves and two fishes ^ on each
   occasion twelve baskets full of fragments are gathered up; each event
   is followed by a night-journey across the sea; yet each Evangelist
   relates only one of these three events, and Mk. and Mt., though each
   knows of another Feeding, do not report more than one of these three;
   but the two between them tell of a fourth and a fifth--one according to
   Mk. (viii. 1-9) in which 4000 men, and another according to Mt. (xv.
   32-38) in which 4000 men besides an indefinite number of women and
   children, were satisfied; but on both occasions this happens after the
   people have wandered about with Jesus for three days, on both occasions
   there are seven loaves and a few fishes, and on both occasions seven
   baskets full of fragments are gathered up afterwards.

   But enough! The perseverance with which people have pursued all these
   suggestions--which from the outset are such as we cannot accept--to
   their utmost limit, and have put faith in them out of respect for the
   Holy Spirit, who is supposed to have inspired every letter of the
   Bible, certainly deserves to be fully recognised. Only one question is
   forbidden. How often may Jesus be supposed to have been born, baptized,
   crucified, and raised from the dead?
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. MODERN ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THEM APPROXIMATELY.

   Present-day defenders of the trustworthiness of all the four Gospels
   are far more modest in the claims which they make. They quietly assume
   that one and the same event is meant, even where the accounts differ
   from one another rather widely; only they would rather not concede too
   much, and so they try as far as possible to represent the differences
   as being only slight. Naturally it is right for us always to test
   whether these are really as great as they seem at first sight to be.
   Where, however, this attempt is vain unless we seriously misinterpret
   the language, it is not only unfair, but is also nothing better than
   illogical. For if we are obliged to admit, and actually do admit, that
   there are many contradictions in the Bible, there is no point in
   insisting in the case of a limited number of these, that they are not
   really contradictions. If we admit--since Jesus was taken captive only
   on one occasion--that according to the Synoptics Judas betrayed him by
   a kiss, and according to Jn. did not betray him in this way (xviii.
   4-6), what is the use, when we turn to the expulsion of the dealers
   from the fore-court of the Temple, of denying that either the
   Synoptists or Jn. must have made a mistake, and of preferring to
   suppose that there were two such acts, one at the beginning of his
   ministry (Jn. ii. 13-22), the other at the end of it (Mk. xi. 15-18)?
   If this were so, why did Jesus omit to drive the dealers and
   money-changers from the temple court on his other visits to Jerusalem
   as well? Are we to suppose that they were not stationed there on these
   occasions? And why on the first occasion did he escape scot free,
   whereas on the second he suffered death in consequence?

  3. USE OF THE SYNOPTICS BY JN.

   We may set aside such palpably impossible attempts to deny that there
   are contradictions between the Synoptics and Jn., and give attention to
   such as are really worth discussing. But before we do this, it should
   be said that it is almost universally agreed that the author of the
   Fourth Gospel had the other three before him when he wrote.

   To prove this we are not of course at liberty to cite at our pleasure
   all kinds of things in which Jn. agrees with them, for these he might
   himself have noted as an eye witness. We must specify passages which he
   would not certainly have written, if he had not derived them from the
   Synoptics. Thus, for example, it is very remarkable that Jesus ascends
   the mountain before the Feeding of the Five Thousand (Jn. vi. 3) and
   ascends the mountain after it (vi. 15), though we have not been told in
   the meantime that he came down, or been given any clue that would lead
   us to conjecture that he did so. The matter admits of a simple
   explanation: when the author was about to relate the beginning of the
   Feeding, he had before him the beginning of the second Feeding in Mt.
   (xv. 29), "and he went up into the mountain and sat there." He tells us
   almost word for word: "And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there
   he sat with his disciples." At the second place, however, when he was
   about to pass from the Feeding to Jesus' walking on the sea (vi. 15) he
   remembered that Mk. and Mt., in their first story of the Feeding, said
   that between the two acts Jesus ascended the mountain (his language
   agrees very closely with Mt. xiv. 23), and so he added this and
   overlooked the fact that he had said nothing about Jesus coming down.
   For another example see xx. 2 (chap. iii., 26). In i. 15, in the words,
   "This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before
   me,'" the Baptist actually recalls something he has said about Jesus at
   an earlier date, but which is not found in the Fourth Gospel but only
   in the Synoptics Mt. iii. 11), though there the language and meaning
   are different.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. Is JN.'S PURPOSE SIMPLY TO SUPPLEMENT AND CORRECT?

   But why does Jn. differ so often from the Synoptics, if he was
   acquainted with their books? The most important attempt to explain this
   consists in saying that his purpose throughout his book is to
   supplement the story of his predecessors and, where in small matters
   this was inexact, to correct it. This theory therefore presupposes
   further that he was himself present at the events described, and was
   entitled to think that wherever he made additions and corrections he
   was justified in doing so. Whether this is confirmed is a question we
   shall soon have to investigate more closely. We leave it for the
   present and simply ask, Can this double purpose, which is ascribed to
   him, be discovered at all in his book? As regards this intention to
   make corrections, it is certainly not easy to recognise it, for the
   author nowhere says: the matter was not thus, but thus. If then he made
   corrections, he must have made them quite quietly out of respect for
   his predecessors.

   We prefer, therefore, in the first instance, to consider the question:
   Does he wish merely to give facts which are supplementary? In the case
   of the narratives which are peculiar to him, this would be conceivable,
   as well as in the case of the expulsion of the dealers from the
   fore-court of the Temple, if such an event really took place at the
   beginning of Jesus' ministry. But in Jn. we find again a number of
   stories given by the Synoptics, in which the idea cannot possibly be
   that the events happened a second time, and not merely on one occasion
   as the Synoptics state. We need only mention the Feeding of the Five
   Thousand, the walking on the sea and the entrance into Jerusalem (vi.
   1-15, 16-21; xii. 12-16). It might really be thought in the case of the
   second of these stories that the idea of correcting was the ruling
   purpose; Jn., in opposition to the story of the Synoptics which says
   that Jesus was taken into the boat in the middle of the sea, wishes, as
   an eye witness, to insist that this was not so, since Jesus crossed the
   lake from one shore to the other. But it is really hard to discover
   what correction he means to make in his description of the entry into
   Jerusalem, or, in particular, in that of the Feeding of the Five
   Thousand; and this is sufficient to show that the whole idea that Jn.'s
   purpose is always either to supplement or correct is untenable. If, on
   the other hand, certain concessions are made, and it is claimed that he
   only meant to do this now arid then, the whole explanation of the
   passages in which he differs from the Synoptics would have no value;
   for in the case of a considerable number of sections in his book the
   question why he introduced them would still be left unexplained.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. JN.'S PURPOSE NOT MERELY TO SUPPLEMENT AND CORRECT.

   But let us see rather more exactly how in detail people think of the
   author as carrying out his purpose of supplementing and correcting the
   Synoptics. Here special importance may be attached to his statement
   that some time after Jesus' public appearance John the Baptist was
   still baptizing and that Jesus was doing so too, and to the addition,
   "for John was not yet imprisoned" (iii. 22-24). In the Synoptics (Mk.
   i. 14), Jesus does not come forward publicly until after the
   imprisonment of the Baptist. Consequently the remark in Jn. which
   contradicts this might easily be due in this instance to his purpose of
   making a correction. If this were so, Jn. is aware, as the Synoptics
   are not, that Jesus started a public mission while the Baptist was
   still at work. And here we should have the explanation of the fact that
   he adds so much which these omit: all this really happened before the
   arrest of the Baptist, with which in the Synoptics the story of Jesus
   work begins.

   All? Strictly speaking, as a matter of fact, everything that Jn.
   reports; for he never mentions a point at which the Baptist was
   imprisoned. But this view of the matter would be quite impossible; for
   in the expression "not yet taken" Jn. betrays the fact that he knew
   very well of the arrest of the Baptist, and thinks of it as happening
   during the public ministry of Jesus. But when? Before v. 35 ("he was
   the lamp") and certainly before the Feeding of the Five Thousand and
   Jesus' walking on the sea (Jn. vi. 1-21), of which the Synoptics do not
   speak until long after the imprisonment of the Baptist--unless we were
   to adopt the quite untenable assumption (see p. 48) that Jn. in these
   two stories is thinking of two events quite different from those the
   Synoptics have in mind. But we find afterwards in Jn. (chap. vii.-xi.)
   Jesus appearing in Jerusalem at the Feast of Tabernacles, the cure of
   the man born blind, Jesus appearing at the Feast of the Dedication of
   the Temple, and the raising of Lazarus--all things about which the
   Synoptics say nothing, and which, nevertheless, are so extremely
   important, that their silence about them is quite inexplicable. In all
   these cases it does not help us at all to be told that Jn. merely
   wished to supply facts as to what happened before the imprisonment of
   the Baptist.

   At the best, therefore, the assumption could be used for the events
   which Jn. narrates in chapters ii.-v. But before we adopt it, we shall
   do well once more to examine closely the passage on which it is based.
   "Jesus baptized," we are told in Jn. iii. 22 (26; iv. 1). And in iv. 2
   we read "and yet Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples." What
   would a writer, who was anxious to report nothing false, have done when
   he noticed afterwards that this had happened? We may be sure that he
   would afterwards have deleted the error in the earlier passage, instead
   of allowing it to stand and appending the confession that he had made a
   mistake. Here we can see the peculiar character of the Fourth
   Evangelist. He is not an author who is anxious to report nothing false;
   where it suits his purpose, he reports it.

   And here in fact it suits his purpose very well. It is only the
   statement, that Jesus baptized, and did so while John was still at
   work, that enables him to represent the interesting situation in which
   the number of the followers of the Baptist is becoming smaller and
   smaller, and that of the followers of Jesus growing larger and larger.
   And this is one of Jn.'s chief aims. "He must increase, but I must
   decrease" (iii. 30): with these words the Baptist himself is made to
   write the legend to this little picture, which is really sketched very
   gracefully. In order to do so, the author adds a touch which, in
   reality, as he himself knows, does not at all harmonise with the truth.

   Only one? Of course the picture includes that other feature we have
   mentioned; John the Baptist is still at large. Must we see in this a
   correct addition, a correction made by an eye-witness when the same
   "eye-witness" in another verse not far off has told us with equal
   precision something which on his own admission is not true? Must we
   base upon this our idea of the purpose of correction which he followed
   throughout his book? A different idea of his purpose has resulted, with
   an incomparably greater amount of probability, from this very example;
   he wishes to be not a reporter who is to be taken at his word, but a
   painter; a painter of vivid scenes designed to make clear and
   impressive a higher truth--in the present instance the truth that John
   was only the forerunner of Jesus, and had to take an entirely
   subordinate place, in fact does so of his own free will. And if we now
   ask again, how long the Evangelist imagines the Baptist to be still at
   large while Jesus is at work, the only answer can be: merely for this
   particular scene, and not for those that follow. Once his retirement
   before Jesus has been described, the Baptist is so unimportant to Jn.
   that he does not think his arrest worth reporting. Indeed, even in the
   case of preceding events (the marriage at Cana, the expulsion of the
   dealers from the fore-court of the Temple, the conversation with
   Nicodemus), he seems to have hardly thought that they occurred while
   the Baptist was still at large.

   But the theory that Jn. wishes to supplement the Synoptics by giving
   the earliest events in the public life of Jesus is overthrown by what
   we are told as regards the discourses of Jesus, when it is presupposed
   that these also served the purpose of supplementing the Synoptics. If
   Jesus be supposed to have spoken in both ways--as he is represented as
   doing in the Synoptics and as Jn. makes him do--it cannot be imagined
   that the style met with in Jn. was the earlier. We are told on the
   contrary that Jn. preserves the manner of speech in which Jesus
   addressed his disciples in his last days, after he had finished his
   ministry amongst the people, which latter is reflected in his
   discourses in the Synoptics. This statement might seem worth
   considering if the discourses of Jesus preserved to us in Jn. were
   solely farewell ad dresses to his disciples during his last days, like
   those in chapters xiii.-xvii. But, as a matter of fact, Jn. represents
   Jesus as speaking from the very beginning in the same style as in these
   farewell discourses. To sum up, in the events which he describes, Jn.
   is supposed to take us back to the earliest days, and in the discourses
   which Jesus delivered at these, the earliest events in his public
   career, this same author Jn. is supposed to preserve the tone in which
   Jesus spoke during the last weeks of his life. Both assumptions are
   necessary if we are to insist that Jn. wishes to supplement and correct
   the Synoptics. And yet one of the two assumptions annuls the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. ARE SEVERAL JOURNEYS OF JESUS TO JERUSALEM PRESUPPOSED IN MT. xxiii. 37?

   But an attempt is made in another way to show that Jn. could not really
   be in conflict with his predecessors. Those who make it find in the
   Synoptics themselves passages here and there which confirm, as they
   think, the story of Jn. In particular, several journeys of Jesus to
   Jerusalem, connected with a public appearance there, are, they say,
   presupposed when Jesus says in Mt. (xxiii. 37): "Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
   that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee,
   how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen
   gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not." The
   inference really appears to be unavoidable. The only remarkable thing
   is that the Synoptists themselves have not drawn it. If they themselves
   really suggest that Jesus came forward so often in Jerusalem, why do
   they not only tell us nothing about this, but represent things as if
   when he made this utterance he had come to Jerusalem for the first time
   to counsel and admonish. Thus those who refer to this utterance as a
   corroboration of the story of Jn. are producing a greater puzzle as
   regards the Synoptists, who likewise claim that their story has a right
   to be regarded as correct. So that before we attach such great
   importance to the utterance in question, we prefer to examine it again
   more closely.

   When we do this, it is clear in the very first instance that it does
   not read as people think it does, and in the way in which we have
   rendered it above, intentionally following the general practice, in
   order to show what mistakes one is liable to make when one follows a
   popular custom. In reality--and in Lk. (xiii. 34) exactly as in Mt.--it
   reads: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones them
   that are sent unto her, how often would I have gathered thy children,"
   &c. Jerusalem is therefore apostrophised only in the second half of the
   sentence; in the first something is said about the city without the
   city itself being addressed. No one who has a thought clearly in his
   mind, and intends to write it down in an equally simple sentence, would
   express himself in this way.

   On the other hand, the remarkable form of the sentence would be quite
   intelligible if our Evangelists, Mt. and Lk., or rather the earlier
   writer from whom they both draw, [3] used a book in which the sentence
   about Jerusalem appeared without any apostrophe; and if they or he
   proceeded to introduce the apostrophe without noticing that, having
   made this alteration, the sentence should have been made to read
   differently at the beginning. And this is not a mere conjecture; we
   have, in addition, a clue which indicates the kind of book it may have
   been. In Mt., that is to say, the utterance immediately follows another
   (xxiii. 34-36) to this effect: "Therefore, behold, I send unto you
   prophets, and wise men, and scribes; some of them shall ye kill and
   crucify, and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and
   persecute from city to city," &c. Lk. gives this utterance in xi.
   49-51, keeping the continuation about Jerusalem--quoted above--for
   chap. xiii. of his book. But this earlier utterance in Lk. not only
   dispenses with the apostrophe, as the beginning of the continuation
   about Jerusalem does--"I will send unto them prophets and apostles, and
   some of them they shall kill and persecute," &c.--but--and this is the
   chief point it is preceded by the introductory words: u There fore also
   said the wisdom of God."

   The Wisdom of God is represented in several books of the Old Testament
   as a person who takes up the word (Prov. viii. f., Ecclus. xxiv.), or
   is found as the title of a book (Wisdom of Solomon; Wisdom of Jesus,
   son of Sirach). The saying under consideration is not found in any of
   these books. But it is clear that it cannot have been framed for the
   first time by Jesus. In what precedes Jesus is addressing the
   Pharisees. He could not, therefore, as he does in Lk., suddenly
   continue, "therefore also said the wisdom of God," unless what now
   follows is a saying which was already well known. But this is clear
   from the version in Mt. as well, though here the introductory formula
   is wanting. Jesus cannot have said of himself, as Mt. makes him say, "I
   send to you prophets and wise men and Scribes," for he never did this,
   and at least would never have sent Scribes, whose attitude towards him
   was so unfriendly. Lk. knew very well what he was doing, when he
   substituted "Prophets and Apostles"; for Jesus could really send
   Apostles and (New Testament) Prophets. In this description of the
   persons sent, Mt. therefore has, we may be sure, preserved the more
   original version, but in the introductory formula it is Lk. who has
   done so. In Mt. the only remaining clue to the fact that his
   predecessor had before him a book in which this introductory formula
   stood is the word "therefore."

   But what kind of book was it? If the Scribes were mentioned amongst
   those men who were sent by God to the people, it was the work of a
   pious Jew who reproached his people for being stiff-necked, and was
   anxious to induce them to repent. Whether it had the title
   "Wisdom"--perhaps with some addition--or whether Wisdom was simply
   represented as speaking in it, we do not know. From this book,
   according to the story of the predecessor of our Mt. and Lk., Jesus
   quoted a passage in support of his own words in which he warned the
   Pharisees that they would be punished. In this way it is still used in
   Lk. Mt., on the other hand, has wrongly understood it and introduced it
   in such a way that Jesus uses the words as his own, and Lk. also, as
   regards the utterance about Jerusalem, shares the misunderstanding.
   Thus it was the Wisdom of God which said that it had often wished to
   gather together Jerusalem's children, as a hen gathers her chickens.
   This it had actually done by sending prophets and wise men and Scribes.
   It is not Jesus who says he has done this. Thus the whole confirmation
   of Jn.'s story of many visits of Jesus to Jerusalem rests solely on the
   fact that an utterance put into the mouth of the Wisdom of God by a
   Jewish author has been wrongly regarded as a saying of Jesus. And now
   we understand also why the Synoptics, in spite of this "saying of
   Jesus" in which he says how often he has concerned himself about
   Jerusalem, had no information about these labours.

   [3] The truth of the theory that they had the work of an earlier writer
   before them has been fully demonstrated. Cp. Wernle, Die Quellen des
   Lelens Jesu, pp. 70-7-4 (in the Religionsgeschichtlichen Volksbücher;
   Engl. trans, pp. 131-139).
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. IS JESUS' RELATIONSHIP TO GOD IN MT. xi. 27 THE SAME AS IN JN.?

   It would be still more important if we could find a second passage in
   the Synoptics fitted to confirm the story of Jn. We mean such
   confirmation as would relate not merely to one particular point, such
   as the journeys of Jesus to Jerusalem, but to the whole character of
   Jesus' discourses. We have in mind Mt. xi. 27: "All things have been
   delivered unto me of my Father, and no one knoweth the Son, save the
   Father; neither (doth any know) the Father, save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him." These words seem certainly
   to be spoken quite in the spirit of the Fourth Gospel, which in x. 14
   f., for instance, says ("I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own,
   and mine own know me), even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the
   Father." In Jn. this mutual knowledge must be understood in the sense
   that Jesus had from eternity existed with God in heaven before he came
   down to earth.

   Now it is certainly remarkable that in the Synoptics only this one
   saying can be found which gives expression to this thought, and might
   be compared to the discourses of Jesus in Jn. If, as is claimed, it
   really implies confirmation of these, again all that we get is a new
   puzzle as regards the Synoptics: why in these does Jesus not speak in
   this way more often, instead of talking everywhere else in such an
   entirely different way? This consideration obliges us to re-examine the
   utterance more closely.

   This also originally read quite differently. All ecclesiastical and
   heretical writers of the second century, who give us any information
   about this passage, entirely or in part support the following version:
   "All things have been delivered unto me of my Father, and no one hath
   known the Father, save the Son, neither the Son save the Father, and he
   to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him."

   Even the Church Father, Irenaeus, about A.D. 185, who warmly upbraids a
   Christian sect for making use of this version, follows it several times
   in his writings; it must therefore have really been found in his own
   Bible. As compared with it, the version which we now have in the Bible
   cannot under any circumstances claim the preference. It is true that
   our oldest copies of the Bible contain it, but they are about two
   centuries later than the authorities we have mentioned. And no
   plausible reason can be given why the version current in the second
   century should be due to a deliberate change on the part of a Christian
   sect; on the other hand, since the one form must have arisen through an
   alteration of the other, it is very conceivable that it is the text in
   our present Bible which has resulted from a change, because, we may
   suppose, the writer was anxious to make the language resemble more
   closely Jesus style of preaching in Jn.

   Is the difference so great then? At first sight it might seem slight.
   But that is a very wrong impression. While we read, "No one knoweth the
   Son . . . the Father," a mutual knowledge from eternity may be meant,
   and, as we said just now, this is one of the ideas of the Fourth
   Gospel. When, however, we read, "no one hath known," a definite point
   of time is fixed at which the knowledge first began; and when Jesus
   goes on to say of himself, "no one has known the Father but the Son,"
   it is clear that the knowledge of the Father cannot have commenced
   before some definite date in his earthly life, since the Synoptics are
   not aware that Jesus existed in heaven before he lived on earth.
   Nevertheless, if the words in the first place were, "no one hath known
   the Son save the Father," it would still be possible that at any rate
   the knowledge on the part of God was present from eternity, and this
   would be in agreement with the style of thought in the Fourth Gospel.
   But a second important peculiarity in the oldest version is found in
   this very fact that the first place is assigned to the clause, "No one
   hath known the Father save the Son," and that the other clause follows,
   "No one hath known the Son, save the Father." And since the knowledge
   spoken of first was not gained earlier than during the earthly life of
   Jesus, we cannot suppose that the knowledge referred to in the second
   clause belongs to an earlier date.

   The meaning is really quite simple: Jesus alone has acquired the
   knowledge that God is not a Lord who is jealous for his own honour, and
   cannot be approached by men, but is a loving Father. This of itself
   means that he can feel himself to be a son of God. It is a feeling of
   his own, however, which no one so far has realised--none of his
   hearers, but God alone. This second part of the thought is very well
   expressed in Lk. (x. 22) by the clause: "no one knows (more correctly,
   has known) who the son is," that is to say, that I am he. Finally, with
   this agrees very well the conclusion in Mt. and Lk., "and to whom the
   son will reveal it." In the usual version of the saying, the
   immediately preceding words are: "no one knows the Father, but the
   son." What the latter will reveal is thus the deeper nature of God,
   and, understood in the spirit of the Fourth Gospel, the meaning might
   be that Jesus acquired the knowledge during his pre-existence in
   heaven. But, according to the correct version, the immediately
   preceding words are, "no one has known the son, but the Father," and
   here the following words mean, "and he to whom I myself am willing to
   reveal that I am that son; you have all failed as yet to recognise
   this, I myself must tell you of it."

   Strictly speaking, when the knowledge that God is the Father dawns upon
   any man, he can feel that he himself is His son; this knowledge Jesus
   wished to bring to all, and said, "blessed are the peace-makers, for
   they shall be called the sons of God," "love your enemies, and pray for
   them that persecute you, that ye may be sons of your Father which is in
   heaven" (Mt. v. 9, 44 f.). He used the expression "sons of God," and so
   the same expression as he applied to himself. Instead of this, Jn.
   continually uses of men--and he is the first to do so--the phrase
   "children of God," reserving the expression "Son of God" for Jesus
   alone, and Luther, without any justification, has used it also in Mt.
   and in other places where the original has "sons." [4] It is quite
   clear that, in view of what we have said, Jesus cannot have called
   himself Son of God in a sense that only applies to himself, on the
   ground, for instance, that he proceeded from God in a manner different
   from that in which human beings come into existence at their birth; he
   can only have done so in a sense in which all men can become what he
   was, that is to say, sons of God who are equally ready to obey
   absolutely the Father in heaven, but at the same time rely upon His
   love, just as a human son relies upon the love of his human father. If
   we of to-day wish to express the sense in which Jesus called himself
   Son of God in a way that cannot be misunderstood, we must do the
   reverse of what Jn. has done--use the other expression and say that
   Jesus felt himself to be a child of God.

   Turning again to Mt. xi. 27, we must remember that at this time Jesus
   alone possessed the knowledge that God is a loving Father. This made
   him singular and raised him above other men. Thus the thought of being
   God's son made him feel in addition that he was sent by God to reveal
   this knowledge to his brethren. This is the meaning of the initial
   words of the saying: "all things have been delivered to me of my
   Father." It does not imply any super human power, as in the saying
   (which, it is almost generally agreed, was not spoken by Jesus), "all
   power is given to me in heaven and upon earth" (Mt. xxviii. 18). Here
   the word "power" does occur in the passage, but not in the text under
   consideration. What is delivered to Jesus, in our passage, we must
   gather simply from the context; on the evidence of the saying itself,
   it is the knowledge that we can regard God as our Father. In agreement
   with this is the fact that according to xi. 25 it must be something
   which was hidden from the wise and revealed to the simple, and
   according to xi. 28-30 something which was quite different from the
   yoke of the Jewish Law under which the weary and heavy-laden groaned,
   while Jesus yoke was easy and his burden light, and was able to refresh
   the soul because it consisted simply in doing the will of God gladly
   and in relying upon His love.

   Are all these thoughts similar to those found in the Fourth Gospel? Far
   from it. On the contrary, no utterance harmonises with the spirit of
   Jesus' discourses in the Synoptics so well as the one we have been
   considering if we hold fast to its original language. In fact, it is
   precisely this that enables us for the first time to under stand fully
   how Jesus came to be what he was according to the Synoptics; at first
   he was quite simply a man who in the course of his mental development
   realised that he had a Father in heaven; next he became one who felt
   himself called by this Father of his to be a leader, sent to the
   people, because he found that he stood quite alone in having this
   knowledge, and yet could not be silent about it; and from this it was
   easy to take a further step and to feel obliged to regard himself as
   that highest messenger sent by God, whom his people and his age thought
   of as the one who had been long promised, as the Messiah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] Paul interchanges "sons" and "children" without any distinction.
   Luther renders only the Singular by "son" (Heb. xii. 5-7; Rev. xxi. 7),
   the Plural by "sons" only in the phrase "sons and daughters" (2 Cor.
   vi. 18). In Gal. iv. 7 he arbitrarily changes the Singular into the
   Plural in order to be able to use the term "children." The Authorised
   English Version has, like Luther, son for the Singular, but also in
   Gal. iv. 7. For the Plural it has in half the cases sons (Rom. viii.
   14, 19; Gal. iv. 6; Heb. ii. 10, xii. 7 f.; besides 2 Cor. vi. 18), but
   in the other half, like Luther, children (Mt. v. 9, 45; Lk. vi. 35, xx.
   36; Rom. ix. 26; Gal. iii. 26; Heb. xii. 5). The Revised Version
   everywhere translates correctly son or sons.

  8. INACCURATE RECOLLECTION ON THE PART OF THE APOSTLE JOHN?

   What remains, if we still wish to maintain that the Fourth Gospel is in
   agreement with the first three? If we disregard various other
   expedients, which are far less likely to be satisfactory than those we
   have already discussed, there is only one left. We are told by the
   Church Fathers that at the end of the first century the Apostle John
   was still living. This being so, it is eagerly assumed that he did not
   write his gospel until shortly before his death. And whereas his great
   age obscured his recollection of many matters in the life of Jesus, he
   remembered other things quite correctly. This explains, it is said, how
   it is that his book, apart from much that is incorrect, contains much
   that serves to correct the story of the Synoptics.

   In itself this assumption has nothing impossible about it; if indeed it
   could be accepted that the Gospel was composed by the apostle and in
   his old age, this theory might be deemed fairly probable. Since,
   however, we must first examine the two presuppositions on which it is
   based, let us at the outset put the simple question, What would the
   result be? At least not this--that Jn., as compared with the Synoptics,
   must always be regarded as everywhere right. This particular idea
   therefore is abandoned as being untenable. To what extent is he right
   then? To suit the real desire of those who put forward this theory, he
   is right on as many points as possible. For the main purpose of these
   people is to support the idea that we have in Jn. the work of an
   eye-witness of the life of Jesus. But when we examine the matter more
   closely, his trustworthiness is abandoned on one point after another,
   because, however much we may wish to believe in it, it cannot be
   maintained.

   In particular, as regards the discourses of Jesus, it is more and more
   generally conceded that it was the aged John who first conceived them
   in the style in which they appear in the Fourth Gospel. His conception
   of Jesus changed in the course of his long life, and as these new ideas
   took shape his recollection of the discourses of Jesus altered as well.
   If this were assumed to a moderate extent, it might seem conceivable;
   but people would never have jumped at so doubtful an expedient, unless
   the difference between Jn.'s style of discourse and the other style,
   which may really be accepted as original, were very marked indeed.

   Thus the result of emphasising the great age of John is really the
   opposite of what was intended. The desire was simply to defend the
   trustworthiness of the Fourth Gospel as against the Synoptics, and yet
   the would-be defenders are obliged in a clear, if rather veiled, manner
   to admit that on most points he is untrustworthy.

   We have now come to the end of the attempts to reconcile the accounts
   of the life of Jesus in the Synoptics and in Jn. In conclusion, we can
   only say that we sincerely pity any one who engages in this labour. If
   on many particular points his efforts seem to be really satisfactory to
   him, he can never rejoice at his success; for he has no sooner shown
   that it is not absolutely impossible to reconcile some new little
   circumstance in Jn. with the Synoptics than a whole series of others
   come to light which defy every attempt at reconciliation.

CHAPTER III.

   DECISION AS TO WHICH IS THE MORE TRUST WORTHY: THE STORY OF THE FIRST
   THREE GOSPELS OR OF THE FOURTH?

   WE have then to make a choice. And from what has already been said we
   are not as yet precluded from giving decided preference to Jn.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. REASONS FOR FAVOURING JN.

   Beyond question there are people who think such a picture of Jesus as
   the Fourth Gospel gives not merely beautiful in the sense in which even
   a fairy-tale may be felt to be beautiful, but also more trustworthy
   than that of the Synoptics. They are not concerned to find Jesus
   humanly intelligible in his whole character; on the contrary, the less
   human it is, the truer does it seem to them to be. It is not merely
   that they want one who can do the greatest miracles, but they really
   think it a most likely thing that, when the time was fulfilled, God
   would have caused exactly such a Saviour to appear. They are not
   disturbed when they find that Jesus' enemies, in spite of all their
   efforts, never succeeded in overpowering him, and think it quite
   natural that the attempts did not succeed because God tied their hands.
   It does not surprise them that Jesus spoke to the people about his
   coming from heaven in a way that they could not under stand at all;
   were his teaching intelligible, it seems to them it would not have been
   so sublime as it must certainly have been. Taking examples from
   history, we will only add that Clement of Alexandria as early as about
   A.D. 200 called the Gospel of John the pneumatic Gospel, that Luther
   called it the true, unique, tender Gospel of Gospels, and that
   Schleiermacher (ob. 1834) ranked it high above the Synoptics.

   We have no idea of arguing with people who feel in this way. We do not
   wish to destroy their idea; we respect it. One thing, however, they
   cannot expect us to attribute to them--we mean, the historical sense.
   Every one who has had much to do with history knows that, to understand
   events and characters, it is of the first importance to look for such
   explanations as suggest themselves to us from experience of other human
   happenings. There will always be points which we cannot clear up in
   this way. But every student of history knows that he would be defeating
   his own purpose if he were to set aside those obvious explanations
   which hold good again and again in all human experience and were to try
   to put in place of them indefinite and unusual explanations, such as a
   miracle, a direct intervention on the part of God. In other branches of
   history, even those people whom we have described above carefully avoid
   this; it is only in the field of "sacred" history that they prefer the
   dark to the clear, the inconceivable to the conceivable, the miraculous
   to the natural.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. PREFERENCE FOR THE SYNOPTICS ON THE WHOLE.

   When we address our question, Do the Synoptics or Jn. deserve the
   preference? to those who do not care to make such a distinction between
   "sacred" and ordinary human history, who, though they are quite
   prepared to find in the history of Jesus and especially in his inmost
   character much that is unfathomable, would like even here to see as
   much that is clear and humanly intelligible as it is possible to see,
   we are almost inclined to conjecture that the decision has already been
   made. Much as we have tried, in enumerating the distinctions between
   the two stories of the life of Jesus, to make the facts alone speak, we
   could not help it if these made the scale turn in favour of the
   Synoptics: and the review of the attempts which have been made to
   reconcile the two accounts could hardly fail to strengthen this
   impression.

   Our task is now therefore merely to sum up the matter as briefly as
   possible, and then to give a rather more detailed treatment of some
   further points in which the trustworthiness of Jn. really needs to be
   more thoroughly investigated or in which it is still necessary to
   explain how it is that Jn. has come to make statements differing so
   widely from the truth. When we do this it will be time to say plainly
   what we think of these statements, whereas so far we have refrained
   from doing so, and have faithfully followed our purpose of giving in
   the first instance only the facts (p. 4).
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. INFLUENCE OF JESUS WITH HIS HEARERS.

   Which is more likely--that Jesus came into contact with all sorts and
   conditions of men amongst his people and achieved successes of every
   kind, or that he had to deal almost entirely and without distinction
   with the "Jews" in a body? Which is more likely that he often had an
   enthusiastic reception, or that the Jews, in a compact body, refused to
   believe in him? It is said in Jn. often enough that "many" believed in
   him on this or that occasion (ii. 23; vii. 31; viii. 30; x. 42, &c.).
   This, however, should not deceive us as to the fact, that as a general
   result the Jews do not believe. When a certain number believe, this
   always (apart from x. 42) gives rise to a division among Jesus'
   hearers, and if that had not happened, Jesus would never have been led
   to speak such words as "if a man keep my word, he shall never see
   death" (viii. 51) and the like, which Jn. is determined to record. But
   the belief has no permanent result, for when Jesus delivers his
   farewell discourses (chaps. xiii.-xvii.), only the little band of his
   intimate disciples is represented as being still true to him; all those
   who have believed only for a time are referred to in the saying: "But
   Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men" (ii.
   24); in other words, he knew that in the end these--all of them--would
   join in the cry, "Crucify him, crucify him" (xix. 6, 15).
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. COURSE OF JESUS' PUBLIC WORK.

   But if from the first Jesus really met with so much hostility, how are
   we to understand why he was so long allowed such freedom? Is it
   conceivable that, after driving the dealers from the fore-court of the
   Temple, and supposing that it took place at the beginning of his visits
   to Jerusalem, he could have continued to work for two years unmolested?
   In Galilee, it would be easier to think this; it is not so easy to
   imagine that he could have done so under the eyes of the Jewish
   authorities in Jerusalem, where, according to Jn., he stayed with few
   exceptions. The excuse that "his hour was not yet come" (vii. 30; viii.
   20), is one which, having regard to all we know from the rest of human
   history, should be characterised as quite unsatisfactory.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. JESUS' STYLE OF SPEAKING.

   But if Jesus really met with a friendly reception and had a following,
   especially amongst the humble and oppressed members of his race--and no
   one would like to give up the idea that he had--which is the more
   likely, that this success was due to the style of addresses the
   Synoptics describe him as giving to the people or to that which Jn.
   describes? In the Synoptics he really lifts from the people the heavy
   yoke of the Old Testament law with its thousand impossible precepts,
   and substitutes the light yoke of a free, childlike obedience to the
   simple command to love God and one's neighbour; in Jn., instead of
   this, we find nothing but an incessant command, supported by bare
   assurances and awe-inspiring miracles, to believe in him and his coming
   from heaven. It was really difficult for a soul in anguish to derive
   any comfort from it. There is certainly nothing more touching to such a
   soul known to any one--not even to the worshippers of the Jesus of the
   Fourth Gospel--than the parable of the Prodigal Son (Lk. xv. 11-32),
   whom the father, in spite of his great fault, goes forth to meet and
   embrace when he comes back penitent to his old home. This parable, with
   those of the Good Samaritan (Lk. x. 25-37), of the cruel and wicked
   servant (Mt. xviii. 23-35), of the Pharisee and the Publican (Lk.
   xviii. 9-14), and all the others, so helpful and dear to us as precious
   and living examples of a simple piety which at once touches the heart,
   we seek for in vain in the "true, unique, tender Gospel of
   Gospels"--and not because they are already found in the Synoptics and
   must not be repeated, but because they do not illustrate the only
   matter about which the Jesus of Jn. is permitted to speak, his divine
   majesty.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. MISUNDERSTANDINGS AS REGARDS JESUS' DISCOURSES.

   We have reached a point at which we may also say that it is not the
   hearers of Jesus who are to be accused of having seriously
   misunderstood his discourses, and that it was not Jesus who
   intentionally provoked the misunderstandings. The author himself
   inserts in Jesus' discourses, when they have, as a matter of fact,
   already reached their end, some expression having more meanings than
   one, in order that he may proceed to tell us how, when the hearers of
   Jesus understood him in an external, material sense, he explained his
   deeper, spiritual meaning, and in so doing brought to light on the one
   hand a want of intelligence on the part of the people, and even of the
   disciples, and on the other the unsuspected profundity of his own
   disclosures. These misunderstandings are not therefore the
   reminiscences of an eye-witness, but a device employed by the author.
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. REPETITIONS IN JESUS' DISCOURSES.

   When we consider further how limited a number of ideas are continually
   repeated in these discourses in a way which is felt to be quite
   monotonous and tedious even by very many of those who regard the Fourth
   Gospel with a kind of awe, we wonder the more how Jesus could have gone
   on talking in this way for two years without being left with no one at
   all to listen to him.

   But we have still to add something which has not so far been mentioned:
   in Jn. Jesus continues a discourse even when in the meantime a series
   of events have happened, and when of course the audience has changed.
   He says, for example, at the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple (x.
   26; cp. 22), "But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep," and
   then proceeds to enlarge upon the idea of the sheep, just as he has
   done on an earlier and quite different occasion (x. 3, 10 f., 14). On
   another occasion, at the Feast of Tabernacles (vii. 23; cp. 2) he says,
   "are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the
   Sabbath? "Now the only act of the kind which has been mentioned so far
   is the healing of the sick man at Bethesda (v. 1-16) which took place
   at an earlier, but not definitely distinguished, "feast of the Jews."
   Since this, according to Jn., Jesus fed the Five Thousand at the
   Passover Feast in Galilee (vi. 4), and the interval between this and
   the Feast of Tabernacles would amount to another six months.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. LEAVES IN JN. WRONGLY ARRANGED

   That, in spite of this, he should speak as if the healing at Bethesda
   had only just happened is so striking as to have given rise to the
   theory that the page which contained this continuation of the discourse
   got shifted in Jn.'s manuscript or in one of the oldest copies of it,
   from its proper place in the book, and was reinserted in a wrong place
   farther back. This is not in itself impossible; indeed, the existence
   of this kind of mistake in several ancient books has been made so
   probable that there can no longer be any question about it. Of course,
   if it occurred here, both the first words and the last in the wrongly
   inserted leaf must have caused some disturbance in the context of the
   book, and in the place where the leaf originally stood a lacuna in the
   narrative, as we have it, would be noticeable. But there is nothing of
   this in the passage under consideration; and, apart from this, there
   are very many other passages, in which, because the order of events is
   unlikely, or because the order in the Gospel of Jn. does not agree with
   that of the Synoptics, one would like to suppose that a leaf has been
   misplaced in some such manner. We wish any one who proposes by such
   expedients to bring the Fourth Gospel into good order and into
   agreement with the Synoptics a long life, but his labour is one which
   will never suffice for his task.
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. CARELESS DESCRIPTION IN JN.

   The matter is much simpler. As we found in the case of the
   misunderstandings, it is not Jesus but the Evangelist who enlarges upon
   the ideas and spins out the discourses. He imagines Jesus as having
   always the same hearers, because he has no real recollection of actual
   cases in which Jesus confronted the people. It is his fault, and not
   the fault of Jesus, that no account is taken of the intervals which
   must have elapsed between two of Jesus utterances which could not have
   been so close together in actual life as they are on paper.

   This explains further how it is that the discourses of Jesus and the
   remarks of the Evangelist himself are often so much alike that the one
   might be taken for the other--they are even amalgamated with the
   discourses of the Baptist. In the midst of one of these a number of
   utterances begins in iii. 31, of a kind that only Jesus himself makes
   elsewhere in the Fourth Gospel, and yet it is not said that Jesus is
   the speaker. The expositors are therefore quite at a loss to know
   whether to ascribe them to the Baptist or to regard them as remarks of
   the Evangelist himself. Even the well-known saying, "And this is life
   eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom
   thou didst send, even Jesus Christ," is in Jn. (xvii. 3) an utterance
   made by Jesus himself, though, were it his, he would surely have said,
   "and know me whom thou hast sent," especially as he is using the words
   in a prayer addressed to God.

   In these cases there is certainly a considerable amount of carelessness
   on the part of the Evangelist. But the most friendly critic cannot deny
   that there is evidence of it in other places as well. At the beginning
   of the story of the raising of Lazarus, Jn. mentions (xi. 1 f.) Lazarus
   sisters Martha and Mary, and adds: "And it was that Mary which anointed
   the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair." We ask in
   vain where Jn. has already narrated this. There would perhaps be some
   excuse--though it would still be strange--if he thought he might refer
   to Mary in this way because the description of the anointing was known
   to his readers from the older Gospels (cp. i. 15, p. 52). In that case
   his purpose would be to add, as a new point, that the woman who is
   mentioned in the Synoptics but is not named was no other than this same
   Mary. But we do not find in any of the Synoptics what seems to be
   recalled here. According to Mk. (xiv. 3) and Mt. (xxvi. 7), a woman in
   Bethany, near Jerusalem, pours the contents of a flask of precious
   nard, having according to Mk. broken it for the purpose, on Jesus head.
   According to Lk. (vii. 37 f.), when Jesus was invited in Galilee to sup
   at the house of a Pharisee, a sinful woman of the town moistened his
   feet with her tears, dried them with her hair, kissed them, and
   anointed them with ointment. Which of these accounts does Jn. wish to
   recall to us? Neither meets the case. On the other hand, the puzzle is
   solved at once when we reach the 12th chapter of his own Gospel. Here
   in v. 3 we are told for the first time something which is already
   referred to in chap. xi. as a past event (see further, below pp.
   81-83). Here Jn. tells us distinctly that what is narrated in the 12th
   chapter happened later than what he has reported in the 11th chapter.
   If a modern writer were to tell us something like this, we should think
   ourselves badly treated, and would not easily forgive him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. COLOURLESS DESCRIPTIONS IN JN.

   Further, in how colourless a way many of the scenes in Jn. are
   sketched! Certain Greeks come (xii. 20) to Jerusalem for the Passover
   Feast and wish to see Jesus. They apply to Philip; he tells Andrew, and
   both inform Jesus. Up to this point every word suggests that we are
   dealing with an eye-witness, so precise is every statement. And then?
   "But Jesus answered them" (i.e. the two disciples), "the hour is come
   that the Son of Man should be glorified," &c. He makes a reference to
   his impending death, to which he cheerfully reconciles himself. Whether
   the Greeks were admitted to see him, what they said, what Jesus said to
   them--about all this we hear nothing. Similarly, the conversation with
   Nicodemus, to take another example (iii. 1-21), has no conclusion. It
   is again clear that the author is not concerned about the persons who
   come into touch with Jesus, but entirely about Jesus himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  11. THE PICTURE OF JOHN THE BAPTIST.

   Even John the Baptist has suffered the same fate. In the Synoptics he
   conies before us a character which of itself would have a claim to
   interest us greatly, even if it had never been brought into close touch
   with Jesus. The purpose of his baptism and preaching of repentance, and
   their benefit to the people, would have been achieved in any case. It
   is not merely his pathetic death (Mk. vi. 17-29) that makes him sure of
   winning the sympathy of readers of the Synoptics, but also his
   uncertainty as to whether he is to regard Jesus as the Messiah (Mt. xi.
   2 f.). It shows how truly Jesus speaks when he says that he is greater
   than any Old Testament figure, and yet least amongst the New Testament
   believers (Mt. xi. 11). He could call men to repentance, but he had not
   himself been commissioned to preach the glad tidings. We are told only
   in Mt. (iii. 14 f.) that he refused to baptize Jesus, and this is
   clearly a later touch, for according to the most original account which
   we can still gather easily from Mk., he did not learn Jesus higher
   nature even at the baptism itself. Jesus alone in Mk. (i. 10) sees the
   heavens open and the Holy Spirit coming down upon him like a dove. And
   this is undoubtedly the correct version, since no one would have
   invented it, if as Lk. reports (iii. 21 f.), and as regards the heavens
   Mt. also (iii. 16), the opening of the heavens and the coming down of
   the spirit were visible to every one. It is true that Mk. also (like
   Mt. and Lk.), as regards the voice from heaven, only says that it
   sounded, which seems to imply that it could be heard by every one. But
   only Mt. says "this is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased;" Mk.
   (and Lk.), on the contrary, "thou art," &c.; and from this we may
   certainly assume that according to the older account which was used by
   Mk., the voice could be heard by Jesus alone, just as he alone saw the
   heavens open.

   In the Fourth Gospel, however, the Baptist knows from the beginning not
   only of Jesus higher nature, as in Mt., and that he was destined to be
   the Redeemer of the whole world (i. 27, 29), but also that he
   pre-existed with God in heaven (i. 15, 30). But for this very reason
   the work of the Baptist is strictly limited: he bears witness to Jesus
   (i. 6-8, 15, 23). His baptism is never of any importance to those who
   receive it. John uses it only as a means of testifying to Jesus (i. 26,
   31). His preaching of repentance is not even mentioned. It would thus
   be quite impossible for him to ask later whether Jesus is the Messiah,
   as in Mt. xi. 2 f., unless we were to explain such a question by
   ascribing to him doubts--which would be quite sinful--of all that had
   been revealed to him at an earlier date by God Himself, According to
   the original account of the Synoptics, on the other hand, he had as yet
   no actual knowledge which would enable him to answer the question. In
   short, in place of a character which was full of power, if limited in
   its spiritual outlook, and of a person whose tragic death made him an
   object of veneration, the Fourth Gospel gives us nothing better than a
   lay-figure endowed with supernatural knowledge, but always the same,
   and devoid of living features--a figure which was only meant to serve
   the purpose of revealing Jesus majesty.
     __________________________________________________________________

  12. INJUDICIOUS RELIANCE ON THE SYNOPTICS.

   How is it that the circumstances of many events are so obscurely
   sketched in the Fourth Gospel? We can some times explain this quite
   definitely. It is because the author starts in a careless way from an
   account in the Synoptics. Thus we had an instance (p. 51) already in
   vi. 3, 15, where Jesus twice ascends the mountain, without in the
   meantime having come down. This again explains a fact we noted as far
   back as p. 12, that in vi. 1, Jesus betakes himself to the other shore
   of the Lake of Galilee, whereas in the whole of the fifth chapter we
   have found him in Jerusalem. Without any further explanation, the
   Synoptics (Mk. vi. 32), and they alone, can represent him as crossing
   the Lake, because in the Synoptics he is always in Galilee; Jn. has
   carelessly followed them, without reflecting that he should have told
   us first how Jesus came from Jerusalem to Galilee--a matter which he
   reports quite appropriately in other places (iv. 3, 43).

   But the most important example of his following the Synoptics and at
   the same time carelessly tacking his story on to theirs, is found in
   Jn.'s account (xii. 1-8) of the anointing of Jesus. Several striking
   features in it we have already noticed (p. 77 f .); we must now explain
   how these originated. Jn. found an anointing of Jesus reported twice in
   the Synoptics j in Mk. (xiv. 3-9) and Mt. (xxvi. 6-13), one in Bethany
   near Jerusalem shortly before his death, in Lk. (vii. 36-50) one in
   Galilee, a long time before it. And yet in both cases the master of the
   house is called Simon. Moreover, in Mk. and Mt. he is (had been) a
   leper; in Lk. he is a Pharisee. But the fact that the names were alike
   seems to have been sufficient to lead Jn. to believe that in both cases
   the same event was intended. The woman therefore who anointed Jesus in
   this case must have been the same sinful woman who did so in Lk. (Mk.
   and Mt. tell us nothing beyond the fact that a woman anointed Jesus).
   But Jn. is prepared to say that it was that pious Mary who, according
   to the beautiful story in Lk. (x. 38-42), sat at Jesus' feet and
   listened to him, while her sister Martha busied herself more than was
   necessary with the household affairs. How did he obtain this knowledge?
   Not from Lk. , for in this Gospel the two sisters live in an unnamed
   village at which Jesus stops on his way through Samaria. We know
   already from xi. 1 f. that Jn. believed they lived in Bethany near
   Jerusalem and that Lazarus was their brother. Comparing the account of
   Lk., which Jn. drags in here, it suits the circumstances when at the
   meal Martha undertakes the serving and Mary anoints Jesus; this quite
   harmonizes with the fact that in Lk.'s Gospel she listens to him so
   attentively.

   Must we indeed believe that all this was really observed by an
   eye-witness John? Or have events which, according to the Synoptics,
   happened at three different places with quite different persons and in
   a quite different way been simply worked up into one in the style of
   the writer of Jn.? That may be best decided by a consideration of the
   last fact which he reports: Mary anointed Jesus' feet and dried them
   with her hair. She could hardly have done anything more awkward. The
   ointment was too precious to be used for her hair. On this point Judas,
   who afterwards betrayed his Lord, was right; the ointment should have
   been sold and the proceeds (about 240 shillings) given to the poor
   (xii. 5). No; no such anointing was observed by any eye-witness; it
   owes its origin simply to a wrong use of the two accounts in Lk. There
   the sinful woman moistens Jesus' feet with her tears and then dries
   them with her hair; she anoints them afterwards, not before. But the
   tears of a sinful woman do not suit the case of Mary. Jn. therefore
   omits them. And, having done this, the anointing has to come first;
   otherwise there would be nothing to wipe away. We see then that there
   is really no reason to think the Synoptics wrong. We see also that Mary
   is not the woman who anointed Jesus' feet; the name of the woman will
   always be unknown to us. The same is true of the dwelling-place of Mary
   and Martha. That this was Bethany is a fact which existed only in the
   imagination of the Fourth Evangelist.
     __________________________________________________________________

  13. ASTOUNDING NATURE OF THE MIRACLES IN JN.

   The raising of Lazarus, which is supposed to have taken place in
   Bethany, suggests that at this point it may be well to say all that
   remains to be said about the astounding nature of the miracles in the
   Fourth Gospel. What we shall say applies equally to the turning of
   water into wine at Cana, to the healing at the Pool of Bethesda of the
   man who had been lame for thirty-eight years, to the cure of the man
   born blind, &c. But it may suffice to explain what we mean, by dealing
   with the raising of Lazarus, which did not take place until the fourth
   day after death, when the body would already have become putrid. Martha
   actually refers to this fact (xi. 39), with the idea of suggesting that
   Jesus need not trouble to have the stone, which closed the rock-hewn
   selpulchre, rolled away. There is nothing which so clearly reveals the
   astounding nature of this miracle as the way in which it is regarded by
   scholars who assure us with the greatest earnestness that they do
   believe in miracles. They will tell us not only that the utterance of
   Martha is based upon a pure conjecture, but also that her conjecture
   was wrong. Certainly they can never have been inside a mortuary; nor do
   they reflect that in the warm climate of Palestine decomposition began
   much sooner than it does with us (cp. p. 19). Again they will tell us
   that, when a man dies, hearing is the last of all his senses to fail;
   and for this reason we are expressly told (xi. 43) that Jesus cried
   with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." Indeed, they are able to tell
   us more. They will tell us that the bands in which, according to xi.
   44, Lazarus' feet and hands were wrapped, were not fastened round his
   feet tightly. That Jesus could raise a man on the fourth day after his
   death they believe, and they expect every one who does not wish to be
   called an unbeliever to believe it too; but that he could give the man
   power to walk with firmly fastened feet--no, this they do not believe.
   Can we wonder then that other people refuse to accept as credible not
   only this narrative, but with it the whole book which produces it, and
   lays such emphasis on it, as principal evidence for the divine power of
   Jesus?

  14. ARE MIRACLES POSSIBLE?

   We ourselves do not at once assume this attitude, We remember not only
   that an incredible story may have found its way even into a book which
   is otherwise credible; we feel bound also to examine more closely the
   actual manner in which it is demonstrated that this miracle-story as
   well as the others in the Fourth Gospel and in the Bible generally do
   not deserve to be believed. In the last resort most people, we may be
   sure, rely in this matter on the idea that miracles are quite
   impossible. But the idea is not so firmly established as is commonly
   supposed. At the outset, it is certainly remarkable that it does not
   have the slightest influence on one who believes in miracles. Now we
   might say that the person who believes in miracles is unable to think
   correctly. But even his opponent will feel that his own case is not
   very strong when a miracle-story is brought to his notice which is
   attested by people who are worth considering, and when he has nothing
   better to say against it than, "Ah yes, but there are no such things as
   miracles," without being able to show, in this particular occurrence,
   how what seems miraculous in it can have arisen in a natural way. This
   reflection may lead us to what--regarding the matter from a strictly
   scientific standpoint--lies at the root of this question.

   If we are to be able to say that a matter has been proved, it is
   necessary that it should have been proved by facts. In the case of a
   miracle-story, for example, we consider it to have been really proved
   that nothing miraculous happened, only when we have found the same
   phenomenon reappearing a second time and are certain that here no other
   than quite natural causes have operated. We call this kind of proof,
   proof from experience. The other kind is known as proof from reasoning.
   Whoever uses the latter in support of the contention that there are no
   miracles will say either, that the laws of Nature are unalterable, and
   a miracle would be no miracle unless one or more of the laws of nature
   were suspended; or he will say, it would be a contradiction of His
   character, rightly understood, if God were to suspend the laws of
   Nature the operation of which He has made so inviolable.

   Let us devote just a few words to the notion--unfortunately very common
   among theologians--that a miracle is not contrary to the laws of
   Nature, but that certain forces come into operation which are quite
   natural but are not as yet known to us. Of course in earlier times
   Electricity and quite a short time ago the Röntgen rays were not known
   to us, and some occurrence due to these forces might easily have seemed
   miraculous, so that no man, even if he were only half-witted, would
   think of denying that all the forces of Nature are not as yet known to
   us. But what is the use of calling something a miracle which is due to
   forces like these which are quite natural, though still unknown to us?
   These are miracles which no one in the world would regard as
   impossible. But the chief aim of those who pride themselves on
   believing in miracles is to distinguish themselves in this way--to
   their own advantage--from those who do not believe in them and for this
   reason, in the opinion of their opponents, deserve to be called
   "infidels." That they have no right to make free with these quite
   natural but unknown forces, and by calling them to their aid to make
   miracles of as many occurrences as possible, is a fact that we need
   only mention in passing.

   Another favourite contention is that in working a miracle God only
   makes certain forces, which are natural and known to us, operate in an
   extraordinary way, just as a man does when he makes a clock strike
   before the hour by moving the hand. We refrain from insisting here that
   such intervention on the part of God would involve a breach in the
   natural order of things, for this reflection will not trouble those who
   imagine the natural order of things to be not something unconditionally
   willed by God, a part of His own nature, but a limitation imposed upon
   him (by whom?), and who are only satisfied, nay can only see in Him a
   living God when (as happens rarely enough) He breaks through this
   limitation. But of course it is nothing better than a very naive
   presumption to suppose that a miracle which really deserves to be
   called one is prearranged by and adjusted to preconditions in exactly
   the same way as the premature striking of a clock. To produce bread for
   five thousand men--supposing that it were prearranged in some such
   way--flour, leaven, and heat must have been ready at hand. To increase
   the number of fish for the feeding, spawn and time for growth, or at
   least a good catch, and in any case heat, would again have been
   necessary; to walk upon the sea some quality in the water would have
   been needed to offer to the feet some power of resistance like that of
   a firm body; for a cure there must have been in the body a condition
   quite different from that which favours the continuance of sickness,
   though for the most part we cannot exactly define the condition
   necessary for disease or recovery. We must therefore disregard such
   statements, and reckon seriously with the fact that a miracle under all
   circumstances is a violation of the laws of Nature.

   But if any one who for this reason pronounces miracles to be impossible
   is asked how he would prove it, he can in reality make no other reply
   than this: "I have come to that conclusion after using my reason to the
   best of my power." But this conclusion is not drawn by every one,
   whereas a fact of experience is recognised by all. And supposing he
   should say: "If the laws of Nature could ever cease to operate, there
   could no longer be any such study as Natural Science, we could no
   longer construct machines, and reckon on the working of a machine or of
   any other force in Nature"; the answer would be somewhat as follows:
   the point is not whether we can do all this, but how the world is
   actually constituted; if there are miracles in it, the fact is that we
   cannot do any of these things for certain.

   Now it has been proved, and proved by experience, that we can do these
   things; and whenever things do not work as the natural scientist or the
   technical worker expected, he regularly finds out afterwards that the
   fault is not with Nature, but that he himself has made a miscalculation
   and been the cause of the failure. But, strictly speaking, what this
   means is only that the number of miracles, if miracles there are, must
   be very small, and moreover the fact only applies to the present time;
   as regards the distant past, before every occurrence was observed as
   closely as it is now, one may still suppose that miracles happened in
   greater number. To try to dispute this with any prospect of success,
   one should be able to investigate all the miracle-stories of the past
   which have come down to us, and to show the events to have been
   perfectly natural; but we are no longer in a position to do this. In
   fact, even if we were, it would not help us sufficiently; for miracles
   might have happened which have not been recorded at all. And were it
   possible to trace these also to natural causes, we should be powerless
   to prevent an event taking place to-morrow which we should be obliged
   to recognise as a miracle, and nothing would then be gained by the
   statement that there are no such things as miracles. A scientific
   caution therefore bids us in no case to make this statement a guiding
   principle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  15. MUST WE BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?

   But we have only reached this result quite provisionally. It will take
   us a step further if I may be allowed to recall a personal experience.
   When I had occasion some years ago to express the above ideas to my
   class at the University, as they left the class-room they shook their
   heads and said, "He believes in miracles." I had certainly given them
   credit for more intelligence. To hold that it is not right to deny
   unconditionally that miracles are possible, and to believe that
   miracles do really happen, are two entirely different things. All that
   has been said so far only amounts to saying that in forming my opinion
   about miracles I must not be guided by general ideas, but by
   experience. But from experience I know for certain that I have never
   yet seen a miracle. I know also that pretty well all the miracles which
   are supposed to have happened in the present age have turned out, upon
   more careful inquiry, to be perfectly natural occurrences. I know too
   that the certainty with which the natural scientist and the technical
   worker reckon has never yet failed them. As regards the miracles of the
   past, I know that we can find no reason for supposing that miracles
   could have happened then more easily than to-day. In particular, I know
   that to say that God was obliged to use miracles for the purpose of
   proving Jesus to be the Saviour of the world is a bare assertion and
   cannot be proved. The Bible tells us that Paul, as well as Jesus, and
   very many ordinary persons in the Christian communities, and in fact--a
   still more important point--even the disciples of the Pharisees and
   other contemporaries of Jesus, possessed the power of working miracles
   (Rom. xv. 19; 2 Cor. xii. 12; 1 Cor. xii. 9 f., 28; Mt. xii. 27, vii.
   22 f.; Mk. ix. 38-40); and yet none of these was ever regarded as the
   Saviour. Had Jesus worked ever so many miracles, without being at the
   same time a physician of souls, I know that he would not have been
   worshipped as the Saviour, and that we of to-day should not be called
   by his name.

   And what is the use of the knowledge we possess of so many other
   religions if we refuse to use it in order to find out the origin of our
   own? Works of wonder are ascribed to every founder of a great religion
   of whose life we possess records, and they are often much more
   astounding than those attributed to Jesus; and--what is most remarkable
   here--in the case of each one of them utterances have at the same time
   been preserved in which he absolutely declines, as Jesus did (see
   above, p. 21 f.), to work miracles, and refers to them as matters of
   quite minor importance.

   In the case of Buddha the utterance is preserved: "I do not teach my
   disciples, Do miracles by means of your supernatural power . . .; I say
   to them, Live by concealing your good works and making your sins to be
   seen." Confucius, the founder of the Chinese religion, or rather of
   their political and moral science, is reported to have said:
   "Investigate what is obscure, do what is wonderful, that later
   generations may say of it, I do not like these things." In the case of
   Zarathustra, the founder of the Persian religion as committed to
   writing in the Zend-Avesta, we read: "God said to me, If the king asks
   for a sign, do thou say, Only read the Zend-Avesta, and you will need
   no miracles." In the Koran we find God saying to Muhammed: "Thy destiny
   is to preach and not to do miracles." Muhammed appeals to God's great
   miracles, the rising and setting of the sun, the rain, the growth of
   the plants, and the birth of souls; these are the true wonders to those
   who know what faith is. [5] Very much that is told us about these
   founders of religion is untrustworthy. But these utterances deserve to
   be believed without question; for who could have invented them?

   To these we may add in conclusion the saying of Kant, the founder of
   the newer philosophy: "Wise governments have at all times conceded, in
   fact have legally incorporated the notion in the public doctrines of
   religion, that in olden times miracles happened, but they have not
   allowed new miracles to happen. As regards new wonder-workers, they
   must have feared the effects they might have on the public peace and
   the established order." It is not difficult in the case of so clear a
   thinker to read between the lines: if, he would say, in olden times
   there had already been a wise government, it would not have allowed
   miracles to happen even in those days.

   From which presupposition then ought we to start, if we wish to decide
   the question whether miracle-stories deserve belief? Strictly speaking,
   from none. But that is not possible. We always bring to the
   consideration of a subject some kind of presupposition. After what has
   been said, this must not be to the effect that miracles are not
   possible. But it would be still worse to assume, that miracles may
   easily happen. One who starts with this presupposition will certainly
   regard many occurrences as miracles in which everything has been
   brought about by causes which are quite natural. If then we cannot
   avoid starting with a presupposition, it can only of course be one that
   has already stood its trial in other cases, not one which has never yet
   been tested. In the present case therefore it can only be this, that
   any miracle-story we propose to examine will, presumably, admit of
   exactly the same natural explanation as others which we have so far
   been able closely to investigate. It is therefore not only permissible,
   but is our bounden duty, to try with all the means at our disposal to
   explain such matters by natural causes. While we do this, we must be
   ready to find a miracle if necessary, but only when there are
   insurmountable obstacles to our regarding a matter otherwise.

   Until such obstacles arise, we are entitled to accept the two
   statements, (1) that the laws of Nature are unchangeable and (2) that
   God himself does not desire to suspend them by a miracle. Only we must
   be clear on this point--that they are not matters which have been
   proved quite sufficiently, but in spite of all that can be advanced in
   their favour, are never anything more than a belief.

   If we know a miracle-story only from written accounts--which is the
   case with those of the Bible--the first question we must ask is, Do
   these accounts show themselves to be reliable in every detail? For
   instance, it is not a matter of no importance, whether Jesus healed one
   blind man before he entered the city of Jericho (so Lk. xviii. 35-43)
   or healed him after he left it (so Mk. x. 46-52), or whether he healed
   two blind men (so Mt. xx. 29-34) at the same place. Why should I take
   it for granted that the Evangelists or their authorities duly informed
   them selves that it was really a case of blindness, when they are not
   agreed as to where and in the case of how many per sons the thing was
   done? Nor is it any more a matter of indifference whether on the
   evening after Jesus had healed Peter's wife's mother, people brought
   all the sick to him and he healed many of them (so Mk. i. 32-34), or
   whether they brought many and he healed all (so Mt. viii. 16), or
   whether they brought all and he healed them all (so Lk. iv. 40). Nor
   again is it a matter of no importance whether he taught the multitude
   before the Feeding of the Five Thousand (so Mk. vi. 34), or whether he
   healed their sick (so Mt. xiv. 14). We might continue thus for a long
   time if we wished /to throw light on this aspect of the miracle-stories
   found in the Synoptics. But the points we have mentioned are only
   intended to serve as examples of the kind of thing we are obliged to
   take note of in the stories of the Fourth Gospel.

  16. SILENCE OP THE SYNOPTICS AS TO THE MIRACLES IN JN.

   As compared with the stories in the Synoptics, the only one in Jn. that
   can be said to contain an actual contradiction is that of Jesus'
   walking on the sea, since Jesus crossed not merely a part but the whole
   of the sea, and is not supposed to have been taken into the boat (see
   above, p. 19 f.). In the other miracle stories in this Gospel (apart
   from that of the Feeding), contradictions are impossible, because the
   Synoptics do not include the stories. But this silence on their part is
   the very thing that cannot fail to make us feel the most serious
   doubts. These miracles which are known only to the Fourth Gospel are
   actually the most stupendous recorded: the turning of the water into
   wine at Cana, the healing of the man who was thirty-eight years a
   paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda, the cure of the man born blind, and
   the raising of Lazarus. (It is difficult to say whether by the cure of
   the son of a royal official at Capernaum, iv. 46-54, the same event is
   intended as the cure of the son or servant of the centurion at
   Capernaum in Mt. viii. 5-13 and Lk. vii., 1-10; see p. 99 f.)

   Why these particular miracles should have been passed over by the
   Synoptics, if they really happened, it is absolutely impossible to
   imagine. What real arguments have those scholars who hold them to be
   true to offer, in order to explain the fact that there is not a word
   about them in the Synoptics? Once more it will be sufficient to fix our
   attention on the Raising of Lazarus.

   We are told, for instance, that among the great mass of persons who
   were raised (!) by Jesus, the Synoptists might easily have forgotten
   Lazarus; or that they did not think themselves gifted enough to be able
   to gather up the preeminent importance of the event for the career of
   Jesus; or that they did not credit themselves with sufficiently
   delicate and lively feeling to be able to report it worthily; or that
   they were silent out of respect for the relatives of Lazarus who were
   still living (as if the story would not, on the contrary, have
   redounded to their honour); or that they did not think themselves to be
   sufficiently well instructed as to the details; or that the matter did
   not come to their ears because it took place before the arrival of the
   pilgrims from Galilee for the Easter festival (this would be to
   disregard xi. 16, where it is expressly said that all the twelve
   disciples of Jesus were present); or that it did not come to their ears
   because, when they arrived in Jerusalem, it was already too well known;
   or that the plan which they followed in their Gospels, apart from the
   last week of the life of Jesus, did not allow of their reporting events
   in Judaea. but only those which happened in Galilee; or that they were
   already aware that John, the beloved disciple of Jesus, would write his
   Gospel after them, and they wished to leave him to relate the Raising
   of Lazarus.

   It could not really be shown in a more lamentable way that we cannot
   discover a single intelligible reason why the Synoptists have not
   related the Raising of Lazarus. To make such statements is at the same
   time to pronounce sentence that the event never happened. We see then
   that to arrive at this conviction it was not necessary to be shy of
   miracles; the way in which the story is told is in itself quite
   sufficient for our conclusion. And this is equally true of the other
   miracle stories which are found only in Jn.
     __________________________________________________________________

  17. THE MIRACLES IN JN. SYMBOLIC.

   But why does Jn. introduce such incredible matters? Is it purely from a
   delight in the wonderful? Is it from the idea that Jesus could only in
   this way have shown himself to be the Saviour? Certainly he held this
   idea, and even attached importance to it (see p. 20 f.). But we should
   be doing him a great wrong, if we were disposed to think this his sole
   motive for telling us that such miracles were worked by Jesus. The fact
   that he describes so few in detail is itself an argument against this.
   But he also makes us realise clearly that each of these miracles has a
   deeper sense, a symbolic meaning; that is to say, that it is meant to
   express a religious idea in a picture as it were. In the case of the
   .Raising of Lazarus, he himself has supplied in the clearest manner the
   legend to the picture. Martha expresses to Jesus clearly, if shyly, her
   hope that he will raise her brother: "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
   brother had not died. And even now I know that whatsoever thou shalt
   ask of God, God will give thee" (xi. 21 f.). Jesus answered, "Thy
   brother shall rise again." Martha rejoins, "I know that he shall rise
   again in the resurrection at the last day." And thereupon Jesus said to
   her, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth on me,
   though he die, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth on
   me shall never die." Here therefore we have the well-known and
   beautiful idea in the Fourth Gospel of that eternal life, in a deeply
   spiritual sense, which, through faith in Jesus, begins even during this
   earthly existence, and not merely after death, and which cannot be
   interrupted by the death of the body (cp. further especially v. 24).

   Is it the same thing when Lazarus is immediately after wards summoned
   to come forth from the grave? By no means. Lazarus receives back the
   life of the body; but that spiritually eternal life of which we have
   spoken is a treasure which is stored in the depth of one's heart. To
   call Lazarus back to life, one of the greatest miraculous interventions
   in the laws of Nature was required; to bring to birth the spiritually
   eternal life of which we have spoken, only faith was needed. Lazarus
   can do nothing to help himself to come forth from the grave; whoever
   wishes to have the spiritually eternal life, must himself do his best
   within his own heart to call forth faith. Sooner or later Lazarus must
   die again; the spiritually eternal life, once gained, can never again
   be lost. Finally, Lazarus is only one man, and though we are certain
   that Jesus loved all other men, yet he is obliged to leave them all in
   the grave; but the spiritually eternal life is to be denied to no one.
   In brief, the thought of that eternal life which Jesus here speaks of
   as the essence of his message to Martha rises high as the heavens above
   the work which he afterwards per forms on Lazarus; so high that it has
   even been thought that the two things were not originally connected,
   and that the Raising of Lazarus was inserted in the original book of
   Jn. by a later writer. That is of course a great mistake. Both belong
   together very well, but only in the same way as a deeply spiritual
   thought belongs to the picture which gives it clear, if inadequate,
   expression in a visible occurrence.

   Imagine a painter who wishes by means of his art to represent the
   thought: "Whosoever believes on me will live, even though he dies, and
   whosoever lives and believes on me will never die." Can he represent
   the feeling of his heart on canvas? What better symbol will he choose
   than the summoning of Lazarus, the friend of Jesus, from the grave? And
   is he obliged to make it real to our eyes in an obscure and indistinct
   way, because he does not suppose that the event really happened, but
   only wishes to awaken an idea in the soul of the beholder? We shall
   call him nothing better than a bungler, if he fails to represent, in a
   stirring way, how Jesus, while the onlookers are nervously expectant,
   stands in front of the sepulchre and cries out with arm upraised,
   "Lazarus, come forth," while behind the stone door, which has been
   rolled aside from the hollow vault, is seen the figure of the dead man
   wrapped in bands. And are we ready to reproach the author of the Fourth
   Gospel for using his art with equal vigour and effectiveness--the art
   of painting with words, instead of with the brush? Are we ready to
   reproach him, because we do not believe that what he paints on his
   canvas really happened, and because perhaps he also did not believe it?

   Did he also not believe it? That would certainly be the most noteworthy
   aspect of the matter. Before we enter more closely into the question
   whether we ought to think this, we must take a wider survey. Clearly,
   the Raising of Lazarus is by no means the only instance in which a
   miracle is used to represent an idea. On the contrary, this point of
   view can be applied very easily to all the miracle-stories of the
   Fourth Gospel; and for the most part the Evangelist himself supplies us
   with a very clear clue. The legend which should be inscribed under the
   picture of the healing of the man born blind is found in viii. 12: "I
   am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the
   darkness, but shall have the light of life" (cp. ix. 5, 39). The
   Feeding of the Five Thousand is explained in the discourses attached to
   it, vi. 26-35a, 36-5la, as a spiritual enjoyment of the person of
   Jesus, he being described as the true bread that comes from heaven:
   people must take his whole nature into themselves, or in other words,
   must believe in him (vi. 28 f.). At the same time the Feeding is here
   meant to represent the Supper; if this were not so, there could not be
   mention in vi. 51b-58 of the eating of Jesus flesh and at the same time
   of the drinking (cp. what is already said in vi. 35b) of his blood, not
   a word having been said in the Feeding of the Five Thousand to the
   effect that Jesus handed a cup to the disciples. Here indeed emerges
   the quite remarkable fact that Jesus, about the time of the second
   Passover feast, which occurred during his public ministry (vi. 4),
   gives his disciples an explanation of the meaning of the Supper, which,
   according to the same Gospel, he did not celebrate with them at all,
   and according to the Synoptics not until a year later; yet the
   discourses in chapter vi. do not permit of the least doubt that the
   Supper is really alluded to.

   But if this is once assured, it is no longer difficult to recognise
   also the deeper meaning of Jesus' Walking on the Sea, which is linked
   to the Feeding of the Five Thousand as an event of the same evening.
   True, it might be thought that it has simply been taken over from the
   Synoptics, where also it follows the Feeding. But, as a matter of fact,
   Jn. does not repeat other miracle-stories found in the Synoptics. His
   repetition of this one, however, fits in very well with his purpose.
   When the Supper is celebrated at one and the same time in the most
   diverse places throughout the whole of Christendom, it is presupposed
   everywhere that Jesus is present at the celebration. Yet this could not
   be, if he were subject to the laws by which man is confined to the
   limits of space. Now, no single story in the Synoptics better expresses
   the idea that he was not so limited than that of the walking on the
   sea; consequently, it is certainly meant to serve to support the belief
   that at every celebration of the Supper Jesus is really near to his
   followers.

   In the case of the sick man at the Pool of Bethesda we have a clue as
   to how we are to understand his sickness, as regards the time it had
   lasted. For thirty-eight years the people of Israel had been obliged,
   as a punishment for their disobedience to God, to wander in the
   wilderness, without being permitted to set foot on the promised land of
   Canaan (Deut. i. 34 f., ii. 14). The sick man thus represents the
   Jewish people, and in the five porticoes of the house in which he has
   so long hoped for a cure (Jn. v. 2) we may easily recognise the five
   books of Moses, obedience to which had been no help to the people.
   Jesus was the first to be able to bring to an end the period of their
   banishment from the land of peace and quiet; but since the people had
   opposed the will of God, he was obliged to say first, "Wilt thou be
   whole?" (v. 6).

   The wine into which Jesus changed the water at Cana is then, of course,
   the new, glowing and inspiring religion which Jesus puts in the place
   of a weak Judaism. With this is grouped--and not without intention--the
   expulsion of the dealers and moneychangers from the fore-court of the
   Temple (ii. 1-11, 13-22). It was this act that showed most clearly how
   necessary it was to displace the old religion.

   Again, with the healing at the Pool of Bethesda is connected that of
   the son of the royal official at Capernaum (iv. 46-54; v. 1-18). In
   order also to understand this miracle-story, the last that remains in
   Jn., we must take note of the points in which it differs from that
   concerning the Centurion at Capernaum in Mt. (viii. 5-13) and Lk. (vii.
   1-10), a story which so manifestly lies at the root of it that perhaps
   the same event may be supposed to be intended in both cases. This
   centurion is a Gentile, who by his faith excels and puts the Jews to
   shame. In Jn., however, there appears in his place an officer of the
   king (so we read in Jn. as in Mk. vi. 14; Mt. xiv. 9 inexactly instead
   of "of the prince"; see Mt. xiv. 1; Lk. iii. 1, 19), Herod Antipas of
   Galilee, and we must take him to be a Jew, since, if he were not, the
   contrary would have been expressly stated. By his faith he also
   distinguishes himself, though not like the centurion by excelling all
   Jews, but only those who wish to see signs and wonders before they will
   believe in Jesus divine power. At first, no doubt in order to prove
   him, Jesus assumes that he shares the same disposition (iv. 48), but
   the man frees himself from this suspicion by taking Jesus at his word,
   when he says that he will make his son whole. We must, therefore, see
   in him a picture of that better section of the Jewish people which
   intercedes for the sick section; that is to say, for those who do not
   believe in Jesus. The latter is represented by the son of the official,
   just as in the other case it is by the sick man at Bethesda. Just
   because the sick man of the first story, like the sound official who
   makes petition for him, represents a section of the Jewish people, he
   must be described as his son and not as his servant, as in the case of
   the centurion of Capernaum according to Lk., and perhaps also according
   to Mt. Though the Greek word in Mt. (pais) may mean, not merely
   servant, but, equally well, son, and Jn. might keep this second meaning
   because it suited him better.

  18. THE FEEDING A FACT FOR JN. IN SPITE OF ALL?

   Thus in all the miracle-stories of the Fourth Gospel, a deeper thought
   can be recognised which they present vividly to us as in a picture.
   Now, as regards the problem suggested above (p. 97), when we were
   dealing with the Raising of Lazarus, whether in spite of all that has
   been said, the author held them to be actual occurrences, for the
   present this at least is clear, that the interest in the question
   whether a miracle really happened becomes secondary at once, if the
   miracle is used to represent nothing more than an idea. And so we
   discover in these stories some discord in the thought of the Fourth
   Evangelist. Side by side with the absolute value that he attaches to
   Jesus' works of wonder being recognised as real occurrences (p. 21), we
   note a certain indifference to the matter. Nor is it necessary to base
   this conclusion entirely upon our present examination; he has given
   even more definite expression to this indifference in other places.
   When many in Jerusalem believed on Jesus on account of his works of
   wonder, he did not trust himself unto them (ii. 23 f.), and Thomas, who
   would not believe on Jesus resurrection until lie had touched his
   wounds, was told, "Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have
   believed" (xx. 27-29). If we felt ourselves absolutely bound to go
   farther and to conjecture that Jn. first conceived his pictures in his
   own brain, just as a modern painter does, it would hardly be thinkable
   that afterwards he could have believed what he had depicted to be real
   events. What then is the truth?

   Something more certain from which to start in this matter is found in
   the Synoptics. According to Mk. (viii. 14-21) the disciples, when they
   journeyed across the Lake of Galilee, had forgotten to take bread.
   Jesus then says to them: "Take heed, beware of the leaven of the
   Pharisees and the leaven of Herod" (or according to Mt. xvi. 6, "and
   the leaven of the Sadducees"). They imagine that he wishes to warn them
   against procuring loaves from the Pharisees and the others. Jesus notes
   this and says, "Do ye not perceive nor understand? . . . and do ye not
   remember? When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how
   many baskets (full of broken pieces) took ye up? . . . And when the
   seven among the four thousand, how many baskets took ye up?" (so
   according to Mt.). "Do ye not yet understand?" Mt. fittingly completes
   Jesus utterance thus: "that I spake not to you concerning bread? But
   beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then understood
   they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of
   the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."

   Shortly before, Mk. and Mt. have recounted the Feeding of the Five
   Thousand and that of the Four Thousand as actual occurrences. When
   Jesus now reminds the disciples of these, they must have been confirmed
   in their first thought, that by the leaven of which they were to beware
   he meant real loaves, and must have believed that, to make up for the
   omission, he would procure them loaves in as wonderful a way as he had
   done in the case of the two Feedings. Now, it would in itself be very
   surprising that Jesus should have offered to repair a piece of
   forgetfulness on the part of the disciples by exercising his miraculous
   power. In such a case, we certainly could not speak of a higher divine
   purpose for which he used this miraculous power, and say that he was
   actuated by love and compassion. But such reflections are not really
   necessary. The result of Jesus calling to mind the two Feedings is
   this: the disciples see that he does not wish to speak of loaves; and
   this is simply impossible. Have the Evangelists, then, told us
   something that is meaningless? That would be equally inconceivable. How
   can they have come to say the contrary of what is as clear as daylight?

   The solution of the riddle is, however, not so difficult after all; we
   must only have the courage to think out the ideas of the story to the
   end. If the disciples by that of which Jesus reminds them are made to
   see that by leaven Jesus did not mean loaves but teaching, then in
   those earlier cases they cannot have seen and eaten loaves, but must
   simply have heard about loaves--and have heard too that the loaves
   meant teaching. In other words, the things of which they were reminded
   (and rightly reminded), when they thought of the Feedings, were not
   events in the life of Jesus, but discourses, in which he had compared
   his teaching with bread, by which the soul is satisfied. Now it
   suddenly dawns upon us also why more bread is said to have remained
   over than there was at first. Had the bread been real, this would have
   been a pure miracle. On the other hand, when Jesus propounds his
   teaching, it is quite natural that it should arouse new ideas in the
   minds of his hearers, and awaken new impulses; and that they them
   selves, enriching what they had heard by their own experiences and
   feelings, should carry it farther.

   It is not enough, therefore, to see that the two miracle stories were
   certainly one at the beginning, and only came to be regarded as two
   distinct events at a later date when through the carelessness of the
   narrators the number of the partakers, of the loaves, and of the
   baskets of broken pieces, was changed. We must go farther and declare,
   in all seriousness, that no miraculous feeding took place, nor even a
   feeding which merely appeared miraculous. It would be tempting to us to
   explain the matter by sup posing that very many persons in the crowd
   were provided with more provisions than Jesus and his disciples, and
   that Jesus example simply induced them to place these at his disposal.
   But had this been the case, the disciples could just as little, by
   being reminded of it, have been led to understand that by leaven Jesus
   meant teaching, as they could by being reminded of a real miracle of
   feeding.

   The only miraculous feature in the stories of the Feedings is therefore
   this: that by the side of them the story of the leaven of the Pharisees
   should also have found a place in the Gospels. Certainly Mk. and Mt.
   have not proved themselves very careful here; the words "Do ye not
   perceive?" apply to them also. But we have no reason to complain of
   them. If they had noticed the contradiction, they would certainly not
   have omitted the stories of the Feedings, but, rather, the narrative
   under consideration; and it would then have been much harder for us to
   recognise the real situation. In reality, they have faithfully
   preserved the narrative, because it had been transmitted to them. And
   we must recognise this with the greater satisfaction, because in other
   places in their Gospels we have been obliged to note many arbitrary
   alterations in the accounts, and because, again, it has not been
   possible for them to preserve correctly other matter, they themselves
   having become acquainted with it in a distorted form. Thus, for
   example, exactly what was narrated about Jesus' discourse concerning
   that remarkable bread (the teaching) which, when it was divided and
   partaken of, did not decrease but increased, will certainly at a very
   early date have been misunderstood by people who were not present, just
   as the Synoptists have misunderstood it, by including it in their books
   as a miraculous event.

   How does what has been said help us to answer the question, In spite of
   the fact that to Jn. the Feeding was in part a representation of the
   spiritual appropriation of the nature of Jesus, and in part a
   representation of the Supper, did he regard it as a real event? In any
   case, we know at least that if he did so, he was wrong. But since there
   was a time when it was known that it was not a real event, it is not
   altogether inconceivable that Jn. too derived this knowledge from that
   time. On the other hand, this again is hardly likely, for the
   Synoptists themselves no longer possessed the knowledge, and Jn. did
   not write until after them and drew upon them. Such reflections
   therefore will hardly clear up our question. Nor is there any other way
   of fathoming the inmost thought of the Fourth Evangelist: and if we
   could dig deeper perhaps we might not find harmony and clearness, but
   simply a struggle between two points of view, the literal and the
   purely figurative.

   But it is quite sufficient that to Jn. the story of the Feeding,
   regarded from one of these two points of view, serves merely to
   represent something spiritual. In this way he has in fact approached
   quite near, though perhaps in a very roundabout way (if he regards the
   Feeding as an actual event), to what we know from the Synoptists to
   have been the most original version--namely, that Jesus himself
   referred to the Feeding with bread simply as a figure-of-speech for the
   satisfaction of the soul by his teaching. The point of view in Jn. does
   not, it is true, agree with this quite exactly; but very much is gained
   already when we find him attaching no decisive value to the miracle as
   such. And the relatively slight divergence from the ideas of Jesus is
   at the same time characteristic of the general spirit of the Fourth
   Gospel. What, in Jesus' opinion, is offered to men to satisfy their
   souls is his teaching; what is offered them in Jn. is his person. To
   Jn. everything centres round his person; and even when he finds the
   Supper represented in the story of the Feeding, he imagines that when
   it is celebrated, it is the person of Jesus that in some mysterious way
   the partaker receives into himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  19. ARE THE OTHER MIRACLES FACTS FOR JN.?

   We must quote yet another passage from the Synoptics to elucidate the
   question as to what opinion the Fourth Evangelist held with regard to
   the miracle-stories. When John the Baptist was in prison, he sent his
   disciples to Jesus to ask whether he was the promised Saviour, or
   whether they must look for another. We must remember here that, from
   the time of the baptism of Jesus, John could not have been clear on
   this matter (see p. 79 f.). The answer of Jesus is almost verbally
   identical in Mt. (xi. 4-6) and in Lk. (vii. 22 f.): "Go your way and
   tell John the things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their
   sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and
   the dead are raised up and the poor have good tidings preached to them.
   And blessed is he whosoever shall find none occasion of stumbling in
   me." Could Jesus have done anything more calculated to destroy the
   effect of his words than, in his list of works of wonder which reaches
   a climax in the awakening from the dead, to specify at the end of them
   preaching to the poor, that is to say, something quite ordinary,
   something not at all wonderful, something which could not make the
   slightest impression on the disciples of John as an answer to their
   question whether he was the promised Saviour, their ideas of his
   superhuman power being what they were. Or may we suppose that the
   Evangelists have inappropriately added this from clumsiness? Assuredly
   not. They have taken the greatest possible care that we should read in
   their books of all the five classes of wonders which Jesus enumerates
   before this answer to the Baptist.

   Now, in both consistently (Mk. omits the whole story of the Baptist's
   messengers) there appear before this date only the healing of a leper
   (Mt. viii. 1-4 = Lk, v. 12-14) and of palsied men (Mt. viii. 5-13 = Lk.
   vii. 1-10; Mt. ix. l-8 = Lk. v. 17-26); and in Mt. (ix. 18-26), besides
   these, in agreement with the order of events in Mk. (v. 21-43), the
   awakening of the daughter of Jairus. This Lk. introduces too late for
   the answer to the Baptist's question (not until viii. 40-56). But,
   instead of it he has introduced earlier (vii. 11-17) the awakening of
   the young man at Nain, about which Mt. and even Mk. say nothing at all.
   On the other hand, Mt. ix. 27-34 introduces the healing of two blind
   men and a dumb man, about which Lk. and even Mk. are silent. In Jesus
   enumeration there is no dumb man, but mention is made of the deaf;
   since, however, both are described by the same Greek word (kophós),
   there do, as a matter of fact, appear in Mt. before chapter xi. all the
   ailments mentioned by Jesus. In Lk. the blind and the deaf are omitted.
   Instead of this, Lk. tells us in vii. 21 that in the presence of the
   messengers of the Baptist Jesus healed many blind and other ailing
   persons, about whom there is not a word in Mt.

   Both Evangelists, therefore, although in complete disagreement with
   each other, have been at pains to make Jesus enumeration appear
   literally true; and, this being so, could they have deprived it of its
   whole force by making so unsuitable an addition (concerning the
   preaching to the poor)? Or was it perhaps later copyists who did this?
   But even in their case, the matter would be equally inexplicable.

   There is here again, as in the question of Jesus utterance about
   leaven, only one solution: the most striking and seemingly the most
   embarrassing version must be the most original. Jesus himself must have
   added, "and the poor have the gospel preached to them." But he could
   only have done so if all the previously mentioned persons are on the
   same level, that is to say, if he meant spiritually blind, spiritually
   lame, spiritually leprous, spiritually deaf, and spiritually dead. And
   here again, just as in the case of the stories of feeding, the
   concluding words are intelligible only on this understanding. "Blessed
   is he whosoever finds none occasion of stumbling in me": this means
   that the Baptist should not take offence at Jesus for coming forward in
   such simple guise, as a mere teacher and prophet, and should recognise
   him as the promised Saviour, in spite of his humble appearance. This,
   in truth, was why John had had doubts on the matter. In thinking of the
   promised Messiah, he thought, as his whole race did, of a person who
   would come forward with superhuman power, drive the Romans from the
   land and set up a mighty kingdom, in which the Jews would reign.

   Here then we have a new instance how utterances of Jesus have often
   been faithfully preserved in the Synoptics. In this saying we may
   depend upon it that we have the words of Jesus in all essentials,
   particularly in their conclusion, just as he spoke them (the question
   whether he enumerated at the beginning one ailment more or less need
   not detain us); and this is the more noteworthy, since the Evangelists
   have entirely misunderstood it, and have made great efforts to show
   that their misunderstanding is right. At the same time, we have in it a
   new example of the way in which Jesus availed himself of figurative
   language which might easily be misunderstood, and which actually was
   understood in such a manner that objective works of wonder were
   supposed to be intended when he had spoken merely of spiritual
   experiences unaccompanied by any miracle.

   For the Fourth Gospel, therefore, we have here a foundation upon which
   to build if we would assume that not only the feeding of the five
   thousand, but also the healing of the man born blind, of the man
   paralysed for thirty-eight years, of the son of the royal official, and
   the awakening of Lazarus, were from the first meant to describe merely
   the healing of souls. It makes no difference, of course, if the son of
   the royal official is described as suffering, not from one of the
   ailments enumerated in Mt. xi. 5, but from a fever. In fact, by
   recognising this figurative style of speech, we may also venture to
   seek such an explanation of the last remaining miracles of the Fourth
   Gospel, the turning of water into wine at Cana, and Jesus' walking on
   the sea, even though these are not miracles of healing.

   We may not, of course, in any case go as far as to sup pose that all
   these stories, in their figurative meaning, actually came from Jesus
   himself. Had they done so it would be inconceivable that about most of
   them the Synoptics should know nothing. What we gather, therefore, is
   at most this, that the author of the Fourth Gospel still had correct
   information as to the metaphorical style in which Jesus delighted to
   express himself, and that he copied this in the spirit of his master.
   At the same time, it is true, we must reckon fully with the possibility
   that he did not gain this by first-hand knowledge of Jesus style of
   speech, but in the roundabout way described above: he believed that in
   all his miracle-stories he had to do with real events; not until later
   did they become to him figures for mere ideas, and the question whether
   they really happened become of but secondary importance. Not even now
   are we able to come to a decision upon these two points of view;
   perhaps indeed, as already intimated, Jn. could not himself have said
   which of them he had finally adopted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  20. TRADITIONS KNOWN ONLY TO JN.?

   In any case we must be quite clear that at the root of each of the two
   points of view there are quite distinct presuppositions. If Jn. from
   the first gave forth his miracle-stories merely as the figurative
   clothing of religious ideas, then we may be all the more certain that
   he invented them himself; he could not have had them from the lips of
   Jesus, for had that been their source the Synoptics also would have
   given them. If, on the other hand, Jn. regarded them as real events,
   then they must have come to him from some authorities in whom he had
   confidence. Is it possible perhaps to decide now which of the two
   suppositions is right? In other words, is there a tradition concerning
   the Life of Jesus which was known only to Jn. and remained unknown to
   the Synoptics?

   The far-reaching importance of this question can be realised at once.
   If Jn. was acquainted with such a tradition, he may have derived from
   it all that he has in addition to what the Synoptics tell us; and in
   this much else is included besides the miracle narratives we have been
   considering. On this basis very many people immediately think they may
   assume that all these additional matters are also historical. But the
   pleasure which they thus give themselves is premature. Supposing that
   Jn. drew from a tradition--for the time being we are willing to assume
   that he did--have we then disposed of the question, Why do the
   Synoptics know nothing about this tradition? Who was the first to know
   of it? Was it the Apostle John? Could he really, in Jesus' lifetime,
   have noted certain things of which Peter and the other apostles had no
   experience? And yet the Synoptists themselves drew from the
   communications of the Apostles or of their disciples! We might
   acquiesce, if the things which appear only in the Fourth Gospel were
   all minor matters, In that case, we might think that to the other
   Apostles or to the Synoptics they seemed to be unimportant. But the
   healing of the man born blind, the healing of the man palsied for
   thirty-eight years, the raising of Lazarus, the farewell discourses of
   Jesus, the washing of the disciples' feet on the last evening of his
   life, etc.!

   Or can we believe that some worshipper of Jesus--not further known to
   us--outside the circle of his twelve apostles, observed all these
   things, one, for instance, as people of late have been fond of
   suggesting, who lived in Judaea, and, having nothing to tell us about
   Galilee, had all the more to tell us about what Jesus did in Judaea? Of
   such an one it would be equally true to say that he could have observed
   nothing which the apostles did not also know of. Does not the Fourth
   Gospel say continually that they were all present on all these
   occasions?

   It is thus, besides, quite immaterial whether we assume the eye-witness
   in question (whether we think of him as the apostle John or as one who
   was not an apostle) to have written the Fourth Gospel himself or only
   to have given information to the author. In no case can what this
   person alone tells us be derived from actual observation of the events;
   for, if it were, we should read of it in the Synoptics as well.

   It may, nevertheless, have come to the Fourth Evangelist by tradition.
   The idea that a tradition must in all circumstances be correct is a
   very curious one. He to whom it is delivered may hold it to be correct;
   but before it reached him an error may have crept in. In view of what
   has been said, only on this presupposition is it worth while to speak
   of a tradition known only to the Fourth Evangelist. If we call it a
   "Johannine tradition," we must not be understood to mean that it
   started from the apostle John, but simply that it came by tradition to
   the Fourth Evangelist whom we, depending again upon a tradition, call
   John.
     __________________________________________________________________

  21. AMPLIFICATION OF THE STORY OF LAZARUS ON THE BASIS OF LK.

   But instead of instituting general inquiries into such a tradition, we
   will at once show by examples how we may very easily think of the
   matter. We do not by any means assert that it must really have so
   happened; it is quite sufficient if it may have so happened. We will
   start again with the most instructive story in the Fourth Gospel, that
   of the Raising of Lazarus. His name reminds us of the parable in Lk.
   (xvi. 19-31), in which a Lazarus appears by the side of a rich man. At
   first sight the two narratives seem to be radically different: in Lk.
   we have before us a figure in a parable, in Jn. a real person; in Lk. a
   poor and sick man who after his death is compensated for his
   sufferings, in Jn. a man for whom neither sufferings nor compensation
   come in question. But the two figures have at any rate one point of
   contact. The rich man in Lk. (xvi. 27-31) in his torment wishes Abraham
   to send Lazarus back to earth to warn the brethren of the rich man.
   Abraham answers, "they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
   them." The rich man objects: "Nay, father Abraham, but if one go to
   them from the dead, they will repent." Abraham, however, decides that
   "if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be
   persuaded if one rise from the dead."

   Let us now imagine this parable to have been discussed in a sermon. It
   is not difficult to conjecture what may have been said. The brothers of
   the rich man who have Moses and the prophets are, of course, the Jews.
   The preacher had thus a most excellent opportunity of proving the truth
   of Abraham's concluding words, to the effect that even one who had
   risen from the dead would not induce them to repent. Jesus had actually
   risen, and, notwithstanding, the Jews, with trifling exceptions, had
   rejected his preaching, though so many heathen had accepted it. Now if
   Lazarus, in answer to the request of the rich man, had been sent back
   to earth to preach to his brethren, he would have been made to do in
   the parable what, according to the belief of Christians, Jesus in
   reality did by his resurrection. If the preacher reckoned on his
   hearers possessing some intelligence, he may perhaps, with raised
   finger, have continued the parable thus: "as a matter of fact, Lazarus
   has risen, and the brethren of the rich man have not listened to him."
   Some hearer who had not understood the delicate meaning of this turn it
   may even have been a woman hearer--then went home, we may further
   imagine, and said: "To-day the preacher said that Lazarus has arisen."
   "Really, such a thing I have never heard." "But he said so without a
   doubt." "Who awakened him then?" "He did not say that. But who should
   have awakened him, if it was not Jesus himself?"

   In this way the kernel of the narrative in Jn. was provided: Lazarus
   has been awakened by Jesus. And without any idea of deception or
   forgery, without even any censurable indulgence in phantasies, but
   purely from a very excusable misunderstanding! We need not go on
   describing further how one little feature after another may have, now
   and again, been added. Let it suffice that this may very well have
   happened; and again without any idea of deception, but purely with the
   idea that the thing cannot well have happened in any other way. For
   instance, what was more natural than that Lazarus, before his death,
   should have been ill, and that Jesus should have been informed of this?
   If we only imagine a sufficient number of people contributing to the
   story, and adding one detail after another, the Fourth Evangelist in
   the end need only have dotted the i's, so to say, in order to get the
   story in due form into his book.

   This consideration is by no means unimportant. It relieves him of the
   charge of having himself invented the whole narrative. Certainly we
   could not shrink from making this charge, if the attempt we have made
   above, to explain the matter differently, might not be considered
   successful; for the fact that Lazarus was not awakened, we do not now,
   after all that has been said, need to prove. In fact, we should have to
   ask ourselves whether this reproach of having invented the whole
   narrative would really be a reproach, since quite certainly we could
   not reproach the preacher in question with it, if, relying on the
   intelligence of his hearers, he carried the parable of Lk. a step
   further and said, Lazarus has arisen. But we have preferred our own
   theory because it has enabled us to assume that the raising of Lazarus
   was "delivered" to the Fourth Evangelist as a real miracle, and because
   we can understand better how, at least in many passages of his book, he
   could attach so much importance to the fact of this and the other
   miracles having really happened (p. 20 f.).
     __________________________________________________________________

  22. OTHER AMPLIFICATIONS IN JN.

   Taking next the narrative of the healing of the man born blind, its
   origin could easily be understood on the sup position that some
   preacher discussed a story of the healing of another blind man taken
   from the Synoptics, and held the Jewish people to be meant by the man.
   In that case, it was very natural for him to say that this blind man
   was so from his birth. In a quite similar way, indeed, the discourse of
   Stephen (Acts vii.) aims at showing that the Jewish people had mistaken
   the will of God from the first. Some hearer who was not too attentive
   might easily have gathered from the discourse that Jesus had really
   healed a man who was blind from birth. In this particular case,
   however, we are in a position to say further how some of the details in
   the narrative in Jn. may have arisen. In Mk. viii. 22-25 we read that a
   blind man was made to see by Jesus, not at once but by degrees. If a
   preacher enlarged upon this, he might easily reach the thought: the
   spiritually blind only succeed gradually in recognising Jesus, the
   person who makes them whole. The thought is in Jn. ix. 17, 31-33, 38
   expressed in such a way that the healed man at first regards Jesus only
   as a prophet and a devout man sent by God, and only in the end comes to
   perceive that he is the Son of man, in other words, the Saviour of the
   world. Further, from the same passage in Mk. the point in Jn. ix. 6 is
   borrowed, that Jesus' spittle served as the remedy. The only new
   features are the way in which this is used, and the washing of the eyes
   in the Pool of Shiloah.

   For the story of the marriage-feast at Cana also (ii. 1-11) there were
   starting-points in the New Testament. In the future kingdom of eternal
   happiness people drink wine (Mk. xiv. 25). Figuratively, the new
   religion which Jesus introduces has already (in Mk. ii. 22) been
   compared with new wine which ought not to be poured into old skins; and
   the time during which Jesus is with his friends, whether in the present
   or in the future, is here (Mk. ii. 19) and elsewhere (Rev. xix. 7; Jn.
   iii. 29) described as a marriage festival. If we may believe that the
   Fourth Evangelist built his narrative upon these foundation stones,
   some one who was familiar with the figurative style of speech, or a
   number of such people, before Jn. may easily have done the same; and in
   that case the whole account would have been handed on to Jn. as a real
   miracle.

   The origin of the story of the healing at the Pool of Bethesda we may
   suppose to have been rather different (v. 1-16). Here a preacher may
   not have started with some parable which had been handed down as coming
   from the mouth of Jesus. But he might certainly have taken the story in
   the Old Testament (Deut. ii. 14) as his starting-point, according to
   which the people of Israel, in punishment of its disobedience, was
   obliged to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years. Thus, in a
   figurative discourse, having in view all the while the people's whole
   history down to his own time, he might have described the nation as a
   sick person, who for thirty-eight years had been bed-ridden. Five
   porticoes--thus he went on per haps to recall the five books of Moses,
   by obedience to which the Jews hoped to be made blessed--had the house
   in which he lay, but he did not become well; often as the water was
   stirred, which held out to him the hope of a cure, there was never any
   one there to help him to step in, until Jesus came and asked him, Wilt
   thou be whole?

   In this way the explanation may be applied to all the miracle-stories
   in Jn. which have not been taken directly from the Synoptics, like the
   feeding of the multitudes and the walking on the sea. Of other
   narratives, it perhaps suits best that of the washing of the disciples'
   feet. According to Lk. xxii. 26 f., immediately after the last occasion
   in his life on which he supped with his disciples, Jesus said, "I am in
   the midst of you as one that serveth." Now, washing the feet was one of
   the duties of the humblest servants. It may perhaps seem to us rather
   bold, but it is not unthinkable, that a preacher, wishing to describe
   very vividly Jesus condescension in serving his followers, may perhaps
   have said: "Jesus ministered to his disciples like the humblest slave;
   he compared himself with the servant who washes the feet of the guests
   at meal-time." Of course, he meant this only as a figure of speech; but
   it is very conceivable that it was understood as a real event which
   actually happened on the last evening of Jesus' life.

   But enough. We do not press the application of this method of
   explanation to other accounts in the Fourth Gospel; for we by no means
   wish to derive all accounts not included in the Synoptics from a
   "tradition" only known to Jn., but only those in which this can be done
   naturally; and so we leave every reader to judge in how many cases the
   method is appropriate.

  23. DIVERGENCE AS TO JESUS DEATH.

   We must look all the more closely now into the one, but very important,
   point in which, with much plausibility, people may find in Jn. a
   correct tradition based upon faithful recollection, a tradition by
   which the story of the Synoptics is shown to be faulty. It concerns the
   day of Jesus' death. According to all four Gospels, Jesus died on a
   Friday. This was, according to the Synoptics (Mk. xiv. 12, 14; xv. 1),
   the 15th of the month Nisan (corresponding almost to our April), but
   according to Jn. (xiii. 1, 29; xviii. 28; xix. 14, 31) the 14th. This
   means an extremely serious difference. On the afternoon of the 14th
   Nisan the lambs were slain in the fore-court of the Temple at
   Jerusalem, and then after sunset, at the meal of the Passover festival
   (the place of which is taken by our Easter festival), were eaten. The
   15th Nisan was the first of the seven days of the festival, and in
   sanctity and the strictness with which all work was refrained from, was
   almost equivalent to a Sabbath. It is important to remember that this
   is true also of the night between the 14th and the 15th of Nisan,
   because amongst the Jews the day began with sunset.

   The difference between Jn. and the other Gospels is seen, therefore,
   particularly in two points. According to the Synoptics, Jesus
   celebrated the Passover meal, together with his disciples, on his last
   evening. But not according to Jn.; according to his account, Jesus'
   last supper was, rather, on the preceding day, which was not a
   feast-day; and when the Jews ate the Paschal lamb twenty-four hours
   later, he already lay in the grave. Consequently his arrest,
   condemnation, crucifixion, and burial, which according to both accounts
   were compressed into less than twenty-four hours (to the next sunset
   after his last supper), also followed, according to Jn., on the
   working-day before the festival; but according to the Synoptics on the
   first feast day which involved strict suspension of all work.

   The following table will serve to make this clear. The days of the
   month Nisan, placed in the middle, are common to the Synoptics and Jn.
   The denotes the crucifixion of Jesus.

  24. DAY OF JESUS DEATH ACCORDING TO THE SYNOPTICS CONCEIVABLE.

   Was Jesus trial possible on the feast-day? It would seem not. And if
   Jn. is right, this point is so decisive that we may seek the truth in
   this Gospel everywhere else as well. He would, in that case, appear as
   the eye-witness whose purpose in his story is tacitly to correct the
   Synoptics (see above, pp. 52-57).

   But consider what this means. Hitherto, as compared with the Synoptics,
   the Fourth Gospel has always proved less correct, and often quite
   untrustworthy. Is this discovery to be all at once reversed? May we
   believe that the Synoptists have made a mistake like this even on this
   one point (the day of Jesus' death)? Can we, if we do so, believe
   anything else at all in their books on any one point? What took place
   in these last hours of the life of Jesus must have stamped itself
   indelibly on the minds of the disciples. How could they have told, or
   merely through an obscure recital have suggested to their hearers, that
   their Lord was present to partake with them of the Jewish paschal meal,
   if this was not the case at all? How can they have wrongly stated, or
   only suggested, that he was arrested, condemned, crucified, and buried
   on the feast-day, when all this seems to be made impossible by the
   sanctity of the day itself? Of course, up to the present it seems an
   equally great riddle that Jn. should have been led by some mistake to
   relate the contrary. But, in any case, we have the most .pressing
   occasion to see exactly whether the statement of the Synoptics is
   really unacceptable.

   According to Jewish law, as committed to writing in the Mishnah, the
   oldest part of the Talmud, about 200 A.D., in order to pass a death
   sentence two sittings of the High Council--that is to say, of the
   highest judicial court--were necessary, and a night must intervene
   between them. Now, since no judicial proceedings might be held on the
   Sabbath, a trial which might end in a death-sentence could not commence
   on the day before (and therefore also, we may be sure, on the day
   before the first day of the Feast of the Passover). On this view of the
   matter, the story of the Synoptics seems in all circumstances to be
   excluded; for, according to this, the first sitting took place in the
   night which to the Jews already formed part of the feast-day, and the
   second actually on the morning of this first feast-day (Mk. xiv. 17,
   53-64; xv. 1). But--and this is a point which is not usually
   noted--even the Johannine account would be impossible. Even if we
   assume that a trial of Jesus took place in the palace of Caiaphas
   (xviii. 24-28), as it had already done (xviii. 13-23) in the palace of
   Annas (Jn. does not tell us at all what happened before Caiaphas), we
   must still insist that between the two trials there intervened not a
   night, but only a few hours of one and the same night. If in conformity
   with the regulations a night was to be allowed to intervene between the
   two sittings, the trial, even according to Jn., could not have
   commenced; for, according to his account, the 14th of Nisan had already
   begun when Jesus was arrested, so that the second trial could not have
   fallen before the 15th Nisan, which would mean the great feast-day.
   Accordingly, as regards both stories, we cannot avoid devoting space to
   the following consideration.

   At this time the Jews were no longer allowed to execute a sentence of
   death; that could be done only by the Roman governor, and so at that
   time by Pontius Pilate, who was present in Jerusalem throughout the
   Passover feast with a force of soldiers which had been increased on
   account of the immense throng of people. But, this being so, it was of
   no importance to the Jews to pass the death-sentence formally, since
   they had to ask Pilate to confirm and execute it. They could achieve
   their purpose equally well by simply making their charge against Jesus
   before Pilate without previously condemning him. The high-priest, who
   always presided, required in the first instance, therefore, simply to
   declare that no judicial court would be held, but only a charge be
   prepared to bring before Pilate; in that case, the law we have
   mentioned would have proved no obstacle. We may well believe that the
   High Council had shrewdness enough to hit upon this expedient.

   Only consider, as regards the whole subject, how urgent the matter was!
   If, during the festival, the people were to declare for Jesus,
   recognising him as the Messiah, towards which recognition they had a
   few days before at Jesus entry into Jerusalem already made a very
   suspicious beginning (Mk. xi. 1-11), it would be too late to take
   action. The original determination to remove him had been formed even
   before the beginning of the festival (Mk. xiv. 1 f.). After the
   festival had started and Jesus had been arrested, not another hour was
   to be lost. The Christians heard nothing at all of that purely juristic
   observation of the high-priest, which we have conjectured; or they paid
   no attention to it for they saw in it, unquestionably and quite
   correctly, a mere excuse, and they held fast, in a way that we can very
   easily understand, to the familiar idea that the High Council was the
   highest judicial Court in their nation.

   Simon, who was compelled to bear Jesus cross, was coming at the time
   "from the country" (Mk. xv. 21). But who can say that he had been
   working there? He belonged, in truth, to Cyrene in North Africa, and
   therefore clearly was one of the number of pilgrims who had come to
   Jerusalem solely in order to keep the feast. At such a feast two
   million men may easily have assembled; for we know that about 65 A.D.
   256,500 paschal lambs were counted at the slaughter in the fore-court
   of the Temple, and no part of their flesh might be left over until the
   next morning (Ex. xii. 4, 10). Beyond question very many of those who
   had come to the feast must have passed the night outside the city, so
   that Simon may very well have returned to it before nine o'clock in the
   morning (Mk. xv. 25). The Greek words may mean not only "from the
   field," but equally well "from the country."

   Similarly, from the fact that the Synoptics call the day of Jesus'
   death "the day of preparation" we may not conclude that they support
   Jn. when he tells us in his gospel that it was a working-day. "Day of
   preparation," that is to say, day for making preparations, was in fact
   the name of every Friday, because people prepared for the Sabbath by
   doing the works which were forbidden on the Sabbath itself. And this
   would be equally appropriate if the Friday were a feast-day; for some
   kinds of activity forbidden on the Sabbath were allowed then,
   particularly (see Ex. xii. 16) the cooking of foods, which were kept
   warm from every Friday evening to be used on the Sabbath when there
   could be no fire. Mk. expressly says (Mk. xv. 42) that the day of
   preparation was "the day before the Sabbath"; cp. Lk. xxiii. 54; Mt.
   xxvii. 62.

   Jesus execution would not have been possible on the feast-day if the
   Jews themselves had had to carry it out. But as a matter of fact this
   was the business of Pilate; and what he did the Jewish authorities
   would not of course regard as a violation of the feast-day for which
   they could be held responsible. Nor was there any need to fear a rising
   among the people in favour of Jesus after Pilate had pronounced his
   sentence; it might be taken for granted that he would suppress anything
   of the kind with the utmost rigour.

   Still less does the burial of Jesus, which according to all four
   Gospels (Mk. xv. 42-46; Jn. xix. 38-42) was carried out before sunset
   on the very day of Jesus' death, prove that the first feast-day had not
   begun before this sunset, as Jn. would have us believe (according to
   the Jewish division of the day). All four accounts agree that Jesus
   died on a Friday. If then the time of burial had been delayed because
   this (according to the Synoptics) was a feast-day, it would have fallen
   on a Sabbath, a day on which it must have been still more strictly
   excluded. Moreover, the burial on the day of death itself is not merely
   a custom (see above, p. 19), but in the case of one who has been
   hanged, is expressly commanded in the Law (Deut. xxi. 22 f.).

   It was really forbidden in the Law (Exod. xii. 22) to leave the house
   in which the Passover meal had been eaten before the next morning. But
   this prohibition in view of the multitude of pilgrims, to which we have
   referred above, could certainly at this time no longer be obeyed. Even
   the custom enjoined in the same verse as well as in verse seven, of
   smearing the door-posts with the blood of the paschal lamb, was
   dispensed with. It seemed helpful to suppose that the practice had been
   ordained solely for the first celebration of the Passover before the
   Exodus from Egypt, and not for its later repetition (see v. 12 f.),
   though, as a matter of fact, in vv. 24 f. it is ordained "for ever."
   Jesus therefore may very well have gone to the Garden of Gethsemane
   with his disciples on the night which was included in the feast-day.

   So far then we have not discovered a single point in which anything
   that the Synoptics tell us would have been really impossible on the
   feast-day to which they refer it. The case seems to be different when
   we read in Lk. (xxiii. 56) that the women prepared ointments, and in
   Mk. (xv. 46) that Joseph of Arimathea bought a linen cloth in which to
   wrap the body of Jesus. True, we do not know whether these two things
   would be as strictly forbidden on such a feast-day as they were on the
   Sabbath. But if they were, the further question must always arise, Were
   the Synoptics really guilty of the great mistake of placing Jesus'
   death on a wrong day, or only of the small slip of recording on a
   side-issue something which the sanctity of the day made impossible?
   Would it not be quite excusable if they have pictured to themselves in
   a way that is not quite correct a matter which they did not witness
   themselves, and if they did so through not having a very accurate
   knowledge of Jewish regulations? Moreover, Mk. (xvi. 1), at any rate,
   says, in conformity with these, that the women did not buy the
   ointments until the Sabbath was over.

   Similarly, the Synoptics may have been led astray by a pardonable
   error, when they suppose that the band of men sent by the Jewish
   authorities to capture Jesus were armed with swords (Mk. xiv. 43, 48).
   To carry a sword on the Sabbath, and therefore probably also on the
   night which, according to the Synoptics, was part of the feast-day, was
   forbidden. But this at any rate is certain, that the use of police on
   days when there was an immense throng of people could in no case be
   rendered impossible by a command which prohibited the carrying of any
   weapon. In the Mishnah, in fact, only the following weapons are for
   bidden; cuirasses, helmets, greaves, swords, bows, shields, slings (?),
   and spears. We may well believe that the Jews were sharp-witted enough
   to hit upon something which could not be included amongst these, and
   yet was a weapon all the same. Perhaps the Synoptics give us a real
   clue here, when they say that those who were sent by the Jewish
   authorities were armed with staves as well as with swords.

   There is no reason to doubt that Jesus disciples had swords with them
   (Mk. xiv. 47). But they had themselves long given up the habit of
   painfully adhering to commands about such things as these. They had, of
   course, armed themselves on the preceding working-days, in order to be
   prepared against a sudden attack; and certainly on the night when they
   were exposed to greatest danger they would not have laid aside their
   swords, even though, strictly speaking, they were forbidden to carry
   them on the feast-day.

   Let us draw the conclusion! Apart from unimportant side-issues, in
   which we can easily believe that mistakes may have been made, the
   Synoptists tell us nothing that might not have happened on the
   feast-day. The account in Jn., according to which the whole thing took
   place on a working-day is, it is true, easier to understand, but it
   does not by any means provide the only explanation. And it cannot
   surely be postulated that an event must have transpired in a way that
   can be understood easily. If that were so, how many events would have
   to be struck out of the pages of history! It is not necessary to reject
   an account, unless it is thoroughly inconceivable. But, as we have
   shown, that is by no means the case with that of the Synoptists.
   Consequently, we are fully justified in accepting it, seeing that on
   other points we have always been able to give more credit to the
   Synoptics than to Jn.
     __________________________________________________________________

  25. THE DAY OF JESUS DEATH ARTIFICIALLY FIXED IN JN.

   True, it always remains a riddle how Jn. can have been led to give us
   his account, which, in view of what we have said, is necessarily wrong.
   But the riddle can be solved, and even Jn. himself expressly indicates
   how this may be done. According to xix. 31-36, Pilate, at the
   instigation of the Jews, gives command for the thighs of Jesus and of
   the two men who were crucified with him to be broken, that their death
   might be hastened, and that they might be buried before the sunset with
   which in Jn. the feast begins. But the soldiers find Jesus already
   dead, and therefore in his case do not carry out the command. Jn. then
   tells us that this happened in order that the passage in the Old
   Testament might be fulfilled: "a bone of him shall not be broken." Of
   whom? The paschal lamb (Ex. xii. 46). Consequently, Jn. regards Jesus
   as the true paschal lamb, and thinks that in him what is said of the
   paschal lamb in the Old Testament must be fulfilled. Paul had expressed
   the thought: "for our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ"
   (1 Cor. v. 7); Jn. elaborates it more exactly, and tells of the
   sufferings and death of Jesus as they must have happened if they were
   in precise agreement with the injunctions about the paschal lamb.

   He does this, it should be noted, not merely in the matter we have
   mentioned, where he tells us that Jesus bones were not broken, but in
   every case where there are injunctions in the Old Testament about the
   lamb which might have been fulfilled in Jesus as well. The lamb had to
   be slain in the afternoon (Ex. xii. 6; Deut. xvi. 6: towards evening,
   but in Jesus time as early as from one or two o'clock). In accordance
   with this, Jesus is still standing before Pilate (Jn. xix. 14) at
   midday, though, according to the Synoptics (Mk. xv. 25), he was
   crucified at nine o'clock in the morning. This, however, makes it the
   more difficult to understand why Jn. should represent that Jesus was
   already dead towards five o'clock in the afternoon, for we know that,
   by no means seldom, crucified men have continued to live on the cross
   for several days. Further, the lamb had to be chosen on the 10th of
   Nisan (Exod. xii. 3); in harmony with this, the anointing of Jesus in
   Bethany, which, according to the Synoptics (Mk. xiv. 8) as well as Jn.
   (xii. 7), is of the nature of a consecration for his death, is
   represented in Jn. xii. 1 as taking place on the sixth day before the
   feast, though Mk. xiv. 1 tells us that it happened on the second day
   before it (the first and the last day being included; reckoning
   backwards, therefore, from 15th Nisan as the first day of the feast,
   this gives us really the 10th Nisan). But, in particular, the day on
   which the lamb had to be slain was the 14th Nisan (Ex. xii. 6), and
   this now explains the whole dislocation which Jn. has introduced into
   the last events of Jesus' life. In the interest of an idea, to Jn. an
   idea of some importance, Jesus has been made to carry out to the exact
   letter, in his own person, the whole fate of the paschal lamb, in order
   to show that all the injunctions concerning it have now been fulfilled
   and so abolished for ever, and with them all the commands of the
   religion of the Old Testament.

   It might be doubted whether that Evangelist whose work Clement of
   Alexandria called--and certainly not unjustly--the pneumatic, or the
   spiritually-centred, gospel, can have attached such importance to this
   verbal fulfilment of the Old Testament. Yet Jn. has expressly drawn
   attention to the fact that when Jesus thighs were not broken, an Old
   Testament prophecy was fulfilled. And in like manner, it is only he who
   gives Jesus cry on the cross, "I thirst" (xix. 28), and adds that it
   was made in fulfilment of a passage in the Old Testament (Ps. xxii.
   16). It is only he who tells us (xix. 23 f.) that after Jesus
   crucifixion his cloak and his tunic were differently disposed of, and
   who adds here also that this was done in fulfilment of a passage in the
   Bible, the 19th verse of this same 22nd Psalm: "they divided my raiment
   among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots." The Synoptics
   introduce from this Psalm (besides the cry undoubtedly made by Jesus,
   "My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?") other matter that might
   serve to embellish the story of Jesus passion (Mt. xxvii. 39, 43); but
   they have rightly understood verse 19 to imply only one action (Mk. xv.
   24). Jn., in understanding it of two actions, shows, on the one hand,
   that he has no idea how often, times without number, in the Old
   Testament one idea is expressed by two clauses slightly differing from
   each other, and, on the other hand, how anxious he is to demonstrate in
   the history of Jesus the literal fulfilment of the Old Testament. Much
   as he felt himself to be exalted above it, so far as it contains
   injunctions as to life, yet in so far as the prophecies are concerned,
   he held fast very tenaciously, just as the apostle Paul did, to the
   thesis that "the scripture cannot be broken" (x. 35). Jesus says to the
   Jews in this Gospel (v. 39), "Ye search the Scriptures because ye think
   that in them ye have eternal life" (that is to say, have received
   assurance of eternal life), "and these are they which "in reality "bear
   witness of me" Compare further the quotations in xiii. 18 (compared
   with xvii. 12), xv. 25, xix. 37, xii. 38, and the reference to the
   serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness as being a symbol of the
   lifting up of Jesus on the cross in iii. 14 f.; also ii. 17, vi. 31,
   45, x. 34.

   The matter may therefore be summed up as follows. The Synoptics report
   that the arrest, condemnation, execution, and burial of Jesus took
   place on a day on which all these things would be associated with
   difficulties, but would by no means be impossible; and as to how they
   could have arrived at this, by mistake or of set purpose, if the day
   were really another one, no one has yet been able to offer a suggestion
   which is even remotely probable. In the case of Jn., on the other hand,
   we can tell point by point how he must have come to fix upon another
   day, supposing the Synoptics were right. As soon as we have perceived
   this, the question ought to be decided, Are we obliged to believe Jn.
   on this one point, even though in everything else we have been able to
   put so little faith in him?

   But if any one persists in giving the preference to Jn. here, we must
   ask him one more question in conclusion; to what are we to trace the
   agreement between the last acts in the closing day of Jesus' life and
   those associated with the paschal lamb? Is it chance? Chance in no less
   than four points? Any one who has not the courage to say this, should
   realise that only one supposition remains, and one which has been put
   forward only by the very strictest believers: God so arranged the
   course of the Passion that everything in it agreed exactly with the
   injunctions concerning the paschal lamb, purposing in this way to make
   men realise that Jesus died as the true paschal lamb, and thus did away
   with the Jewish feast of the Passover and the whole Jewish religion.
   This view may be found wholly unacceptable, and yet no defender of the
   statement of the days as given in Jn. can refuse to accept it, unless
   he is prepared to see here a really very remarkable accident.
     __________________________________________________________________

  26. THE STORY OF JESUS RESURRECTION.

   As to the occurrences after Jesus resurrection, especially as to what
   transpired at the empty grave, the Fourth Evangelist tells us so much
   that is not found in the other Gospels that it might easily be supposed
   we have here the words of an eye-witness. The more so because amongst
   these statements we find also one to the effect that the disciple whom
   Jesus loved--and whom to all appearance we might sup pose to be the
   author of the Gospel--hastened with Peter to the tomb. But if that were
   so, the story of Mk. (xvi. 1-8) and of Mt. (xxviii. 1-8) would be quite
   inconceivable.

   Their chief variation from Jn.--though in this feature Lk. agrees with
   him--is found, that is to say, in the statement that the women who find
   the tomb of Jesus empty are commissioned by an angel to bid the
   disciples go to Galilee, for there they would see their risen Lord.
   According to Mt. the latter event afterwards happened, and it must have
   been narrated by Mk. as well; but the original conclusion to his Gospel
   has been lost, and a much later supplement (xvi. 9-20) substituted for
   it. In Lk. and Jn., on the other hand, all the appearances of the risen
   Lord take place in or near Jerusalem. And this too seems really to be
   the only natural course. All the Gospels agree that Jerusalem was the
   place in which Jesus rose, and that the disciples were still staying
   there on Easter morning. Why, then, should the disciples be advised to
   go to Galilee in order that they might see Jesus?

   But for this very reason Mk. and Mt. could never have been led to tell
   us of this advice to the disciples to go to Galilee, if they had ever
   heard that Jesus appeared to the disciples in Jerusalem. In no case,
   therefore, can this account in Lk. and Jn. be the original one; for, if
   it had been, Mk. and Mt. would unquestionably have heard and accepted
   it. On the contrary, they must have known of only one account, to wit,
   that the appearances of the risen Lord had taken place in Galilee.

   Even in their case, however, it is remarkable enough that an angel
   should have to commission the women at the tomb to bid the disciples go
   to Galilee; and, as a matter of fact, judged by all that we may suppose
   to have happened, this story is not plausible. Only, the truth is not
   to be looked for in Lk. and Jn., but in quite a different quarter. In
   Mk. (xiv. 50) and Mt., that is to say, we read that when Jesus was
   arrested all the disciples forsook him and fled. Whither? Hardly to
   Jerusalem; for there what happened to Peter might only too easily
   happen to them: they might be identified as followers of Jesus. Mk.
   (xiv. 27 f.) and Mt., however, give us a further clue. When, shortly
   before his arrest, Jesus prophesied to the disciples that they would
   all forsake him, he added, "Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go
   before you into Galilee." The idea that he would reach Galilee before
   them agrees with the account of the angel's advice to the women; but it
   is really too obvious to see in this statement merely a veiled
   indication that the disciples made their escape to their native place,
   Galilee, and that Jesus appeared to them there, simply because they
   took up their abode there from the day of his resurrection or a little
   later (the distance is two or three days journey). Peter, too, after
   his denial of Jesus, would certainly have followed the rest.

   The mistake in Mk. and Mt., therefore, is not that they assume the
   appearances of the risen Lord to have taken place in Galilee, but that
   they suppose the disciples to have been still in Jerusalem on Easter
   morning. But it was this very mistake that must have suggested to Lk.
   and Jn. the necessity of making a change. If the disciples were still
   in Jerusalem after Jesus resurrection, these two Evangelists could not
   but suppose that here also Jesus must have appeared to them. But what
   to their mind, of course, was the correction of an error, in reality
   simply added to the -first mistake a second which was much greater.

   If, however, in view of this, Jn. does not by any means give us the
   truth on the main point, it is clear that in the details also we cannot
   expect to find it. For instance, in the story of Thomas, which is so
   beautiful in itself, but of which the Synoptics know nothing, and the
   scene of which, moreover, is likewise Jerusalem. In the case of the
   story of Mary Magdalene, attractive and affecting though it is to
   persons of delicate feeling, we can detect from a particular expression
   that it is not original, but a reconstruction of a story told in the
   Synoptics. In Jn. Mary Magdalene came to the sepulchre alone, and yet
   she says (xx. 2), "we know not where they have laid him." The plural
   here is only appropriate if there were several women, as in the
   Synoptics. In xx. 13, the mistake is avoided; Mary Magdalene says here:
   "I know not where they have laid him."

   And, lastly, the race of Peter and the beloved disciple to the
   sepulchre! This cannot have happened if the disciples were no longer in
   Jerusalem. But even if they were still there, we must still insist that
   the Synoptists never had any knowledge of this race; for, had they had
   any, who could believe that they would have been silent about it?
   Moreover, we can see here quite clearly step by step how the statements
   of the Evangelists developed. Although Mk. and Mt. presuppose that the
   disciples were still present in Jerusalem, they are quite unaware that
   any of them has visited the sepulchre (and this will be an echo of the
   truth that they were no longer in Jerusalem). Lk. already knows
   something about it, but only in the quite indefinite form (xxiv. 24):
   "and certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it
   even so as the women had said, but him they saw not." [6] Jn. already
   knows the names of the disciples and all the details of their visit to
   the grave.

   And how are these details told? The beloved disciple ran faster than
   Peter, came first to the grave, and saw the linen cloths lying in it,
   but did not go in. Peter went in and saw, in addition to the linen
   cloths, the napkin as well. Afterwards the beloved disciple went in
   too, saw and believed, that is to say, gained the faith that Jesus had
   risen. Thus, alternately the one gets an advantage over the other; but,
   first and last, the beloved disciple appears as the greater.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] Lk. xxiv. 12, according to which Peter ran to the tomb, saw the
   linen cloths lying, and departed to his home, wondering, certainly did
   not originally find a place in the Third Gospel but was only added to
   it subsequently as an abstract from the Fourth. Only, in Lk. the
   beloved disciple was ignored, because he was not known at all to the
   readers of the Third Gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

  27. INTRODUCTION OF CONDITIONS OF A LATER PERIOD.

   In proportion as it becomes less likely that this could have happened
   at the tomb of Jesus, the question becomes more pressing, Did it not
   happen in the later careers of the two disciples? We are reluctant to
   believe it, and yet it can hardly be otherwise: expression is here
   given to that later struggle for precedence between the two apostles.
   Peter excelled the beloved disciple by being bolder and observing more
   closely the details--of, we may now perhaps say without further ado,
   the life of Jesus; but in faith, that is to say, in the deeper
   understanding, the beloved disciple had the advantage.

   If any one should still have any scruples about seeing here so bold an
   introduction of the conditions of a later period into the story of
   Jesus' life, he will dismiss them, we should think, when he takes into
   consideration another passage of a similar kind. We refer to the words
   spoken by Jesus, iv. 35-38, on an occasion when there seemed to be a
   possibility of winning over the men belonging to the city of the woman
   of Samaria. The idea with which the author starts, that the fields
   (that is to say, the field of his operations among the Samaritans) are
   white already unto harvest, seems appropriate to the situation. But not
   a single word in the concluding sentence (iv. 38) is suitable. It is
   not true that, before the disciples, others laboured to win the
   Samaritans, or that the disciples themselves did so (cp. p. 13)--to say
   nothing of the idea that they afterwards entered into the labour of
   their predecessors. On the other hand, all these sentences are seen at
   once to be true, if we suppose that Jesus is here speaking of the
   Christian Mission, and in the way in which some one who was looking
   back upon the progress of this work during a number of decades would be
   obliged to speak of it. Then, and then only, is it appropriate to say
   that the one set of missionaries took the place of the other, and that
   the later only reaped what the earlier had sown (iv. 37 f.). Here then
   we can note clearly the careless way in which the author makes Jesus
   express views which could not have been formed until the much later
   period in which the author himself lived. But at the same time we can
   see further that such views do not apply to the Samaritans alone, nor
   even to them in a special sense, but to all the Gentiles. The author
   regards the Samaritans--who, as a matter of fact, were not recognised
   as fellow-countrymen by the Jews (iv. 9; Lk. xvii. 18)--simply as
   representatives of the whole Gentile world; it is in this that he finds
   the fields white already unto harvest.

   Again, the strange metaphor by which Jesus represents himself as the
   door through which a rightful shepherd comes to his sheep (p. 36) can
   be understood if we seek the explanation in the circumstances of a
   later period. And we can easily do this if we follow the clue provided
   in 1 Jn. iv. 1-3. The shepherds and the robbers contrasted with them,
   stand for two classes of Christian teacher; the former acknowledge the
   true faith in Christ, the latter disavow it. Strictly speaking, then,
   not Jesus himself, but faith in him is the door by which a true teacher
   seeks admission to the members of the Christian communities, as
   compared with false teachers who seek to force an entrance into the
   communities without any such passport, and so in an unlawful way, and
   try to capture the leadership of them. In the lifetime of Jesus of
   course these two classes of teacher were not in existence; they did not
   arise until a much later period. In x. 8, it is true, Jesus says that
   all teachers who came forward before him were thieves and robbers; but
   this is an entirely new thought, and the interpretation of the
   adjoining verses (x. 1-7, 9, 10a) cannot be made to depend upon it. In
   these verses teachers who came forward before Jesus cannot be meant,
   simply because they could never have been in a position to use him as a
   door.
     __________________________________________________________________

  28. PRECISE STATEMENTS OF TIME IN JN.

   The last thing which is made to tell in favour of the accuracy and
   fidelity of the Fourth Gospel consists of a number of passages in which
   the day, and even the hour, in which something happened is stated much
   more carefully than in the Synoptics. Thus i. 29, 35, 43; vi. 22; xii.
   12 commence "on the following day"; ii. 1 "on the third day"; in i. 39
   it is four o'clock in the afternoon when the two first disciples,
   Andrew and one who is unnamed, join Jesus; in iv. 6 it is twelve
   o'clock midday, when Jesus sits by Jacob's well in Samaria. The
   inhabitants of the town of Sychar having invited him to stay with them,
   he remains two days (iv. 40, 43).

   If these passages were shown to any one before he knew the rest of the
   contents of the Fourth Gospel, he would certainly form the opinion that
   the author must have been a companion of Jesus and deserves to be
   absolutely trusted even down to the smallest details. But after what
   has been said in the preceding paragraphs, it is no longer possible to
   think this. We have actually found that after Jn. has made a statement
   which is equally precise in form, namely, that Jesus baptised (iii. 22,
   26), a few verses later (iv. 2) he himself withdraws it (p. 55 f.). And
   what is it that happens on each occasion "on the following day"? In i.
   29, 35 f. the Baptist is said to have declared Jesus to be the Lamb of
   God which will take away the sins of the world; in i. 35-42 Andrew and
   an unnamed disciple are said to have been the first to become disciples
   of Jesus, and after them Simon, Andrew's brother, and he is said to
   have received from Jesus at once, without having given any further
   proof of his fidelity, the name of honour, Peter, that is to say,
   "rock." All this is diametrically opposed to the account of the
   Synoptics (p. 79 f.; Mk. i. 16-20), and has no likelihood in itself; in
   fact, if the Baptist had already called Jesus the Lamb of God, and
   Andrew (i. 41) had described him as the Saviour, it is quite impossible
   that Jesus should not have been recognised to be the Saviour until a
   relatively late date (see p. 33). But what is the use of the precise
   statement, that a matter happened "on the following day," if it cannot
   have happened at all?

   The only further question that we can ask is, how can Jn. have come to
   make such precise statements of time? And to this no other answer is
   possible but that he wished by this device to indicate more clearly the
   progress made in his story, or intended the words to introduce another
   important suggestion. When in chap. i. he has arrived at a new stage in
   the increase in the number of Jesus' disciples, he says that a new day
   is beginning. We cannot really be surprised at this in a man who is so
   little concerned about literal accuracy. It helps to make his story
   decidedly more vivid and impressive; and it is actually his purpose to
   paint pictures which will make an impression (see pp. 55 f. and 96 f.).
   The question whether the statements about Jesus journeys to the feasts
   (p. 9 f.) have arisen in the same way, or were actually "delivered" to
   Jn., we must leave undecided.

   The hours of the day in i. 39, iv. 6, which we mentioned above, may
   perhaps have a hidden meaning. If we cannot define it, it does not in
   the least follow that we have before us the account of an eye-witness.
   We have quite clearly a hidden meaning of the kind in vi. 4, when we
   are told that at the time of the feeding of the five thousand "the
   feast of the Passover was near." The discourses which follow are an
   explanation of the Supper (see p. 98). No one, however, could have
   known this, since the Supper does not take place in Jn., and in the
   Synoptics not until a year later. It must, therefore, have been hinted
   at in a hidden, though intelligible, way. With this, however, agrees
   the statement, that the Passover was near; for it was at a Passover
   festival that Jesus celebrated the Supper with his disciples. If this
   be correct, there would no longer be any occasion to consider seriously
   the idea that Jesus' ministry lasted for two years; for this is based
   entirely upon the statement about this feast of the Passover (p. 9 f
   .). But the idea also that it began shortly before a (preceding) feast
   of the Passover is simply founded on the fact that the expulsion of the
   dealers from the fore-court of the Temple, which Jn . transfers from
   the end to the beginning of the public work of Jesus, according to the
   account of the Synoptics happened at a Passover feast. The short space
   of two days, for which, according to iv. 40, 43, Jesus accepted the
   invitation to stay in the Samaritan town agrees with the time beyond
   which in the second century a travelling preacher was not allowed to
   stay as a guest and receive board.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONCLUSION.

   But enough. A book in which Jesus gives the explanation of the Supper a
   year before its celebration; in which 500, if not 1000, soldiers, when
   he whom they are sent to take prisoner says "I am he," recoil and fall
   to the ground (xviii. 3-6); in which one hundred pounds of spices are
   used to embalm his body (xix. 39), ought, at the outset, to be safe
   from the misunderstanding that it recounts real events. These three
   points are enough to show that it is dominated by complete indifference
   as to the faithfulness of a record; that importance is attached only to
   giving as impressive a representation as possible of certain ideas; and
   that the whole is sustained by a reverence of Jesus which has lost
   every standard for measuring what can really happen.

CHAPTER IV

  FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL AND THEIR ORIGINS.

   FROM all that we have said so far, it may have become more and more
   obvious, that what is decisive, in the thought and in the presentation
   of the Fourth Evangelist, is the conception of Jesus which exists in
   his own mind. This idea we must now follow up more closely if we are to
   advance from a mere comparison of Jn.'s picture of Jesus' life with
   that of the Synoptics, and from the conclusion that it deserves less
   belief, to the most underlying reasons why he has left us so incorrect
   a description of Jesus' life.

   For this purpose, in the first place we shall deal with a section of
   his book about which we have not yet spoken because the Synoptics do
   not contain one like it, we mean the prologue, i. 1-18. Something to
   which hitherto our attention has only been directed occasionally--the
   fact that Jesus before his earthly life lived a life with God in
   heaven--is here, at the very outset and with the greatest emphasis,
   placed at the head of everything, and is even surpassed by the
   explanation, "he was the word" (in Greek "the logos").
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. REVELATION THROUGH "THE WORD" (THE LOGOS).

   This remarkable expression has had a history of its own, and would in
   itself have quite justified the publishers of the
   Religionsgeschichtliche Volksbücher in allowing the Fourth Gospel a
   separate treatment. In all religions, it has been found again and again
   that the deity, if men are to learn to know its will and to aim at
   following it, must reveal itself. This it does, according to the belief
   of different peoples, in very different ways. But when it does so, for
   example, by natural events, by serious misfortunes, men do not know at
   first what they on their part ought to do in order to remove its anger.
   Special means are needed to find this out. Wise men must explain the
   will of God, whether they read it in the stars or in the flight of
   birds or in the entrails of sacrificial animals, or in whatever it may
   be. The prospect of doing this is far more auspicious, if there are
   prophets with whom God--as they themselves are convinced--really speaks
   in their inner man, in such a way that they can directly reproduce
   God's very words. It is not without reason, for example, that Muhammed
   in the Koran again and again emphasises the fact that he has proclaimed
   to his people "in clear Arabic" the will of God. But in the Old
   Testament, in which we have such abundant information about the
   prophets, there are "false" prophets besides the "true"; yet these
   quite certainly considered themselves to be the true, and the
   distinction between the two classes was of such real difficulty, that
   rules are given about it in the Bible itself which are quite
   impracticable and even contradictory (Deut. xviii. 20-22; xiii. 2-6).
   Clearly then the most helpful thing that could happen would be for a
   divine being, who could not make mistakes, to appear himself upon earth
   in order to speak immediately with men. Such a being would really
   deserve to be called the incarnate "word of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. THE LOGOS AS REASON.

   The Greek expression for "word" (logos), however, means at the same
   time "reason." This brings us to a second origin of this name for
   Jesus, and one which lies not so much in religion as in the
   contemplation of the Greek philosophers about the world as a whole. If
   we recognise in this world one order, it is natural to say that this
   world, as well as each individual man, possesses a "reason." The logos
   is then the reasonable order which rules in the world, and so we are
   able to express ourselves, even if we cannot believe that the world is
   ruled by a deity who possesses a consciousness of himself.

   In this sense Heraclitus (about 500-450 B.C.) introduced the term
   "logos" into Greek philosophy. Plato (427-347), without using this
   term, assumed a world of ideas in which the highest, the idea of the
   Good, represents the deity. These ideas he regards as the original
   patterns of which all particular things in the material world are only
   copies. The Stoics (from 300 B.C.) adopted the word logos and the idea
   of Heraclitus, that the logos is the reasonable order that rules in the
   world. On this view, therefore, particular things are adapted to the
   logos, just as, on Plato's view, they are to the ideas. In
   correspondence with the plurality of ideas in Plato, the Stoics divided
   the one logos into a plurality, which is called in Greek logoi. To the
   statement that these logoi are the originals or patterns of the things
   in the world, they added a second statement, that they are the powers
   by which the things of the world are established. So they compare the
   logoi with seeds of corn which have been scattered everywhere in the
   world and which have produced out of themselves the particular things.
   Thus it happens, on their view, that the deity which they see in the
   one logos, the world-reason, through its particular logoi creates all
   that is, in conformity with that original which it actually represents
   itself.

   We find the doctrine of the logos fully developed in the Jewish thinker
   Philo, who was twenty to thirty years older than Jesus. In his native
   city, Alexandria, in Egypt, he had the best opportunity of imbibing
   Greek philosophy, and of combining it with the ideas which he himself
   cherished as a Jew. Consequently, the logos is the pattern and producer
   of things, as we found it on Greek soil; but it cannot be the deity
   himself (that would conflict with Philo's Jewish faith); it is simply a
   second divine being, who is subordinate to the God of the Old
   Testament.

   In the Old Testament itself we also find the beginnings of a
   disposition to distinguish between God himself and a second divine
   being of this kind. In particular, the Wisdom of God is often
   represented as assisting God at the creation of the world; it then
   works in his sight for his delight (Job xxviii. 12-28; Proverbs viii.
   22-31; Ecclus. i. 1-10; xxiv. 1-12; Wisdom of Solomon vii. 22-30). This
   is, of course, only a figurative way of saying that God at the creation
   of the world made use of his wisdom; but the form of the world, which
   he conceived in this wisdom of his, before he made the real to arise in
   conformity with the ideal, may, with a little imagination, be regarded
   as the original of the world as it existed in the abstract, or as a
   kind of model of it. And we get some thing very like the expression
   "logos," when it is said that God created the world by his word (Psalm
   xxxiii. 6), because in Gen. i. 3 it is said, "God spake . . . and it
   was so." In the Hebrew Old Testament as translated into the Aramaic
   language current at the time of the Fourth Evangelist, and as recited
   in the Synagogue every Sabbath, in place of the name God, which the
   people had to avoid pronouncing, the expression "the word of God" was
   often put, even where, strictly speaking, it was not suitable.

   All this, and presumably in addition, legends about the gods, who,
   according to the religions of Egypt, Babylonia, or Greece, as the
   agents of a still higher Deity shaped the world and filled it with
   divine effects, Philo sums up, by representing that the Logos in itself
   was, on the one hand, only a faculty of God, by which he conceived the
   organisation of the world, and, on the other hand, a being who has come
   forth from God and brought God's influence into the world. In the
   second sense, we can call it a person, but in the former not; and the
   important point is that in Philo the Logos must always be a person and
   at the same time not a person. Were it only the one or only the other,
   some necessary aspect which it has would be neglected. Philo gives the
   Logos designations which only seem applicable to a person; for example,
   the first-born son of God, the high-priest, the mediator, the sinless
   one. We must not lose sight of the fact, however, that it always
   remains the power of mind in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. JESUS AS LOGOS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT EPISTLES.

   The idea has played a further part in the history of religion in the
   New Testament itself. The Fourth Evangelist, that is to say, is by no
   means the first New Testament writer to represent Jesus as the Logos;
   others did the same before him. Even Paul presupposes that, before
   Jesus appeared on earth, he lived a life with God in heaven (Gal iv. 4;
   Rom. x. 6). In doing so, he thinks of him, in spite of all his heavenly
   perfection, as a man in whose image earthly beings, especially men,
   were first created (1 Cor. xv. 45-49; xi. 8). In fact, according to one
   passage (1 Cor. viii. 6), he himself helped to carry out the creation
   of the world. In any case, he arose in quite a different way from human
   beings, and for this reason he is called God's own son (Rom. viii. 32).
   We can see how much there is here in agreement with Philo, whose
   writings or ideas Paul may have known very well. However, it is
   noteworthy that Paul was not so much concerned, as Philo was, to
   explain the origin of the whole world; had he been, he would have
   described Jesus as the prototype of the whole world and not merely of
   human beings.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews, whose author unquestionably knew Philo's
   writings, takes us a step further. To him Christ, before he descended
   upon earth, is no longer a man in heaven, but is a reflexion of the
   majesty and imprint of the nature of God, just as in a seal the imprint
   entirely resembles the stamp; he has not only created the world, but he
   also continually sustains it; that is to say, keeps it in existence (i.
   2 f. 10). The manner in which he proceeded from God is expressly
   described as a "being begotten" (i. 5), and he is accordingly called
   simply "Son of God," without further addition, and so with the
   implication that there is only one such (i. 1 f. 5; not so, however, in
   i. 6 "the first-born"). It is all the more note worthy that Jesus "in
   the days of his flesh offered up prayers and supplications with strong
   crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and
   . . . though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he
   suffered" (v. 7 f.), and that he "in all points like as we," men, "was
   tempted, yet without sin" (iv. 15), This true recollection of real
   events in the life of Jesus can only be reconciled with the description
   of his God-like elevation before his earthly existence by supposing, as
   Paul does in 2 Cor. viii. 9 and Phil. ii. 6 f., that when he descended
   upon earth he emptied himself of his heavenly powers, and assumed the
   form of a man, even of a servant.

   The Epistle to the Colossians (the most important sections of which
   cannot have been written by Paul himself) adds to the two statements,
   that through Christ the world was made and is maintained in existence,
   a third to the effect that it was created for him, so that he is thus
   its goal (i. 15-17). Moreover, it calls him the image of the invisible
   God, and in doing so, explains even more clearly than the Epistle to
   the Hebrews why God needed such an image. But, above all, in the
   Epistle to the Colossians we find the idea of the humiliation of Jesus
   on earth inter changed with its opposite. It is said in ii. 9, "in him
   dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; and this is true, not merely
   from the time of Jesus resurrection, but even during his heavenly life
   before his earthly existence, and then even during his earthly life
   itself. We read for instance in i. 19 f., God "was pleased that in him
   should all the fulness dwell, and wished" (afterwards) "through him to
   reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood
   of his cross, &c." If the author had thought as Paul did, he would not,
   directly before the mention of Jesus' sacrificial death, have
   emphasised the fact that God endowed Jesus with all the fulness of the
   God head. The whole of the Gospel of Jn. is an amplification of this
   briefly suggested thought, that in Jesus all the fulness of the Godhead
   dwelt on earth, as in heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. MINGLING OF RELIGIONS AT THE TIME OF JN.

   Before, however, we can show this, it remains necessary to review
   another part of the history of religion; that is to say, the mingling
   of the religions of the Babylonians, Persians, Egyptians, Syrians,
   people of Asia Minor and Greeks, in the last centuries before Christ.
   Amongst nearly all these peoples there were legends of gods, goddesses
   or sons of gods, who came down from heaven to earth to contend with
   hostile beings. One such foe is the great serpent of the Babylonian
   religion. It represents darkness, and the floods which in that country
   made the winter such a joyless season. It is conquered by the sun of
   spring, which is of course thought of as a god. In other religions the
   struggle associated with the change in the year's seasons was
   differently represented, but in such a way that the identity of the
   thing could not be mistaken.

   Another purpose for which the gods had to descend from heaven is found
   in the belief that the soul of man is from heaven and yearns after its
   home, but cannot find the way, unless a being descends from above and
   releases it from the prison in which it is held captive. This idea also
   had received, in different religions, different, but not altogether
   dissimilar, expression.

   But even that the world might be created or organised, subordinate
   divine beings had to help as soon as a religion was dominated by the
   belief that the highest God, if He was to continue to be perfectly pure
   and divine, could have nothing to do with the world.

   But, further, it must be possible to say, as regards these divine
   beings, how they arose; and their origin, as can be easily understood,
   was represented in such a way that one always proceeded from the other
   or was born from two others, thought of as male and female. Here we
   have reason enough for the existence of a number of divine figures in
   every religion, whose derivation from one another, whose rank,
   friendship and enmity amongst one another, whose activity in favour or
   to the detriment of men, it was a somewhat intricate problem to solve.

   When, especially from the end of the fourth century, Alexander the
   Great's expeditions brought all the well-known peoples, and many more
   which were less important, into frequent contact, there was an
   interchange of ideas, even as regards their gods. The agreement between
   so many divine forms in the different religions was recognised, and the
   manner in which such and such a god was worshipped in one country was
   transferred to the related god in another, so long as people believed
   that, by doing so, they could better assure themselves of his help. In
   brief, a complete mingling started, which made this whole world of
   deities not only an intricate, but even a confused, puzzle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. GNOSTICISM.

   Gnosticism drew upon this mingling of religions. This was a very
   important movement, but is so difficult to present in detail that we
   must be content to give only the most noteworthy outlines. Gnosis means
   "knowledge"; and this is in fact the first and most important point,
   that one must have a great fund of knowledge to be able to know all
   these doctrines about the different divine beings, and at the same time
   a great deal of penetration rightly to apprehend the deep thoughts
   which were hidden under such wonderful clothing. These Gnostics, or
   Knowers, were at the same time men who thought deeply about the origin
   of the world; and their ideas were again taken up by several of the
   most prominent philosophers of the nineteenth century.

   One idea which continually recurs in their systems is that a deep
   division runs through the world. God is by nature good, pure,
   unspotted; the matter of which the world consists is also by nature
   evil, impure, tainted. God cannot therefore come into contact with this
   matter; and it would have remained for ever unorganised and devoid of
   any divine influence, if subordinate divine beings had not imparted
   this to it and converted it into an organised world. They do it,
   however, in a very imperfect way; for their own knowledge is quite
   limited. This is why the world is so faulty.

   The soul and the body of men are by nature just as much strangers to
   one another as are God and the world. The soul comes from heaven,
   whether it be supposed that the creator of the world, that is to say,
   one of those divine, but subordinate, beings, created it, or that it
   represents a spark which emanated from the highest God Himself and
   descended into the gloomy kingdom of the world. The body, however, is a
   part of that matter of which the world consists, and therefore shares
   all its evil characteristics. Through the senses, and the spell which
   they exercise, it drags down the soul into the domain of the vile and
   common, and estranges it from its divine destiny. It is its prison, and
   the soul cannot escape from it, partly for the very good reason that it
   is no longer conscious of its divine origin. If, therefore, it is to be
   redeemed, some one must come who will first make it realise that it has
   come from God. But this can only be a being who has himself come from
   God, and possesses the knowledge of the divine in full measure--in
   other words, a god.

   All Gnostics who confessed themselves Christians have found this being
   in Christ as he appeared upon earth. But the division which exists
   between the soul and the body of every man, of course affects him also,
   and even in a much stronger degree. A being so high and divine cannot
   really have a body which consists of earthly matter. Consequently, the
   Gnostics could only explain in one of two ways. Either the Christ who
   came down from heaven was only in an external way united to an ordinary
   man Jesus, who was born of Joseph and Mary, but was righteous in a
   peculiar degree: that is to say, he came down upon him at the baptism
   in the Jordan, but left him again before he suffered death, so that the
   person who underwent suffering was only the man Jesus. Or the heavenly
   Christ, during the whole of his sojourn upon earth, possessed himself
   of a phantom body, so that all his human acts, such as eating,
   sleeping, suffering, &c., were nothing more than appearance.

   From what we have said, it will be clear that the chief task of this
   redeemer was to make the soul of man realise that it is of divine
   origin. But many souls are not able to apprehend this truth; and so the
   same disastrous division again makes itself felt, and separates men
   into two classes. In the nature of the case, it is very conceivable
   that the great sum of knowledge and the great depth of thought
   appertaining to Gnosis, could not be within the reach of many simple
   people. But the Gnostics assumed that the question who can attain to it
   has been decided long before one comes to know it; from eternity there
   are some, namely the Gnostics themselves, endowed with the capacity to
   appropriate it as soon as it is imparted to them, whereas to others
   this faculty is denied from eternity, and therefore they could never be
   happy.

   From the time when the soul of the Gnostic comes to know its divine
   origin it is, strictly speaking, released from its fetters. A new life
   begins for it, and from this point it is already sure of returning to
   heaven as soon as death emancipates it from the body. For this reason,
   in 2 Tim. ii. 18, and of course in a tone of reproach, the doc trine of
   the Gnostics is represented thus: "the resurrection is come already."
   And it is a resurrection only of the soul. The body can in no way share
   in the eternal happiness; it abides for ever in death. The Gnostics are
   equally firm in rejecting the idea that the Christ, who has risen and
   been exalted to heaven, will return to earth again, when the dead will
   be awakened and their works judged. Every soul at the moment of death
   of itself reaches its final state of happiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. THE PROLOGUE OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   We may now turn to the opening words of the Gospel of Jn. They read:
   "In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the
   Logos was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
   made by him; and without him was not anything made that hath been
   made." None of these statements is now new to us. Only, we must guard
   against misunderstanding the third, as if it meant: God himself was the
   same being as the Logos--which in fact would not agree with what has
   already been mentioned. It would be equally wrong to make the statement
   mean the contrary: the Logos was a god. The sense is rather: the Logos
   was of divine nature (just as in iv. 24 the words "God is spirit" mean:
   God is of a spiritual nature, has a spiritual nature). This is really
   what we should expect: the Logos is not God Himself, but of like
   nature. Similarly, we may expect that he was from the beginning, and so
   existed before the creation of the world, and with God, and that by him
   the whole world was made. What Paul, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and
   the Epistle to the Colossians have said with increasing precision, only
   without using the word Logos, is here expressed by the Fourth
   Evangelist quite in the language of Philo.

   It should therefore never have been doubted that Jn. borrowed the word
   Logos and the ideas associated with it from Philo. And if we were
   inclined to take offence that such an important idea should have come
   to the Biblical author from an extra-Biblical writer--though in truth
   there is nothing objectionable in it--yet we can console ourselves with
   the thought that Jn. has shown great independence. He continues in
   verse 14, "and the Logos became flesh, and dwelt among us." The idea
   that the Logos could become flesh would have been to Philo something
   impossible. We see then that Jn. gives the idea an entirely new turn.
   Only, it would be a misunderstanding to interpret it: the Logos was
   transformed into flesh. The sentence is certainly opposed to the idea
   of the Gnostics, according to which the Christ who had come down from
   heaven was not a real man. But Jn., nevertheless, agrees with them
   inasmuch as he thinks the transformation of a divine being into a
   fleshly being cannot be imagined. A more guarded statement therefore
   would be: he became man, or as we read in 1 Jn. iv. 2 and 2 Jn. 7, he
   came in the flesh that is to say, not "he came into flesh," but "he
   came, clothed with flesh; he came forward with a body consisting of
   flesh." It is possible that, as against the Gnostics, the expression
   "he became flesh" was a more sharp than useful definition from the
   point of view of clearness.

   In other places also it is clear that Jn. does not on all points reject
   the ideas of the Gnostics. Certainly he will not hear of their many
   divine beings, but knows of the one true God and of Jesus Christ whom
   he has sent (xvii. 3). But this Christ is to him, as to the Gnostics, a
   necessary mediator between God and the world, and in his view, exactly
   as in theirs, he must for a definite time appear upon earth. These last
   ideas are, it is true, shared also by Paul, the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   and the Epistle to the Colossians; the first especially by the Epistle
   to the Colossians, in which God, just as in Jn. i. 18, vi. 46, is an
   invisible God and Christ his image (Col. i. 15). But what Jn. has in
   common with the Gnostics alone is the idea that it was Christ's most
   important work to communicate a certain kind of knowledge to men.

   At the end of i. 14: "and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only
   begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth," we have, further,
   the most peculiar term which Jn. applies to Jesus to describe precisely
   the sense in which he is the Son of God. The Greek word monogenes means
   the only son w r ho was begotten by his father, and that, in ordinary
   human relations, means of course the single son produced by a father.
   This being so, a satisfactory translation would be: "the only son."
   Since, however, in Jn.'s Gospel, by the side of Jesus as the Son of
   God, there appear very many children of God among men, the second part
   of the expression also acquires a special sense: Jesus is the only son
   of God who was begotten by Him; all others have been produced by Him in
   another way.

   Thus we must understand the idea of the author--even though just before
   he has spoken of men who are able to be come children of God, and has
   used a related Greek expression to the effect that they were begotten
   from God. Those are meant of whom the Gnostics say they are able to
   apprehend the idea of their heavenly origin because they come from God.
   But that Jn. thought of Christ as having arisen in another way, having
   been begotten in a more peculiar sense, is seen already in the
   persistence with which he applies the name "son" solely to him, and
   always calls all others the children of God (see p. 64).

   But at the same time he has perhaps chosen the name monogenés, because
   several Gnostics, in their long list of divine beings, used it of a
   being different from the Logos, that is to say, of an older being and
   one standing in a closer relationship to God. Of him Jn. will not hear.
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. JESUS AS LOGOS THROUGHOUT THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   But the most important feature in this expression, "we saw his
   majesty," &c. (i. 14) is this, that the whole Gospel is nothing but an
   amplification of it, This explains the continual insistence on the
   omnipotence and omniscience of Jesus, the omission of the baptism, the
   temptation, the anguish in Gethsemane; it explains the prayer at the
   grave of Lazarus, which was only for the sake of the people, the saying
   on the cross "I thirst," which was only in fulfilment of a passage in
   the Bible, Jesus inviolability when attempts were made to capture or to
   stone him, the falling down of the Roman battalion when he said "I am
   he" whom ye seek, his continual reference to his own person and to his
   life with God before his descent upon earth, his ambiguous style of
   speaking without considering whether his hearers could follow him, his
   continual demand that they must believe in him, his continual assurance
   that only faith in him could give eternal life; his unvarying
   uniformity from beginning to end, his opposition to "the Jews" without
   distinction, his superiority to "the law of the Jews" and "the feasts
   of the Jews," and the colourlessness of the figure of the Baptist, who
   is only permitted to point to Jesus. This explains, in particular,
   certain utterances of Jesus which we have not yet mentioned: "And now
   (that is to say, now that I am taking farewell of the earth), Father,
   glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with
   thee before the world was" (xvii. 5), "before Abraham was, I am" (viii.
   58). The "I am" seems really to be senseless. But, as a matter of fact,
   there is a purpose in it, and it alone gives the sentence its real
   force. Strictly speaking, two sentences have been compressed into one:
   "before Abraham was, I was" and "I am eternal and, being such, have no
   change." Next and last, iii. 13, "No man hath ascended into heaven" in
   order to bring information, "but he only" can bring it "who descended
   out of heaven, the Son of man, which is in heaven," that is to say "who
   is simultaneously in heaven continually," not "who was in heaven." The
   four last words are omitted in important manuscripts, but only, we may
   be sure, because the copyists thought they went too far. They very
   appropriately reflect Jn.'s idea about Jesus, and were therefore
   certainly written by him. Finally, the positive summing-up of Jn.'s
   view is expressed by Thomas in the last words addressed to Jesus in the
   Fourth Gospel (xx. 28), "My Lord and my God." In the rest of the New
   Testament Jesus is called "God" only in Heb. i. 8 f. (Tit. ii. 13?); in
   1 Tim. iii. 16; Rom. ix. 5, he is only so called through a wrong
   reading or faulty punctuation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN TRAITS IN JESUS.

   From tins can now be gathered how greatly Jn.'s style of thinking is
   misunderstood when an attempt is made to find traits of a real humanity
   in the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel. Those who do this, for instance, in
   the case of the raising of Lazarus, or those even who are only
   disturbed by the thought that no such traits can really be found, have
   quite misunderstood the peculiar character of this book. Humanly
   speaking, Jesus must have been so cruel as to keep away from Bethany
   for two more days, because otherwise the miracle which he proposed to
   do would not have been so great as if it did not happen until the
   fourth day after Lazarus' death. We ought not. however, to apply this
   human point of view; if we are to do the Evangelist justice, we ought,
   just as he does, to identify our selves to such an extent with this Son
   of God who has come from heaven, as to approve entirely of his
   demonstrating his exaltation, his dignity, and his omnipotence in the
   strongest possible way. So long as it is what is truly human in Jesus
   that attracts us, we are totally unfit to enter into the ideas of the
   Evangelist, for he is attracted only by what is divine.

   This is, in fact, so much the case that the human in Jesus is more
   sternly set aside than the Evangelist himself desires. He would like
   certainly to oppose the Gnostics, amongst whom the heavenly Christ was
   united with the man Jesus only superficially and for a limited period,
   or only had a phantom body to deceive the eyes of men. To meet this
   latter idea, he insists that there flowed from the wound, which was
   made by the spear-thrust in the crucified Lord, blood and water (xix.
   34); and perhaps he has the same thing in mind when he says that Jesus
   sat down tired by Jacob's well (iv. 6), and so forth. In this Gospel
   again Jesus speaks of having always observed the commands of God (xv.
   10) and of being studious to do not his own will, but the will of God
   (v. 30). But how does all this help us? This kind of obedience can
   hardly be said to have the same value as the obedience of a man to God,
   for Jesus simply could not act otherwise; he himself speaks of doing
   the will of God as being his food (iv. 34). He can even say "I and the
   Father are one" (x. 30); and the reason for this is not that he
   entirely subordinates his own will to the will of his heavenly Father
   (he does indeed do this, but only because it was natural for him to do
   so), but that he, and he alone, was begotten of God, that he, and he
   alone, was of like nature with God.

   This is as clear as daylight, when he walks over the sea, or when, on
   an attempt being made to stone him, he makes himself invisible in a
   miraculous way; when his soul is affected by no feelings of passion;
   when he keeps away for two days from the place where his friend has
   died, in order to set his miraculous power in a brighter light; when
   Philip is made to see in his person, as he stands before him, God the
   Father. Here he is actually, in hardly a different way than he is
   amongst the Gnostics, a God walking upon the earth, whom one can only
   worship in astonishment. A man whose possibilities are exposed to
   limitations, as those of others are, who thinks and feels like others,
   to whom one can cling, because he has first trodden the same path and
   experienced the same difficulties, whom one can gladly follow--no, he
   is nothing of this. The Fourth Gospel knows nothing and can know
   nothing of the great consolation which the Epistle to the Hebrews (ii.
   18) gives to all such earthly pilgrims: "because that he himself hath
   suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."

   Nevertheless, we shall refuse to reproach its author for this, in
   proportion as it becomes clear to us that the task which he set before
   himself was from the first impossible of achievement. Nor has any later
   teacher in the Church been able so to reconcile the divine and human
   nature in Jesus, that a real and consistent personality has been
   produced. The important point, therefore, is simply to recognise on
   which of the two sides in Jn. the scale turns. Those who persist in
   attempting to reconcile the two natures, are not agreed, even down to
   the present day, as to whether they ought to say, as Paul says (see
   above, p. 146), that Jesus, when he came down from heaven to earth,
   laid aside his divine characteristics, or that he kept them, hiding
   them during his earthly life. As regards the Fourth Gospel, we must say
   that it quite certainly does not take the first of these positions. And
   even as regards the second view, it only presents the thought that on
   earth Jesus was endowed with all his divine characteristics; their
   concealment is very slight and transparent, and does not really accord
   with the purpose of Jesus' public ministry, which in Jn. consists
   simply in revealing himself in all his greatness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. KINGDOM OF GOD AND KINGDOM OF THE DEVIL ACCORDING TO JN.

   Although the figure of Jesus claims almost the whole attention of the
   Fourth Gospel, we must, in order to realise its fundamental ideas and
   discover their origin, look into Jn.'s answer to the question, What is
   God's relation to the world, and the world's relation to God? We have
   been obliged to touch upon this already; for the whole descent of
   Christ from heaven to earth would not have been necessary, if God by
   His own work had made the world according to His will. There is,
   therefore, in Jn., strictly speaking, exactly the same deep division
   between God and the world as exists in the system of the Gnostics. And
   to this he gives expression often enough.

   Two kingdoms, we should almost say two worlds, are contrasted, the one
   which is above, and the one which is below; from the one is Jesus, from
   the other are the Jews (viii. 23). This lower kingdom is also called
   the earth; it is, therefore, quite literally supposed that Jesus came
   down from that heaven which forms an arch over the earth (iii. 31).
   Elsewhere, the lower kingdom is called also "this world," or simply
   "the world"; heaven is consequently never included in it. The upper
   kingdom is that of light, truth, life; to the lower belong darkness,
   deception, and death (i. 5; iii. 19-21; viii. 44; vi. 47-54). The ruler
   of the upper kingdom is, of course, God; the ruler of the lower is the
   devil (viii. 44). Paul also has already called the devil the god of
   this world (2 Cor. iv. 4), but he has not set up any thing like so
   harsh an opposition between it and the kingdom of heaven. In Jn. this
   opposition is based on the thought that God cannot come into contact
   with the world, because the matter of which it consists is evil by
   nature and God would be denied by any contact with it. This idea is not
   only represented in the Gnostic system, but is found even in Plato, and
   has thence become the common property of many Greek philosophers, and,
   in particular, of the Jews also who, like Philo, made the philosophic
   thinking of the Greeks their own.
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. CHILDREN OF GOD AND OF THE DEVIL.

   The consequence, strictly speaking, was that all men were incapable of
   receiving any divine gift. But the other idea also, which we have found
   among the Gnostics, that the souls of men come from the upper kingdom,
   was very widespread. But not all souls. And so the Gospel of Jn.
   reveals that deep division, which separates God and the world, even
   between those men who are begotten from God (i. 13), and those who are
   the children of the devil (viii. 44). It is only another mode of
   expressing this, when it is said in iii. 6, "that which is born of the
   flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit." And
   this sentence would lose all force, if we were to continue: but that
   also which is born of the flesh can become spirit and vice versâ. If it
   is to have any value, we must complete it thus: that which is born of
   the flesh is and remains flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is
   and remains spirit. Further it accords entirely with this when in viii.
   47 it is said: "ye hear not" the words of God, "because ye are not of
   God," or in viii. 43, "ye cannot hear my word?" or in vi. 65, "No man
   can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father." And when
   he is leaving the earth, Jesus utters those words in xvii. 9 which may
   well startle us: "I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou
   hast given me." In fact, if this were the Evangelist's last word, he
   could not be distinguished from a Gnostic; only destined men could come
   to know the truth, and redemption would consist merely in enabling
   these alone to recognise their heavenly origin and so to achieve their
   emancipation from the prison formed by their body.
     __________________________________________________________________

  11. SOFTENING OF THE OPPOSITION,.

   The Evangelist, however, does not actually go so far. He already
   declares against the Gnostics when in i. 3 he says that by the Logos
   the world was made, and so not, as they taught, by subordinate divine
   beings, who had no correct understanding of the way to do it, but by
   the highest and only representative of God. True, if we were inclined
   to conclude from this, that this Being must have made it quite
   according to God's will, it would certainly be hard to under stand why,
   notwithstanding, it is a kingdom of darkness, deception, and death. The
   division between God and the world, which the author has accepted from
   the philosophical thinkers of his time, is therefore not really set
   aside; but the author has made a move in this direction.

   In the next place, we are told in v. 22, in the spirit of the same
   harsh division between God and the world, that God judges no one, but
   has committed the whole work of judging to the Son. As regards other
   works, however, he does not deny that God exercises them in the world;
   for example, God attracts to Jesus the men who from the beginning were
   destined to come to him (vi. 44). But we have, in quite a special way,
   the expression "world," in which the change of Jn.'s mode of thought is
   revealed. When Jesus declines to pray for the world (xvii. 9), the
   world includes only those men who are children of the devil. Similarly,
   in xv. 19, "be cause ye are not of the world, . . . therefore the world
   hates you." Between these two parts of the sentence, however, we have
   the clause, "because I have chosen you from the world," and here the
   word "world "has a wider sense; it includes all men, even those who,
   since they could be chosen, were from the first children of God, and
   therefore, according to the more limited use of the word, are not "of
   the world." Similarly in xvii. 6, "I manifested thy name unto the men
   whom thou gavest me out of the world." But expressions like that in
   iii. 16 f. go even beyond these: "For God so loved the world that he
   gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth on him should not
   perish, but have eternal life. For God sent not the Son into the world
   to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him":
   that is to say the whole world, and not merely individuals singled out
   of the world (similarly xii. 47; i. 29; vi. 33).
     __________________________________________________________________

  12. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JN. AND THE GNOSTICS.

   The importance of these differences between Jn. and the Gnostics cannot
   be overstated. By its very nature, Gnosticism was unable to make itself
   master of the world, because it was, and aimed at being, a religion
   restricted to a limited number of privileged persons. The simple man,
   the simple woman, could never hope to be numbered amongst these. All
   the valuable and exalted elements contained in the Gospel of Jn. could
   only be saved for the Church, and so for all future times, by the
   author's declaring them to be destined for all men. "God willeth that
   all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth": this
   saying (1 Tim. ii. 4) possesses telling force; and the author of the
   Fourth Gospel has not failed to notice it.

   It was not less important, however, that he should have differed from
   the Gnostics in his teaching about the creation of the world. The
   belief in one God could not be held to consistently if one of the most
   important kinds of work which the pious gladly ascribe to Him, the
   creation of the world, was carried out in a very faulty way by
   subordinate and unintelligent beings. Many Gnostics went so far as to
   see in this unintelligent creator of the world the God of the Old
   Testament of whom it is said, that he produced the world. He was then
   regarded by them as a being quite different from the real God.

   In consequence, however, the Old Testament, which was likewise regarded
   as his work, seemed at the same time to be a useless and abortive book,
   though at that time it was the only holy book which Christians who
   adhered to the Church .had (the New Testament writings were not
   regarded as holy until towards the end of the second century, and in
   large part had not yet been written at the time when Gnosticism made
   its way into the Christian communities, that is to say, about the year
   100). By such ideas, simple Christians, who on all questions thought
   they might rely on the Old Testament, were thoroughly confused. It is
   perhaps for this reason that the author of the Gospel of Jn. emphasises
   the statement that Holy Scripture could not be annulled (see p. 129).
   The Gnostics supposed that it was quite a new revelation which Christ
   brought from heaven; if, however, as Jn. represents, this Christ was
   the same being who had made the world, simple believers might rest
   assured that everything which they received as a revelation through the
   Old Testament and the teaching of Christianity was in agreement.

   As regards this Christ, however, if one followed the Gnostics, one
   could not take seriously what Christian tradition had to communicate
   concerning his life upon earth. Take, for example, the death on the
   cross. It was this, according to the common belief of the Church, that
   brought salvation to mankind; but according to the Gnostics another
   person, an ordinary man, must be supposed to have suffered, or the body
   of Christ was merely a phantom figure. In this way, the whole
   foundation of the faith of the Church crumbled to pieces. It was of the
   highest importance to receive the assurance that it really was the
   redeemer himself who was concerned in all the records of the Gospel
   story.

   And this was all the more important, because the existence of the
   Church at that time was very seriously endangered. On the one side, the
   Gnostics attracted a large following. On the other, the old habit of
   worshipping the pagan deities and a continued intercourse with
   relatives and friends who had remained pagan, enticed people back to
   the old beliefs. Above all, however, the persecutions of Christians,
   which from the beginning of the second century followed upon one
   another all too quickly, made it really difficult for the young
   community to persist in its faith. And though we, at the present time,
   reject so much that was at that time accounted a necessary part of
   Christianity, and has perhaps been clung to with a tenacity which may
   be vexatious to us, yet, in judging past periods, we ought never to
   forget one thing, that something which we can dispense with to-day may
   at an earlier date have been in dispensable because people had not
   anything better to cling to, and that perhaps we might not have had
   Christianity as a whole to-day if in time of danger it had not been
   kept intact by means which we should no longer think of using. Had the
   martyrs, for example those at Lyons in the year 177, not cherished so
   firmly the conviction that God would bring together from the ocean
   every particle of the ashes of their burnt bodies, which the Romans
   scattered in the Rhone in mockery of their faith, and so at the
   resurrection would completely reunite their bodies with the old shapes,
   who can say whether they would have endured their terrible tortures
   with that firmness which made their persecutors on the very next day
   adopt the same faith and themselves go to death on its behalf?

  13. JN.'S LEANING TO THE TEACHING OF THE CHURCH.

   When the author of the Fourth Gospel takes up another position,
   different from that of the Gnostics and more akin to the faith of the
   Church, arid yet in many points agrees with them we would like much to
   know whether this mingling is due entirely to a want of clearness or
   whether it admits of a more satisfactory explanation. At that time,
   when so many competing ideas were brought to the notice of the
   individual, it is not inconceivable that many persons might appropriate
   something of one and some thing of another, without being able really
   to blend the two. Many other persons, however, will have attached
   themselves entirely to the one at first, and afterwards have had a
   leaning to the other, without having given up everything that at an
   earlier time they had accepted as true. We may suppose the author of
   our Gospel to have been in this position. Not that he was in process of
   passing from the teaching of the Church to Gnosticism, but, on the
   contrary, of passing from Gnosticism to the teaching of the Church.
   This, of course, is merely a conjecture. It, however, strikes us as
   probable, because we may presume that the Gnostic ideas would be more
   prominent and not so strongly combated if the author had been by way of
   attaching himself to them. Instead of this, they appear, in the main,
   sporadically; and are withdrawn or made harmless by other utterances.
   If this consideration be correct, the easiest explanation would be that
   the author was attached to the Gnostic ideas at an earlier date, and at
   the time he wrote had not succeeded in banishing them entirely from his
   mind, but to all intents and purposes had now passed beyond them to
   where he now stands.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONCLUSION.

   There still remain many important ideas in the Fourth Gospel that would
   repay discussion. But we cannot take them up here. In Part II. of this
   book we shall discuss them from a new point of view.

   We trust that readers who have followed us so far will also give their
   attention to the briefer investigations to be undertaken there. Not
   only have we still to deal with the whole question, when and by whom
   the Fourth Gospel was really composed--which we shall deal with in
   connection with the same question as regards the three Epistles and the
   "Revelation" of Jn.--but we propose to add a few words as to the value
   of these remarkable writings for the time of their authors and for all
   times.

   Whoever desires to know no more than this, whether the Fourth Gospel
   gives us correct knowledge of the Life of Jesus, might stop at this
   point. He would then throw the Gospel on one side like an instrument
   which for any definite purpose is useless. But a book is not a mere
   instrument. It is the work of some man who, if he does not dryly add
   one note to another without being really interested in his work,
   introduces into it, perhaps unconsciously, but to a more delicate mind
   unmistakably, a part of his own soul. And from what we have already
   said it should be clear that, in the case of the Fourth Evangelist,
   this was so to a quite specially high degree. The more we have so far
   found him to be wrong, when he differs from the Synoptics, the more
   anxious we become to read his soul, by finding out the ideas and needs
   by which he was actuated, and to search lovingly for what it is that
   exercises such undeniable power of attraction over even the strictest
   of his critics.

ORIGIN AND VALUE OF THE GOSPEL, EPISTLES, AND REVELATION OF JOHN.
     __________________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION.

   AMONG the twelve Apostles of Jesus a prominent place is taken by John,
   son of Zebedee and brother of the first of the two Jameses who were
   included in the band of twelve disciples. Tradition tells us that five
   of the writings contained in the New Testament are by him: the Fourth
   Gospel, the three Epistles of John, and "Revelation." By the side, on
   the one hand, of the first three Gospels, and, on the other, of those
   Epistles which were either composed by the Apostle Paul or have been
   wrongly ascribed to him, these writings form a group of their own in
   the New Testament which is quite as important as the others; and any
   one who proposes to examine them, must of course regard them all
   together.

CHAPTER I.

  AUTHOR OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL AND DATE AT WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN.

   WHAT has been said in Part I. contributes a very great deal towards the
   decision of the question, By whom and at what date was the Fourth
   Gospel composed? But it may be pointed out that all this was based
   solely on one definite view of the contents of the Gospel, and that
   besides this another is possible according to which the contents
   thoroughly deserve to be believed, have no connection with Gnosticism,
   or were directed against it--and so forth. Far more certain, we are
   told, are statements of men belonging to the oldest Christian times,
   who were still in a position to know the exact answer to our question.
   It will be seen whether they are more certain. In any case, we must
   hear what they are.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. PAPIAS' TEACHER IN EPHESUS: JOHN THE ELDER.

   Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, who wrote about 185, and nearly all the
   Christian writers of later date are unanimous in saying that the Fourth
   Gospel was composed by the Apostle John, who lived in Ephesus during
   about the last third of the first century and took a leading position
   in the eyes of all the Christian communities in the West of Asia Minor.
   Irenaeus, who must have been born about 140, in his early youth stayed
   at the house of the aged Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna in Asia Minor, who
   died in the year 156, and he often heard him speak of his teacher John.
   He adds that Papias also, the companion of Polycarp, who was afterwards
   bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, was a hearer of the Apostle John.

   But the latter statement is a mistake. Eusebius, the author of the
   first History of the Church (ob. 340) has in an earlier work simply
   repeated it from Irenaeus; in the History, however, which was written
   later, he has corrected it and, in proof of his right to do so, appeals
   to Papias own words in a work which, apart from this quotation, has
   been almost entirely lost. We shall give this memorable passage in
   order to show how a documentary statement may prove the incorrectness
   of extremely important ideas which have not been doubted by any one for
   centuries. Papias' book contained, as we know from its title,
   "Expositions of the Sayings of the Lord" Jesus. In the Introduction
   Eusebius found the following: "I shall not hesitate to gather up for
   you, with the expositions (belonging to the same), as well all that I
   once learnt well from the mouths of the elders and committed well to
   memory, I myself guaranteeing the truth of it. . . . But whenever any
   one came who had enjoyed intercourse with the elders, I inquired
   (firstly) about the sayings of the Elders, (as to) what Andrew or Peter
   said, or what Philip or what Thomas or James or what John or Matthew or
   any other of the disciples of the Lord (said), and (secondly) what
   Aristion and John the Elder, the disciples of the Lord, say."

   Quite a number of important inferences may be drawn from this. (1)
   Papias gathered his information partly from the persons whom he calls
   "the Elders," partly from their disciples. (2) The Greek word which we
   render "the Elders" is presbyter. We cannot use this Greek word itself,
   because it would be understood to mean, as it does still in the
   Reformed Churches, leaders of a Christian community. But such an office
   is no guarantee that its holder could give what Papias needed--reliable
   memoranda of the Life of Jesus based as far as possible on personal
   observation; such a guarantee could only be given by persons of great
   age. Papias was born about 70; even if he began to collect his
   information at twenty years of age, the people who could tell him
   anything which they had learned by experience from their association
   with Jesus--that is to say, about the year 30--must have been already
   well advanced in years. (3) Jesus twelve apostles would have been the
   proper people to have spoken to, but Papias did not speak to any of
   these. It would really be very unnatural for him to wish on his own
   part to guarantee for the first time the truth of what he had heard
   from such all-important persons. But, besides this, he expressly tells
   us that he inquired about the sayings of the Elders from companions of
   the Elders--inquired as to what Andrew and the six others first
   mentioned said, and what Aristion and John the Elder say. It is clear
   that only these two were still alive when Papias gathered his
   information, and that those who are mentioned before them were no
   longer living. But these are actually seven of Jesus twelve Apostles;
   and there can be no idea of his having spoken personally to any of the
   five others, since he would not in that case under any consideration
   have failed to mention it. (4) We must therefore distinguish four
   stages: the twelve Apostles whom Papias no longer knew, the elders whom
   he still knew, their disciples, and lastly Papias himself. (5) Papias
   distinguishes between two persons with the name John: the Apostle and
   the person whom he calls "John, the Elder." Both belong to the
   "disciples of the Lord," but each in a different sense. The Apostle was
   a constant disciple of Jesus; the other was not; in fact, it may be
   that he only heard Jesus a few times in his early youth. When the first
   century came to an end, and the persons who could boast of a personal
   acquaintance with Jesus died out, it became easier for the title of
   honour, "disciple of the Lord," to be applied to one who, strictly
   speaking, little deserved it. (6) Papias may very well have known this
   second John. This need not be doubted on the ground that he inquired
   about his sayings of other persons; this only became necessary when he
   himself could no longer speak to him, either because he was living in a
   remote place or because he had died. In all probability Papias wrote
   his work between 140 and 160. At that time the John who had seen Jesus
   could certainly no longer be living; he may very well have lived during
   Papias youth.

   We must assume with the greater certainty that Papias really knew him,
   because Irenaeus says that Papias was a hearer of the Apostle John, and
   yet, according to his own statements, he no longer knew the Apostle.
   Here then we have the confusion of which Irenaeus was guilty: Papias
   certainly had a John as his teacher; this, however, was not the
   Apostle, but John the Elder.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. POLYCARP'S TEACHER IN EPHESUS: JOHN THE ELDER.

   The confusion might appear harmless. It affects Papias merely; but the
   man with whom we are concerned, who told the young Irenaeus about his
   former teacher, the Apostle John, was Polycarp. But why does Irenaeus
   call Papias a companion of Polycarp, unless it be because both of them
   in their early youth had the same teacher? Both lived in Asia Minor,
   and when they were young there was only one John in Asia Minor. It was
   left for a Christian writer in the third century to note that there
   were statements about both John the Apostle and John the Elder which
   indicated Ephesus as their dwelling-place; and because he knew of no
   other way of adjusting these, he was obliged to think that the two men
   lived there simultaneously. But no one belonging to the earlier period
   has any knowledge of this, and it is clear from our records, every one
   of which knows only of one head of the Christian Church in Asia Minor,
   that there was no room for the two men at the same time. Irenaeus must
   therefore have been as much mistaken about Polycarp's teacher as about
   the teacher of Papias; and Polycarp was the disciple of John the Elder,
   not of the Apostle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. THE APOSTLE JOHN NOT IN EPHESUS.

   Another thing that lends the strongest support to this conclusion is
   the fact that none of the Christian writers before Irenaeus knows
   anything of a stay of the Apostle John in Asia Minor; and yet this same
   John, who on the occasion of the meeting of Paul with the original
   apostles at Jerusalem (Gal. ii. 1-10 and Acts xv.) appears by the side
   of Peter and James (the brother of Jesus) as one of the three pillars
   of the first community, is one of the most important persons in
   primitive Christianity.

   We will point to one fact only. When Paul took fare well of those who
   presided over the community at Ephesus (Acts xx. 29), he prophesied
   that after his departure fierce wolves would force a way in and would
   not spare the flock. This farewell address was not actually so
   delivered by Paul, but was composed by the author of the Acts (between
   about 105 and 130) in accordance with his own ideas a liberty which
   every ancient historian took with the speeches of his heroes, and which
   no one thought wrong, seeing that the most famous of the Greek
   historians, Thucydides (about 400 B.C.), expressly declares (I. xxii.
   1) that he followed this plan in his work because it would have been an
   impossibility to have reported the exact words of the speeches as
   delivered. But how could the author of the Acts of the Apostles, who
   was as full of a feeling of veneration for the original apostles as he
   was for Paul, have introduced into Paul's speech so unfriendly an
   utterance about his successors, if he had any idea that the most
   important and influential of these was the Apostle John? But, further,
   if it be supposed that Paul actually made the utterance, without, of
   course, having any idea of the person of his successor, how could the
   author incorporate it in his book, and thus seriously impede his own
   main purpose--that of showing the unanimity subsisting between Paul and
   the original disciples--instead of quietly ignoring it, as he does so
   much that is unfavourable to the original apostles and their adherents
   (so we learn from the Epistles of Paul; e.g., Gal. ii. 11-21; i. 6 f.;
   vi. 12 f.)?
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. CONFUSION OF THE TWO JOHNS.

   But, as a boy, Irenaeus often heard Polycarp himself speak of his
   teacher John; how, then, can a mistake have been possible as to which
   John was meant? Well, the riddle explains itself. Both Johns were
   "disciples of the Lord." As a rule, Polycarp only needed to say, "my
   teacher John, the disciple of the Lord," and the young Irenaeus only
   too easily made the mistake of supposing that he meant the apostle, who
   was perhaps the only John of whom he had so far heard. In fact,
   Irenaeus himself says regularly in his book, when he means the Apostle
   John, as we have just conjectured that Polycarp did, "the disciple of
   the Lord," whereas for Paul he always uses the expression "Apostle."

   Once a mistake of the kind had arisen, the statement would be believed
   only too readily. The community in a city thought it a great honour to
   have been founded by an apostle, or led by one for some time. In the
   second century the idea grew up that the bishop of a community must
   have been consecrated to his office through the laying-on of hands
   either by an apostle or by a bishop who had received his own
   consecration at the hands of an apostle. It was thought that the
   capacity to fill the office of bishop, the so-called "charisma of
   office," could be transferred from one person to another only through
   this laying-on of hands by a consecrated person, and the first of such
   a series must always be an apostle. Thus it was naturally of the
   greatest importance to be able to show that in the past an apostle
   himself laboured in the community. Every one believed that he attended
   to the consecration of his successor; otherwise doubts might arise as
   to whether a bishop was properly consecrated.

   We must not suppose that the confusion by which Ephesus was given an
   apostle, instead of one who was not an apostle, as the leader of the
   community is an isolated case. In the Acts of the Apostles (vi. 5) we
   find included among the seven almoners of the community at Jerusalem a
   Philip who, according to xxi. 8 f., was an evangelist, that is to say,
   a missionary, and had four daughters who were endowed with the gift of
   prophecy. At the end of the second century this same Philip was
   identified with Philip the Apostle. Thus Hierapolis, where he is
   supposed to have stayed at the end of his life, was provided with an
   apostle as the head of the community.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. EARLY DEATH OF THE APOSTLE JOHN (IN PALESTINE).

   Where then, if it was not he but John the Elder who led the Church of
   Asia Minor in Ephesus, did John the Apostle live, and why are we not
   told another word about his fate since the meeting in Jerusalem we have
   mentioned (Gal. ii. 1-10)? As regards this also Papias gives us
   information, but this time in another sentence of his book which became
   known to scholars only a few years ago: "John, the man of God, and his
   brother James were killed by Jews." We are also told this about James
   in the Acts of the Apostles (xii. 2); he was executed at Jerusalem in
   the year 44 by Herod Agrippa I. Of the John who was head of the Church
   in Ephesus we know the contrary: there is no other record but this,
   that he died a natural death at a great age. But there is really no
   contradiction here, if we realise that this was a different John from
   John the Apostle. Besides, in Ephesus, where the Jews were closely
   watched by a foreign power, they would hardly have dared to lay hands
   on the bishop of the Christian community. It would be quite different
   if the Apostle John, whom, as we learn from the story of Papias, they
   killed, lived in Pales tine. And as a matter of fact at the meeting
   with Paul (about 52) mentioned above, he, as well as Peter and James
   (the brother of Jesus), declared this intention: they wished to go as
   missionaries to the Jews (Gal. ii. 9).

   Only, we must beware of misunderstanding the words of Papias as if he
   meant that John and his brother James were killed at the same time. If
   that were so, it would certainly be impossible to understand why only
   the death of James is reported in the Acts of the Apostles. But besides
   this, the idea that they died together does not suit the words of
   Papias. No one has ever said that John the Baptist was killed by Jews;
   every one says, by Herod Antipas (Mk. vi. 17-29). Similarly, if Papias
   had meant to say that the two brothers had perished at the same time
   and on the same pretext he would have said: they were killed by Herod
   Agrippa 1. When he says, instead of this, "by Jews," it is most natural
   to suppose that John at least perished in such a way that no such
   notable person as a prince could be referred to as the author of his
   death. The sooner we can suppose the death of John to have taken place
   after the year 52, the easier it is to understand, on the one hand, why
   we do not hear more of his work, and, on the other, how the John in
   Ephesus, alongside of him, could become so prominent that in the end he
   was confused with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. RESULT AS FAR AS THE FOURTH GOSPEL IS CONCERNED.

   The result as far as the Fourth Gospel is concerned is as follows. The
   earlier the apostle died, the less easy it is to think that he wrote
   the Gospel. It is almost universally admitted that the first three
   Gospels were completed before the fourth; and of these the third at
   least was not composed until after the destruction of Jerusalem in the
   year 70 (provisionally we confine ourselves to a statement the truth of
   which is recognised almost on all hands). But even if we do not suppose
   that the Apostle died early, he cannot be regarded as the author of the
   Gospel because, as we have seen, he did not live in Ephesus. The
   Christian writers who look upon him as the author do not say that the
   Apostle composed it, no matter where he lived, but they say, "the John
   who was head of the Church of Asia Minor wrote it," so that the Apostle
   may be held to be the author of the Gospel only if we can think of him
   as living in Ephesus. If he lived elsewhere, we cannot say that these
   writers regarded him as the author; for by the John who in their
   opinion wrote the Gospel, they always mean the John in Ephesus.
   Accordingly, their "testimony" to the effect that the Apostle was the
   author is evidence, rather, that some one else was the author.
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. THE TESTIMONY OP THE BELOVED DISCIPLE.

   But what about the author's own testimony? Does he not himself say that
   he is the Apostle? This is surely a curious question! When a matter is
   to be decided in other fields--when, for instance, the origin of
   extra-canonical books is in question, or a trial is being held--scant
   consideration indeed is paid to the personal testimony of the person
   involved; but here forsooth this is to be decisive, and all arguments
   against it, however plausible, are to be ignored. This is to take for
   granted--is it not?--what, strictly speaking, should first be proved,
   that a person whose book has been included in the Bible cannot have
   said anything incorrect.

   But let us hear what this testimony is. The author nowhere refers to
   the name John as being his own. The superscription "Gospel according to
   John" is not due to him, but was first added when several Gospels were
   put together in one book. [7] Neither, however, does he ever refer to
   the Apostle John by this name. But he has him in mind when he says that
   after the arrest of Jesus, "Simon Peter and another disciple "followed
   him to the Palace of the High Priest (xviii. 15), and that "Peter and
   the other disciple "went to the grave of Jesus (xx. 1-10). Here he
   writes more fully (xx. 2), "Simon Peter, and that other disciple whom
   Jesus loved," and the simple description, "one of the disciples whom
   Jesus loved," is found already in xiii. 23, where it is said that at
   Jesus' last supper he "reclined in Jesus bosom"; finally, we learn from
   xix. 26, that "the disciple whom he loved" stood with Jesus mother at
   the foot of the cross.

   In this circumlocution we see, it is said, the delicate and sensitive
   way in which the Apostle John hinted that he was the author of the
   Gospel, without expressly saying so. In reality, if he did this, he
   would have shown himself to be an incredibly presumptuous person. Jesus
   surely loved all his disciples! If the author had said of himself, "the
   disciple whom Jesus specially loved," we could not acquit him of
   presumption, even though this were really the case; but he says
   outright, "the disciple whom Jesus loved," as if he loved him alone. It
   is not really doing the Apostle any honour to insist that he must have
   described himself in this way. On the other hand, it is quite easy to
   understand that one of his devoted admirers may have so described him.
   But if we examine further all that is told us about the beloved
   disciple--the story, in particular, of his race with Peter to the grave
   of Jesus is so incredible (p. 133 f.) that we cannot imagine it to have
   been committed to writing by an eyewitness. And so here again this
   "testimony" of the author to the effect that he is the Apostle becomes
   evidence, rather, that some one else was the author.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] The words are "Gospel according to John," not "Gospel of John";
   similarly, "Gospel according to Mt., according to Mk., according to
   Lk." But this does not mean that such a gospel was written by another
   man with the help of communications from the person specially named.
   The word "Gospel" in these cases means, rather, "Account of the Life of
   Jesus," and the superscription means therefore "the Gospel History as
   composed by Mt., Mk., Lk., or Jn."
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. FURTHER WITNESS OF THE AUTHOR TO HIMSELF
  (Jn. xix. 35).

   The most characteristic instance of the author testifying to
   himself--an instance in which there is a real idea of bearing
   testimony--is held to be that in xix. 34 f.: "one of the soldiers with
   a spear pierced his side (the side of the crucified Lord), and
   straightway there came out blood and water; and he that hath seen hath
   borne witness, and his witness is true, and he knoweth that he saith
   true, that ye also may believe." We must remember here that we were
   told in verse 26 that the beloved disciple stood at the foot of the
   cross; it is he therefore who is meant when reference is made to one
   who saw the flowing of blood and water. But is it he himself who pens
   the words?

   Searching inquiries have been instituted as to whether, in speaking of
   himself in Greek, any one could say "he." But this is not the point.
   Once the Apostle had begun by saying, instead of "I," "he that hath
   seen," there was no other way to continue than by saying "he." So that
   the question is: When the writer says "he that hath seen," does he mean
   himself? This in itself would be quite possible, if he wished to avoid
   the use of "I." Throughout the whole description of his wars (58-48
   B.C.), Julius Caesar has never said "I did this and that," but always
   "Caesar did this and that." But, if he wished to express himself
   similarly, it would have been far more correct for the Fourth
   Evangelist to say: "he that hath seen it, bears witness" (now, as he
   writes it down). The expression, "he hath borne witness" would be far
   more appropriate if the observer of what occurred told it orally and
   another person recorded it in writing afterwards. Yet according to
   Greek Syntax the expression might also mean: he wishes (hereby) to have
   testified; and in this case it is still possible that what we read in
   this passage was written down by the observer.

   It is decisive here that blood and water cannot by any means have
   flowed separately from Jesus' wound so soon after his death (it was at
   most two hours, but probably much less; see p. 127). It is therefore
   doing no honour to the Apostle to insist that he is here bearing
   personal testimony. On the other hand, we can very well under stand a
   later writer, who had been orally assured that it really happened,
   noting it down in good faith.

   We should add further, that in any case the flowing of water and blood
   has some deeper mysterious meaning. It was a common Christian belief
   that the blood of Jesus shed at his death was the means of bringing
   salvation to man kind. Now, the individual Christian can partake of the
   blood of Jesus in the Supper, and is reminded of the redemption which
   has through his blood been granted to men. And water is used in baptism
   for the purpose of initiating people into communion with those who have
   been redeemed by the death of Jesus. Accordingly, the idea that the two
   things which are necessary for the most important and holy of the
   Christian ceremonies came into being at the death of Jesus is an
   ingenious one. We can easily imagine that a preacher may have expressed
   the idea in a veiled form, just as was done, if we have conjectured
   rightly (p. 113 f.), in the case of the story of Lazarus, and that some
   one in the audience jumped to the conclusion that it might be recorded
   as an actual fact that blood and water flowed from Jesus wound.
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. NO DECEPTION IN WRITING UNDER PSEUDONYMS.

   If what we have said indicates that it was not the Apostle, but another
   who wrote the passage which speaks of testifying to the blood and
   water, and at the same time wrote the whole Gospel, we do not of course
   know as yet whether he wishes to be regarded merely as the reporter of
   the testimony of a greater person, or whether he wishes it to appear
   that he himself is this greater person, this eye witness. Even one who
   at the outset does not hold the Biblical writers in particularly high
   esteem, will readily be inclined to find the second supposition
   unthinkable, be cause it would imply such an amount of dishonesty as
   there is no reason to ascribe to the Evangelist, whose style is simple
   and candid.

   But, as regards this matter, people quite ignore the fact that in those
   days it was not considered wrong to compose a writing in the name of
   another person. Among the Greeks and Romans it was quite common for
   disciples to publish their works, not under their own name, but under
   that of their masters; and we can see in what light this was regarded,
   from the philosopher Iamblichus (about 300 A.D.), for example, who was
   one of the followers of Pythagoras. We know even at the present time of
   a list of sixty writings which have been fathered upon Pythagoras and
   other old masters amongst his successors; and Iamblichus expressly
   praises the later disciples of Pythagoras, because they have sacrificed
   their own fame and given all the glory to their masters.

   As regards Christian writers, the story of the leader of a Church in
   Asia Minor, who published the history of Paul and Thecla in the second
   century under the name of the Apostle Paul, is specially instructive.
   When he was reproached for doing so, he replied that he did it out of
   love for Paul; and Tertullian, the Church writer and jurist at Carthage
   (about 200), who tells us about it, does not think of charging him with
   it as a sin, but only makes fun of him for his incapacity in the words:
   "as if his work could do anything to increase the fame of Paul." The
   man was deposed, not however because he had been guilty of anything
   that we should call a forgery, but because he said in his book that
   Thecla came forward to teach in public and baptized herself by jumping
   into a ditch filled with water in view of death by wild beasts in the
   Circus. Both things were contrary to the regulations of the Church (on
   the first see 1 Cor. xiv. 34, "Let the women keep silence in the
   churches"). They were not allowed; but there was no offence in the
   publication of a writing in the name of another person.

   This way of looking at the matter makes it very easy for us to
   understand how so many of the books of the New Testament were composed
   in the name of Paul, of Peter, of James, &c. And strange as it may
   appear, we must thoroughly accustom ourselves to it. To show that this
   suggests itself even to a quite orthodox theologian, we will quote an
   utterance by Professor Kahnis of Leipzig, who died in 1888. "If the
   fifth book of Moses is not by Moses, it is by an impostor, says Dr.
   Hengstenberg. To whom does Dr. Hengstenberg say this? Every one who has
   been to a classical school knows that there are a great number of
   writings in classical literature which are ascribed to persons with
   famous names, and that specialists do not think there was any deception
   in the practice." As regards the Second Epistle of Peter, even very
   conservative theologians now admit that it was written one hundred and
   twenty or more years after Jesus' death, although, in speaking of Jesus
   transfiguration, its author assures us, quite as if he were the Apostle
   Peter (i. 18): "and this voice we ourselves heard come out of heaven,
   when we were with him on the holy mount." Why then should the same
   thing not have happened in the case of the Fourth Gospel?

   Thus we need not shrink from crediting the author of the Fourth Gospel
   with the wish to have his book regarded as the work of the Apostle
   himself. We have, however, no absolutely definite ground for saying so.
   The matter remains obscure. And perhaps it was meant to remain obscure.
   The testimony we have been examining could, as a matter of fact, hardly
   have been framed in a more enigmatic way than in the terms, "and his
   witness is true, and he knoweth that he saith true." It is possible
   therefore that the author, though he did not wish to say expressly that
   his book was the work of the Apostle, had no objection to people
   believing so. Even when he says in i. 14 "the Logos became flesh . . .
   and we beheld his glory", it is not certain whether he means with our
   bodily eyes (which, in view of what we have said above, would not need
   to be regarded as a fraudulent assertion), or whether he wishes to
   imply that those who were not privileged to do this saw his glory with
   their spiritual vision by means of the stories of Jesus' life, and of
   the blessings which proceeded from him even after his death.

  10. CHAPTER XXI AN APPENDIX FROM ANOTHER PEN.

   We could not, it is true, seriously impute this obscurity to him, if
   the twenty-first chapter were due to the same author. But this is not
   the case. For the same concepts quite different words are used here
   from those found in the first twenty chapters. The appearance of the
   risen Lord in chapter xxi. (14) is said to be the third; but three
   others have already been mentioned in chapter xx. Peter is a fisher, as
   in the Synoptics (Mk. i. 16), whereas Jn. (i. 35-41) knows him only as
   a disciple of the Baptist. But, most important of all, in chapter xxi.
   Peter appears in a much more favoured light than before; he even
   receives the commission to feed Jesus sheep, that is to say, to guide
   the Church, and is told that he is likely to have the honour of dying a
   martyr's death. The beloved disciple, on the other hand, who has always
   taken precedence of him in chapters i.-xx. (xiii. 24; xviii. 16; xix.
   26; xx. 2-10), in chapter xxi. (22-24) has to content himself with a
   humbler role: he is promised a long life, and is given the task of
   writing the Gospel. This striking recognition of Peter is in all
   likelihood due to the fact that offence had been taken because in
   chapters i.-xx. he was made subordinate to the beloved disciple. Peter
   had already won high esteem in the Christian Church, especially at
   Rome, and the friends of the author of the Gospel must have feared, or,
   as we shall see shortly, must have found, that for this reason the book
   was gaining slight recognition. One of them therefore decided to reckon
   with these circumstances by adding an appendix.

   And because the Gospel had gained such slight recognition, he took
   occasion at the same time, in the appendix which he added, to assure
   its readers once more that the author was the famous John. This he does
   (xxi. 24) with more clearness and emphasis than the author himself:
   "this (that is to say, the long-lived beloved disciple) is the disciple
   which beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we
   know that his witness is true." We? Who? Here we have a hint that the
   author of the appendix has perhaps been commissioned by a whole number
   of the party of the Evangelist to write, or at least writes to voice
   their sentiments and to promote the idea that the Gospel was composed
   by the beloved disciple and for that reason deserves to be trusted
   absolutely. But his very zeal has been the means of discrediting him in
   the eyes of a serious critic. A witness, whose evidence must itself be
   witnessed to in turn, cannot seem a very trustworthy person.
     __________________________________________________________________

  11. THE REAL PICTURE OF JOHN THE APOSTLE.

   After all these "witnesses" on the part of badly informed writers, of
   the author himself and of his friends who have intervened on his
   behalf, it is at length time to seek for some point from which we can
   learn better who wrote the Fourth Gospel. What information have we then
   in the New Testament about the Apostle John which is really reliable?
   We must not of course turn to the Fourth Gospel for our answer. The
   most certain thing is the record of Paul, that John was one of the
   three pillars of the Community in Jerusalem, and wished to confine his
   missionary activity to the Jews (see pp. 174 and 177), the reason being
   no doubt that, if he held intercourse with the Gentiles, he would
   violate the Old Testament commandments about foods, cleanness, &c.,
   which he thought ought still to be observed. This does not harmonise
   well with the fact that in the Fourth Gospel Jesus calls the Law a "Law
   of the Jews" and feels that he is quite superior to it. Further, the
   whole view of the world here, familiar as it is with the ideas of the
   greatest Greek thinkers, and the boldness with which, following the
   example of Gnosticism, all that is traditional is swept away--all this,
   which we have found in the Gospel, suits no one so little as this man
   who had remained stationary and simply persisted in holding the
   standpoint of the Old Testament. Add to this that according to Mk. i.
   19 he was a fisherman, and according to Acts iv. 13 a man without
   learning and culture. Nor is this altered by the fact that he, with his
   brother James and with Peter, was one of the most intimate companions
   of Jesus in the circle of the twelve disciples (Mk. v. 37; ix. 2; xiv.
   33).

  12. MISTAKES AS TO THE CONDITION OF THINGS IN PALESTINE.

   One who writes under an assumed name often betrays himself by having
   false ideas of the places or institutions of the country in which he
   claims to be living. As far as places are concerned, it cannot be shown
   with success that Jn. does this. But, as regards institutions, he has
   been led to make as great a mistake as it is possible to imagine. By
   telling us twice (xi. 49, 51, and xviii. 13) that Caiaphas was "high
   priest that year" he assumes that the office changed hands every year.
   As a matter of fact, the high priest held the office for life, and,
   although it happened not infrequently that one was deposed, there was
   never any question of a yearly vacation of office. This of course is a
   fact which would have been as well known to a contemporary of Jesus in
   Palestine, as the fact that the office of Emperor is hereditary is to a
   German of to-day. In face of a mistake on such a matter, how can we
   attach importance to the knowledge of places in the country, which
   could easily be acquired even one hundred years after the events with
   which they are associated?
     __________________________________________________________________

  13. JOHN THE ELDER NOT THE WRITER OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   May we therefore speak of John the Elder in Ephesus as the author of
   the Fourth Gospel? Support for this might, as a matter of fact, be
   found in the consideration that Irenaeus and his successors virtually
   supposed this, even though they believed that this John in Ephesus was
   the Apostle. But the assumption will not bear closer examination. If he
   was a disciple of Jesus, and consequently a man whose home was in
   Palestine, he ought to have known more about the tenure of the
   high-priest's office. But, above all, his standpoint was hardly less
   Jewish-Christian than that of the Apostle. In fact when Polycarp (see
   p. 173), who was a former disciple of his, visited Rome towards the end
   of his life (154 or 155), and found that Easter was fixed at a quite
   different time (the time at which we still fix it) from that of Asia
   Minor, where he lived, he appealed to the practice of John (and
   others). In Asia Minor what, according to the Jewish Calendar, was
   always the 14th Nisan was duly celebrated, not in memory of the death
   of Jesus--as the Fourth Gospel would require (p. 118)--but of the
   institution of the Supper a practice which conflicts with the Fourth
   Gospel, and is, as a matter of fact, supported by a special appeal to
   Mt. The John who shared this practice as leader of the Church of Asia
   Minor cannot have written the Fourth Gospel. Moreover, this would be
   equally true of John the Apostle if he had been the leader of the
   Church of Asia Minor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  14. WHAT KIND OP PERSON WAS THE FOURTH EVANGELIST?

   If this means that we must give up the idea of naming some well-known
   person as the author, we are, nevertheless, very well able to form a
   clear idea of the writer of the Fourth Gospel. In seeking to do so, we
   have come back, after making a long circuit, to our starting-point, for
   we have to consult the Gospel itself. To have been able to write such a
   book, the author must have been one of the leading spirits of his age.
   He was familiar with the best that the Greek mind and the religions of
   the whole world known to people of those days had produced. His own
   mind was liberal enough to soar to the realm of these ideas, and to
   refuse to allow itself to be cramped by anything traditional. He knew
   how to gather into a common reservoir all the streams of thought that
   flowed towards him from the most diverse sources. His great object was
   to use all for the glorification of Jesus as he conceived him. Even
   Gnosticism, the most dangerous movement of his time, was well known to
   him--so much so that he had made many of its ideas his own. But he
   recognised the danger in it and did all in his power to overcome it,
   without giving up anything in Gnosticism which was really lofty and
   emancipating.

   His chief pattern was Philo, and he perhaps had some thing else in
   common with him in the fact that he was of Jewish extraction. If he had
   not been, he would hardly have attached so much importance to the
   fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies (see p. 128 f.), and would
   hardly have made Jesus say "salvation is of the Jews" (iv. 22). He
   cannot of course have received his wide culture in Palestine.
   Accordingly, we must seek his home outside of this country, and
   preferably in a great city which would gather up all the wisdom of the
   known world. Ephesus would suit the requirements admirably, and if the
   Gospel came into existence here, it would be very easy for it to be
   ascribed to a person who had taken a very prominent position in the
   city at an earlier date, John the Elder whether or not it was done in
   such a way that he was sup posed to be the Apostle. Ephesus will
   suggest itself again when we inquire into the origin of the
   "Revelation" of Jn.; and in itself it is rather likely that all the
   five writings which are supposed to have been composed by John the
   Apostle would have come into existence amongst the same circle of men
   of kindred spirit, and so in one and the same locality. But we cannot
   rely upon all these considerations, nor need we think it important to
   be able to say where the Gospel was written.
     __________________________________________________________________

  15. DATE AT WHICH THE FOURTH GOSPEL WAS COMPOSED.

   More pressing is the question, When did it come into existence? And, as
   regards this, we must of course look once more for statements outside
   the Gospel. When were the first three Gospels written, which, by almost
   general agreement, were all known to the writer of the Fourth? If we
   may voice our own conviction, it would suffice to say that the Third
   Gospel cannot have come into existence until about the year 100,
   because the author was well acquainted with the writings of the Jewish
   historian Josephus who composed his chief work in the year 93 or 94.
   Others, who place the Gospel of Lk. (and so the Gospels of Mk. and Mt.
   also) earlier, think that, when this estimation is taken into
   consideration, the Gospel of Jn. may have been composed as early as
   about the year 100. But here again we have to remember that the
   Gnosticism with which the Fourth Evangelist is familiar, and which he
   vigorously opposes, did not force its way into the Christian
   communities until about the year 100. We learn this from Hegesippus,
   who wrote his "memorials" about the year 180, and as he was of a great
   age was still able to afford correct information on the matter. Jn., on
   the other hand, already had to do with a more developed form of
   Gnosticism (p. 205). Only, he does not seem to be acquainted with the
   forms which appeared after about the year 140.
     __________________________________________________________________

  16. THE APOSTLE IS NOT MENTIONED AS THE AUTHOR UNTIL AFTER THE YEAR 170.

   The most important and decisive point is to know from what date we have
   reliable external evidence, as we say, concerning the Fourth Gospel; in
   other words, statements by writers which imply that they knew the book
   as the work of such and such an author, or at least that they wrote out
   passages from him, so that there can be no mistake that they really had
   the book lying before them. This, in fact, is the point on which those
   who claim that the Gospel was composed by John the Apostle have staked
   everything. Many of them have undertaken no less a task than to prove
   by such external testimony that the author ship has been placed so much
   beyond doubt that it is not permissible even to take into consideration
   the counter arguments drawn from other considerations, for instance
   from an examination of the Gospel itself.

   Unfortunately it is quite impossible here to go into this point with
   all the thoroughness that is really required. If we thought of doing
   so, we should have to give verbatim an almost endless number of
   passages from all the writers of the second century, in order to enable
   the reader to decide whether or not they betray a knowledge of the
   Fourth Gospel. We should be obliged, further, in the case of all these
   writers to state when they wrote, or rather, since in most cases the
   matter is not certain, to make inquiry and try to fix the most likely
   date. Ten years earlier or later here mean a very great difference.
   Finally, we should be obliged to find out their habits: whether to a
   greater or less extent they incorporate in their works passages from
   other books; whether they are accustomed to do this exactly word for
   word or merely from memory; whether they state regularly from what book
   they draw, or simply write down the words without saying that they have
   borrowed them; whether they use books which we no longer possess. All
   this may be important when it is a question whether a passage in their
   writings which resembles one in the Fourth Gospel is taken from this or
   not. Instead of going into all these troublesome and wearisome
   questions, it must suffice here to state the results briefly, and to
   show by a few examples how they have been attained.

   First then we have to establish the fact that before the year 170 no
   writer can be found who ascribes the Fourth Gospel to John the Apostle.
   As regards this matter, we must note further that the year 170 is the
   very earliest that can be specified, for the statement we have in mind
   that belongs to this time reads simply: as to the day of Jesus' death
   "the Gospels seem to be at variance." The name, therefore, of John the
   Apostle is not mentioned. But it is clear from the words that this
   writer (Claudius Apollinaris) puts the Fourth Gospel, which introduces
   the variance (for the first three are quite agreed; see p. 118 f.), on
   the same level as the others.
     __________________________________________________________________

  17. VALUE OF THESE "EXTERNAL EVIDENCES."

   But if from this date it is almost generally regarded as the work of
   the Apostle, in order to be able to determine the value of this
   assertion, we must know in the first place the general idea which
   leading persons of the time had of the books of the New Testament.

   On this point Irenaeus (about 185) is specially instructive. To prove
   that there are just four true Gospels (there were still many others in
   existence), he points to the fact that there are four quarters of the
   world and four winds; since, then, the Church is scattered over the
   whole earth and the Gospel constitutes its pillar and support and the
   spirit of its life, it is appropriate that the pillars which on all
   (four) sides blow upon it with the airs of imperishability should be
   four in number--in other words, the four Gospels. Such was the idea of
   so distinguished a person as Irenaeus; when it was a question of
   deciding whether the Fourth Gospel was composed by John the Apostle, he
   took his stand on the fact that the quarters of heaven and the chief
   winds are four in number. To understand how he could do this while
   speaking of the spirit of life, as well as of the winds, we must be
   aware that in Greek "wind "and "spirit "are represented by the same
   word (pneuma). So that by means of a play upon words, to sustain which
   he has further to think of pillars (i.e., the Gospels) as blowing, he
   is prepared to decide a question of such great importance. Surely we
   are justified in practically ignoring the proof which a person of this
   stamp brings forward to show that such and such a person was the author
   of a book in the New Testament.

   But we will take a few more cases as tests of the care fulness of
   Irenaeus and those of his contemporaries who agreed with him in
   claiming that the Fourth Gospel was composed by John the Apostle; they
   will serve to test their critical powers as well. Irenaeus regards the
   James who is said in Acts xv. to have been present at the
   already-mentioned (p. 174) meeting with Paul as one of the three
   pillars of the Church at Jerusalem as that brother of John and personal
   disciple of Jesus whose execution has been recorded three chapters
   further back (xii. 2). In the Gospel of Lk. again he thinks that the
   discourses of the Apostle Paul concerning the Life of Jesus are
   committed to writing just as those of Peter are in the Gospel of
   Mk.--and this in spite of the fact that Paul never met Jesus, and
   continued to persecute the Christians even after Jesus' death. Dealing
   with the question of eternal happiness, Irenaeus is able to tell us
   that there will be vines with 10,000 stems, on each stem 10,000
   branches, on each branch 10,000 shoots, on each shoot 10,000 clusters,
   on each cluster 10,000 berries, and that every berry will yield 900 to
   1000 litres of wine. The most important point, however, is not the size
   of these vines, but Irenaeus statement, that Jesus himself prophesied
   this; the aged men whom he so often mentions had told him so, and had
   added that they had heard it from John the Apostle. And this Irenaeus
   believes, although he assures us so emphatically that this same person
   wrote the Fourth Gospel which makes Jesus appear so superior to all
   such expectations.

   Clement of Alexandria, one of the most learned and most venerated
   teachers in the Church (about 200), quotes as an utterance of the
   Apostle Paul(!) the words, "take also the Greek books, read the Sibyl
   and see how it reveals one God and the future, and read Hystaspes, and
   you will find in them the Son of God described much more clearly."
   Hystaspes was the father of Darius, the Persian king who reigned from
   521 to 485 B.C. The words of Clement give us some idea of the kind of
   fabrication that was put forth in his name. The credulous Clement also
   quotes the book of Zoroaster of Pamphylia in which he recorded after
   his resurrection all that had been taught him in the under world by the
   gods. The jurist Tertullian (about 200) is able to tell us that in the
   official account of Jesus condemnation which Pilate sent to the Emperor
   Tiberius, he mentioned, amongst other things, the eclipse of the sun at
   the time of Jesus' death, the guarding of the sepulchre, the
   resurrection of Jesus and his ascension, and that in his inmost
   convictions he was already a Christian. If Tertullian is not giving
   free rein to his imagination here, but has used some book ("Acts of
   Pilate"), we shall be glad to think that the author of it was a
   Christian.

   But enough. We can see clearly the kind of people we have to deal with
   when the witnesses in support of the usual statements about the origin
   of the New Testament books are brought forward. Instead of insisting so
   emphatically that the fact that the Fourth Gospel was composed by John
   the Apostle is already borne witness to by Irenaeus, Tertullian,
   Clement of Alexandria and others, it ought in truth to be said that no
   one did so until they bore witness to it--or, rather, asserted it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  18. THE GOSPEL NOT USED BEFORE 140.

   Of rather a different nature are the cases in which passages from the
   Fourth Gospel are merely cited without its being said who wrote them.
   As regards these, it can be shown that before the year 140 there is
   evidence of none to which we have strict right to appeal. Sayings and
   expressions which resemble some in this Gospel, are indeed found in
   Christian writings after about the year 100 not infrequently. But it is
   a very strange idea that this resemblance must always be accounted for
   by supposing that the writers had read the Fourth Gospel. Because the
   Gospel has first made us acquainted with these sayings and expressions,
   there is no need to suppose that the circum stances were the same as
   early as about the year 100. On the contrary, why may not the Fourth
   Evangelist have been acquainted with the writings in question? Or, to
   mention a suggestion which in many cases is more likely, the discourses
   of the travelling teachers of the times, of whom there were very many,
   may have given currency to a number of catchwords, phrases, and whole
   sentences, which became the common property of all more or less
   cultured Christians. No one could say where he first heard them. Any
   one who wrote a book made use of them without suspecting that the
   question from what other book he took them would ever be asked. It may
   be that the Fourth Evangelist availed himself of them, and stamped them
   with his own particular genius; and we of the present day may easily be
   misled into supposing that he must have been the first to coin them,
   and that all other writers who use them must have written subsequently.

   It is particularly easy to think this when a whole sentence is in
   question, which contains in itself an independent and important
   thought. We have an example in Jn. xiv. 2, "in my Father's house (that
   is to say, in heaven) are many mansions." Those people of great age to
   whom Irenaeus often appeals, have handed down to him as a saying of
   Jesus the words, "in my Father's domains are many mansions." Besides
   this, we learn from Jn. alone (xiv. 2) that Jesus made this statement,
   and the conclusion is drawn that the "elders" also can only have become
   acquainted with it from the Gospel. And since they have been referred
   to by Irenaeus as people who speak not from a more recent age, but from
   their own recollection of the distant past, the Gospel must already
   have been in existence at a very early date. This is a typical example
   of the kind of proof it is not permissible to use. We refrain from
   reckoning with the possibility that Jesus may really have made the
   statement, and that the elders were just as likely as the Fourth
   Evangelist to have learned it orally. But in their case, as well as
   that of Jn., the belief may also have grown up erroneously that he made
   the statement. This assertion would then have been repeated, and so
   finally have found its way into the Fourth Gospel. It was certainly the
   kind of saying that was likely to have been passed on from mouth to
   mouth, for it contains the comforting assurance that after one's death
   one might look forward with certainty to finding a refuge in heaven.
   Another indication that the saying became current in this way may be
   found in the fact that the versions in Jn. and Irenaeus are not word
   for word identical.
     __________________________________________________________________

  19. USED WITHOUT RECOGNITION IN THE YEARS 140-170.

   Most noteworthy are the writers between the specified years 140 and
   170, who really cite passages from the Fourth Gospel, but do not say
   who composed it. The most important is Justin, who wrote about 152 and
   was subsequently martyred. From the Synoptics he introduces over one
   hundred passages, but from Jn. only three, and these are so far from
   following Jn.'s language exactly that in every case it can be thought
   that he took them from another book, and that the Fourth Evangelist may
   have done the same. We assume, however, that Justin took them from
   Jn.'s work. But why, then, are there so few, and why is nothing said
   about this work being the composition of a personal disciple of Jesus?
   Referring to the "Revelation" of Jn., he says positively that it was
   composed by the Apostle; but he says nothing about the Gospel. And yet
   he attaches so much importance to the "memorials of the Apostles and
   their companions," as he calls the Gospels; and shares with the Fourth
   the doctrine of the Logos. We can only understand this on one
   supposition: Justin did not consider the Fourth Gospel to be the work
   of the Apostle. In that case, it must in his age still have been quite
   new; otherwise it would long ago have won general recognition.
   Obviously Justin finds in it some passages which are beautiful and
   worth mentioning, but, compared with the rich use made of the
   Synoptics, he uses it with great caution, and almost with hesitation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  20. CONCLUSION AS TO THE "EXTERNAL EVIDENCES."

   When therefore we sum up the results of our examination of the external
   evidence for the Fourth Gospel, we find that the lesson it teaches is
   the opposite of what those who believe that it was written by the
   Apostle think it ought to teach. Instead of proving that this was
   written very early, it proves that it was composed at a very late date.
   If the work in question were that of an obscure person, we can perhaps
   understand that it may have been in existence for decades without
   attracting attention or gaining recognition. But think of it! A work by
   the disciple whom Jesus loved! And, besides, a work containing
   disclosures of such paramount importance! It could not have failed to
   be greeted on its first appearance with the greatest joy, and to be
   greedily devoured; we could not fail to find an echo of it in all
   Christian writers. Instead of that, from the date at which it must have
   been published by the Apostle, that is to say, at latest from 90-100,
   until 140, there is not one certain instance of the use of the book; we
   do not find the Apostle recognised as the author until after 170, and
   in the meantime we do find it clearly realised that it was not by him.
   Indeed, we have to add further that after 160 or 170 it was positively
   stated by some who were good Churchmen, and later by the Presbyter
   Gaius in Rome at the beginning of the third century, to have been
   composed by a heretic. The result therefore of examining the external
   evidence means that we cannot place the origin of the Gospel earlier
   than very shortly before the first appearance of this evidence, and so
   very shortly before 140.

  21. MENTION OF BAR COCHBA S INSURRECTION IN JN. v. 43 .

   Let us now return to a consideration of the Gospel itself, and ask
   whether we cannot really get the best information as to the date at
   which it was composed in the same way that we have obtained it in
   considering the questions who was its author, and whether the work is
   reliable. Here then our attention is arrested by Jesus' words to the
   Jews in v. 43, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not:
   if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive." In the
   year 132 Simon, having taken the name Bar Cochba, came forward,
   proclaimed himself the Messiah, and became among the Jews the leader of
   a fanatical rising against the Roman rule, with the result that in the
   year 135 the Jewish nation finally lost its in dependence. The
   Christians, as we can well understand, declared against the new Messiah
   from the first, and in consequence were fiercely persecuted so long as
   he retained any power. If the Fourth Evangelist had had experience of
   all this, may he not have thought that it would be under stood and
   would make an impression if he put into Jesus mouth a prophecy of these
   events? In that case he would have written between 132 and 140. If it
   had not been that for other reasons we have already been led to assign
   the composition of his book to about this date, we might not have had
   the boldness to appeal to this passage; but, such being the case, we
   seem to be really justified in doing so.
     __________________________________________________________________

  22. THE FOURTH GOSPEL NOT THE WORK OF SEVERAL AUTHORS.

   We have reserved a question for discussion last, which, it might be
   thought, ought to have been dealt with first. Can it be that the Fourth
   Gospel is not by one and the same author? If not, whenever any
   assertion is made with regard to the author, it must of course be
   stated very care fully to what part it refers. But the question is not
   of serious importance. We have mentioned that the story of the woman
   taken in adultery (vii. 53-viii. 11) and chap. xxi. are later additions
   (pp. 39 and 186 f.; see also p. 209). But this does not make the least
   difference to our explanation of the Gospel as a whole.

   The case would be altered, only if we were obliged to partition the
   first twenty chapters in large part between two or more authors. The
   attempt to do this as a rule rests upon the supposition that one half
   is due to a trust worthy historian and an eye-witness, the other to a
   badly informed contributor. In an earlier part of this volume (p. 110
   f.), we have already realised how far such assumptions are from making
   anything contained in the Gospel really credible. But in conclusion we
   will try to show the contradictions in which people involve themselves
   when they make a division of the kind.

   One of the most recent of these attempts explains that the eye-witness
   Peter, whose record Mk. preserves in his Gospel, tells us that on the
   last evening of Jesus' life he celebrated the Supper with his
   disciples; and the eye-witness John that he washed their feet. Peter
   therefore knew nothing of the washing, and John nothing of the Supper.
   The eye-witness Peter--we are told further as regards--Jesus' idea of
   the judgment of the world, preserved the record that it would begin for
   all men on one and the same day at the end of the world; the
   eye-witness John recorded that for those who believed in Jesus it would
   never take place (v. 24), and it is the badly informed contributor who
   has added the version in v. 28 f. which agrees with the statement of
   Peter. The eye-witness Peter, we are told, finally, left a record which
   suggests that .Jesus never betrayed that he was conscious of having
   lived a life with God in heaven before his earthly life; the
   eye-witness John is able to tell us that Jesus said "before Abraham
   was, I am," "Glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I
   had with thee before the world was" (viii. 58; xvii. 5); and he wrote
   in the Prologue the sentences in which Jesus is described as the Logos
   who was with God before the be ginning of the world. In face of such
   contradictions, it is really no use bringing forward passages here in
   which the context is said to have been interrupted by some intervention
   on the part of the contributor. We have already found out the
   carelessness of the Evangelist (pp. 76-78, 81-83) and it sufficiently
   explains the contradictions which appear in his book, even if no one
   else helped to compose it.

CHAPTER II.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

   WHAT is known as the First Epistle of John, though in reality it is not
   in epistolary form at all but in that of a circular addressed to the
   whole of Christendom, is to all appearances inseparably connected with
   the Gospel. Often, as we read, we can hardly say whether we have the
   one or the other book open before us. And in fact the matter on which
   they differ from each other most clearly is one which, from another
   point of view, serves to bring them together again.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1 . MAIN PURPOSE: TO OPPOSE THE GNOSTICS.

   Whereas, for instance, the Gospel never says that it is opposing false
   teaching within the Christian fold (except in x. 1-10: see p. 135 f.),
   the Epistle says this most emphatically. But we found certain
   utterances in the Gospel aimed at very definite opponents, in other
   words, at the Gnostics (pp. 152-154, 160-163); and the first Epistle
   likewise opposes the Gnostics. We are told (ii. 4) that the author's
   opponents asserted that they knew God; and it was knowledge on which
   the Gnostics prided themselves. We know further the doctrine of the
   Stoics according to which the logos or rather the individual logoi were
   like seeds of corn scattered throughout the world (p. 142 f.), and out
   of these the things of the world arose. The Gnostics applied this idea
   to themselves, and claimed that they had in their own persons the
   divine seed. There is a hint of this idea in iii. 9; and in i. 8, 10 of
   the Gnostics assertion that this made them sinless.

   As to Jesus, the opponents of the writer of the Epistle taught that he
   was not the Christ (ii. 22). And in this again we can recognise the
   claim of the Gnostics, that Jesus was only a man who for a time and in
   a loose way became one with the Christ who had come down from heaven.
   This is seen even more clearly in iv. 2 f.; they deny that Jesus Christ
   is come in the flesh, an utterance which is aimed at the same time at
   that other idea of the Gnostics--that he had merely a phantom body (pp.
   150, 152). And in v. 6 that teaching of theirs is opposed, according to
   which the man who suffered on the cross was not really the redeemer,
   that is to say, the Christ, who had come down from heaven. The author
   says here that he came, that is to say, to save mankind, not only with
   water through his baptism but also with blood through his death.

   But, further, in iii. 4, 10, ii. 4 the author declares against "every
   one that doeth sin" or "that keepeth not God's commandments," and by
   sin he means opposition to the injunction in iii. 3, that every one
   should purify himself. What he has in mind therefore is an unholy,
   unbridled life. Now, it is hardly possible that this reproach, which is
   made more than once and in the most varied forms, can apply to persons
   other than those who are opposed in other passages throughout the
   Epistle. And if this be so, the Gnostics with whom we have to deal here
   are not, like many others, especially in the first decades of the
   second century, people who adhered to the law of the Old Testament. We
   already have to do with a more developed form of Gnosticism.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. AGREEMENT WITH GNOSTICISM.

   But it is remarkable that the man who so decisively opposes Gnosticism
   agrees with it entirely on a strikingly large number of points. He also
   cannot but think that there are two kingdoms very sharply opposed to
   each other, the kingdom of God, and that of the world which is ruled by
   the devil (ii. 16; iii. 8, 10; iv. 4-6), or the kingdom of truth and
   that of lies (ii. 21) and this opposition extends to mankind as well,
   the one part being from God and the other from the world, which "lieth
   in the evil one," that is to say, is under the dominion of the devil
   (v. 19).

   We found that there is the same kind of agreement with the Gnostics in
   the Gospel (pp. 158-160). But the Epistle goes a step farther. While
   the Gospel only occasionally suggests that knowledge is a valuable
   thing (xvii. 3), the Epistle emphasises, in a way that a Gnostic could
   not excel, that the author and his party themselves possess the
   knowledge of God or of the truth (ii. 13 f., 20 f., 27; iv. 7).
   Further, as to the Gnostics belief that they had in themselves the
   divine "seed," the author maintains again that it is really he and
   those who think with him who possess it as their own. And on this point
   he ventures to make the strongest statement found in his Epistle:
   "Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin" (iii. 9; v. 18). By these
   he means himself and his party. And this is said by the same person who
   just before (i. 8, 10) has reproached his opponents in these words: "If
   we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
   in us." Here we can see how great a spell the ideas of the Gnostics
   exercised upon men's minds.

  3. NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION TO GNOSTICISM.

   But we see at the same time the peculiar nature of the attack that is
   made upon them. Those who opposed them claimed as their own all that
   was valuable in the things the Gnostics prided themselves on, and
   denied it to the Gnostics. And upon what ground? If these Gnostics
   really lived the sinful kind of life they were reproached with, this
   would assuredly provide a certain amount of justification for arguing
   on these grounds against the truth of their teaching, on the principle
   "by their fruits ye shall know them" (Mt. vii. 16). But it is much to
   be feared that the opponents of the Gnostics painted their excesses in
   darker colours than was just; and it would also be reasonable to ask
   whether they had as much light on their own side as (in their view)
   there was of shade in that of their opponents. Unfortunately, we are
   obliged to say that the New Testament writers are too prone to
   disparage their opponents by attacking their morals, and often they do
   so in a way that is very unpleasant. In this matter the Epistles to
   Timothy and Titus (which were not composed by the Apostle Paul, but in
   the first half of the second century), the Epistle of Jude from the
   same period, and the Second Epistle of Peter (which was not written by
   the Apostle Peter any more than the first Epistle, but is the latest
   book in the New Testament, and was not written until after the middle
   of the second century) offend in a special degree. It is very possible
   that by employing this method of warfare, they show at the same time
   that they are incapable of overcoming their opponents with intellectual
   weapons. The author of the Epistle to the Colossians provides an
   honourable exception; and from this we can see at the same time that
   Gnostic views were not always and necessarily associated with
   immorality.

   As regards the First Epistle of John, we must say that in its attack on
   its opponents, compared with the writings mentioned above, it has
   observed a certain moderation. In form at least it is written in a calm
   and measured style. We note that the author feels the necessity of
   convincing his readers of the truth of what he says. Laying so great
   stress on knowledge as he does, he cannot have failed to desire this.
   True, his argument does not take the form of giving real proofs; he
   simply gives expression to his own conviction; but the brevity and
   simplicity with which he does so makes it so effective that he could
   really hope to make an impression by it.

   On what then, in the last resort, does he take his stand when he
   opposes the Gnostics? On the Confession of the Church. People must
   confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh that is to say, has
   appeared with a body consisting of flesh; otherwise they are not from
   God, but are Christ's enemies, and, in denying the son, they are at the
   same time denying God the Father as well (iv. 2 f.; ii. 22).
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. THE EPISTLE NOT BY THE AUTHOR OF THE GOSPEL.

   After all that has been said so far, the Gospel and the first Epistle
   might very well seem to have been the work of the same person; but on a
   closer view it is clear that in all probability the two writings had
   different authors. A number of important expressions occur only in the
   Epistle which the author of the Gospel would have had opportunities of
   using as well had he been familiar with them. But, above all, the
   convictions to which the Epistle gives expression bring it nearer than
   the Gospel to the ordinary, simple faith of the Church.

   Jesus second coming from heaven, at which he will bring eternal
   happiness, in ii. 28, as amongst primitive Christians in general, is
   expected to take place on a definite day as an objective event; on the
   other hand, when the Evangelist speaks of a second coming of Jesus
   after his death, he does so only in the sense that it will be identical
   with the coming of the Holy Spirit into the hearts of believers, which
   of course happens at very different times (xiv. 16-18, 26-28). The
   Epistle follows the old idea closely in expecting that on that great
   day in the future all men will rise from the dead and come before the
   bar of judgment (iii. 2; iv. 17). In the Gospel this idea is found only
   in particular passages, for example in v. 28 f., or in a clause which
   is perhaps disturbing, or at least can always be dispensed with, "and I
   will raise him up at the last day," vi. 40, 44, 54, 39 (on this account
   perhaps added by another person, in order to make the book more
   acceptable to simple believers); but his principal idea on this point
   is that eternal life begins even in this world as soon as a man
   believes in Jesus, and that such a one will never come into judgment
   (v. 24). To the writer of the Epistle the most important redemptive act
   of Jesus seems to be his death (i. 7; ii. 2; iv. 10), as was generally
   thought since the time of the Apostle Paul; the Gospel gives expression
   to this belief only in i. 29, 36, and perhaps in xi. 50-52; xvii. 19 b,
   and assumes everywhere else that Jesus brought redemption by coming
   amongst men and bringing them that true knowledge which leads to
   believing in him. In the division which is made between God and the
   world, the Epistle does not go so far as the Gospel. The Evangelist's
   most significant train of thought is to the effect that God does not
   give his gifts directly to men, but to Jesus. Jesus is the first to
   bestow them upon men (xv. 9 f.); none can come to the Father save
   through him (xiv. 6). There are not wanting in the Gospel, as we have
   indicated already (p. 161), sayings which represent the idea, assumed
   throughout the Epistle (ii. 24; iii. 24; iv. 12 f., 15 f.), that men
   also can commune directly with God. But the difference is perceptible
   all the same. Finally, in place of the designation "Logos," the Epistle
   (i. 1) has "the Word of Life," by which one cannot perceive that Jesus
   is a Being who bears the name Logos and is well known from Greek
   Philosophy.

   It is indeed permissible to think that one and the same person might
   have expressed himself differently in two works. But the facts of the
   case are certainly more easily understood if we suppose that we have to
   do with two different authors; and since, moreover, the Evangelist
   cannot have been John the Apostle, it is no use insisting that the
   author of the Epistle can have been no other than he.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. DATE OF COMPOSITION.

   But when was the Epistle written? Since it represents the simpler and
   earlier form of the Christian faith, it is natural to think it older
   than the Gospel. But the contrary may also have been the case; and
   there are many other writers who have not followed the Gospel of John,
   when it diverges from the original teaching, but have betaken
   themselves to this. We must therefore look for another means of
   deciding the question. Let me quote here ii. 12-14: "I write unto you,
   my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's
   sake. I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him which is from the
   beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the
   evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the
   Father. I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him which is
   from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are
   strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the
   evil one." This can hardly be understood to mean anything else than
   that the author wishes to inform his readers that what he now writes is
   essentially the same as he has already written to them once before. And
   thus it is very natural to suppose that he suggests that he had done
   this in the Gospel. With this the external evidence would agree; the
   Epistle, like the Gospel, is not used by Christian writers until after
   the year 140, and when it is first used there is no mention of the
   author's name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. SECONDARY PURPOSE: RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   We must now devote a few more words to the purpose of the Epistle. We
   have hitherto explained that the author is opposing the Gnostics, but
   if what we have just said be correct, this does not exhaust the matter;
   another purpose is to repeat in another form what is contained in the
   Gospel and so to confirm it. Is there any connection between this and
   the fact that in the earliest days after its publication it gained so
   little recognition (p. 199 f.)? In that case, the purpose of the
   Epistle would be the same as that which induced some one, as we have
   already found (p. 186 f.), to add the twenty-first chapter to the
   Gospel. And just as in the addition to the Gospel the ruling idea was
   to satisfy the requirement that the account of Peter should be more
   favourable, sq in the present case the work was carried out in such a
   way as to avoid those statements in the Gospel which differed too much
   from the ordinary faith of the Church. Here we may again wonder whether
   this may not have been done by the author of the Gospel himself, and
   whether he may not have written in this way, to set aside his original
   views of set purpose. But it is easier to suppose that one who belonged
   to the circle of his followers wrote it to give expression to his own
   view of the matter.

   We should have to assume at the same time that he wished to be taken
   for the Evangelist. But, according to the ideas of the time, there
   would be as little harm in this as there was in the other case where
   the Evangelist (perhaps) wished to be taken for John the Apostle (pp.
   183-185). We must not therefore regard it as being in the slightest
   degree deceitful when we are told at the beginning of his circular:
   "that which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that
   which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld and our hands
   handled, concerning the Word of Life (that is to say, concerning Jesus)
   . . . declare we unto you also." By taking up the pen in the name of
   the Evangelist, and yet writing in a rather different sense, the author
   served the great purpose of gaining recognition in the Church for the
   precious thoughts contained in the Fourth Gospel, knowing as he did how
   to remove all that was offensive; and it is quite possible that he
   helped in a real sense to achieve this purpose. He did not, however,
   fulfil in any way his opening promise (i. 1). There is not the least
   trace in his Epistle of anything that only an eye-witness of the Life
   of Jesus could know.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER. III.

THE SECOND AND THIRD EPISTLES OF JOHN.

   THE agreement which we have noticed in the mode of expression and the
   thought of the Fourth Gospel and the First Epistle, is much less
   pronounced when we turn to the Second Epistle, and disappears even more
   in the Third. On the other hand, these two Epistles supplement the
   First from a new point of view.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. PURPOSE OP THE TWO EPISTLES.

   If we take note of what is most peculiar in them, we cannot help seeing
   that their main purpose is to insist that with certain members of the
   Christian Church communion must be ended. We read in 2 Jn. 10 f.: "If
   any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this (the right) teaching,
   receive him not into your house and give him no greeting: for he that
   giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works." Here the Gnostics are
   intended who are called in verse 9 people who "go onward."

   In the Third Epistle the opposition to these is less perceptible; there
   was less opportunity, for the occasion for this Epistle was provided by
   disputes between the author and a certain Diotrephes as to the
   authoritative influence in the community. "I wrote somewhat unto the
   Church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them,
   receiveth us not . . . neither doth he himself receive the brethren,
   and them that would he forbiddeth, and casteth them out of the Church"
   (3 Jn. 9 f.). These brethren are therefore travelling Christians, who
   belong to the party of the author. The idea of the Epistle is to
   request Gaius, to whom it is addressed, to receive them kindly. The
   author claims to have an influence extending beyond his own
   dwelling-place. The Demetrius who is mentioned at the end of the
   Epistle, and of whom it is expressly stated that he "hath the witness
   of all men," may well have conveyed it himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. ADDRESS OP THE TWO EPISTLES.

   The Third Epistle, then, is addressed to a particular person. At first
   sight, this seems to be so with the Second Epistle as well, when we
   read, "the elder unto the elect lady and her children." But who is the
   lady? The last sentence of the Epistle runs: "The children of thine
   elect sister salute thee." Does the author actually write from the
   house of the sister of the recipient? And what does verse 4 mean? "I
   rejoice greatly that I have found certain of thy children walking in
   truth." Only certain? Was there not greater cause to express sorrow for
   the others? In short, the "lady" is not a particular woman; she is a
   community. We learn from Ephes. v. 31 f.; Rev. xix. 7, that the
   community was thought of as the bride of Christ who had been exalted to
   heaven, just as in the Old Testament the people of Israel is the bride
   of God. Since Christ is called "the Lord," the community might be
   called "the lady." It deserves to be called "elect" because it consists
   of all the chosen. Its children are of course the members of the
   community.

   We need not stop to think, as regards this matter, that a community had
   been shown to be meant instead of what appeared at first sight to be
   one woman. Where should we have to look for it? There is no clue to
   anything of the kind. Any community, therefore, might suppose that it
   was greeted by that other community in which the author was staying.
   This means that the Epistle was meant for the whole church, and its
   contents suit this idea quite well. For a secondary purpose of the
   Epistle is found in the fact that the author wishes to warn people in
   quite a general way against the Gnostics and to emphasise the correct
   teaching about Jesus (2 Jn. 7-9). In this respect it falls into line
   with the first Epistle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. AUTHOR OF THE TWO EPISTLES AND DATE OF COMPOSITION.

   While the Second Epistle insists, not only on opposition to, but on the
   expulsion of the Gnostics, it goes beyond the First, and so might with
   the Third seem to be later. Unfortunately we have no definite points
   from which to start in order to determine the date at which both were
   written. Yet, on the other hand, there is another fact which leads us
   to suppose that they preceded the Gospel and the First Epistle.

   The author of both Epistles, that is to say, calls himself simply, "the
   elder." How it could be thought that, in spite of this clear
   description, he was the Apostle, is really difficult to explain. If we
   cannot say for certain who is meant by "the elder," yet it is clear
   that the Apostle would not have described himself in this way. When we
   read in v. 1 of the First Epistle of Peter (which, besides, is not by
   Peter, but was written at the beginning of the persecution of the
   Christians in Asia Minor in the year 112; see iv. 12, 15 f.), that
   Peter is addressing the elders of the community, and for this special
   reason calls himself their fellow elder we have something quite
   different. But, besides this, we know of one quite famous person who is
   continually called "the elder"; this is John "the Elder," head of the
   Church in Asia Minor. The use of his special name "the elder" may very
   well have been so widespread that his real name John was omitted.

   Was he the writer of the Epistles? If the Gnostics did not succeed in
   gaining a following in the Christian communities until about the year
   100 (p. 192), a considerable period of time must have elapsed before
   people would take measures to exclude them so harshly from communion.
   For many decades they regarded themselves as members of the Church,
   and, though they were opposed by other teachers in it, they were
   treated everywhere with toleration, A personal disciple of Jesus, such
   as John the Elder was, cannot have lived to see the time when they were
   excluded from communion.

   Another person in his circle, who is not known to us, may have had the
   same title, and in course of time have come to be known solely by this
   name, "the Elder." But in view of the close relationship between, at
   least, the Second Epistle on the one hand and the First and the Gospel
   on the other, it is very likely that the author is supposed to be that
   John the Elder whom Irenaeus and the other Christian writers had in
   mind, even though they mentioned the Apostle as the writer of the
   Gospel and the First Epistle. Only, in that case, the two small
   Epistles would have been composed merely in the name of John the Elder,
   just as the First Epistle and (perhaps) the Gospel are represented as
   being works of John the Apostle.

   And this would be the reason for supposing these two to be the earlier
   of the four writings in question. On this assumption, we shall have to
   think that in one particular place, Ephesus perhaps, there was a whole
   number of persons of like mind who were filled with a feeling of
   veneration for John the Elder, once head of this community, and at the
   same time were anxious, by writing books, to make their ideas current
   in the Church. Even if these ideas had ceased to be quite identical
   with those of their former Master, it was most natural for them to
   publish their first writings in his name. But perhaps they were made to
   realise that his reputation had not extended beyond the immediate
   circle in which he had once worked. In order, therefore, to make a
   greater impression, when they thought of publishing new works, such as
   the Gospel and the First Epistle, they felt obliged to choose a person
   who ranked still higher and publish them in his name; this person was
   John the Apostle. In this way the two small Epistles, in spite of the
   fact that their range is restricted, would contribute not a little
   towards giving us a very interesting and instructive glimpse of a whole
   series of events and struggles, which the idea that arose later, that
   their author was John the Apostle, to all intents and purposes served
   to overcloud completely.

  1. VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS.

   THE last book of the New Testament is called "Revelation" (Gk.
   Apokalypsis) of Jesus Christ, but after we have pored over the
   books--far more than a thousand--which have been written in the past
   years to explain it, it must appear so obscure that the seven seals
   which are mentioned in the book (chapters v. f.; viii. 1) as closing
   over the fate of humanity and being loosened one after another, must
   seem to clasp the book itself firmly together and to refuse to be
   broken.

   It has been supposed to prophesy the whole history of the Church and
   even of the world, in each case of course down to the lifetime of the
   expositor, and nearly always in a different way. In the beast described
   in xiii. 1-10; xvii. 7-18, people have recognised emperor after
   emperor, pope after pope, one leader after another of the Vandals,
   Muhammedans, and Turks, as well as Luther, Napoleon I., Napoleon III.,
   and the French General Boulanger (1891); and, besides these, even
   impersonal things, such as apostasy, godlessness, the Catholic Church,
   and, to mention only one other thing, Smallpox. In a revelation of
   Jesus Christ men would fain expect to read nothing less than every
   thing which had determined the fate of humanity since its appearance.
   In proportion as people could show for certain that what had already
   happened was prophesied in it, they might also rest assured that all
   that it said about a time still to come would be correctly unravelled.

   All this mass of ingenuity and error might of course have been seen
   from the beginning to be useless, if people had only taken note,
   amongst other things, of the first verse and the last verse but one in
   the book. We are told in i. 1 (and xxii. 6) that the revelation of
   Jesus Christ is "to shew unto his servants the things which must
   shortly come to pass." And this does not mean "which must soon begin,
   and then go on for thousands of years," for in xxii. 20 (as well as in
   iii. 11; xxii. 7, 12) Jesus says, "I come quickly," that is to say, to
   introduce the end of the world. The author of the book, accordingly,
   expected the end of the world in his own lifetime; and if we wish to
   understand the curious figures in which he described it, we must try to
   interpret them in the light of the ideas which prevailed at the time.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. COMBINATION OF SEPARATE FRAGMENTS.

   But first we must realise clearly that in this book we have not to do
   with a single author. The visions which he is supposed to have seen in
   it follow upon one another with so little regard to order that it has
   already been thought that he could not have seen them all one after
   another, but after each must have had time to note it down; other wise
   he would not have been in a position to note them all in their right
   order. No less than six times we find the "last things," which from
   what has already been said we might think are to follow (viii. 1; xi.
   15-19; xiv. 20; xvi. 17-21; xviii. 21-24; xix. 21), described before
   the real conclusion of the book. In every case we meet with a
   self-contained picture only in a particular section of the narrative,
   and for the most part this never extends to a whole chapter.

   It has been noticed that chap. xxiv. of Mt.'s Gospel (not so literally
   in Mk. xiii., and in Lk. xxi. in a version which differs still more)
   incorporates a very small publication in which events are described
   which are supposed to happen immediately before or at the end of the
   world. Mt. xxiv. 6-8, 15-22, 29-31, 34, that is to say, do not fit into
   the sections between which they are placed, but connect together all
   the better. These verses, which have been called a "little Apocalypse,"
   and which now appear as the words of Jesus only by an entire
   misapprehension, may very well have been a leaflet published and spread
   abroad at the time of direst need in order to call the attention of the
   faithful to signs by which they might recognise the near approach of
   the end of the world, and to warn them. In xxiv. 15 we even read, "let
   him that readeth under stand," though Jesus would have been obliged to
   say, "let him that heareth."

   Such leaflets may still be discovered in the Apocalypse of Jn. as well.
   It is difficult to say whether the writer who put together the whole
   book was the first to insert them, or whether earlier workers did so,
   each of them publishing only a part of the present book; and the matter
   is of subordinate importance. Particular stones in the building attract
   attention and can be separated more easily than those sections of the
   walls which have been constructed by one or another foreman.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. A LEAFLET ON THE FATE OF JERUSALEM.

   In Rev. xi. 1-13 we can recognise a leaflet which is quite similar to
   the little Apocalypse in Mt. xxiv., and belongs to the last years
   before August 70 A.D., when the Temple at Jerusalem was destroyed by
   the Imperial Prince, Titus. We learn from xi. 1 f. that the heathen
   might tread upon the outer fore-court of the Temple and the rest of the
   holy city of Jerusalem, but might not touch "the temple of God, and the
   altar, and them that worship therein." Often enough two, and even
   three, hostile parties had struggled for months without result inside
   the walls of Jerusalem. Just before Easter of the year 70 one of the
   three parties was in possession of the Temple with the inner
   fore-court, the other of the rest of the Temple hill, the third of the
   rest of the city. The author was therefore entirely justified by the
   events of the time in his expectation, even if in the end he was
   baffled by the destruction of the Temple.

   He cannot, of course, have been a Christian if Jesus supposed prophecy,
   "there shall not be left here one stone upon another" (Mk. xiii. 2),
   was well known. And Jesus may very well have uttered such a prophecy,
   even if we refuse to credit him with omniscience. By simply exercising
   human powers of reflection, it was not difficult to foresee the fall of
   the Temple. But since this prophecy may also have been ascribed to
   Jesus subsequently, it is still possible that it was a Christian who
   gave expression to the contrary prophecy in his leaflet (Rev. xi.
   1-13).
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. PROPHECY CONCERNING ROME AND THE FIRST BEAST.

   But the city of Rome takes an even more important place than Jerusalem
   in the Apocalypse. Fear of the authorities, who might think the
   prophecies about it dangerous to the State, leads the author to mention
   the city not by its real name, but by that of Babylon, which, as was
   well known, was in the Old Testament associated with an equal amount of
   wickedness; but xvii. 5 f., 9, 18 make it clear enough to every
   intelligent reader what city is meant. In chap. xviii., which, like xi.
   1-13, may have been a separate leaflet, the description of its
   overthrow is quite different from that given in the other parts of the
   book.

   In these we find connected with it the most important figure in the
   whole Apocalypse, the (first) beast, that is to say, the Roman
   imperium. It supports and carries the woman, as the city of Rome is
   also called (xvii. 3, 7), it has a throne, kingdom, dominion over the
   world (xiii. 2, 7; xvi. 10), and, in particular, seven heads, that is
   to say, as we learn in xvii. 9 f., seven kings, of whom the first five
   have fallen, one is now reigning, and the seventh is still to come. The
   first five Roman emperors, who are here intended, were Augustus,
   Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. The author of chap. xvii.
   therefore writes after Nero's death, which took place on the 9th of
   June in the year 68; and the same date suits chap. xiii. Nero, it is
   true, had no real successors; but Galba, Otho, and Vitellius struggled
   for the mastery until Vespasian seized it for himself in December of
   the year 69. Yet it is by no means certain that he was numbered as the
   sixth, and that the one and a half years of the dispute about the
   succession are excluded. A person who lived in the second half of the
   year 68 could only say, as our author does, "the sixth emperor is now
   reigning," though in other parts of the extensive Roman empire his rule
   was disputed.

   There is something else which suggests that the time intended is that
   immediately following Nero's death. By the beast we are not always
   meant to understand the Roman imperium in general, but sometimes a
   single emperor. There is no mistake when it is said in xiii. 7 f., "and
   there was given to him (that is to say, the beast) authority over every
   tribe . . . and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him" and in
   xiii. 14, "to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword, and lived."
   Add to this xvii. 8, 11: "the beast . . . was and (now) is not, and is
   about to come up out of the abyss . . . and the beast that was, and is
   not, is himself the eighth, and at the same time is one of the seven
   (Roman Emperors), and he goeth into perdition."

   To which Roman Emperor does this apply? When Nero saw that his rule was
   at an end, he fled in the company of a few persons to an estate, and on
   hearing his pursuers approaching, with the help of his secretary he cut
   his throat with a sword. His corpse was solemnly burned. But his
   friends, especially amongst the mob, refused to believe that he was
   dead; they imagined that he had made his escape and would shortly
   return and wrest back his power.

   A heathen could not reconcile these two accounts of Nero's end; but a
   Christian (or a Jew), believing as he did in a resurrection, could very
   well do so. Accordingly, all that we read about the beast in the
   Apocalypse would apply to Nero: the sword-wound, the death, the return
   from the underworld, to which every one went when he died, and the
   statement that this risen person who is to appear as the eighth
   emperor, was one of the seven preceding emperors. We know indeed that
   impostors were continually coming forward and claiming to be Nero. The
   very first, who arose as early as the year in which Nero died, created
   a disturbance for months along the whole of the west coast of Asia
   Minor as well as in Greece. And this makes it probable that these
   sections of the Apocalypse date from that time, and so from 68 or 69.

   Those who, as we mentioned above, claim that the sixth place must be
   assigned to the Emperor Vespasian, and that this was the reign in which
   the author lived, may still discover the reason for his statements in
   the appearance of this false Nero, if they suppose that they were
   written in the first period of Vespasian, that is to say at the be
   ginning of the year 70. On the other hand, the next false Nero of whom
   we hear did not appear at the end of the reign of Vespasian, but in the
   days of his successor, Titus. But a person who wrote in this reign
   (79-81) could in no circumstances say that he was living in the reign
   of the sixth Emperor.

   It has been thought that the expectation that the resuscitated Nero
   would be the eighth Emperor could only have been held when the seventh
   had already ascended the throne; otherwise a seventh would not have
   been prophesied. But the writer's conviction that Rome would have seven
   emperors was drawn from the Old Testament book of Daniel. This
   represents the matter in such a way that it might have been composed in
   the sixth century B.C. (in reality it was not written until 167-164
   B.C.), and prophesies in vii. 1-8 that there will appear one after
   another a lion, a bear, a panther with four heads, and another terrible
   beast with ten horns. According to vii. 17, what are meant are four
   empires which will rule the world one after another, the Babylonian
   down to 539 B.C., the Median which really ended as early as 550, the
   Persian, 539-330, to which the author assigns four kings instead of
   eleven, and the Greek with ten kings in Syria, to the last among whom
   the Jews were subject.

   Since the author of the Apocalypse does not pretend, like the book of
   Daniel, to prophesy so many centuries before the time in which he
   really lived, he speaks of only one world-wide empire, that of Home.
   Since, however, the book of Daniel and its description of the empires
   ruling the world was held to be a divine prophecy, which in the
   author's lifetime still waited for fulfilment, he (or one of his
   predecessors) has made its four beasts into one, which now, according
   to xiii. 1 f., has at the same time the characteristics of the lion,
   the bear, and the panther, and the ten horns of the fourth beast, but
   the seven heads of all four which these have all together. The idea
   that the end of the world is at hand is reckoned with, in spite of the
   seventh emperor, by representing in xvii. 10 that he will reign for a
   short time.

   Here again we can note well how the Apocalypse borrows its descriptions
   from an older prophecy, which it held to be sacred, and how at the same
   time it adapts this prophecy to its own present. This enables us to
   understand fully such a figure as that of the beast, which is really
   very curious. In other cases as well, the author continually takes his
   expressions and even whole sentences from the Old Testament. It may be,
   however, that several remarkable descriptions in the book are derived
   from other old prophecies, perhaps suggested by myths about the gods of
   the Babylonians or Persians.
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. THE NUMBER 666.

   The last point which confirms us in thinking that Nero is meant by the
   beast consists in the famous number (xiii. 18): "He that hath
   understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the
   number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty and six." The
   number of a man, or as it is said in xiii. 17, the number of the name
   of the beast is the number which results when all the numbers are added
   which are indicated by the letters of the name. In Latin only a few
   letters (I, V, X, L, C, M, D) are used for numbers, but in Greek and
   Hebrew all. Now the number 666 does really result when we write N(e)ron
   K(e)s(a)r (that is to say, Emperor Nero) in Hebrew letters and add up
   the numbers: 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 + 100 + 60 + 200 (the letters in
   brackets are not written in Hebrew). The number 666 also results from
   more than a hundred other solutions which have been suggested. But,
   apart from other reasons which show that the many popes, princes, and
   so forth down to the present time which people have tried to find in
   the beast, cannot be intended, no such calculation has been hit upon
   which might at the same time give 616 as the correct number. And yet
   there must be this alternative, for in many copies of the Apocalpyse
   even before the time of Irenaeus, that is to say, before 185, 616 is
   given as the number instead of 666, And this is the number we get if an
   "n" is omitted from Neron Kesar, which represents the number 50: Nero
   Kesar. This, too, would suit very well, for where Latin was spoken
   people said Nero, whereas the Greek form, familiar to the author of the
   Apocalypse himself, is Neron. It was natural to him to use Hebrew for
   the calculation, for in any case it was his mother-tongue, and it would
   make it less easy for uninitiated persons to solve the riddle. Irenaeus
   himself no longer knew the solution. It was rejected because Nero
   failed to return.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. TIME OF COMPOSITION.

   The most important sections of the book, that concerning Jerusalem, and
   those about the return of Nero from the underworld, date therefore in
   all probability from the years 68-70. None of the others indicates so
   clearly the date at which it came into existence. We ask therefore at
   once when the whole book may be supposed to have been put together. And
   here Irenaeus tells us that the Apocalypse was revealed and written
   down at the end of the reign of the Emperor Domitian, that is to say,
   in the year 95 or 96. We have already seen (p. 194 f.) how little we
   can rely on Irenaeus in such matters. But in this case we have no
   definite reason to dispute that the date he fixes for the composition
   of the Apocalypse is appropriate enough for the putting together of the
   whole book.
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. THE AUTHOR NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   But who is the author (or compiler) of the whole Apocalypse? In any
   case, it is not the same person who wrote the Fourth Gospel. The two
   works are fundamentally different.

   If the Gospel is not written in good Greek style, the style is at any
   rate smooth; the Apocalypse has very serious linguistic mistakes.
   Moreover, in both works Jesus is called the Lamb, but in each case a
   different Greek word is used. The Evangelist knows nothing about the
   things which are most important to the author of the Apocalypse, about
   the terrible events before the end of the world, about the descent of
   Christ and his army from the sky on white horses for the great battle
   with the kings of the earth, about the peaceful millennial rule of the
   faithful after their resurrection, about the Jerusalem which is to come
   down from heaven and is 12,000 stadia--say, a third of the radius of
   the earth--in length, breadth, and height, and consists of gold
   transparent like glass (xix. 11-21; xx. 1-6; xxi. 9-xxii. 5), &c.; and
   he cannot have wished to know anything about these things, since his
   style of thought was averse to all such expectations. Nor may we go so
   far as to assume that both men belonged to one and the same circle of
   kindred spirits. The most we can say is that the Apocalypse may have
   still been held in honour by those who held the same views as the
   Evangelist; he himself was far superior to its style of thought, and
   shows only in isolated cases that he was familiar with it but not, for
   in stance, where it is said that Jesus "is the Logos of God." In Rev.
   xix. 13 this is a later addition, for his name "no one knoweth, but he
   himself" (verse 12).
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. THE AUTHOR NOT THE APOSTLE JOHN.

   As we cannot ascribe the Gospel to the Apostle John, it is still
   possible that he may have written the Apocalypse (in i. 1, 4 the author
   calls himself John and a servant of Christ; in xxii. 9 a prophet). But,
   in that case we may be sure he would not call Jesus, exactly as if he
   were God, the Alpha and Omega, that is to say, as is expressly
   explained, the first and the last (literally the first and last letter
   of the Greek Alphabet; see xxii. 13; i. 17; ii. 8, just as in i. 8;
   xxi. 6), nor describe him as the first link of God's creation, if not
   as the author of God's creation (iii. 14). We found such expressions in
   the Fourth Gospel, but not in the Synoptics. And how can a personal
   disciple of Jesus imagine him in heaven as a lamb with seven horns and
   seven eyes, "standing as though it had been slain," and then taking a
   book from the hand of God and breaking its seals (v. 6-9; vi. 1), or
   conceive of him as he is described in i. 13-16? But even if he took
   such sections as these from another book and incorporated them in his
   own, we might expect that expression would be given at the same time to
   his own recollection of the life of Jesus. And yet almost the only case
   in which this is done is in the statement that Jesus is "the true
   witness" (i. 5; iii. 14), and we cannot be sure that this does not mean
   that Jesus is now testifying in heaven that what is prophesied in the
   Apocalypse is true (such is the idea in i. 2). We need only add that
   according to xxi. 14 the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb, that
   is to say, of Christ, are written on the twelve foundation-stones of
   the walls of the heavenly Jerusalem. Had one of these same apostles
   written this or even merely incorporated it in his book, we should be
   obliged to regard it in the same way as the title, "the disciple whom
   Jesus loved," if by this the Fourth Evangelist meant himself (pp.
   179-181).
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. THE AUTHOR JOHN THE ELDER?

   It is different if we think of John the Elder (p. 172 f.) as the final
   editor of the Apocalypse. This would explain the fact (which would also
   be appropriate if the author were the Apostle John) that the Jews are
   always represented as the chosen people of God (vii. 1-8), and that it
   is forbidden to eat flesh taken from a victim offered to a heathen idol
   (ii. 14, 20), though Paul declared it to have been allowed in principle
   (1 Cor. x. 25-27, 29b, 30) and only forbids it when a sensitive
   Christian who thought it for bidden might be offended by it (1 Cor.
   viii. 7-13; x. 28, 29 a), or when people, by sharing in the
   festivities, recognised the idol as a real god (1 Cor. x. 20 f .) In
   this matter a strongly Jewish sentiment in favour of the Law of the Old
   Testament still pervades the Apocalypse.

   We know further, as regards John the Elder (but not also as regards the
   Apostle), that he was very much interested in prophecies of the end of
   the world, and imagined, for example, that after the resurrection of
   the dead there would be on earth a millennial kingdom full of peace and
   happiness and ruled by Christ, exactly as it is described in Rev. xx.
   1-6.

   When we remember, finally, that John the Elder of Ephesus was leader of
   the Church of Western Asia Minor, we can easily see how well his
   position suits the tone in which the seven Epistles to the seven
   Communities in that region are composed in Rev. ii. f. They were
   certainly not sent separately to each one of those communities, and
   grouped together only at a later date. The way in which they are all
   written round the same circle of ideas, and almost modelled on one
   pattern, indicates far rather that from the very first they were only
   intended for publication in the book of Revelation. They make a weighty
   impression precisely because the same turns of expression recur so
   continually. They must, therefore, in any case, have been composed by
   the last contributor to the book, with the idea of recommending a
   definite circle of readers to take due note of the prophecies which
   follow in iv. 1-xxii. 5.

   We must not persist, however, in thinking that it was John the Elder
   who wrote the seven letters, and in this way, as well as by other
   embellishments which we can no longer specify exactly, brought the
   Apocalypse to a close. The description of Jesus tells against this,
   even if John him self only heard him for a short time. The work may
   also have been composed by another person in his name, just as well as
   the Second and Third Epistles of John.
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. SPIRIT OF THE BOOK.

   The seven Epistles in the Apocalypse contain severe words about evil
   conditions and the opponents of the author in some of the seven
   communities; but they also contain beautiful and truly religious
   utterances which are sufficient to compensate for the spirit of the
   whole book, which is sometimes narrow and vindictive (xvi. 6; xviii. 6
   f.), and concentrated upon such external and materialistic matters as
   eating, ruling, and white garments (ii. 7, 17; iii. 20 f.; xix. 8,
   &c.): "I stand at the door and knock" (iii. 20); "Be thou faithful unto
   death, and I will give thee the crown of life" (ii. 10); "hold fast
   that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown" (iii. 11). Not a
   single prophecy in the book has been fulfilled, and none remains to be
   fulfilled, since they are all framed in such a way that they ought to
   have been fulfilled within a few years. The main idea, that people
   should no longer attempt to improve upon the world, but should withdraw
   from it entirely, and simply wait and hope for a speedy end to it
   (especially xxii. 11), is certainly quite out of harmony with the most
   precious truths which Christianity has brought home to us in the course
   of centuries, and the fully developed seeds of which were already
   present in the ideas of Jesus; still, one of the most beautiful
   products of Christianity, and one which in the end concerns absolutely
   every individual, consists in that constancy and faithfulness which all
   the prophecies and admonitions of this book insist upon so forcibly.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V.

SPIRIT AND VALUE OF THE GOSPEL AND EPISTLES OF JOHN.

   THE task that remains is the most attractive of all. We have to enter
   wholeheartedly into the spirit of the other four Johannine writings,
   and to try to realise their importance, on the one hand for their own
   time, and on the other for all times. When we did this in the case of
   the Apocalypse, we could only speak with a good deal of reserve; as
   regards these other writings, however, we are in a much more favourable
   position, especially as regards the Gospel and the First Epistle. At
   this point we assume, of course, that the reader is acquainted with all
   that we have said at the close of the first part of this book (pp.
   151-165) about the intellectual currents observable in the Fourth
   Gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. ADMISSION OF THE GENTILES INTO THE CHRISTIAN BODY.

   A consideration of the question whether the Gentiles also ought to be
   encouraged to become Christians will perhaps be the clearest way of
   showing that, of all the writings of the New Testament, the Fourth
   Gospel marks the greatest step forward.

   At first Jesus did not think of extending to the Gentiles the benefits
   of his work (p. 34 f.), and he forbade his disciples to undertake
   mission work amongst them, or even among the Samaritans; though perhaps
   the reason was simply that he wished the preaching of salvation to
   reach, at any rate, all the members of his own race before the end of
   the world, which he imagined to be quite near (Mt. x. 5 f. 23). For a
   Gentile was no less capable than a Jew of meeting the requirements for
   entrance into the kingdom of God, a longing for God, humility,
   compassion, purity of heart (Mt. v. 3-9); and in this matter Paul has
   grasped the inmost thought of Jesus more correctly than the original
   apostles. These leave Paul and his associates to go on a mission to the
   Gentiles, while they address themselves solely to the Jews (p. 187);
   and Paul has to fight hard for the principle that the Gentiles do not
   need first to become Jews and to accept circumcision and the whole of
   the Jewish Law before they can become Christians (Gal. ii. 1-10; Acts
   xv. 1, 5). In the Apocalypse only Jews (12,000 from each of the twelve
   tribes) receive the seal on the fore head which protects them against
   the great tribulations of the last days before the end of the world
   (vii. 1-8); and it is only in a section added later (vii. 9-17) that
   the seer sees before the throne of God a numberless crowd of all
   peoples who have come there, because they have steadfastly endured the
   great persecution of the Christians.

   In the Fourth Gospel, however, the admission of Gentiles to
   Christianity is quite a matter of course. When Greeks come near to
   Jesus and wish to meet him, he sees in their coming the beginning of
   the hour in which he will be glorified, that is to say, exalted to
   heaven (xii. 20-23). This story, which at an earlier point in our
   discussion (p. 78) seemed very curious, is now intelligible. The last
   and greatest goal of Jesus earthly message was the admission of the
   Gentiles to Christianity. And in x. 16 he says: "And other sheep I
   have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring . . . and they
   shall become one flock, one shepherd." Only such views as these could
   make Christianity a world-religion.

   For the same purpose again it was important that it should not seem to
   be dangerous to the State. In the case of Paul, the Acts of the
   Apostles always represents the Roman officials as recognising that it
   did not really threaten the State (xviii. 14 f.; xxiii. 29; xxv. 18 f.;
   cp. xix. 37; xxvi. 31 f.). In the Third Gospel, the same author, going
   beyond Mk. and Mt., tells us that Pilate declared three times that he
   found no fault in Jesus (xxiii. 4, 14 f., 22). Jn. emphasises this
   still more (xviii. 28-xix. 16) and adds, moreover, that in the course
   of his trial Jesus expressly said that his kingdom was not of this
   world (xviii. 36).

  2. STRUGGLE WITH THE JEWS.

   If Christianity was to become a world-religion, it had to break away
   more and more from Judaism; and this cer tainly could not be done
   without a struggle. The great majority of the Jews from the time of the
   Apostle Paul had already adopted a hostile attitude towards
   Christianity: this would make the Christians despise them all the more.
   The way in which Jesus is represented as speaking of the Jews, the Law,
   the feasts of the Jews, as matters of utter indifference to him, and
   which to us seems inconceivable (p. 15 f.), entirely harmonises with
   the ideas of Christians in the second century, who were for the most
   part Gentiles by birth, and is most appropriate if the Evangelist was
   alive at the time of the rising of Bar Cochba (p. 200 f.). When he
   represents Jesus as being continually engaged in controversies with the
   Jews, all those points are touched upon which were in question between
   Christians and Jews in the second century: Jesus is really the Son of
   God; the Jews refusal to believe this is simply due to obstinacy, &c.
   In this way, the author answers all the needs of his time. We must
   leave the question whether there were also followers of John the
   Baptist to be refuted, and whether it is against these that proof is
   offered of the great superiority of Jesus (p. 80).
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. APPRECIATION OF MONTANISM AND GNOSTICISM.

   We see more clearly how the author appreciates those intellectual
   movements of his age with which he feels that he him self has something
   in common. He prepared the way even for Montanus of Phrygia and his
   followers, who after the year 156 came forward with new prophecies and
   declared that this age of theirs, the age of the Holy Spirit which
   filled them, represented a higher level compared with the time in which
   Jesus lived, by making Jesus himself say in Jn. xvi. 12 f., that the
   disciples could not at the time understand many other things which he
   had to say to them, but that after his death the Holy Spirit would come
   and lead them into all truth.

   But it was, in particular, the captivating ideas of Gnosticism that the
   Fourth Evangelist appropriated (pp. 152 f. 158-160). He did a great
   service to his age by showing that one could be a thinker, appreciate
   knowledge, stand in the midst of a stream of thoroughly intellectual
   movements, and yet remain a faithful son of the Church. In this way, we
   may presume, he contributed not a little to keep Christians from
   splitting into two classes having hardly any connecting link, the
   intellectual aristocracy of the Gnostics and simple believers. In face
   of mutual feuds and of persecution from without, such cleavage might
   have endangered the continued existence of Christianity altogether. The
   Second and Third Epistles of John, which aimed at keeping the
   communities closely knit together by means of the authority of the
   Church, also deserve part of the credit for having warded off this
   danger. To us the effort may not seem, very exalted or even very
   beautiful: but, nevertheless, it was productive of good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. IDEAS ABOUT THE STATE AFTER DEATH.

   The Fourth Evangelist, by adopting the view that the visible world is
   only a perishable copy of the invisible, at the same time introduced a
   revolution in the ideas about the state after death, the results of
   which have been felt even down to the present time. The Old Testament,
   and with it Jesus and the whole of primitive Christendom, imagined a
   future state of happiness upon earth. Even in the Apocalypse (xxi. 1
   f.), we read of the New Jerusalem descending from heaven upon a
   renovated earth.

   Only in a few passages does Paul express the idea (2 Cor. v. 1-8; Phil.
   i. 23) that the faithful immediately after their death will come to
   Christ in heaven. It is not until we turn to the Epistle to the Hebrews
   (xii. 27 f.) that we find the teaching that at the end of things the
   earth will pass away entirely and only the heavens remain; there, in
   the heavenly Jerusalem, which will not descend upon earth, is also the
   place where Christians will enjoy eternal happiness (xii. 22 f.). But
   whereas this truth is not easily to be discovered in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, in Jn. it is expressed with absolute clearness (xiv. 2): "in
   my Father's house are many mansions. . . I go," by being exalted to
   heaven, "to prepare a place for you."
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. JESUS THE SON OF GOD AND LOGOS IN HEAVEN.

   But the Fourth Evangelist exercised the greatest influence by adopting
   to some extent the view of the world held by the great thinkers of his
   age and applying it to the Person of Jesus. Paul and those who followed
   him (pp. 144-146) had already ascribed to Jesus a life with God in
   heaven before his descent upon earth, and even a share in the creation
   of the world; but Jn. is the first to start clearly with the idea that
   Jesus was the Logos and that without him God could have produced no
   effect upon the world, because He, being perfectly good, was obliged
   without question to keep at a distance from the world which was
   thoroughly evil. The idea that Jesus was begotten of God as a human son
   is begotten by his human father, an idea which Paul and those who
   followed him had given expression to before Jn., must of itself have
   helped very much to make Gentiles familiar with Jesus from the start
   and favourably disposed towards his worship, for they knew of and
   worshipped so many deities who were begotten by a god. But the
   statement was truly a greater one when it could be said that the Logos,
   whose work the deepest thinkers had found to be necessary if the divine
   influence was to come into the world, was no other than Jesus. While
   the conception of Jesus as a Son of God might make an impression on the
   lower classes among the Gentiles, that of Jesus as the Logos would
   attract the people of culture. And, as a matter of fact, it was very
   important that Christianity should not always remain a religion merely
   for uncultured and uninfluential people. In the form in which the
   Fourth Gospel presented it, it was capable of satisfying the highest
   demands of the age. Here attention was no longer paid to the fact that
   this Jesus in whom people were to believe was a Jew--a fact which might
   have greatly repelled many Gentiles--for he is described in such a way
   as to make him quite superior to everything Jewish. And so Jn., even
   more than Paul, has brought it about that Jesus should be recognised as
   being what he was--without Jesus himself thinking the idea out--the
   Saviour of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. EMPHASIS ON THE CHURCH.

   True, there is another side to this picture. There was now no longer
   any other way of attaining to blessedness than by believing in Jesus.
   He himself must now be represented as continually requiring people to
   believe in him--a request which the Jesus of the Synoptics made so
   seldom. The branches must abide in the vine (by which Jesus means
   himself), otherwise they will wither. "Apart from me ye can do nothing"
   (xv. 4 f.). But this means at the same time that one must be a member
   of the Church and submit to the ordinances of the Church; for example,
   to those of the Second Epistle of John (verse 10 f.), which forbids one
   to receive Christian brethren who hold different doctrines, or even to
   greet them. People are now divided into those who are in communion with
   the Church and are blessed, and those who are outside and are not; and
   the fact that one belongs to the Church is apt, moreover, to depend
   more on faith than on that doing of the will of God which Jesus
   required so continually in the Synoptics. On the other hand, the
   feeling that one is one of the elect leads only too readily to
   presumption; the power which is associated with ecclesiastical
   officialism leads to domination, and even, in certain circumstances, to
   mercenariness (1 Pet. v. 2; 1 Tim. iii. 8).

   Nevertheless, it was necessary to establish a Church communion. The
   desire to enjoy a common religious possession with people of a like
   mind cannot be repressed. Moreover, such communion is a powerful
   support to the individual, whether he comes to be distressed by doubts,
   is in trouble, or is in danger of falling into sin. Institutions which
   serve this purpose, whatever dangers may lurk in them, must be
   considered instruments of progress.

   To all intents and purposes, the Fourth Evangelist never speaks of such
   institutions (xxi. 15-17 is by a later writer; see p. 186 f.). He has
   no interest whatever in episcopal authority and such like things. Had
   he had, it would have been a simple matter to make Jesus say something
   more than he does in xx. 21-23 about the privileges of the Apostles.
   His idea of the Church is still thoroughly ideal a community with
   Christ alone as its head. Nevertheless, we should make a great mistake
   if we were to think that he is indifferent to the Church. Every one who
   wishes to be blessed must share the Church's belief in Jesus; he who
   does not share it is already judged (iii. 18). He who wishes to be a
   shepherd of the Church must come in to the sheep through the door,
   which is Jesus himself, that is to say, through faith in him (x. 7-9;
   see p. 135). Indeed, according to the one point of view, with which, it
   is true, we shall soon have to contrast another, no man can have life
   in him unless he partakes of the Supper (vi. 51b-56).

   But beyond question the author, while emphasising these thoughts, does
   so in moderation. In the First Epistle of John, the believer's
   consciousness that he comes from God, possesses full knowledge, and is
   free from sin (iv. 4, 6; ii. 20 f., 27; iii. 9; v. 18 by the side of i.
   8-ii. 2: "if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus),
   certainly goes very far; but it is due to a connection with Gnosticism,
   more than to the idea that one belongs to the Church. Both authors
   never forget that it is the individual who must have the faith and keep
   the commandments of God; they do not say that, because he is a member
   of the Church, any demand which should really be required of him will
   be lessened. If, on the one hand, the Church is a blessing, and so far
   as it is an evil, on the other hand, is a necessary evil, we shall have
   to admit that only the Second and Third Epistles of Jn. transgress the
   limits of what has to be recognised as an appropriate move forward.
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. JESUS AS A DIVINE BEING UPON EARTH.

   The really dangerous aspect of the matter when, by describing Jesus as
   the Son of God and the Logos, people easily induced the Gentiles to
   believe in him, is seen in another direction. They had to carry this
   description through. It had to be shown in detail how be walked on
   earth as a divine being, simply proclaiming his high rank, doing the
   greatest miracles for his own glorification, and for that reason
   keeping away from the grave of Lazarus for two days, while at the same
   time an effort had to be made to maintain that he was really a man. We
   need not stop again to explain how difficult it is for the mind to
   imagine this figure, or how hard it is for the religious sentiment to
   accept it. Even if it were applied to the Jesus of the Synoptics, that
   would be a hard saying: "I am the way and the truth and the life; no
   man cometh unto the Father but by me" (xiv. 6). People without number
   have either never had an opportunity of hearing about him, or in spite
   of knowing of him, hold to another religion or to a way of thinking
   which cannot ascribe any merits to some mediator who has appeared at
   some previous date; and yet, as a matter of fact, they display as much
   humility, love, and fidelity to God as the many Christians who have
   devoted themselves to the faith of the Church. But how much harder is
   the saying, when it is the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel in whom one must
   believe unconditionally if one wishes to enter into communion with God!

   For centuries this demand has been made and complied with; and the
   books of history suggest rarely to some extent how many have been the
   doubts, and how great has been the torture of souls. To-day, in ever
   widening circles, people resolutely refuse to comply with it. And since
   this has happened, it may be considered fortunate that Jn. has made the
   demand so emphatically. For as a result of it we have been made to
   decide that no further move can be made in his direction, and that we
   must go back to the Synoptics and try to find in their account
   and--with their own guidance--in the background of their account, the
   figure of Jesus as he really existed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. WHY DID JN. WRITE A GOSPEL?

   But why did this person write a Gospel? We are sure that the question
   has long ago occurred to many of our readers. But what other kind of
   book should he have written? A treatise, or a letter like the First
   Epistle of Jn. as found in our Bible? What does this contain? Hardly
   anything but general maxims: we must love God, we must shun false
   teachers. Now the Gospel also contains such maxims: God is Spirit; a
   man must be born from above (iv. 24, iii. 3), and so forth. But
   Christianity does not purpose to be a system of Wisdom, based upon
   theory; it is a religion which appeals to Jesus. Therefore in a book
   which is to make an impression he must be represented as coming forward
   and saying: "a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
   another;" "I am the Light of the world;" "I am the Bread of Life;" "I
   am the Resurrection and the Life" (xiii. 34; viii. 12; vi. 35; xi. 25).
   At Jesus hand the Christians, and with them the Fourth Evangelist,
   wished to receive no less than all that they thought themselves
   entitled to hope for. And, similarly, if all the blessings which still
   make Christianity precious to us at the present day were to be brought
   into the world of the Gentiles, it was of all things necessary that
   Jesus should be recognised by them; it was necessary therefore to
   record his acts, especially if the Gnostics introduced the danger of
   resolving his earthly life into a mere phantom existence (p. 150).

   And it was necessary to be able to describe everything as being as
   sublime as possible. It would not do to stop short at the teaching of
   Paul, that Jesus laid aside his divine attributes before he came down
   from heaven. If he ever possessed them, he must actually reveal them,
   and reveal them just where they could be seen by human eyes--upon
   earth. This idea must necessarily have arisen sooner or later. The
   higher the god, the more powerful his help; and Gentiles, who hitherto
   had always turned from a god who was not sufficiently powerful to one
   who was supposed to be more so, would only address themselves to a
   powerful god. In fact, even if Jn. had refrained from writing a Gospel,
   another person would have written one in the same sense, and we should
   simply have to make our complaint elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. SOME SPECIAL IDEAS OF ABIDING VALUE.

   What we have said may have suggested that the Fourth Gospel with the
   Epistles of Jn. met the needs of its age in a very successful way, but
   hardly gives us anything that is of value for all times. Certainly, the
   abiding worth of the Gospel is not to be found where people seek it,
   and where the claim of the book itself, that it is a history of the
   life and work of Jesus, implies that they must seek it. Nevertheless,
   it is seen to be all the greater in other respects.

   If the authors of the Gospel and the First Epistle were not thinkers in
   the strict sense of the term, but have taken up philosophical ideas
   simply in order to defend their own religion, yet by their
   declarations, "God is Spirit" (Jn. iv. 24: that is to say, God is of
   spiritual nature; not, God is a spirit) and "God is Love" (1 Jn. iv. 8,
   16), they have expressed the nature of God with a precision which
   cannot be surpassed. Their leaning towards Gnosticism has given them
   other ideas of abiding value: a deep-rooted feeling of dependence upon
   God (Jn. iii. 27; pp. 149 f., 159 f.), and that interest in knowledge
   and truth which no religion can ever dispense with. And yet, at the
   same time, the onesidedness to which this might lead is obviated by the
   fact that what is made the test of knowing God is the keeping of his
   commandments (1 Jn. ii. 3).

   Equally deep is the truth hidden in the saying of Jesus (Jn. vii. 17):
   "If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching,
   whether it be of God, or whether I speak from myself." The context
   shows that by the will of God, which is to be kept, is meant, not the
   command to live a moral life, but nothing else than that teaching of
   Jesus which consists in declaring that people must believe in his
   divine origin. They will find this to be true as soon as they humbly
   accept it. Whether this statement is correct is another question. But
   it carries us farther than its application in this passage. It contains
   a criterion which is true in all cases and will show how man, to whom
   the knowledge whether a thing is of God has been made so difficult, can
   learn in another way, by trial, by a provisional submission of his
   will, whether it will satisfy him to such an extent that he can rest
   assured that it is divine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. COMMUNION WITH GOD.

   The First Epistle of John speaks in most beautiful language of what is
   at the heart of religion, communion with God. In the Gospel, since it
   is assumed that God is separated from the world, this communion is
   always effected through Jesus, who says, for example, in xvii. 23, "I
   in them, and thou in me"; according to the Epistle, man himself,
   without a mediator, feels that God is in him and that he is in God (p.
   209 f.). This mysticism, the intenseness of which remains, whether it
   consist in a feeling of union with God, or with Christ, is something
   peculiar to the Johannine Writings. Nowhere else in the New Testament
   has it so profound a meaning; in most cases, indeed, the gap between
   man and God, and man and Christ, is represented as being so great that
   the writers cannot imagine any such union. In the Johannine Writings
   the idea at the same time serves in a valuable way to counter balance
   the emphasis laid on knowledge, and thus assigns the feelings the place
   that rightfully belongs to them in religion.

   The actualisation of this close communion with God, however, is found
   in love of God to man and of man to God, and from these in turn flows
   the love of the brethren for one another. Not even Paul in the
   thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians has written
   anything more profound about love than that found in the First Epistle
   of John (iii. 13-18; iv. 7-21). The original source of love, it tells
   us, is God. Our love for Him and for the brethren only flow from His
   love; but it should do so for the very reason that God first loved us.
   It is of the very essence of love for God that we should keep those
   commandments of His which are not hard when they are obeyed from love,
   and that all fear of Him should vanish. In fact, though God is
   originally unknown, through our love to the brethren, he becomes
   perceptible as one who is present in our souls. And the Fourth
   Evangelist could not have summarised the life-work of Jesus more
   appropriately than he does when he makes him say (xiii. 34 f .): "A new
   commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another. . . . By this
   shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
   another." In this way, as a matter of fact, he turns from his great
   doctrines about Jesus dignity and his derivation from God, to the
   simplest fact which the Synoptics tell us about him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  11. REDEMPTION THROUGH JESUS.

   He does this again, though with a different result, in what he says
   about the redemption brought by Jesus. According to the Synoptics,
   Jesus emancipated (redeemed) those who attached themselves to him from
   two kinds of illusion and from two kinds of sin: from the illusions of
   a religion of fear, and of a religion of pretences, as it is
   represented in the parable in Lk. (xviii. 9-14) by the Pharisee as
   distinguished from the publican, and from the sins of selfishness and
   worldliness (Mt. xvi. 25 f.). He does so by proclaiming his teaching,
   by illustrating it by his own example, and by his death, which proves
   that he is ready not merely to come forward and champion his cause, but
   even to die for it. Remission of guilt, forgiveness of sins, was
   included in this emancipation from the religion of fear. He is not in
   the least aware that his death is required in order that God may be
   merciful out of consideration for the sacrifice. When he promises the
   spiritually poor, the meek, the merciful, those who do God's will, and
   those who become like children, that they shall enjoy the Kingdom of
   Heaven, no previous conditions are laid down (Mt. v. 3-9; vii. 21;
   xviii. 3); when in the parable in Lk. (xv. 11-32) the lost son returns
   home penitent, his father goes to meet him, falls on his neck and
   kisses him without asking whether any one has offered a sacrifice for
   him; while Jesus is still present amongst his followers, he teaches
   them to pray "Forgive us our sins," and comforts them with the words,
   "Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will
   refresh you" (Mt. vi. 12; xi. 28). Picture to yourself a scene in which
   some poor child of man, burdened with guilt, casts himself at Jesus'
   feet and asks that he may realise this promise. Had Jesus thought his
   own death necessary before forgiveness of sin could be realised, he
   would have been obliged to say to him: "No, no, I did not mean that;
   you must wait until I have died for you on the cross." And yet before
   the declaration in Mt. xi. 28 he was silent about it!

   On the last evening of his life, Jesus said: "this is my body;" "this
   is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many" (Mk. xiv. 22-24).
   But only Mt. tells us that he added "for forgiveness of sins;" and in
   the words, which have been thought so sacred, and moreover from the
   first have been repeated at every celebration of the Supper, we may be
   certain, nothing was omitted. On the other hand, additions might
   certainly be made; the person who officiated at the celebration would
   first express something as his own idea, and then at a later date this
   would be wrongly regarded as a saying of Jesus (we have a very clear
   example in the introductory words, "take," "eat," in Mt., of which Mk.
   has only one, and Paul, in 1 Cor. xi. 24, and Lk. neither).

   In what sense Jesus thought of shedding his blood for many, we can
   easily realise when we remember that he was reclining at the paschal
   meal (pp. 117-130). God had promised to pass by those houses, the doors
   of which were smeared with the blood of the Paschal lamb, when on the
   night before the Exodus of the Israelites with Moses from Egypt, he
   would kill all the first-born (Exod. xii. 7, 12 f.; 21-27). The lamb,
   therefore, had to die that others might be spared from death. In like
   manner, Jesus will give his life to the fury of the enemy, that his
   followers, whose lives would otherwise have been equally threatened,
   might escape, since after their Master's death people would think them
   harmless. We see then that he certainly wished to make his death a
   sacrifice, not, however, in order that they might have forgiveness of
   sins, but that they might be preserved from misfortune, and from a
   misfortune which they did not deserve. [8] And if he added further,
   that his blood was the blood of a covenant, his idea was that he was
   again knitting them closely to God by a covenant, and that in the Old
   Testament whenever such a covenant was made a sacrificial victim was
   slain (Jer. xxxiv. 18; Gen. xv. 10, 17 f.; Exod. xxiv. 3-8). Here again
   there is no idea of a sacrifice for sin.

   And the only other passage in the Synoptics in which Jesus attaches
   importance to his death for the salvation of men, can be understood in
   the same way as the paschal sacrifice: "for verily the Son of Man came
   not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a
   ransom for many" (Mk. x. 45 = Mt. xx. 28), that is to say, that they
   might be spared from the danger of themselves falling victims to
   persecution. Instead of the Greek word "ransom," Jesus, who spoke
   Aramaic, may very well have used a word which simply meant "an
   instrument of escape." If, however, a sacrifice for the forgiveness of
   sins were really intended, we should be compelled to suspect that the
   concluding words ("and to give his life" . . .) are a later addition
   based upon an idea of the Apostle Paul, since they would be in
   contradiction with all that we have just found in the Synoptics. As far
   as the context is concerned, they can be dispensed with at once, and
   are not found in Lk. (xxii. 27) where the introductory words (in a
   somewhat different version) occur.

   Paul or some of his predecessors (1 Cor. xv. 3), with their strictly
   Jewish way of thinking, introduced into Christianity the idea that God
   was so angry with men for their sins that he had decreed the eternal
   destruction of all of them, and could only have mercy upon them if his
   own son died on the cross as a sacrifice on their behalf. In doing so,
   according to the opinion of Paul, Jesus took upon him the punishment of
   death which originally men themselves deserved; but he took it upon him
   as one who was guilt less, and therefore his offering became a
   sin-offering to God. This view has been held fast to in Church doctrine
   down to the present day, regardless of the fact that it is not found at
   all in the Synoptics, and only sporadically in the Fourth Gospel (p.
   209), and that in the New Testament the purpose of Jesus' death is
   described in more than twenty different ways, [9] which would not
   certainly have been the case if people had known of one generally satis
   factory explanation.

   If, as the Fourth Gospel represents, Jesus is the Logos, it cannot have
   been through his death that he first brought redemption. He is supposed
   to bring the world into conformity with God's will, since God himself
   was obliged to avoid contact with it. This he could only do by his own
   activity, and so, when upon earth, by his works and preaching.
   According to Jn., he may be compared especially with the light which
   shines upon the world; and so the only important question is whether
   people turn to him or away from him (iii. 19-21; i. 4-13). If they do
   the former (that is to say, as Jn. puts it, believe in him), they are
   quit of sin from that hour. But this brings us at once face to face
   with a character which is familiar to us from the Synoptics. In the
   Synoptics also Jesus brings salvation by his words and works, not by
   his death; and declares that people's sins are forgiven at once,
   wherever he finds the right frame of mind (Mk. ii. 5, 9; Lk. vii. 47
   f.).

   May we suppose then that Jn. here preserves a correct recollection of
   the Life of Jesus? Certainly not. He only arrives at this agreement
   with the Synoptics after making an extraordinarily roundabout journey.
   Paul, influenced by a kind of piety which was very conscientious, and
   for that reason very punctilious, in his teaching about the sacrificial
   death of Jesus introduced foreign matter into the Gospel. Jn., though
   in a tacit and quiet way, removes it again. Had he remembered that it
   was not originally part of the Gospel, he would have omitted it
   altogether, whereas, as a matter of fact, he uses it several times (i.
   29, 36; on xi. 50-52; xvii. 19b, see pp. 271, 272 f.). It is not used
   by him in other places, simply because it could not easily be adapted
   to the other new matter which he felt obliged of his own accord to
   introduce into the Gospel of Jesus, we mean to the doctrine that Jesus
   was the Logos. To this doctrine itself he had only been led by that
   other mistake made by Paul when he supposed that Jesus was begotten as
   the Son of God before the creation of the world, and had existed in
   heaven down to the time of his descent upon earth. The idea that he was
   the Logos only carries us one step beyond this teaching. And yet it is
   this alone that gives rise to the doctrine that Jesus brought
   redemption, not by his death, but by his appearance upon earth. Thus we
   have here an exemplification of the great law of intellectual progress,
   that very often one truth proceeds from another only by the pathway of
   error. Jn. only succeeded in arriving at the truth which already
   existed in the Life of Jesus, by adopting the second of Paul's mistakes
   and carrying it farther.

   We ourselves, nevertheless, have reason to rejoice at the result. We no
   longer find in Jn. any of Paul's laborious arguments to prove that the
   Jewish Law has ceased to be binding upon Christians, and that the
   sinner is justified, that is to say, is declared righteous by God,
   through faith. If God is to declare any one righteous, he must be
   represented as a judge, and must as such examine one's works; and the
   faith which the sinner has merely to exhibit will not be a work, but
   the opposite of any kind of service: it must be simply trust, purely
   the opening of the hand to receive a gift from God--and this, moreover,
   is what it really is. Paul himself in truth found it very difficult to
   preserve intact the most deeply-rooted feature of this kind of faith,
   for with him faith always involved the acceptance as unimpeachably true
   of two facts of the past which criticism might only too easily shatter,
   and as a matter of fact has shattered altogether. The first is that
   Jesus suffered death for the purpose of blotting out the sins of
   mankind; the second that he rose from the dead after three days.

   Now, the latter Jn. also requires us to believe, that is to say, to
   accept as true; but the faith in Jesus person which Jn. asks
   for--although it also includes acceptance of the truth of his heavenly
   origin--consists again, exactly as it does in the Synoptics, simply in
   feeling oneself drawn to him, in confiding in him, in recognising him
   as one's redeemer. Similarly--in place of the above-noted difficulties
   in Paul's teaching about justification by faith--in the Johannine
   writings everything has once more become so simple that the important
   matter is again, just as in the Synoptics, to do the will of God or
   Jesus, concerning which especially the First Epistle of John speaks in
   such beautiful language (ii. 3 f., iii. 22, 24, v. 3 f.; Jn. viii. 51,
   xiv. 21, xv. 10, 14). In fact, when Jesus washes his disciples' feet he
   speaks of it simply as an example which he is giving them (xiii. 14
   f.), an idea, for a parallel to which we shall search in vain in many
   writings of the New Testament. If the roundabout way by which the
   author arrives at the teaching that Jesus was the Logos, and in the
   later course of which this beautiful language has all taken shape,
   represents doctrines which are as unacceptable to us now as they were
   before; if Jesus' washing of the disciples' feet on the last evening of
   his life, about which the Synoptics know nothing, remains now, as much
   as before, something which did not happen; yet the result has been that
   the working-out of those ideas current amongst Christians of the time
   which so often took people farther and farther away from the original
   form of Christianity, leads us back in several main points to its
   primitive simplicity, and so to what at the present time is the only
   form that can satisfy us.

  12. SPIRITUALISING OF MATERIALISTIC IDEAS.

   But the Fourth Gospel is most distinctly modern when it substitutes for
   the materialistic and literally understood ideas of the earliest
   Christians, the spiritual interpretations which were already implied in
   them without people being conscious of the fact. Usually people have no
   idea how many of the liberal ideas of the present may be found in this
   Gospel. As regards miracles, we have already decided, that they are
   only emphatically declared to be real events from one point of view,
   but that from another standpoint they are regarded purely as symbolical
   descriptions of profound truths (pp. 95-100, 105 f., 109); and those
   who are no longer disposed to use them as buttresses of the Christian
   faith need only appeal to the words which Jesus addressed to Thomas
   (xx. 29): "blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."
   The doctrine of the Trinity, which represents that from eternity
   Father, Son, and Spirit have existed as three divine Persons, and yet
   only as one divine substance, cannot by any means be maintained in face
   of Jn.'s statement (vii. 39): "the Spirit did not yet exist, because
   Jesus was not yet (by his exaltation to heaven) glorified." The belief
   that prevailed throughout the whole of the first century, that Jesus
   would come back from heaven to establish the blessed kingdom of the
   last days, has, in the mind of Jn., resolved itself into the idea that
   the Holy Spirit, though of course at a quite different time, will come
   into the hearts of believers. It is all the same to Jn. whether he says
   that Jesus will come again (xiv. 3, 18, 28; xvi. 22), or that the Holy
   Spirit will come because God or Jesus will send it (xiv. 16 f., 26; xv.
   26; xvi. 7). The Jesus who has been exalted to heaven is for Jn., that
   is to say, as he was already for Paul (2 Cor. iii. 17), this Spirit;
   and this again is the reason why the Holy Spirit does not exist before
   Jesus ascension.

   It was generally expected by the early Christians that Jesus second
   coming from heaven would be the signal for a bodily resurrection and
   for the judgment to be held before the throne of God upon all mankind;
   and that eternal life would then begin. In Jn., on the other hand, the
   judgment takes place during life, when a distinction is drawn between
   men, and the one section turns towards Jesus, the light which streams
   upon the world, while the other turns away from him (iii. 19-21). This
   very moment marks the be ginning of eternal life for such as believe in
   him or acknowledge God and Jesus; and it is a life which can never be
   interrupted by the death of the body, and so does not need to be
   introduced by a resurrection of the body. Compare xi. 25 f.; xvii. 3,
   and particularly v. 24: "He that heareth my word, and believeth him
   that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath
   passed (already) out of death into life." In fact, participation in the
   Supper, which according to vi. 51b-56 seems so essential, is made a
   matter which at bottom is of no importance by the concluding words in
   vi. 63: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing;
   the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life." In
   fact, we can hardly conceive of the matter in a more modern way. And
   obviously it is not merely the Supper that is stripped of its
   importance by these words.
     __________________________________________________________________

  13. FINAL APPRECIATION.

   We have thus produced ample evidence to show that, although we cannot
   admit the claim of the Fourth Gospel to be regarded as a record of the
   life of Jesus, it deserves the highest consideration at the present
   time when it is viewed as a book dealing with the essence of
   Christianity. So long as it is read with the idea of finding each
   particular statement about Jesus' works and discourses to be correct,
   it cannot be enjoyed. But when this idea is abandoned, and when, in
   addition, Jesus continual claim upon people to believe in his heavenly
   origin is set aside, when therefore attention is given only to the
   thoughts which he is made to express, or when one reads attentively the
   First Epistle of John, one is impressed by a profundity of thought and
   feeling, the equal of which cannot easily be found anywhere else in the
   New Testament.

   We may be sure that from the experience of his own soul he knew the
   value of the benefits offered by religion. He is aware that the
   religious man has light to illuminate his path (xii. 35), and that he
   possesses truth--truth which does not merely preserve him from error,
   but, more than that, delivers him from sin and leads him to holiness
   (viii. 32-35; xvii. 17-19). He knows of that faith which means
   resigning one's ego entirely to a higher personality; he knows of that
   depth of meaning imparted to life which implies that this truly begins
   at the moment of faith's awakening and cannot be interrupted by the
   death of the body; he knows of a spring of living water in his soul
   (iv. 14) and of the true bread from heaven which lasts for the life
   eternal (vi. 27, 32); he knows of a peace which the world cannot give
   (xiv. 27; xvi. 33), and of perfect joy (xv. 11; xvii. 13). In a word,
   he knows what it is to feel oneself a child of God and a friend of
   one's Master, instead of a slave who does not know what his Master is
   doing (xv. 14 f.); he knows what it is for a man to feel at one with
   God and with his Saviour.

   For all that constituted his religious aspirations he now found
   satisfaction in Christianity. But to him this means that he found it in
   the person of Jesus. For, in addition to all that we have mentioned, he
   knew something else: that no man has ever seen God, that none can
   receive any thing unless it be given from heaven, and that one must be
   chosen and cannot be the chooser of his own Saviour (i. 18; iii. 27;
   xv. 16). Consequently he needed revelation, and, sharing as he did the
   ideas of the age in which he lived, he could only conceive of this
   being imparted by a divine being who came down from heaven, proclaimed
   all truth, and brought every kind of salvation. The result is he has
   sketched the Jesus of his own mind in such a way that we men of to-day
   are often no longer able to find in him the true revelation. And yet in
   spite of this we can understand the way in which this deeply religious
   man came to build up this faith of his, In his Gospel we can still
   discover some very homely statements about Jesus, which show how at
   first a person's attention might have been attracted to him simply as a
   remarkable phenomenon: "never man so spake" (vii. 46); "he that
   speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory, but he that seeketh the
   glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is
   in him" (vii. 18); "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth
   down his life for the sheep" (x. 11). But the author having by such
   observations as these, which are really appropriate to the historical
   Jesus, gained confidence in Jesus, his longing for revelation would of
   itself carry him farther so that he could accept everything else that
   was recorded of this same Jesus and all those ideas that necessarily
   seemed to him to be presupposed if in his own person he represented a
   perfect revelation of God. [10]

   This again leads us to the thought that the author of the Fourth Gospel
   deserves credit for wishing to ascribe to Jesus all the sublime
   thoughts that he had made his own, especially when we remember that
   people of other ages, the present not excepted, have in the same way
   been only too ready to find in Jesus all that at any time has seemed to
   them truest and best in religion, We can understand now how it is that
   the author sees in this Jesus, and in him alone, the way to God, the
   truth and the life (xiv. 6); we can understand the confidence with
   which he can make him say, "whosoever drinketh of the water that I
   shall give him shall never thirst" (iv. 14), or "if a man keep my word,
   he shall never see death" (viii. 51). And one will be glad to be able
   to say after him, though the words were addressed to another kind of
   Jesus, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life"
   (vi. 68).

   At the same time he has not shut his eyes to the truth that Christian
   knowledge needed to make progress. After the death of Jesus, the Holy
   Spirit is to guide the disciples into all truth (xvi. 13). We may
   certainly suppose that the Evangelist himself felt that he was
   receiving some of this guidance when he advanced so far beyond his
   predecessors in his effort to spiritualise Christianity. In fact, he
   has contributed very greatly towards establishing the truth of those
   words which in his Gospel (iv. 23 f.) Jesus addresses to the woman of
   Samaria: "the hour cometh and now is (already) when the true
   worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth . . . God is
   Spirit, and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] In the suggestion here offered, which of course is not meant to be
   anything more than a suggestion, we have deliberately assumed that when
   the Fourth Evangelist devoted himself to Christianity he was of mature
   age. The growth of his ideas could be explained with very much greater
   simplicity if we might suppose that he had been educated in
   Christianity from the days of his youth.

NOTE TO PAGE 248.

   PROF. SCHMIEDEL has kindly allowed me to add a note to his remarks on
   p. 248, and to make them a subject for discussion. In doing so, I am
   breaking through my general principle as Editor of these Volksbücher,
   which is not to express any opinion upon disputable passages.

   Personally it does not seem possible to me that at this decisive hour
   when Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples for the last
   time, he should have thought more of the bodily needs of his followers
   than of the needs of their souls. He himself said, "Fear not those who
   kill the body, but those who can kill the soul," &c. And are we to
   suppose that in face of that calamity which was about to rush upon them
   through his death, he thought these words no longer applied? It seems
   to me that Jesus would be going against the spirit of his own words,
   if, when he took that pathetic farewell of his disciples, he was silent
   about the importance of his death for their souls, and in his kindly
   anxiety thought only of the safety of their bodies. When Socrates went
   to death, he explained to his disciples that he could not try to escape
   it, since his death was necessary for the welfare of their souls--and
   can Jesus at this supreme moment have thought only of the bodily
   welfare of his followers?

   SCHIELE.

   The saying of Jesus (Mt. x. 28 = Lk. xii. 4 f.) quoted by the Editor of
   the present series must not be taken by itself. It must be read in
   connection with the following words: "but rather fear him which is able
   to destroy both soul and body in hell." We see from this that Jesus was
   thinking only of cases in which people are exposed either to death at
   the hands of men or to eternal punishment at the hands of God. For
   instance, in the Christian persecutions those who denied their faith
   because they were afraid of the death which threatened them from men if
   they confessed Christ, incurred the punishment of God.

   To whom then can the saying of Jesus apply? Schiele's objection is to
   the idea that Jesus wished the disciples to be protected from the death
   of the body. But, considering the position of the disciples at the
   time, the saying which he has quoted cannot in any way apply to them.
   They are not yet face to face with the question, whether they ought to
   flee from or resign themselves to death at the hands of men. The
   authorities would not feel obliged to lay hands upon them, until Jesus'
   public ministry assumed such a character as to threaten the security of
   the State. The advice to surrender the body rather than escape by
   violating the will of God, was therefore, as far as the disciples were
   concerned, not required by the circumstances of the case; consequently
   there would be no question of Jesus "going against the spirit of his
   own words," if he did not give it.

   Nor can the saying quoted have applied to Jesus himself. If he had
   tried to avoid death by flight or by denying his belief in his
   Messiahship, he would thus have violated the will of God which clearly
   showed him that the moment had come to prove the truth of his cause by
   resigning himself to death. But there would only be a question of
   "going against the spirit of his own words" if, as far as he himself
   was concerned, he disregarded the advice, not if he does not require
   the disciples to follow it, to whom indeed the advice was not
   appropriate.

   But if Schiele's meaning be that Jesus ought to have told the disciples
   simply that he had decided, as far as he himself was concerned, to act
   in the spirit of this saying and resign himself to death, it seems to
   me quite obvious that he did this, and, to strengthen their minds,
   added to this explanation all the consequences which it necessarily
   implied, even if we are not told that he did so, Indeed, it will be
   seen that this is implicit in what our records tell us about Jesus'
   words on this evening.

   Let us therefore leave the words of Jesus which have been quoted, and
   the citation of which does not seem to me to throw any light on the
   question, and turn to Schiele's real objection.

   First, however, I will print in full, with his permission, an
   explanation of the above note, which, at my request, he was kind enough
   to give me. He writes as follows:

   Whatever Jesus may have hoped to achieve by all that he did for his
   disciples, now at any rate they were directly confronted by a very
   serious mental crisis; within a few hours they will all be offended
   with him, they will all be doubtful about him, when they see that he
   will allow him self to be killed. How shall they survive this mental
   crisis? Jesus himself had already overcome the same crisis in his own
   mind, when he submitted to the will of his Father and accepted death as
   an obligation which could not be refused. Legend, making a justifiable
   use of poetry, has represented Jesus as going through this struggle
   quite alone in the hour of agony in Gethsemane--after the Passover meal
   and immediately before the arrest. But who can doubt that Jesus, having
   conquered himself and decided to face death, must already have prayed,
   "not as I will, but as thou wiliest," before he prepared to eat the
   last Passover with his disciples? That very thing which helped Jesus
   himself in his agony, when his soul was troubled to the point of
   despair, his death--submission to the will of God by dying--must in the
   end have helped and saved the disciples also in their soul's
   distraction--his divinely willed and self-willed death.

   For if Jesus does not struggle successfully and resolve to die, he--and
   with him his cause--must be inwardly ruined. That is Jesus' own idea.
   His death means salvation to him, and therefore to his cause
   also--salvation to his disciples.

   As the death of the Passover lamb means salvation to the Israelites in
   a critical hour, so in like manner in another critical hour the death
   of Jesus means salvation to his disciples.

   He who will preserve the life of his body, shall lose it; he who loses
   it, as Jesus now wills to lose it, will save it. By thus deciding in
   favour of death and saving his own soul, Jesus' death is the salvation
   of his cause and of his disciples.

   You will see from what I have said that I intentionally refrain from
   championing any specific interpretation of the death of Jesus, or from
   trying to maintain that it is possible to know in what special sense
   Jesus attached importance to his death as a means of salvation. All
   that I would claim is that, as Jesus thought of himself as the preacher
   and bringer of salvation, he definitely decided to reconcile him self
   to his death as an act of saving power.

   And naturally when we speak of this salvation, we must think of
   salvation of the body as well as of the soul. If not, why should Jesus
   have saved so many sick persons from bodily suffering? But there can be
   no doubt that the significance of the salvation of the body as compared
   with the salvation of the soul is secondary, and that, especially,
   where it is a question of "care," care for the body will bear no
   comparison with the cares that affect the soul: care for its salvation,
   for forgiveness of its sins, for its child-like nature, for its
   blessedness in the kingdom of God. So that in my opinion the meaning
   also of Mt. x. 28a (whether with or without 28b) is simply: he who is a
   disciple of Jesus, should not have any fear for his body. This is
   Schiele's explanation.

   For my own part I can see no need to confine myself to such indefinite
   statements and to base my answer to the question, What had Jesus in
   mind when he celebrated the Supper? upon conjectures concerning such a
   general term as salvation. The words spoken by Jesus have in fact been
   handed down to us, and in a more reliable way than pretty well anything
   else. For when Paul became a Christian a year or a few years after
   Jesus' death, he already found that this ceremony was in existence and
   that the words of Jesus relating to it were continually repeated. And
   although changes, especially additions, forced their way into this
   language, it is still so concise, that what Jesus himself said can
   hardly have been briefer. As regards the meaning of his words, however,
   the sanctity in which they were held protected them against any serious
   alteration.

   Now if Jesus spoke them at a Paschal meal, it would be strange indeed
   if he did not think of his death as being like that of a paschal lamb.
   And Schiele does not dispute this. But according to the Old Testament,
   by which we must certainly be guided here, the dying of the paschal
   lamb does not involve salvation in such a general sense as he states,
   but, as I have explained on p. 248 f., exemption from bodily death. Is
   this idea really so unworthy of the mind of Jesus as Schiele supposes?

   If, by trying to escape from death, Jesus had at the same time brought
   upon his disciples the risk of persecution, his whole cause might
   easily have perished with them; but Jesus was absolutely sure that God
   could not wish this, for he was convinced that this cause of his was
   the cause of God. As soon, therefore, as Jesus saw reason to hope that
   by dying himself he might save his followers from a similar fate--and
   the whole situation justified this hope--he must have felt that it was
   God's will also that he should do this. But if it was God's will, it
   was something sacred to him, and he could not by any means regard it as
   a matter of such slight importance as Schiele supposes--even if nothing
   more profound, nothing of an essentially religious nature, was
   included.

   Jesus' first task must have been to keep the disciples from that
   despair which they would be only too likely to fall into as soon as he
   was removed; this purpose was a great one, and was in accordance with
   the divine plan as he understood it, even if no word of Jesus is given
   us about the way in which it was to be carried out, apart from the
   assurance that Jesus' death would preserve the bodily life of the
   disciples. But is something more profound, something of an essentially
   religious nature, really lacking? I have not thought it necessary to
   say in so many words that when Jesus wished to preserve his disciples
   from death, he did not do so in the sense that they did not need after
   his death to remain faithful to his cause. He must therefore earnestly
   have admonished them to continue faithful and to realise the magnitude
   of the task that confronted them in the future. It is self-evident that
   Jesus cannot have spoken only the two lines which have been preserved
   to us. But even if we were to suppose that he did not add a single
   word, must not Jesus mere announcement that he wished by going to his
   death to preserve their lives, if apart from this they really loved
   him, have served to ripen the idea which Paul expressed concisely (2
   Cor. v. 15) at a later date, when he said that those who live no longer
   live for themselves, but for him who died for their sake?

   Thus I cannot really think that my meaning is correctly represented by
   the words, "Jesus thought only of the bodily welfare of his followers,
   in his kindly anxiety he thought only of the safety of their bodies."
   Salvation of the body (or rather, preservation of bodily life) and
   salvation of the soul are, I think, in the present case inseparably
   united.

   Moreover, Schiele could not have written the twofold "only," if he had
   also given due consideration to the words which immediately follow the
   passage to which he has added his note. One who thinks that the idea of
   a sacrifice like that of the paschal lamb is not deep enough for Jesus,
   might very well, I think, discover the profundity, which he misses
   here, in the idea which I have there tried to find in the words of
   Jesus as preserved to us, namely, that his death was the sacrifice
   offered at the making of a covenant by which the disciples were to be
   united to God more closely than ever before.

   I think therefore that my explanation, which closely follows the
   records, is, as regards the religious value of the character of Jesus,
   by no means inferior to that of Schiele, and, moreover, that it is
   really not so very different from his.

   In particular, I agree with him when he says that care for the soul
   must always take precedence of care for the body. Only, care for the
   preservation of the disciples lives was of the utmost importance,
   since, without it, there was danger that, when his followers were
   extirpated, his cause would perish with them.

   And as for the forgiveness of the sins of the disciples, which Schiele
   includes amongst the absolutely important objects of care, in my
   opinion Jesus cannot in any case have thought his death necessary for
   this, for he had previously on many occasions assumed, and even
   declared, that God would forgive sins without this (p. 247).

   Nor would I venture to declare that the account according to which
   Jesus' prayer that he might be saved from death, and his resignation to
   the will of God which followed subsequently, first took place in
   Gethsemane and so after the celebration of the Supper, is a legend.
   True, even at the Supper, Jesus looked upon his death as the will of
   God, but only in the event of the authorities laying hands on him. If
   they omitted to do this, he on his part would not only have had no
   reason to bring it about, but would even have been obliged to think
   that his death was contrary to the will of God. For, according to all
   the assumptions that were made with regard to the Messiah, it was the
   will of God that he should establish the divine rule triumphantly upon
   earth, and not at the price of suffering and death. Thus even while
   Jesus was in Gethsemane he may at first have been filled with the
   desire to be preserved from death, and there is no need to think that
   this involved the danger that his cause would be inwardly ruined. It is
   enough that Jesus succeeded in gaining such self-control that, when the
   authorities really interfered, he submitted with resignation.

   Once more then I have no reason to dissent from the Gospels here and to
   reverse the order of the two events, the Supper and the prayer of
   Jesus. The fact as to when and where they heard Jesus utter that prayer
   must have stamped itself indelibly on the memory of the disciples. If,
   however, as Schiele assumes at the end of p. 263, after the Supper
   Jesus again uttered that earnest petition, that the cup of death might
   pass from him, when he had before this meal already won his victory
   over the fear of death and prayed "not as I will, but as thou wiliest,"
   his figure hardly gains that completeness which is meant to be gained
   for it by the whole of this assumption.

   Moreover, a legend which arose in the first instance amongst
   worshippers of Jesus would never have assigned this wavering attitude
   of Jesus in his prayer to so late an hour as that of Gethsemane, since
   it might so easily cast a shadow upon him. In this matter the feeling
   of the Fourth Evangelist was correct; see above, p. 27.

   SCHMIEDEL.
     __________________________________________________________________

NOTE TO PAGE 250.

   THE following are the explanations that are given in the New Testament
   of the death of Jesus. We have grouped them according to their
   similarity or dissimilarity, not according to the persons who have put
   them forward.

   1. Since, as we have shown above (p. 247), until quite a short time
   before his death, Jesus did not regard it as an eventuality ordained by
   God for the salvation of mankind, and since he was obliged to think
   that, being the Messiah, he was destined triumphantly to establish the
   kingdom of God, (a) in view of the Baptist's end and of the
   machinations of his own enemies (Lk. xiii. 31-33; Mk. xii. 6-8), he can
   at most have believed that possibly, but by no means necessarily, God
   would assign him the cup of death as the decisive stroke. (b) The idea
   which approaches this most nearly is that found in the speeches of
   Peter in Acts (iii. 13-15, 17; v. 30) according to which the execution
   of Jesus was a sin on the part of the Jews, though an unwitting one.
   (c) Chapter iii. 18 implies only a slight advance upon this: Jesus'
   death was ordained by God in fulfilment of the predictions of the
   prophets. This does not by any means include the idea that its purpose
   was the salvation of mankind; in that case, the expression could not
   have been directly preceded by iii. 13-17.

   2. Jesus' death implied a purpose as regards his own person, (a) Heb.
   v. 7 f., he is to learn obedience by his suffering; (b) Jn. xii. 23 f.
   5 xvii. 1, 5, he had to return to heaven, whence he had come down; (c)
   xvii. 19 a, he had to sanctify, that is to say consecrate, himself for
   this return by means of death.

   3. Jesus by his death fulfilled a purpose with reference to the final
   condition of the world, (a) Jn. xiv. 2 f., xii. 32, xvii. 24, he had to
   prepare for his friends a place for their future abode in heaven; (b)
   Heb. ix. 21-24, x. 19 f., he had to consecrate, by the sprinkling of
   his blood, that sanctuary which, on the analogy of the earthly temple,
   the author conceives as existing in heaven. Here for the first time in
   our list of interpretations we come upon the idea that Jesus' death was
   an offering, and, in this instance, an offering of initiation.

   4. From another point of view his death is regarded as a sacrifice of
   exemption from an unmerited misfortune. (a) Thus Jesus himself
   explained his death at the celebration of the Supper, by representing
   it as a paschal offering (see above, p. 248). On this perhaps rests
   also the idea that the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep
   (Jn. x. 11, 15), as well as that reflection of Caiaphas (xi. 50) which
   is intended to represent a truth not only from his own point of view
   but also from a higher standpoint: it is better that one man should die
   for the people, and that the whole people should not perish. Moreover,
   it must be remembered here that Jn. describes Jesus' death in such a
   way as to make all the details agree exactly with the commands about
   the paschal lamb, his manifest purpose being to suggest that Jesus was
   the true passover lamb, by whose death these commands were once and for
   all fulfilled and abrogated (see pp. 126-130). (b) In Col. i. 24, Paul
   is represented as one who continues the work of Jesus Passion, since as
   the vicar of Jesus he fills up the gaps left in Jesus' sufferings. That
   is to say, by giving up his life, Jesus was able to concentrate the
   fury of his living enemies upon himself, and could thus divert it from
   his followers, but he could not at the same time ward off the fury of
   all their future enemies. To divert this, others had to sacrifice
   themselves later, and Paul is felt by the author to be the only such
   offering that needs to be taken account of, the Apostle being an object
   of veneration to him. (Paul himself cannot have written this; he would
   never have admitted that Jesus left gaps in his sufferings, and that he
   himself was so far on a level with Jesus as to be able to fill them.)

   5. Again, it has been interpreted as a covenant sacrifice. (a) In this
   way also Jesus explained his death at the celebration of the Supper
   (see above, p. 248 f.). (b) The Epistle to the Hebrews (ix. 15-20; x.
   29) makes a markedly different use of this idea, since it has in mind,
   not, as Jesus had, the general nature of a covenant, but in quite a
   special sense the Old Testament ordinances regarding the ceremonial
   observed when God solemnised his covenant with the people of Israel on
   Sinai.

   6. Before we consider the idea of atonement in its most prominent
   application, as a reconciliation with God, we must view it (a) in a
   quite different aspect, that is to say as a reconciliation between the
   Jews and the Gentiles by the admission of both into the Christian body.
   To effect this was the purpose of Jesus' death according to Eph. ii.
   13-16; it was therefore a peace-offering, (b) Similarly it is said in
   Jn. xi. 52, in extension of the idea of Caiaphas referred to above (4
   a), that Jesus' death must have been not merely for the Jewish people,
   but also for the bringing together and uniting of the dispersed
   children of God. Here, however, the special point is not the removal of
   the conflict between Jews and Gentiles, but, more generally, the
   founding of the Church as one which was to embrace the whole world.
   Perhaps we may include here also what in Jn. xvii. 19b is added as
   another purpose in addition to that of consecrating himself by his
   death for entrance into heaven: his disciples are by this means
   initiated in the truth. At least, the continuation, xvii. 20-23, in
   which Jesus prays that his disciples may all be united in communion
   with God and with himself points to this explanation of the obscure
   words.

   7. In Eph. v. 25 f., the death of Christ is represented as a means of
   sanctification or consecration of the Church, and this consecration is
   imparted to its members by baptism. Baptism, however, is regarded as a
   bath which effects purification from sin. Here, then, for the first
   time in our list of explanations we meet with the idea that the death
   of Jesus meant the removal of sin; but the Old Testament pattern
   presupposed is always a kind of offering which (as above, 2 c) produced
   sanctification, that is to say, consecration, and so such a condition
   of purity as is necessary if people are to regard themselves as
   consecrated to God.

   8. The stricter idea of a sin-offering, without which forgiveness of
   sins is not possible, is applied to Jesus' death, (a) without any
   qualification as regards the predecessors of Paul, 1 Cor. xv. 3, in
   Jesus' words at the Supper, but only in Mt.'s version (xxvi. 28), so
   that the words were certainly not spoken by Jesus himself (see above,
   p. 247 f.), and then in Eph. i. 7, Jn. i. 29, 36, for example, (b) With
   clear reference to the sacrificial ordinances of the Old Testament, in
   the Epistle to the Hebrews Jesus is designated a sin-offering (v. 1, 3;
   vii. 27; ix. 26, 28). Here it is to be noted that in such an offering
   the sacrificial beast does not bear the punishment which is strictly
   deserved by the person who offers it. On the contrary, on the great Day
   of Atonement, for instance, the ceremonial of which the author has
   chiefly in view, the sins of the people are transferred by the
   laying-on of hands, not to the goat which is sacrificed, but to the
   other which is driven into the wilderness (Lev. xvi.). (c) Paul assumes
   the contrary, and so the strictest form of the idea of sin-offering
   (see above, p. 249), especially in Rom. iii. 25 f.: hitherto God has
   not forgiven sins, but neither has he punished them, that is to say not
   in such a way as would have been commensurate with the sin, to wit, by
   the death of sinners, that is to say of all men. In order now to show
   that his justice, which requires some kind of equivalent, whether it be
   punishment or propitiation, is nevertheless operative, he brings about
   not indeed the punishment on sinners, but the reconciliation in Christ,
   by imposing upon him, as the representative of men, the penalty of
   death which they themselves had really deserved, (d) Quite peculiar is
   the teaching of the Epistle to the Colossians (i. 20), to the effect
   that the reconciliation thus produced extends to the heavenly powers,
   that is to say, to the angels (this also, no less than the passage
   mentioned under 4 b cannot have been written by Paul; on the contrary,
   according to 1 Cor. xv. 24-26, Christ is still obliged to contend with
   these angels throughout a long period of his exaltation in heaven).

   9. The blood of Christ shed at his death is compared, not with an
   offering, but with a ransom to be paid (a) when Paul says that men have
   been redeemed by it (1 Cor. vi. 20; vii. 23; Rom. iii. 24), and to wit
   from the curse of the Law (Gal. iii. 18). As the person to whom the
   ransom must here be paid, it is not so much God who is thought of as
   the Law of the Old Testament, which, according to Gal. iii. 19, was
   really imparted not by God himself but by subordinate angels, and so
   does not give pure expression to the will of God. Paul seems to think
   of it as a kind of independent being which on its own authority
   pronounces the curse upon sinners and does not acquit them without
   payment of a ransom. Now a ransom cannot strictly bear punishment; but
   that even on this view of the matter Christ does this in Paul's
   opinion, as the representative of mankind, is clear from Gal. iii. 13:
   "Christ redeemed us thus from the curse of the Law, having become a
   curse for us," that is to say an object for the curse, (b) In place of
   the half-personified Law appears in Heb. ii. 14 f. the wholly
   personified devil who has the power of torturing men for their sins
   while they are dying, and before this of keeping them in continual fear
   of death.

   10. The attainment of everlasting happiness means, however, not merely
   forgiveness of past sins, but, quite as much, the averting of future
   sins; and this again (a) Paul ascribes to Christ's death in which he
   finds all the salvation that has ever been brought to mankind. The
   reason for the experience that again and again without fail man is led
   to commit sin, he finds in the fact that his body consists of flesh
   (Rom. vii. 14-25), that is to say, of that same matter which, according
   to Greek philosophy, is evil by nature (p. 149). Since he regards
   Christ as the pattern upon which all men have been modelled (1 Cor. xi.
   3), he believes further that everything which has happened to him is
   entirely reproduced of itself in men as well, at least in so far as
   they attach themselves to him (1 Cor. xv. 21 f., 48 f., Rom. vi. 3-11).
   And thus in Rom. viii. 3 f., he next reaches the idea, which to us is
   quite unacceptable, but with him was quite a serious conviction, that
   by the slaying of Christ's flesh on the cross, the flesh in his
   followers was slain likewise, not in the sense that they suffered
   bodily death, but that the impulse in them was dead which again and
   again drove them to sin. (b) The First Epistle of Peter gathers up this
   idea in a far more simple and appropriate way (iv. 1; i. 18; ii. 24):
   by fixing one's attention on the death of Jesus, one is brought to arm
   oneself with the same frame of mind as his, and to shrink from sin. As
   a result, but not as a real explanation of the death of Christ, this
   already occurred to Paul also (2 Cor. v. 14 f.). (c) But this frame of
   mind is represented in the New Testament, not as something which people
   can produce in themselves of their own accord, but as a being possessed
   by a new, independent being, the Holy Spirit in the hearts of
   believers. And so in Jn. (xv. 26; xvi. 7) the idea is put in the form
   that Christ died on purpose that the Holy Spirit might be able to come
   down from heaven and take up His abode in believers. Chap. vii. 39
   shows that in Jesus' life-time this was regarded as impossible (see
   above, p. 253 f.).

   We have omitted many passages, for instance even passages from the
   First Epistle of Jn., which reveal nothing specially characteristic, as
   well as those the explanation of which is not certain. Thus, for
   example, the description of Christ as the true witness (Rev. i. 5; iii.
   14) might mean that he gave his life as security for his conviction,
   and this would be one of the most appropriate interpretations of his
   death; but it might also contain a thought which had no reference at
   all to his death (see above, p. 229). On Mk. x. 45, another passage
   which admits of several interpretations, see above, p. 249.

   In spite, however, of the limited number of passages which we have
   dealt with, we can observe how many explanations of the death of Christ
   are often found side by side in one and the same New Testament book.
   Thus the Epistle to the Hebrews contains four such, the Fourth Gospel
   some seven or eight. We can also easily perceive that several of them,
   but by no means all, can be reconciled with one another. Finally, it
   must not be forgotten also that the New Testament contains a book which
   gives a rather detailed exposition of the author's conception of
   Christianity, and yet does not mention Jesus' death, and indeed hardly
   mentions his person--we mean, the Epistle of James.
