                               The Song of Angels

  BY WALTER HILTON


   Dear brother in Christ, I understand by your own speech, and also by
   the word of another man, that you yearn and long to have more knowledge
   and understanding than you have of angel's song and heavenly
   sound--what it is, how it is perceived and felt in the soul, how to be
   sure that it is true and not feigned, and how it is made by the
   presence of the good angel and not by the inputting of the evil angel.
   These things you desire to learn from me, but, truthfully, I cannot
   tell you with certainty the truth of this matter; nevertheless I will
   show you something of my opinion in a short word.

        Note well that the end and pinnacle of perfection is true union of
   God and the soul by perfect love. This union is truly made when the
   powers of the soul are reformed by grace to the dignity and the state
   of the first condition--that is, when the mind is firmly established,
   without changing and wandering, in God and spiritual things, and when
   the reason is cleared from all attention to worldly and fleshly things,
   and from all bodily images, figures, and fantasies of created things,
   and is illumined by grace to see God and spiritual things, and when the
   will and the affection are purified and cleansed from all fleshly,
   natural, and worldly love and inflamed with burning love of the Holy
   Spirit. This wonderful union may not be fulfilled perfectly,
   continuously, and wholly in this life, because of the corruption of the
   flesh, but only in the bliss of heaven. Nevertheless, the nearer that a
   soul in this present life may come to this union, the more perfect it
   is. For the more that it is reformed by grace to the image and the
   likeness of its Creator here, in this way, the more joy and bliss shall
   it have in heaven.

        Our Lord God is an endless being without changing, almighty
   without failing, supreme wisdom, light, truth without error or
   darkness, supreme goodness, love, peace, and sweetness. Therefore the
   more that a soul is united, fastened, conformed, and joined to our
   Lord, the more stable and strong it is, the more wise and clear, good
   and peaceable, loving and virtuous it is, and so it is more perfect.
   For a soul that has by the grace of Jesus and long, hard work of bodily
   and spiritual exercise, overcome and destroyed lusts, passions, and
   unreasonable impulses within itself, and without in the sensuality, and
   is clothed all in virtues, as in meekness and mildness, in patience and
   softness, in spiritual strength and righteousness, in continence, in
   wisdom, in truth, hope and charity--then it is made as perfect as it
   may be in this life. Much comfort it receives from our Lord, not only
   inwardly, in its own secret nature, by virtue of the union to our Lord
   that lies in knowing and loving God, in illumination and spiritual
   burning from Him, in transforming of the soul into the Godhead; but
   also many other comforts, savors, sweetnesses, and wonderful feelings
   in various manners, because our Lord graciously visits His creatures
   here on earth, and because the soul profits and grows in charity.

        Some souls, by virtue of the love that God gives them, are so
   cleansed that all creatures and everything they hear, or see, or feel
   by any of the senses, turns them to comfort and gladness; and the
   sensuality receives new savor and sweetness in all creatures. And just
   as previously the sensual appetites were carnal, vain, and corrupt,
   because of the pain of original sin, so now they are made spiritual and
   clean, without bitterness and biting of conscience. And this is the
   goodness of our Lord, that since the soul is punished in the
   sensuality, and the flesh shares the pain, that afterward the soul be
   comforted in the sensuality, and the flesh join in joy and comfort with
   the soul, not carnal, but spiritual, as it was a fellow in tribulation
   and pain.

        This is the freedom and the lordship, the dignity, and the worth
   that a man has over all creatures, which dignity he may so recover by
   grace here, that every creature appear to him as it is. And that occurs
   when by grace he sees, he hears, he feels only God in all creatures. In
   this way a soul is made spiritual in the sensuality by abundance of
   love, that is, in the nature of the soul.

        Also, our Lord comforts a soul by angel's song. This song cannot
   be described by any bodily likeness, for it is spiritual, and above all
   imagination and reason. It may be felt and perceived in a soul, but it
   may not be showed. Nevertheless, I will speak of it to you as I think.

        When a soul is purified by the love of God, illumined by wisdom,
   and stabilized by the might of God, then the eye of the soul is opened
   to see spiritual things, as virtues and angels and holy souls, and
   heavenly things. Then, because it is clean, the soul is able to feel
   the touching, the speaking of good angels. This touching and speaking
   is spiritual and not bodily. For when the soul is lifted and ravished
   out of the sensuality, and out of mind of any earthly things, then in
   great fervour of love and light (if our Lord deigns) the soul may hear
   and feel heavenly sound, made by the presence of angels in loving God.

        Not that this song of angels is the supreme joy of the soul; but
   because of the difference between a person's soul in flesh and an
   angel, due to uncleanness, a soul may not hear it except by ravishing
   in love, and it must be much purified and well cleaned, and filled with
   much love, before it will be able to hear heavenly sound. For the
   supreme and essential joy is in the love of God by Himself and for
   Himself, and the secondary is in communing with and beholding angels
   and spiritual creatures. For just as a soul, in understanding spiritual
   things, is often touched and moved through bodily imagination by the
   work of angels, as when Ezekiel the prophet saw in bodily imagination
   the truth of God's hidden mysteries, just so, in the love of God, a
   soul by the presence of angels is ravished out of mind of all earthly
   and fleshly things and filled with a heavenly joy, to hear angel's song
   and heavenly sound, according to the measure of its love.

        I think that no soul may truly feel the angel's song or heavenly
   sound, unless it is in perfect love, though not all that are in perfect
   love have felt it, but only the soul that is so purified in the fire of
   love that all earthly savor is burned out of it, and all obstacles
   between the soul and the cleanness of angels are broken and put away
   from it. Then truly may he sing a new song, and truly may he hear a
   blessed heavenly sound, and angel's song, without deceit or feigning.
   Our Lord knows the soul that, for abundance of burning love, is worthy
   to hear angel's song.

        Whoever would hear angel's song, and not be deceived by feigning
   of himself, or by imagination, or by the illusion of the enemy, should
   have perfect love. That is when all vain love and fear, vain joy and
   sorrow, are cast out of the heart, so that it loves nothing but God,
   nor fears anything but God, nor joys, nor sorrows in anything but God,
   or for God. Whoever by the grace of God goes this way will not err.

        Nevertheless, some are deceived by their own imagination or by the
   illusion of the enemy in this matter. Such a person, who may have
   worked long and hard, bodily and spiritually, in the destroying of sins
   and gaining of virtues, and perhaps received by grace a little rest,
   and a clarity in conscience, may soon leave prayers, readings of holy
   scriptures, meditations on the passion of Christ, and thoughts of his
   wretchedness. Before he is called by God, he tries, by his own skill
   and by violence, to seek and to see heavenly things, before his eyes
   are made spiritual by grace. He overcomes his reason by imagination,
   and by indiscreet effort turns the brains in his head, and overworks
   the powers and the wits of the soul and of the body. And then, because
   of weakness of the brain, he thinks that he hears wonderful sounds and
   songs. But it is nothing but a fantasy, caused by troubling of the
   brain, as a person in a frenzy thinks that he hears and sees what no
   one else does. It is all vanity and a fantasy of the head, or else it
   is by the work of the wicked enemy that feigns such sounds in his
   hearing.

        For if a person has any presumption in his fantasies and in his
   workings, and falls by them into indiscreet imagination, as in a
   frenzy, and is not ordered or ruled by grace, or comforted by spiritual
   strength, the devil enters in, and by his false illuminations, and by
   his false sounds, and by his false sweetnesses, he deceives that soul.
   And of this false ground spring errors, heresies, false prophecies,
   presumptions, false reasonings, blasphemings, slanderings, and much
   other mischief. And, therefore, if you see any spiritually-occupied
   person fall in any of these sins or deceits, or into frenzies, know
   well that he never heard or felt angel's song or heavenly sound. For,
   he who truly hears angel's song is made so wise that he will never err
   by fantasy, or by indiscretion, or by deceptive working of the devil.

        Also, some people feel in their hearts what seem to be spiritual
   sounds and sweet songs in various manners, and this is often good, but
   sometimes it may turn to deceit. This sound is felt in this way. A
   person sets the thought of his heart only in the name of Jesus, and
   firmly holds it there, and in a short time he thinks that that name
   brings him great comfort and sweetness, and he thinks that the name
   sounds delectably in his heart, like a song; and this pleasure is so
   strong that it draws all the powers of the soul to it. Whoever feels
   this sound and this sweetness truly in his heart, knows that it is of
   God, and, as long as he is humble, he shall not be deceived.

        But this is not angel's song; it is a song of the soul by virtue
   of the name and by a touching of the good angel. For when a soul offers
   himself to Jesus truly and humbly, putting all his trust and his desire
   in Him, and busily keeping Him in mind, our Lord Jesus, when He will,
   purges the affection of the soul, and fills it and feeds it with
   sweetness of Himself, and makes His name feel in the soul as honey, and
   as song, and as anything that is delectable; so that the soul evermore
   wants to cry Jesus, Jesus. And he has comfort not only in this, but
   also in psalms and hymns, and anthems of holy Church; the heart sings
   them sweetly, devoutly, and freely, without any effort of the soul or
   bitterness, in the music that the holy Church uses.

        This is good, and a gift of God, for the substance of this feeling
   lies in the love of Jesus, which is fed and illuminated by such songs.
   Nevertheless, in this manner of feeling, a soul may be deceived by
   pride--not while the affection sings to Jesus, and loves Jesus in
   sweetness of Him, but afterward, when it ceases and the heart cools
   down from the love of Jesus. Then pride may enter in.

        Also, a man may be deceived in this way: he hears it said that it
   is good to have Jesus in his mind, or any other good word of God, so he
   strains his heart mightily to that name, and by habit he has it nearly
   always in his mind. Nevertheless, he does not feel by it sweetness in
   his affection or light of knowing in his reason, but only an abstract
   thought of God, or of Jesus, or of Mary, or of any other good word.
   Here may be deceit, not that it is evil to have Jesus in mind in this
   way, but if he holds this feeling and this thought (which is only by
   his own effort and habit) to be a special visitation of our Lord, he
   thinks it more than it is.

        For note well that an abstract thought or imagination of Jesus, or
   of any spiritual thing, without sweetness of love in the affection, and
   without light of knowing in reason, is but a blindness, and a way to
   deceit, if a man hold it to be more than it is. Therefore I think it
   safer that he be humble in his own feeling, and not esteem this thought
   at all, till he may, by habit and use of this thought, feel the fire of
   love in his affection, and the light of knowing in his reason.

        Now, I have told you in this matter a little of what I think, not
   affirming that this suffices, or that this is the truth of the matter.
   But if you think otherwise, or if anyone else savor by grace the
   contrary, I defer to him; it suffices for me to live in truth
   principally, and not in feeling.
