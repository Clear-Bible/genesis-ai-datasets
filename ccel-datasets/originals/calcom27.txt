   Translator's Preface

   This volume contains the Writings of three Prophets. Joel exercised his
   office among the Jews; Amos, though a native of Judea, was yet
   appointed a Prophet of The Ten Tribes; and Obadiah's prophecy refers
   only to Edom.

   The great master of Hebrew criticism, Bishop Lowth, speaking, in his
   twenty-first Prelection, of Joel, says, that though he differs much in
   style from Hosea, he is yet "equally poetical." He represents him as
   "elegant, clear, diffuse, and flowing, and also very sublime, severe,
   and fervid." Admitting the perspicuity of his diction, and the
   clearness of his arrangements, he yet confesses that the matter which
   he handles is sometimes obscure, especially towards the end of his
   Prophecy.

   With regard to the style of Amos, the Bishop differs widely from
   Jerome, who has characterized the Prophet as "unskillful in speech, but
   not in knowledge," (imperitum sermone, set non in scientia.) Lowth, on
   the contrary, regarded him as "not a whit behind the very chiefest
   Prophets, being in elevation of sentiment and nobleness of mind almost
   equal to the very firsts and hardly inferior to any of them in splendor
   of diction and elegance of composition." [1]

   Of Obadiah, nothing more is said by the Bishop than that he left but a
   small monument of his genius, and that a considerable portion of that
   is contained in the prophecy of Jeremiah. Of his composition Dr.
   Henderson says, "Its principal features are animation, regularity, and
   perspicuity."

   There is especially one subject in connection with the present Volume,
   which seems to require particular notice -- The interpretation of those
   prophecies which speak of the future restoration of the Jews to their
   own land. Calvin viewed some passages, as having been already
   accomplished in their return from Babylon, which in the estimation of
   others are yet to be fulfilled; while he interpreted those which
   evidently refer to what is future, in such a way as clearly shows that
   he did not consider that the Jews are to be restored again to their own
   country. That justice may be done to him, we must know and bear in mind
   the principles by which he was guided: for it is not to be supposed,
   that one so versed in Scripture, who had studied it with so much labor,
   and manifested, as it is commonly admitted, so much penetration and
   discernment as an expounder, would have taken such a view of this
   subject on slight grounds, without adopting a rule of interpretation,
   which, according to what he thought, was countenanced by Scriptural
   examples.

   It must first be observed, that Calvin, in common with others, regarded
   the history as well erg the institutions of the people of Israel, as in
   great measure typical of things under the Gospel. Their temporal evils
   and blessings, their temporal oppressions and deliverances, were
   intended to set forth the spiritual state and condition of the
   Christian Church. The free choice of the people by God, their Egyptian
   bondage, their passage through the wilderness and their possession of
   the land of Canaan, were events symbolical of things connected with
   that spiritual community afterwards formed by the preaching of the
   Gospel; and of the same character was the subsequent captivity of that
   people in Babylon, and their restoration afterwards to their own land.

   The next thing to be noticed is, that Promises of Blessings made to the
   people of Israel had in some instances a twofold meaning, and had
   reference to two things -- the one temporal and the other spiritual.
   The restoration, for instance, from Babylon, was a prelude of the
   restoration or redemption by Christ. It was not only typical, but a
   kind of an initiative process, which was to be completed, though in a
   sublimer sense, by the Savior of man. The first was a restoration from
   temporal evils; the second was still a restoration, but from evils of a
   spiritual kind. The performance of the promise, in one case, was the
   commencement of a restorative work, which was to be completed in the
   other: the temporal restoration was eventually succeeded by that which
   is spiritual.

   But the most material point in interpreting the Prophecies is The
   Language which is Used: rightly to understand this language forms the
   main difficulty. There are Promises which, as admitted by Calvin, look
   beyond the restoration from Babylon; and they are couched in terms,
   which, if taken literally, most evidently show that there is to be a
   second restoration. What is there, it may be asked, which can justify a
   departure from the letter of the promises? This is the chief question,
   on which the whole matter depends. Calvin evidently thought that the
   literal sense cannot be taken, as that would be inconsistent with the
   general character of the ancient prophecies; for he considered that
   many of the prophecies, which relate to the Church of the New
   Testament, were conveyed in a language suitable to the institutions
   then existing, and in consistency with the notions which then
   prevailed, as to religion and divine worship. Hence the Temple, Mount
   Sion, sacrifices, offerings, the priests, as well as the restoration of
   the people to their own land, and their perpetual establishment in it,
   are often spoken of in those very promises which incontestably refer to
   the Gospel dispensation. Now, if in some cases, as confessed by most,
   if not by all, the language is not to be taken literally, but as
   representing the success, the extension and the blessings of the
   Gospel, why should it be taken literally in other similar cases? The
   possession of the land of Canaan was to the people of Israel one of
   their chief blessings, and was a signal token of the divine favor.
   Banishment from it was not only a temporal loss, but involved also the
   loss of all their religious privileges. Nothing, therefore, could have
   conveyed to their minds a higher idea of redemption than the promise of
   restoration to their own land, and a perpetual possession of it.

   The foregoing seem to have been the views by which Calvin was guided in
   his interpretation: and the Editor must be allowed to express his
   concurrence, though he is fully aware, that there have been, and that
   there are still, many celebrated men of a contrary opinion.

   There is another idea which Calvin suggests, in connection with this
   subject. He regarded The Promises made in some instances by the
   Prophets as to the future prosperity of the people of Israel, and the
   perpetuity of their institutions and privileges, as Conditional, even
   when no condition is expressed. Instances of the same kind are to be
   found in the writings of Moses and of the earlier Prophets. Promises of
   perpetuity are made, (as for instance, respecting the priesthood,) and
   often unaccompanied by any conditions; and yet they were conditional,
   as the event proved, and in accordance with the tenor of the covenant
   under which the Israelites lived. The same view may also be taken of
   such promises as are found in the later Prophets, that is, such as bear
   on them a national stamp: they were announced unconditionally; but as
   they included blessings which belonged to the people as subjects of the
   Mosaic covenant, they were necessarily conditional, dependent as to
   their accomplishment on their obedience. Hence Jeremiah, who had
   himself announced promises of this kind, says, that the time would come
   when God would establish another covenant; and for this reason, because
   the people of Israel had broken the former covenant.

   The Editor feels it to be his duty to say generally of Calvin's
   Expositions that the more maturely he considers them, after having
   compared them with those of others, both modern and ancient, the more
   satisfied he is with them, and the more he admires the acuteness and
   solid judgment they display. Perhaps no individual, possessing his high
   qualifications, natural, acquired, and spiritual, has ever, either in
   ancient or modern times, exercised himself so much in the study of the
   Holy Scriptures, and produced Comments so original and so valuable.

   What is remarkable in Calvin as an Expositor is his unvarying attention
   to the context. This was his polar star, which enabled him to steer
   clear and safe through many intricacies and ambiguities no to the
   meaning of particular words, and even of sentences. His first object
   seems to have been to ascertain the general drift of a passage or of a
   chapter; and his next, to harmonize its several parts. There are many
   words which have various meanings, and the surest way of ascertaining
   their meaning in any given sentence, is to inquire what comports with
   the context. There is indeed no other way by which we can make a
   choice, when a word admits of different senses. Probably no Commentator
   has ever paid so much attention to this canon of interpretation as
   Calvin did. The ground on which he almost at all times rejects a sense
   given by others to words or to sentences is, that it does not suit the
   place, or, to adopt an expression he frequently uses, that it does not
   square (non quadrat) with the passage.

   It has been often thought that more difficulty attends the Hebrew
   language than other languages, owing to the variety of meaning which
   belongs to some of its words. But this variety exists quite as much,
   and indeed much more, in many other languages, and even in our own.
   What enables us in numberless instances to ascertain the meaning of a
   word, and even often of a sentence, is what stands connected with it,
   that is, the context. It is what goes before and comes after, not only
   in a sentence, but often in a long passage, that explains the precise
   meaning of many words. To transfer the meaning of a word from one
   passage to another, and to say that because it has a certain meaning in
   one place, it must have the same in another, (except the word has but
   one meaning,) is certainly not the way to explain Scripture or any
   other writing. The best expositor in this respect is no doubt the
   context.

   It is well known that these Lectures were delivered extempore, and were
   taken down by some of those who heard them; and we have them now as
   thus taken down, and afterwards corrected by Calvin. This circumstance
   accounts for the occasional defect of order and for occasional
   repetitions. But these drawbacks seem to have been more than
   compensated by the freshness and vigor, the life and animation which
   these spontaneous effusion of his mind exhibit. In none of his other
   writings, as it appears to the Editor, has Calvin shone forth with so
   much lustre as an able, clear, plain, and animated an Expounder, as in
   these Lectures. There is a flow and energy to be found in them not
   equaled in those productions which he composed in private, and finished
   with more careful attention to order and style. When the mind is well
   stored and the memory retentive, as was the case in no ordinary degree
   with Calvin, a public auditory has usually the effect of calling into
   action all the powers of the mind; and, as frequently in the present
   instance, the consequence is, that the finest and the most striking
   thoughts are elicited, and are expressed in a language the most
   energetic, calculated to produce the deepest impressions.

   Calvin's Preface to Joel

   I proceed now to explain The Prophet Joel. The time in which he
   prophesied is uncertain. Some of the Jews imagine that he exercised his
   office in the time of Joram, king of Israel, because a dreadful famine
   then prevailed through the whole land, as it appears evident from
   sacred history; and as the Prophet record a famine, they suppose that
   his ministry must be referred to that time. Some think, that he taught
   under Manasseh, but they bring no reason for this opinion; it is,
   therefore, a mere conjecture. Others think that he performed his office
   as a teacher not only under one king, but that he taught, at the same
   time with Isaiah, under several kings.

   But as there is no certainty, it is better to leave the time in which
   he taught undecided; and, as we shall see, this is of no great
   importance. Not to know the time of Hosea would be to readers a great
   loss for there are many parts which could not be explained without a
   knowledge of history; but as to Joel there is, as I have said, less
   need of this; for the import of his doctrine is evident, though his
   time be obscure and uncertain. But we may conclude that he taught at
   Jerusalem, or at least in the kingdom of Judah. As Hosea was appointed
   a Prophet to the kingdom of Israel, so Joel had another appointment;
   for he was to labor especially among the Jews and not among the Ten
   Tribes: this deserves to be particularly noticed.

   Now the sum of the Book is this: At the beginning, he reproves the
   stupidity of the people, who, when severely smitten by God, did not
   feel their evils, but on the contrary grew hardened under them: this is
   one thing. Then he threatens far more grievous evils; as the people
   became so insensible under all their punishments, that they were not
   humbled, the Prophet declares that there were evils at hand much worse
   than those they had hitherto experienced: this is the second thing.
   Thirdly, he exhorts the people to repentance, and shows that there was
   required no common evidence of repentance; for they had not lightly
   offended God, but by their perverseness provoked him to bring on them
   utter ruin: since, then, their obstinacy had been so great, he bids
   them to come as suppliants with tears, with sackcloth, with mourning,
   with ashes, that they might obtain mercy; for they were unworthy of
   being regarded by the Lord, except they thus submissively humbled
   themselves: this is the third subject. The fourth part of the Book is
   taken up with promises; for he prophesies of the Kingdom of Christ, and
   shows, that though now all things seemed full of despair, yet God had
   not forgotten the covenant he made with the fathers; and that therefore
   Christ would come to gather the scattered remnants, yea, and to restore
   to life his people, though they were now lost and dead.

   This is the sum and substance. But we shall see, as we proceed, that
   the chapters have been absurdly and foolishly divided. He thus begins
   --

   Joel 1:1-4

   1. The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

   1. Verbum Jehovae quod fuit ad Joel, filium Pethuel.

   2. Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
   Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

   2. Audite hoc senes, et auscultate omnes incolae terrae, an fuerit hoc
   diebus vestris, et si diebus patrum vestrorum.

   3. Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
   children, and their children another generation.

   3. Super hoc filiis vestris narrate, et filii vestri filiis suis, et
   filii ipsorum generationi posterae.

   4. That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that
   which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which
   the cankerworm hath the caterpiller eaten.

   4. Residuum locustae comedit (est alia species) bruchus (ita ponamus,
   quoniam non possumus certo scire quaenam fuerint istae species) et
   residuum bruchi comedit locusta et residuum locustae comedit eruca
   (alii primo loco ponunt Erucam, est proprie chenille, et puto potius
   esse hoc posterius. Picardi vocant casee, quasi lysch: verisimile est
   deductum fuisse nomen illud vulgare ab Hebraeis, quia est fere idem:
   sed tamen ego non anxie sudo in istis nominibus, quia de sensu
   Prophetae satis constabit. Nunc venio ad inscriptionem libri.)


   The word of Jehovah which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. He names
   here his father; it is hence probable that he was a man well known and
   of some celebrity. But who this Pethuel was, all now are ignorant. And
   what the Hebrews hold as a general rule, that a prophet is designated,
   whenever his father's name is added, appears to me frivolous; and we
   see how bold they are in devising such comments. When no reason for any
   thing appears to them, they invent some fable, and allege it as a
   divine truth. When, therefore, they are wont thus to trifle, I have no
   regard for what is held by them as a rule. But yet it is probable, that
   when the Prophets are mentioned as having sprung from this or that
   father, their fathers were men of some note.

   Now what he declared by saying, that he delivered the word of the Lord,
   is worthy of being observed; for he shows that he claimed nothing for
   himself, as an individual, as though he wished to rule by his own
   judgment, and to subject others to his own fancies; but that he relates
   only what he had received from the Lord. And since the Prophets claimed
   no authority for themselves, except as far as they faithfully executed
   the office divinely committed to them, and delivered, as it were from
   hand to hand, what the Lord commanded, we may hence feel assured that
   no human doctrines ought to be admitted into the Church. Why? Because
   as much as men trust in themselves, so much they take away from the
   authority of God. This preface then ought to be noticed, which almost
   all the Prophets use, namely, that they brought nothing of their own or
   according to their own judgment, but that they were faithful dispensers
   of the truth intrusted to them by God.

   And the word is said to have been to Joel; not that God intended that
   he alone should be his disciple, but because he deposited this treasure
   with him, that he might be his minister to the whole people. Paul also
   says the same thing, -- that to the ministers of the Gospel was
   committed a message for Christ, or in Christ's name, to reconcile men
   to God, (2 Corinthians 5:20;) and in another place he says, He has
   deposited with us this treasure as in earthen vessels,' (2 Corinthians
   4:7.) We now understand why Joel says, that the word of the Lord was
   delivered to him, it was not that he might be the only disciple; but as
   some teacher was necessary, Joel was chosen to whom the Lord committed
   this office. Then the word of God belongs indeed indiscriminately to
   all; and yet it is committed to Prophets and other teachers; for they
   are, so to speak, as it were trustees (depositarii -- depositories.)

   As to the verb hyheie, there is no need of philosophizing so acutely as
   Jerome does: "How was the word of the Lord made?" For he feared lest
   Christ should be said to be made, as he is the word of the Lord. These
   are trifles, the most puerile. He could not, however, in any other way
   get rid of the difficulty but by saying that the word is said to be
   made with respect to man whom God addresses, and not with respect to
   God himself. All this, as ye must see, is childish; for the Prophet
   says here only, that the word of the Lord was sent to him, that is,
   that the Lord employed him as his messenger to the whole people. But
   after having shown that he was a fit minister of God, being furnished
   with his word, he speaks authoritatively, for he represented the person
   of God.

   We now see what is the lawful authority which ought to be in force in
   the Church, and which we ought to obey without dispute, and to which
   all ought to submit. It is then only that this authority exists, when
   God himself speaks by men, and the Holy Spirit employs them as his
   instruments. For the Prophet brings not forward any empty title; he
   does not say that he is a high priest of the tribe of Levi, or of the
   first order, or of the family of Aaron. He alleges no such thing, but
   says that the word of God was deposited with him. Whosoever then
   demands to be heard in the Church, must of necessity really prove that
   he is a preacher of God's word; and he must not bring his own devices,
   nor blend with the word any thing that proceeds from the judgment of
   his own flesh.

   But first the Prophet reproves the Jews for being so stupid as not to
   consider that they were chastised by the hand of God, though this was
   quite evident. Hence they pervert, in my judgment, the meaning of the
   Prophet, who think that punishments are here denounced which were as
   yet suspended; for they transfer all these things to a future time. But
   I distinguish between this reproof and the denunciations which
   afterwards follow. Here then the Prophet reproaches the Jews, that
   having been so severely smitten, they did not gain wisdom; and yet even
   fools, when the rod is applied to their backs, know that they are
   punished. Since then the Jews were so stupid, that when even chastised
   they did not understand that they had to do with God, the Prophet
   justly reproves this madness. "Hear", he says, "ye old men; give ear,
   all ye inhabitants of the land, and declare this to your children". But
   the consideration of this passage I shall put off till tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God that as almost the whole world give such loose
   reins to their licentiousness, that they hesitate not either to despise
   or to regard as of no value thy sacred word -- Grant, O Lord that we
   may always retain such reverence as is justly due to it and to thy holy
   oracles and be so moved whenever thou deignest to address us that being
   truly humbled, we may be raised up by faith to heaven, and by hope
   gradually attain that glory which is as yet hid from us. And may we at
   the same time so submissively restrain ourselves, as to make it our
   whole wisdom to obey thee and to do thee service, until thou gatherest
   us into thy kingdom, where we shall be partakers of thy glory, through
   Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Thirty-ninth.

   Hear this, ye old men; and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land:
   has this been in your days, and in the days of your fathers? This
   declare to your children and your children to their children, and their
   children to the next generation: the residue of the locust has the
   chafer eaten, and the residue of the chafer has the cankerworm eaten,
   and the residue of the cankerworm has the caterpillar eaten [2] I have
   in the last Lecture already mentioned what I think of this passage of
   the Prophet. Some think that a future punishment is denounced; but the
   context sufficiently proves that they mistake and pervert the real
   meaning of the Prophet; for, on the contrary, he reproves here the
   hardness of the people, -- that they fell not their plagues. And as men
   are not easily moved by God's judgments, the Prophet here declares that
   God had executed such a vengeance as could not be regarded otherwise
   than miraculous; as though he said, "God often punishes men, and it
   behooves them to be attentive as soon as he raises up his finger. But
   common punishments are wont to be unheeded; men soon forget those
   punishments to which they have been accustomed. God has, however,
   treated you in an unusual manner, having openly as it were put forth
   his hand from heaven, and brought on you punishments nothing less than
   miraculous. Ye must then be more than stupid, if ye perceive not that
   you are smitten by God's hand." This is the true meaning of the
   Prophet, and may be easily gathered from the words.

   Hear, ye old men, he says. He expressly addresses the old, because
   experience teaches men much; and the old, when they see any thing new
   or unusual, must know, that it is not according to the ordinary course
   of things. He who has past his fiftieth or sixtieth year, and sees
   something new happening which he had never thought of, doubtless
   acknowledges it as the unusual work of God. This is the reason why the
   Prophet directs here his discourse to the old; as though he said, "I
   will not terrify you about nothing; but let the old hear, who have been
   accustomed for many years to many revolutions; let them now answer me,
   whether in their whole life, which has been an age on the earth, have
   they seen any such thing " We now perceive the design of the Prophet;
   for he intended to awaken the Jews that they might understand that God
   had put forth his hand from heaven, and that it was impossible to
   ascribe what they had seen with their eyes to chance or to earthly
   causes, but that it was a miracle. And his object was to make the Jews
   at length ashamed of their folly in not having hitherto been attentive
   to God's punishments, and in having always flattered themselves, as
   though God slept in heaven, when yet he so violently thundered against
   them, and intended by an extraordinary course to move them, that they
   might at last perceive that they were summoned to judgment.

   He afterwards adds, And all ye inhabitants of the land. Had the Prophet
   addressed only the old, some might seize on some pretext for their
   ignorance; hence he addressed and from the least to the greatest; and
   this he did, that the young might not exempt themselves from blame in
   proceeding in their obstinacy and in thus mocking God, when he called
   them to repentance. Hear, he says, all ye inhabitants of the land; has
   this been in your days or in the days of your fathers? He says first,
   has such a thing been in your days, for doubtless what happens rarely
   deserves a greater consideration. It is indeed true that foolish men
   are blind to the daily works of God; as the favor of God in making his
   sun to rise daily is but little thought of by us. This happens through
   our ingratitude; but our ingratitude is doubled, and is much more base
   and less excusable, when the Lord works in an unwonted manner, and we
   yet with closed eves overlook what ought to be deemed a miracle. This
   dullness the Prophet now reproves, Has such a thing, he says, "happened
   in your days, or in the days of your fathers? Ye can recall to mind
   what your fathers have told you. It is certain that for two ages no
   such thing has happened. Your torpidity then is extreme, since ye
   neglect this judgment of God, which from its very rareness ought to
   have awakened your minds."

   He then adds, Tell it to your children, your children to their
   children, their children to the next generation. In this verse the
   Prophet shows that the matter deserved to be remembered, and was not to
   be despised by posterity, even for many generations. It appears now
   quite clear that the Prophet threatens not what was to be, as some
   interpreters think; it would have been puerile: but, on the contrary,
   he expostulates here with the Jews, because they were so slothful and
   tardy in considering God's judgments; and especially as it was a
   remarkable instance, when God employed not usual means, but roused,
   and, as it were, terrified men by prodigies. Of this then tell: for lyh
   olie means no other thing than tell or declare this thing to your
   children;' and further, your children to their children. When any thing
   new happens, it may be, that we are at first moved with some wonder;
   but our feeling soon vanishes with the novelty, and we disregard what
   at first caused great astonishment. But the Prophet here showed, that
   such was the judgment of God of which he speaks, that it ought not to
   have been overlooked, no, not even by posterity. Let your children, he
   says, declare it to those after them, and their children to the fourth
   generation: it was to be always remembered.

   He adds [2]what that judgment was, -- that the hope of food had for
   many years disappointed them. It often happened, we know, that locusts
   devoured the standing corn; and then the chafers and the palmer worms
   did the same: these were ordinary events. But when one devastation
   happened, and another followed, and there was no end; when there had
   been four barren years, suddenly produced by insects, which devoured
   the growth of the earth; -- this was certainly unusual. Hence the
   Prophet says, that this could not have been chance; for God intended to
   show to the Jews some extraordinary portent, that even against their
   will they might observe his hand. When any thing trifling happens, if
   it be rare, it will strike the attention of men; for we often see that
   the world makes a great noise about frivolous things. But this wonder,
   says the Prophet, "ought to have produced effect on you. What then will
   ye do, since ye are starving, and the causes are evident; for God has
   cursed your land, and brought these insects, which have consumed your
   food before your eyes. Since it is so, it is surely the time for you to
   repent; and you have been hitherto very regardless having overlooked
   God's judgments, which have been so remarkable and so memorable." Let
   us now proceed.

   [2] All these are different kinds of locusts. There are in Hebrew ten
   names for them, designative probably of so many kinds. There are four
   here: gzm, gizam, the young locust; 'rvh, arebe, so called from their
   number, one on the wing; ylq, ilak, one of the hairy bristly kind; and
   lpss', chesil, one unfledged. Following the probable ideal meaning of
   the words, we may give them these names, --the cutter, the multiplier,
   the licker, and the devourer. -- Ed.

   Joel 1:5

   5. Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,
   because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.

   5. Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,
   because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.


   The Prophet adds this verse for the sake of amplifying; for when God
   sees men either contemptuously laughing at or disregarding his
   judgments, he derides them; and this mode the Prophet now adopts. Ye
   drunkards,' he says, awake, and weep and howl.' In these words he
   addresses, on the subject in hand, those who had willfully closed their
   eyes to judgments so manifest. The Jews had become torpid, and had
   covered themselves over as it were with hardness; it was then necessary
   to draw them forth as by force into the light. But the Prophet accosts
   the drunkards by name; and it is probable that this vice was then very
   common among the people. However that might be, the Prophet by
   mentioning this instance shows more convincingly, that there was no
   pretense for passing by things, and that the Jews could not excuse
   their indifference if they took no notice; for the very drunkards, who
   had degenerated from the state of men, did themselves feel the
   calamity, for the wine had been cut off from their mouth. And this
   expression of the Prophet, "Awake", ought to be noticed; for the
   drunkards, even while awake, are asleep, and also spend a great portion
   of time in sleep. The Prophet had this in view, that men, though not
   endued with great knowledge, but even void of common sense, could no
   longer flatter themselves; for the very drunkards, who had wholly
   suffocated their senses, and had become thus estranged in their minds,
   did yet perceive the judgment of God; though drowsiness held them
   bound, they were yet constrained to awake at such a manifest
   punishment. What then does this ignorance mean, when ye see not that
   you are smitten by God's hand?

   To the same purpose are the words, Weep and howl. Drunkards, on the
   contrary, give themselves up to mirth, and intemperately indulge
   themselves; and there is nothing more difficult than to make them to
   feel sorrow; for wine so infatuates their senses, that they continue to
   laugh in the greatest calamities. But the Prophet says, Weep and howl,
   ye drunkards! What then ought sober men to do? He then adds, Cut off is
   the wine from your mouth. He says not, "The use of wine is taken away
   from you;" but he says, from your mouth. Though no one should think of
   vineyards or of winecellars or of cups, yet they shall be forced,
   willing or unwilling, to feel the judgment of God in their mouth and in
   their lips. This is what the Prophet means. We then see how much he
   aggravates what he had said before: and we must remember that his
   object was to strike shame into the people, who had become thus torpid
   with regard to God's judgments.

   As to the word sys osis, some render it new wine. ss osas is to press;
   and hence sys osis is properly the wine that is pressed in the
   wine-vat. New wine is not what is drawn out of the bottle, but what is
   pressed out as it were by force. But the Prophet, I have no doubt,
   includes here under one kind every sort of wine. Let us go on.

   Joel 1:6-7

   6. For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,
   whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a
   great lion.

   6. Quia gens ascendit super terram meam, robusta et absque numero,
   dentes ejus dentes leonis, et maxillae (alii vertunt, molares) leonis
   illis (quanquam aliud est nomen: alii vertunt, leunculum.)

   7. He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it
   clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.

   7. Posuit vineam meam in vastitatem (vel, desolationem) et ficulneam
   meam in decorticationem: nudando nudavit eam et disjecit, albi facti
   sunt rami ejus.


   Of what some think, that punishment, not yet inflicted, is denounced
   here on the people, I again repeat, I do not approve; but, on the
   contrary, the Prophet, according to my view, records another judgment
   of God, in order to show that God had not only in one way warned the
   Jews of their sins, that he might restore them to a right mind; but
   that he had tried all means to bring them to the right way, though they
   proved to have been irreclaimable. After having then spoke of the
   sterility of the fields and of other calamities, he now adds that the
   Jews had been visited with war. [3] Surely famine ought to have touched
   them, especially when they saw that evils, succeeding evils, had
   happened for several years contrary to the usual course of things, so
   that they could not be imputed to chance. But when God brought war upon
   them, when they were already worn out with famine, must they not have
   been more than insane in mind, to have continued astonied at God's
   judgments and not to repent? Then the meaning of the Prophet is, that
   God had tried, by every means possible, to find out whether the Jews
   were healable, and had given them every opportunity to repent, but that
   they were wholly perverse and untamable.

   Then he says, Verily a nation came up. The particle ky ki is not to be
   taken as a causative, but only as explanatory, Verily, or surely, he
   says, a nation came up; though an inference also is not amiss, if it be
   drawn from the beginning of the verse: Hear, ye old men, and tell your
   children;' what shall we tell? even this, that a nation, etc. But in
   this form also ky ki would be exegetical, and the sense would be the
   same. This much as to the meaning of the passage.

   A nation, then, came up over my land. God here justly claims the land
   of Canaan as his own heritage, and does so designedly, that the Jews
   might more clearly know that he was angry with them; for their
   condition would not have been worse than that of other nations, had not
   God resolved to punish them for their sins. There is here then an
   implied comparison between Judea and other countries, as though the
   Prophet said, "How comes it, that your land is wasted by wars and many
   other calamities, while other countries are at rest? This land is no
   doubt sacred to God, for he has chosen it for himself, that he might
   rule in it; he has here his own habitation: it then must be that there
   is some cause for God's wrath, as your land is so miserably wasted,
   when other lands enjoy tranquillity." We now perceive what the Prophet
   means. A nation, he says, came up upon my land, and what then? God
   could surely have prevented this; he could have defended his own land,
   of which he was the keeper, and which was under his protection: how
   then had it happened that enemies with impunity inundated this land,
   having marched into it and utterly laid it waste, except that it had
   been forsaken by the Lord himself?

   A nation, he says, came up upon my land, strong and without number; and
   further, who had the teeth of a lion, the jaw-bones of a young lion.
   The nations had no strength which God could not in an instant have
   broken down, nor had he need of mighty auxiliaries, for he could by a
   nod only have reduced to nothing whatever men might have attempted:
   when, therefore, the Assyrians so impetuously assailed the Jews they
   were necessarily exposed to the wantonness of their enemies, for they
   were unworthy of being protected, as hitherto, by the hand of God.

   He afterwards adds, that his vine had been exposed to desolation and
   waste, his fig-tree to the stripping of the bark. God speaks not here
   of his own vine, as in some other places, in which he designates his
   Church by this term; but he calls everything on earth his own, as he
   calls the whole race of Abraham his children: and he thus reproaches
   the Jews for having reduced themselves to such wretchedness through
   their own fault; for they would have never been spoiled by their
   enemies, had not God, who was wont to defend then, previously rejected
   them; for there was nothing in their land which he did not claim as his
   own; as he had chosen the people, so he had consecrated the land to
   himself. Whatsoever, then, enlisted in Judea, was, as it were, sacred
   to God. Now when both the vines and the fig-trees were exposed to the
   depredations of the unbelieving, it was certain that God no longer
   ruled there. How so? Even because the Jews had expelled him. He
   afterwards enlarges on the same subject; for what follows, By denuding
   he has denuded it and cast it away, is not a mere narrative; the
   Prophet here declares not simply what had taken place; but as we have
   already said, adduces more proof, and tries to awaken the drowsy senses
   of the people, yea, to arouse them from that lethargy by which the
   minds of all had been seized; hence it is that he uses in his teaching
   so many expressions. This is the reason why he says that the vine and
   the fig-tree had been denuded, and also that the leaves had been taken
   away, that the branches had been made bare and white; so that there
   remained neither produce nor growth.

   Many interpreters join these three verses with the former, as if the
   Prophet now expressed what he had said before of the palmer worm, the
   chafer, and the locust; for they think that he spake allegorically when
   he said that all the fruits of the land had been consumed by the
   locusts and the chafers. They therefore add, that these locusts, or
   chafers, or the palmer worms, were the Assyrians, as well as the
   Persian and the Greeks, that is, Alexander of Macedon and the Romans:
   but this is wholly a strained views so that there is no need of a long
   argument; for any one may easily perceive that the Prophet mentions
   another kind of punishments that he might in every way render the Jews
   inexcusable who were not roused by judgments so multiplied, but
   remained still obstinate in their vices. Let us now proceed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] But most commentators consider these two verses as containing a
   more particular description of the devastations produced by the locusts
   mentioned before. That they are called "a nation" is according to
   prophetic style, and what has been done by heathen poets: the wasting
   of the vine and the barking of the fig-tree seem more suitable to this
   view. It is true that nvy, nation, and not vzm people, as in Proverbs
   30:25, is here used; but, as Dr. Henderson observes, it seems to have
   been selected on purpose "to prepare the minds of the Jews for the
   allegorical use made of these insects in chapter 2." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:8

   8. Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
   youth.

   8. Plange tanquam puella, accincta sacco, super marito adolescentiae
   suae.


   The Prophet now addresses the whole land. Lament, he says; not in an
   ordinary way, but like a widow, whose husband is dead, whom she had
   married when young. The love, we know, of a young man towards a young
   woman, and so of a young woman towards a young man, is more tender than
   when a person in years marries an elderly woman. This is the reason
   that the Prophet here mentions the husband of her youth; he wished to
   set forth the heaviest lamentation, and hence he says "The Jews ought
   not surely to be otherwise affected by so many calamities, than a widow
   who has lost her husband while young, and not arrived at maturity, but
   in the flower of his age." As then such widows feel bitterly their
   loss, so the Prophet has adduced their case.

   The Hebrews often call a husband vl bol, because he is the lord of his
   wife and has her under his protection. Literally it is, "For the lord
   of her youth;" and hence it is, that they also called their idols vlym
   bolim, as though they were as we have often said in our comment on the
   Prophet Hosea, their patrons.

   The sum of the whole is, That the Jews could not have continued in an
   unconcerned state, without being void of all reason and discernment;
   for they were forced, willing or unwilling, to feel a most grievous
   calamity. It is a monstrous thing, when a widow, losing her husband
   when yet young, refrains from mourning. Now then, since God had
   afflicted his land with so many evils, he wished to bring on them, as
   it were, the grief of widowhood. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:9

   9. The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house
   of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's ministers, mourn.

   9. Succisa est oblatio et libamen e domo Jehovae: luxerunt sacerdotes,
   ministri Jehovae.


   Here, in other words, the Prophet paints the calamity; for, as it has
   been said, we see how great is the slowness of men to discern God's
   judgments; and the Jews, we know, were not more attentive to them than
   we are now. It was, therefore, needful to prick them with various
   goads, as the Prophet now does, as though he said, "If ye are not now
   concerned for want of food, if ye consider not even what the very
   drunkards are constrained to feel, who perceive not the evil at a
   distance, but taste it in their lips -- if all these things are of no
   account with you, do at least look on the temple of God, which is now
   destitute of its ordinary services; for through the sterility of your
   fields, through so great a scarcity, neither bread nor wine is offered.
   Since then ye see that the worship of God has ceased, how is it ye
   yourselves still remain? Why is it that ye perceive not that God's fury
   is kindled against you? For surely except God had been most grievously
   offended, he would at least have had some regard for his own worship;
   he would not have suffered his temple to remain without sacrifices."

   The Jews, we know, daily poured their libations, and offered
   meat-offerings. When, therefore, Joel mentions mnchh meneche and
   libation, he doubtless meant to show that the worship of God was nearly
   abolished. But God would have never permitted such a thing, had he not
   been grievously offended by the sins of men. Hence the indifference, or
   rather the stupidity of the people, is more clearly proved, inasmuch as
   they perceived not the signs of God's wrath made evident even in the
   very temple. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:10

   10. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the
   new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

   10. Vastatus est ager, luxit terra (hoc est, luxerunt terrae incolae;)
   quia vastatum est (idem est verbum vel, quia periit) frumentum, aruit
   (est a verbo yvs, non a vvs, quod significat pudefacere: quanquam
   utraque radix significationem hanc admittit apud Hebraeos: quia ergo
   aruit) mustum et exterminatum est (infirmatum ad verbum, ab 'ml; sed
   significat debilitatum esse) oleum.


   The Prophet goes on here with the same subject, and uses these many
   words to give more effect to what he said; for he knew that he
   addressed the deaf, who, by long habit, had so hardened themselves that
   God could effect nothing, at least very little, by his word. This is
   the reason why the Prophet so earnestly presses a subject so evident.
   Should any one ask what need there was of so many expressions, as it
   seems to be a needless use of words; I do indeed allow that all that
   the Prophet wished to say might have been expressed in one sentence, as
   there is here nothing intricate: but it was not enough that what he
   said should be understood, except the Jews applied it to themselves,
   and perceived that they had to do with God; and to make this
   application they were not disposed. It is not then without reason that
   the Prophet labors here, and enforces the same thing in many words.

   Hence he says, The field is wasted, and the land mourns; for the corn
   has perished, for dried up has the wine, for destroyed has been the
   oil. And by these words he intimates that they seeing saw nothing; as
   though he said, "Let necessity extort mourning from you; ye are indeed
   starving, all complain of want, all deplore the need of bread and wine;
   and yet no one of you thinks whence this want is, that it is from the
   hand of God. Ye feel it in your mouth, ye feel it in your palate, ye
   feel it in your throat, ye feel it in your stomach; but ye feel it not
   in your heart." In short, the Prophet intimates that the Jews were void
   of right understanding; they indeed deplored their famine, but they
   were like brute beasts, who, when hungry, show signs of impatience. So
   the Jews mourned, because their stomach disquieted them; but they knew
   not that the cause of their want and famine was their sins. It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:11

   11. Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the
   wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.

   11. Erubescite agricolae, ululate vinitores super tritico et hordeo;
   quia periit messis agri.


   The Prophet says nothing new here, but only strengthens what he had
   said before, and is not wordy without reason; for he intends here not
   merely to teach, but also to produce an effect: And this is the design
   of heavenly teaching; for God not only wishes that what he says may be
   understood, but intends also to penetrate into our hearts: and the word
   of God, we know, consists not of doctrine only, but also of
   exhortations, and threatenings, and reproofs. This plan then the
   Prophet now pursues: Ye husband men, he says, be ashamed, and ye
   vinedressers, howl; for perished has the harvest of the field. The sum
   of the whole is, that the Jews, as we have already said, could by no
   excuse cover their indifference; for their clamor was everywhere heard,
   their complaints everywhere resounded, that the land had become a
   waste, that they were themselves famished that they were afflicted with
   many calamities; and yet no one acknowledged that God, who visited them
   for their sins, was the author. But what remains I shall put off until
   to-morrow.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou invites us daily by various means to
   repentance, and continues also to urge us, because thou sees our
   extreme tardiness, -- O grant that we may at length be awakened from
   our indifference, and suffer us not to be inebriated by the charms of
   Satan and the world; but by thy Spirit rouse us to real groaning, that,
   being ashamed of ourselves, we may flee to thy mercy, and doubt not but
   that thou wilt be propitious to us, provided with a sincere heart we
   call on thee, and seek that reconciliation which thou daily offerest to
   us by thy Gospel in the name of thy only begotten Son. Amen.

   Joel 1:12

   12. The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate
   tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the
   field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

   12. Vitis exaruit, et ficulnea infirmata est (vel, periit;)
   malogranatum, etiam palma et malus, omnes arbores exaruerunt: certe
   exaruit gaudium a filiis hominum.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Fortieth

   The Prophet now concludes his subjects which was, that as God executed
   judgments so severe on the people, it was a wonder that they remained
   stupefied, when thus reduces to extremities. The vine, he says, has
   dried up, and every kind of fruit; he adds the fig-tree, afterwards the
   rmvn remun, the pomegranate, (for so they render it,) the palm, the
   apple-tree, [4] and all trees. And this sterility was a clear sign of
   God's wrath; and it would have been so regarded, had not men either
   wholly deceived themselves, or had become hardened against all
   punishments. Now this anaisthesia (insensibility) is as it were the
   very summit of evils; that is, when men feel not their own calamities,
   or at least understand not that they are inflicted by the hand of God.
   Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] Of the three foregoing trees we may add this account:
   The pomegranate, rmvn, grows about 20 feet high, has a straight stem
   and spreading branches, and bears large red blossoms. Its fruit is
   about the size of an orange, and is delicious and cooling.
   The palm or date-tree, tmr, is sometimes as high as 100 feet, and
   remarkably straight. Its fruit grows in clusters under its leaves, and
   is in taste very sweet. Palm branches were emblems of victory.
   What is called here the apple-tree, tphvch, was no doubt the
   citron-tree. The word is derived from nphh, to breathe, on account of
   the extreme fragrance it emits. -- Ed.

   Joel 1:13-15

   13. Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the
   altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for
   the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house
   of your God.

   13. Accingimini et plangete sacerdotes; ululate, ministri altaris;
   venite, pernoctate cum saccis, ministri Dei mei: quia prohibita est a
   domo Dei vestri oblatio et libamen.

   14. Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and
   all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God,
   and cry unto the Lord,

   14. Sactificate jejunium, vocate coetum, congregate senes, omnes
   incoles terrae, in domum Jehovae Dei vestri, et clamate ad Jehovam,

   15. Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a
   destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

   15. Heus Diem! Quia propinquus est dies Jehovae, et tanquam vastitas ab
   Omnipotente veniet.


   Now the Prophet begins to exhort the people to repentance. Having
   represented them as grievously afflicted by the hand of God, he now
   adds that a remedy was at hand, provided they solicited the favor of
   God; and at the same tine he denounces a more grievous punishment in
   future; for it would not have been enough that they had been reminded
   of their calamities and evils, except they also feared in time to come.
   Hence the Prophet, that he might the more move them, says, that the
   hand of God was still stretched out, and that there was something worse
   nigh at hand, except they of themselves anticipated it. This is the
   purport of the whole. I now come to the words.

   Be girded, lament and howl, he says, ye priests, the ministers of the
   altar The verb chgrv chegeru may be explained in two ways. Some
   understand it thus "Gird yourselves with sackcloth;" for shortly after
   he says with sackcloth, or in sackcloth. But we may take it as simply
   meaning, gird yourselves, that is, Hasten; for this metaphorical
   expression often occurs. As to the drift of the passage, there is but
   little difference, whether we read, "Gird yourselves with sackcloth,"
   or, "Hasten." And he addresses the priests, though a common and general
   exhortation to the whole people afterwards follows. But as God made
   them the leaders of his people, it behaved them to afford others an
   example. It is the common duty of all the godly to pray for and to
   further the salvation of their brethren; but it is a duty especially
   enjoined on the ministers of the word and on pastors. So also, when God
   calls those to repentance who preside over others, they ought to lead
   the way, and for two reasons; -- first, because they have not been in
   vain chosen by the Lord for this end, that they might outshine others,
   and be as luminaries; -- secondly, because they who bear any public
   office ought to feel a double guilty when the Lord visits public sins
   with judgment. Private men indeed sin; but in pastors there is the
   blame of negligence, and still more, when they deviate even the least
   from the right way, a greater offense is given. Rightly then does the
   Prophet begin with the priests, when he bids the whole people to
   repent. And he not only bids them to put on sackcloth, but commands
   them also, as we shall see, to proclaim a fast, and then to call an
   assembly: ye priests, he says, be girded, and put on sackcloth, wail,
   howl, and pass the night in sackcloth; and then he calls them the
   ministers of the altar and the ministers of God, but in a different
   sense; for the Prophet does not substitute the altar for God, as he
   would thus have formed an idol; but they are called the ministers of
   the altar, because they offered there sacrifices to God. They are
   indeed with strict propriety the ministers of God; but as the priests,
   when they sacrificed, stood in the presence of God, and as the altar
   was to them as it were the way of access to him, they are called the
   ministers of the altar. He calls them, at the same time, the ministers
   of God, and, as it has been stated, they are properly so called.

   But he says here 'lhy alei (my God.) The iod, my, is by some omitted,
   as if it were a servile letter, but redundant. I, however, doubt not
   but that the Prophet here mentions Him as his God; for he thus intended
   to claim more authority for his doctrine. His concern or his contest
   was with the whole people; and they, no doubt, in their usual ways
   proudly opposed against him the name of God as their shield. "What! are
   we not the very people of God?" Hence the Prophet, in order to prove
   this presumption false, sets forth God as being on his side. He
   therefore says, The ministers of my God.' Had any one objected and
   said, that he was in common the God of the whole people, the Prophet
   had a ready answer, -- "I am specially sent by Him, and sustain his
   person, and plead the cause which he has committed to me: He is then my
   God and not yours." We now then see the Prophet's meaning in this
   expression. He now adds, for cut off is offering and libation from the
   house of our God. He confesses Him at the same time to be their God
   with reference to the priesthood; for nothing, we know, was
   presumptuously invented by the Jews, as the temple was built by Godly
   command, and sacrifices were offered according to the rule of the law.
   He then ascribes to the priesthood this honor, that God ruled in the
   temple; for God, as we have already said, approved of that worship as
   having proceeded from his word: and to this purpose is that saying of
   Christ, We know what we worship.' But yet the priests did not rightly
   worship God; for though their external rites were according to the
   command of God, yet as their hearts were polluted, it is certain that
   whatever they did was repudiated by God, until, being touched with the
   fear of his judgment, they fled to his mercy, as the Prophet now
   exhorts them to do.

   He afterwards adds, sanctify a fast, call an assembly, gather the old,
   all the inhabitants of the land. qds kodash means to sanctify and to
   prepare; but I have retained its proper meaning, sanctify a fast; for
   the command had regard to the end, that is, sanctification. Then a fast
   proclaim -- for what purpose? That the people might purge themselves
   from all their pollutions, and present themselves pure and clean before
   God. Call an assembly. It appears that there was a solemn convocation
   whenever a fast was proclaimed among the people: for it was not enough
   for each one privately at home to abstain from food, except all
   confessed openly, with one mouth and one consent, that they were guilty
   before God. Hence with a fast was connected a solemn profession of
   repentance. The uses and ends of a fast, we know, are various: but when
   the Prophet here speaks of a solemn fast, he doubtless bids the people
   to come to it suppliantly, as the guilty are wont to do, who would
   deprecate punishment before a judge, that they may obtain mercy from
   him. In the second chapter there will be much to say on fasting: I only
   wish now briefly to touch on the subject.

   He afterwards bids the old to be gathered, and then adds, All the
   inhabitants of the land. But he begins with the old, and justly so, for
   the guilt of the old is always the heaviest. But this word relates not
   to age as in a former instance. When he said yesterday, Hear ye, the
   aged,' he addressed those who by long experience had learnt in the
   world many things unknown to the young or to men of middle age. But now
   the Prophet means by the old those to whom was intrusted the public
   government; and as through their slothfulness they had suffered the
   worship of God and all integrity to fall into decay, rightly does the
   Prophet wish them to be leaders and precursors to the people in their
   confession of repentance; and further, it behaved them, on account of
   their office, as we have said of the priests, to lead the way. Joel at
   the same time shows that the whole people were implicated in guilt, so
   that none could be excepted, for he bids them all to come with the
   elders.

   Call them, he says, to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry ye to
   Jehovah. We hence learn why he had spoken of fasting and of sackcloth,
   even that they might humbly deprecate God's wrath; for fasting of
   itself would have been useless, and to put on sackcloth, we know, is in
   itself but an empty sign: but prayer is what the Prophet sets here in
   the highest rank, and fasting is only an appendage, and so is
   sackcloth. Whosoever then puts on sackcloth and withholds prayer, is
   guilty of mockery; and no one can derive any good from mere fasting;
   but when fasting and sackcloth are added to prayer, and are as it were
   handmaids, then they are not uselessly practiced. We may then observe,
   that the end of fasting and sackcloth was no other, than that the
   priests together with the whole people, might present themselves
   suppliantly before God, and confess themselves worthy of destruction,
   and that they had no hope except from his gratuitous mercy. This is the
   meaning.

   It now follows, Alas the day! for nigh is the day of Jehovah. Here the
   Prophet, as it was at first stated, threatens something worse in future
   than what they had experienced. He has hitherto been showing their
   torpidity; now he declares that they had not yet suffered all their
   punishments, but that there was something worse to be feared, except
   they turned seasonably to God. And he now exclaims, as though the day
   of Jehovah was before his eyes, and he calls it the day of Jehovah,
   because in that day God would stretch-forth his hand to execute
   judgment; for while he tolerates men or bears with their sins, he seems
   not to rule in the world. And though this mode of speaking is common
   enough in Scripture, it ought yet to be carefully noticed; for all seem
   not to understand that God calls that his own day, when he will openly
   shine forth and appear as the judge of the world: but as long as he
   spares us, his face seems to be hidden from us; yea, he seems not to
   govern the world. The Prophet therefore declares here that the day of
   the Lord was at hand; for it cannot be, but that the Lord must at
   length rise up and ascend his throne to punish men, though for a time
   he may connive at them. But the interjection, expressive of grief,
   intimates that the judgment, of which the Prophet speaks, was not to be
   despised, for it would be dreadful; and he wished to strike terror into
   the Jews, for they were too secure. And he says, The day is nigh, that
   they might not procrastinate, as they were wont to do, from day to day:
   for though men be touched by God's judgments they yet even desire time
   to be prolonged to them, and they come very tardily to God. Hence the
   Prophet, that he might correct this their great slothfulness, says that
   the day was nigh.

   He adds, ksd msdy yvv' kashed meshadi ibu as a desolation from the
   Almighty will it come.' The word sdy shadi signifies a conqueror; but
   it proceeds from the verb sdd shadad; and this in Hebrew means "to
   desolate," or "to destroy." The powerful and the conqueror is called
   sdy shadi; and hence they call God sdy shadi, on account of his power.
   Some derive it from udder: then they call God sdy shadi as though
   Scripture gave him this name, because from him flows all abundance of
   good things as from a fountain. But I rather refer this name to his
   strength and power, for the Jews, we know, gloried in the name of God
   as one armed to defend their safety. Whenever then the Prophets said
   that God was sdy shadi, the people laid hold on this as a ground for
   false confidence, "God is almighty, we are then secure from all evils."
   But yet this confidence was not founded on the promises: and it was, we
   know, an absurd and profane presumption to have thus abused the name of
   God. Since then the Jews foolishly pricked themselves on this, that God
   had adopted them for his people, the prophet says here, "There will
   come a desolation from the Almighty;" that is, "God is Almighty, but ye
   are greatly deceived in thinking that your safety is secured by his
   power; for he will, on the contrary, be opposed to you, inasmuch as ye
   have provoked his wrath." It follows --

   Joel 1:16-17

   16. Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from
   the house of our God?

   16. An non coram oculis nostris cibus excisus est? e domo Dei nostri
   gaudium et exultatio?

   17. The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
   desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

   17. Putrefacta sunt grana subtus sulcos suos, desolata sunt
   reconditoria (vel, apothecae desolatae sunt,) diruta sunt horrea, quia
   exaruit frumentum.


   He repeats the same thing as before, for he reproaches the Jews for
   being so slow to consider that the hand of God was against them. Has
   not the meat, he says, been cut off before our eyes? joy and exultation
   from the house of our God? Here he chides the madness of the Jews, that
   they perceived not things set before their eyes. He therefore says that
   they were blind in the midst of light, and that their sight was such,
   that seeing they saw nothing: they surely ought to have felt
   distressed, when want reached the temple. For since God had commanded
   the first-fruits to be offered to him, the temple ought not by any
   means to have been without its sacrifices; and though mortals perish a
   hundred times through famine and want, yet God ought not to be
   defrauded of his right. When, therefore, there was now no offering nor
   libation, how great was the stupidity of the people not to feel this
   curse, which ought to have wounded them more than if they had been
   consumed a hundred times by famine? We see then the design of the
   Prophet's words, that is, to condemn the Jews for their stupidity; for
   they considered not that a most grievous judgment was brought on them,
   when the temple was deprived of its usual sacrifices.

   He afterwards adds, that joy and gladness were taken away: for God
   commanded the Jews to come to the temple to give thanks and to
   acknowledge themselves blessed, because he had chosen his habitation
   among them. Hence this expression is so often repeated by Moses, Thou
   shalt rejoice before thy God;' for by saying this, God intended to
   encourage the people the more to come cheerfully to the temple; as
   though he said, "I certainly want not your presence, but I wish by my
   presence to make you glad." But now when the worship of God ceased, the
   Prophet says, that joy had been also abolished; for the Jews could not
   cheerfully give thanks to God when his curse was before their eyes,
   when they saw that he was their adversary, and also when they were
   deprived of the ordinances of religion. We now then perceive why the
   Prophet joins joy and gladness with oblations: they were the symbols of
   thanksgiving.

   He shows the cause of the evil, Rotted have the grains in the very
   furrows. For they call seeds phrdvt peredut from the act of scattering.
   He then calls grains by this name, because they are scattered; and he
   says that they rotted in the fields when they ought to have germinated.
   He then adds, The granaries halve become desolated and the barns have
   been pulled down; for there was no use for them. Hence we conclude,
   that sterility had become most grievousand perpetual; for if the people
   had been only afflicted by famine for a few harvests or for one year,
   the Prophet would not have spoken thus. The famine must then have been,
   as it has been already stated for a long time. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:18

   18. How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because
   they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

   18. Quomodo ingemuit bestia? Confusa sunt armenta boum? Quia desunt
   illis pascua: etiam greges ovium desolati sunt.


   The Prophet amplifies his reproof, that even oxen as well as other
   animals felt the judgment of God. There is then here an implied
   comparison between the feeling of brute animals and the insensibility
   of the people, as though he said, "There is certainly more intelligence
   and reason in oxen and other brute animals than in you; for the herds
   groan, the flocks groan, but ye remain stupid and confounded. What does
   this mean?" We then see that the Prophet here compares the stupidity of
   the people with the feeling of animals, to make them more ashamed.

   How, he says, has the beast groaned? The question serves to show
   vehemence; for if he had said in the form of a narrative, that the
   animals groaned, that the cattle were confounded, and that the flocks
   perished, the Jews would have been less affected; but when he exclaims
   and, moved with astonishment, speaks interrogatively, How does the
   beast groan? He, no doubt, wished to produce an effect on the Jews,
   that they might perceive the judgment of God, which they had before
   passed by with their eyes closed, though it was quite manifest. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 1:19-20

   19. O Lord, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures
   of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the
   field.

   19. Ad te Jehovam clamabo, quia ignis consumpsit pascua (vel,
   habitacula) deserti: et flamma accendit omnes arbores agri.

   20. And the beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
   waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the
   wilderness.

   20. Etiam bestiae agri clamabunt ad te (quanquam rg proprium est cervi,
   ut dicunt grammatici, sicuti etiam Psalmo 42 habetur: est illic idem
   verbum: clamabunt igitur bestiae ad te,) quia aruerunt decursus
   aquarum, quia ignis consumpsit habitacula (vel, pascua) deserti.


   When the Prophet saw that he succeeded less than he expected, leaving
   the people, he speaks of what he would do himself, I will cry to thee,
   Jehovah. He had before bidden others to cry, and why does he not now
   press the same thing? Because he saw that the Jews were so deaf and
   listless as to make no account of all his exhortations: he therefore
   says, "I will cry to thee, Jehovah; for they are touched neither by
   shame nor by fear. Since they throw aside every regard for their own
   safety, since they account as nothing my exhortations I will leave
   them, and will cry to thee;" which means this, -- "I see, Lord, that
   all these calamities proceed from thy hand; I will not howl as profane
   men do, but I will ascribe them to thee; for I perceive thee to be
   acting as a judge in all the evils which we suffer." Having then before
   declared that the Jews were more tardy than brute animals and having
   reproached them for feeling less acutely than oxen and sheep, the
   Prophet now says, that though they all remained obstinate, he would yet
   do what a pious man and a worshipper of God ought to do, I will cry to
   thee -- Why? Because the fire has consumed the pastures, or the
   dwellings, of the wilderness.

   He here again gives an awful record of God's judgments. Though the heat
   may burn up whole regions, yet we know that pasture-lands do not soon
   wither, especially on mountains; and of such cold pastures he speaks
   here. We know that however great may be the fertility of mountains, yet
   coolness prevails there, and that, in the greatest drought, the
   mountainous regions are ever green. But the Prophet tells us here of an
   unusual thing, that the dwellings of the wilderness were burnt up. Some
   render n'vt naut pastures; others, dwellings: but as to the meaning, we
   may read either; for the Prophet refers here to cold and humid regions,
   which never want moisture in the greatest heats. Some render the word,
   the beautiful or fair spots of the wilderness, but improperly. He
   doubtless means pastures, or dwellings, or folds. The fire then has
   consumed the dwellings, or pastures of the wilderness. This was not
   usual; it did not happen according to the ordinary course of nature: it
   then follows that it was a miracle. This is the reason why the Prophet
   says, that it was now time to cry to God; for it did not appear to be
   fortuitous, that the heat had burnt up regions which were moist and
   well watered. The flame, he says hath burnt up all the trees of the
   field.

   He afterwards adds The beasts of the field will also cry (for the verb
   is in the plural number;) the beasts then will cry. The Prophet
   expresses here more clearly what he had said before that though the
   brute animals were void of reasons they yet felt God's judgment, so
   that they constrained men by their example to feel ashamed, for they
   cried to God: the beasts then of the field cry. He ascribes crying to
   them, as it is elsewhere ascribed to the young ravens. The young
   ravens, properly speaking, do not indeed call on God; and yet the
   Psalmist says so, and that, because they confess, by raising up their
   bills, that there is no supply for their want except God supports them.
   So also the Prophet mentions here the beasts as crying to God. It is
   indeed a figure of speech, called personification; for this could not
   be properly said of beasts. But when the beasts made a noise under the
   pressure of famine, was it not such a calling on God as their nature
   admitted? As much then as the nature of brute animals allows, they may
   be said to seek their food from the Lord, when they send forth
   lamentable cries and noises, and show that they are oppressed with
   famine and want. When, therefore, the Prophet attributes crying to
   beasts, he at the same time reproaches the Jews with their stupidity,
   that they did not call on God. "What do you mean," he says. "See the
   brute animals; they show to you what ought to be done; it is at least a
   teaching that ought to have effect on you. If I and the other prophets
   have lost all our labor, if God has in vain performed the office of a
   teacher among you, let the very oxen at least be your teachers; to whom
   indeed it is a shame to be disciples, but it is a greater shame not to
   attend to what they teach you; for the oxen by their example lead you
   to God."

   We now perceive how much vehemence there is in the Prophet's words,
   when he says, Even the beasts of the field will cry to God; for the
   streams of waters have dried up, and the fire has consumed the
   dwellings, or the pastures of the wilderness. He again teaches what I
   have lately stated, that sterility proceeded from the evident judgment
   of God, and that it ought to have struck dread into men, for it was a
   sort of miracle. When, therefore the courses of waters dried up on the
   mountains, how could it be deemed natural? 'phyqym aphikim mean courses
   of waters or valleys through which the waters run. The Prophet here
   refers, no doubt, to those regions which, through the abundance of
   water, always retain their fertility. When, therefore, the very valleys
   were burnt up, they ought surely to own that something wonderful had
   happened. On this account, he ascribes crying to herds and brute
   animals, and not any sort of crying, but that by which they called on
   God. What remains we shall defer till to-morrow.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees us to be surrounded with the
   infirmity of our flesh, and so held by, and, as it were, overwhelmed
   with, earthly cares, that we can hardly raise up our hearts and minds
   to thee, -- O grant, that being awaked by thy word and daily warnings,
   we may at length feel our evils, and that we may not only learn by the
   stripes thou inflictest on us, but also of our own accord, summon
   ourselves to judgment, and examine our hearts, and thus come to thy
   presence, being our own judges; so that we may anticipate thy
   displeasure, and thus obtain that mercy which thou best promised to
   all, who, turning only to thee, deprecate thy wrath, and also hope for
   thy favor, through the name of one Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Joel 2:1-11

   1. Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain:
   let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord
   cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

   1. Clangite tuba in Sion, et clamate (alii vertunt, tantarizate: sed
   est generale verbum: clamate igitur, vel, clamorem odite) in monte
   sancto meo: contremiscant omnes incolae terrae, quia venit dies
   Jehovae, quia propinquus est.

   2. A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
   darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and
   a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more
   after it, even to the years of many generations.

   2. Dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nubis et obscuritatis, sicut
   aurora expanditur super montes, populus magnus et robustus (vel,
   terribilis;) similis ei non fuit a seculo, et post eum, non addet (hoc
   est, non erit amplius) ad annos generationis et generationis (ego cogor
   uno contextu legere haec omnia; dicam postea suo loco rationem.)

   3. A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the
   land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
   wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

   3. Coram facie ejus (coram ipso) devorans ignis, et post eum exuret
   flamma: sicut hortus Eden terra coram ipso (ante faciem ejus ad
   verbum;) et post eum desertum solitudinis (vel, vastitatis;) adeoque
   evasio non erit ei.

   4. The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
   horsemen, so shall they run.

   4. Quasi aspectus equorum aspectus ejus, et tanquam equites current.

   5. Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap,
   like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a
   strong people set in battle array.

   5. Sicut vocem quadrigarum (sic mrkvvt interpretes vertunt: postea
   dicam de hoc verbo,) super cacumina montium saltabunt, secundum vocem
   flammae ignis vorantis stipulam, quasi populus robustus (vel,
   terribilis) paratus ad proelium.

   6. Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall
   gather blackness.

   6. A facie ejus pavebunt populi, omnes facies colligent nigredinem.

   7. They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men
   of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not
   break their ranks:

   7. Quasi gigantes (vel, fortes) discurrent, sicut viri proelii
   ascendent murum, et vir (hoc est, quisque in viis suis ambulabit, et
   non tardabunt gressus suos (alii, non inquirent de viis suis.)

   8. Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his
   path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

   8. Vir fratrem suum (hoc est, quisque socium suum) non premet, quisque
   in viis suis ambulabit: usque in gladium cadent (hoc est, super gladium
   cadent) non vulnerabuntur (alii, non concupiscent.)

   9. They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall,
   they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows
   like a thief.

   9. Per urbem gradientur, per murum discurrent, in domos ascendent,
   usque ad fenestras intrabunt tanquam fur.

   10. The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the
   sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their
   shining:

   10. Coram eo contremiscet terra, et angentur coeli; sol et luna
   nigrescent, et stellae retrahent splendorem suum.

   11. And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is
   very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of
   the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

   11. Et Jehova edet vocem suam coram exercitu suo, quia magna valde
   castra ejus: quia robustus qui facit (vel, exequitur) verbum ejus; quia
   magnus dies Jehovae, et terribilis valde, et quis sustinebit eum?


   This chapter contains serious exhortations, mixed with threatening; but
   the Prophet threatens for the purpose of correcting the indifference of
   the people, whom we have seen to have been very tardy to consider God's
   judgments. Now the reason why I wished to join together these eleven
   verses was, because the design of the Prophet in them is no other than
   to stir up by fear the minds of the people. The object of the narrative
   then is, to make the people sensible, that it was now no time for
   taking rest; for the Lord, having long tolerated their wickedness, was
   now resolved to pour upon them in full torrent his whole fiery. This is
   the sum of the whole. Let us now come to the words.

   Sound the trumpet, he says, in Zion; cry out in my holy mountain; let
   all the inhabitants of the earth tremble. The Prophet begins with an
   exhortation. We know, indeed that he alludes to the usual custom
   sanctioned by the law; for as on festivals trumpets were sounded to
   call the people, so also it was done when anything extraordinary
   happened. Hence the Prophet addresses not each individually; but as all
   had done wickedly, from the least to the greatest, he bids the whole
   assembly to be called, that they might in common own themselves to be
   guilty before God, and deprecate his vengeance. It is the same as
   though the Prophet had said that there was no one among the people who
   could exempt himself from blame, for iniquity had prevailed through the
   whole body. But this passage shows that when any judgment of God is
   impending, and tokens of it appear, this remedy ought to be used,
   namely, that all must publicly assemble and confess themselves worthy
   of punishments and at the same time flee to the mercy of God. This, we
   know, was, as I have already said, formerly enjoined on the people; and
   this practice has not been abolished by the gospel. And it hence
   appears how much we have departed from the right and lawful order of
   things; for at this day it would be new and unusual to proclaim a fast.
   How so? Because the greater part are become hardened; and as they know
   not commonly what repentance is, so they understand not what the
   profession of repentance means; for they understand not what sin is,
   what the wrath of God is, what grace is. It is then no wonder that they
   are so secure, and that when praying for pardon is mentioned, it is a
   thing wholly unknown at this day. But though people in general are thus
   stupid, it is yet our duty to learn from the Prophets what has always
   been the actual mode of proceeding among the people of God, and to
   labor as much as we can, that this may be known, so that when there
   shall come an occasion for a public repentance, even the most ignorant
   may understand that this practice has ever prevailed in the Church of
   God, and that it did not prevail through inconsiderate zeal of men, but
   through the will of God himself.

   But he bids the inhabitants of the land to tremble. By these words he
   intimates, that we are not to trifle with God by vain ceremonies but to
   deal with him in earnest. When therefore, the trumpets sound, our
   hearts ought to tremble; and thus the reality is to be connected with
   the outward signs. And this ought to be carefully noticed; for the
   world is ever disposed to have an eye to some outward service, and
   thinks that a satisfaction is given to God, when some external rite is
   observed. But we do nothing but mock God, when we present him with
   ceremonies, while there is no corresponding sincere feeling in the
   heart; and this is what we shall find handled in another place.

   The Prophet now adds threatening, that he might stir up the minds of
   the people: For coming, he says, is the day of Jehovah for nigh it is.
   By these words he first intimates that we are not to wait until God
   strikes us, but that as soon as he shows signs of his wrath, we ought
   to anticipate his judgment. When God then warns us of his displeasure,
   we ought instantly to solicit pardon: nigh, he says, is the day of
   Jehovah. What follows has a regard to the end which we have mentioned;
   for the Prophet paints the terrible judgment of God with the view of
   rousing minds wholly stupid and indifferent.

   And then he says, A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of
   clouds and of obscurity, as the dawn which expands over the mountains.
   By calling it a dark and gloomy day, he wished to show that there would
   be no hope of deliverance; for, according to the common usage of
   Scripture, we know that by light is designated a cheerful and happy
   state, or the hope of deliverance from any affliction: but the Prophet
   now extinguishes, as it were, every hope in this world, when he
   declares that the day of Jehovah would be dark, that is, without hope
   of restoration. This is his meaning. When he says afterwards, As the
   dawn which expands, etc., he mentions this to signify the celerity with
   which it would come; for we know how sudden is the rising of the dawn
   on the mountains: the dawn spreads in a moment on the mountains, where
   darkness was before. For the light penetrates not immediately either
   into valleys or even into plains; but if any one looks at the summits
   of mountains, he will see that the dawn rises quickly. It is then the
   settle as though the Prophet said, "The day of the Lord is nigh, for
   the Lord can suddenly stretch forth his hand, as the dawn spreads over
   the mountains."

   He then mentions its character, A people great and strong to whom there
   has not been the like from the beginning, or from ages and after whom
   there will be no more the like, to the years of a generation and a
   generation. Here the Prophet specifies the kind of judgment that would
   be, of which he had generally spoken before; and he shows that what he
   had hitherto recorded of God's vengeance ought not to be so understood
   as that God would descend openly and visibly from heaven, but that the
   Assyrians would be the ministers and executioners of his vengeance. In
   short, the Prophet shows here that the coming of that people ought to
   have been as much dreaded as if God had put forth his hand and executed
   on his people the vengeance deserved by their sins. And by these words
   he teaches us, that men gain nothing by being blind to the judgments of
   God; for God will notwithstanding execute his works and use the
   instrumentality of men; for men are the scourges by which he chastises
   his own people. The Chaldeans and the Assyrians were unbelievers; yet
   God used them for the purpose of correcting the Jews. This the Prophet
   now shows, that is, that God was the avenger in these very Assyrians,
   for he employed them as the ministers and executioners of his judgment.
   We see at the same time that the Prophet describes here the terrible
   wrath of God to shake off from the Jews their tardiness; for he saw
   that they were not moved by all his threatening, and ever laid hold on
   some new flattering pretenses. This is the reason why he gives such a
   long description.

   Before them, he says, the fire will devour, and after them the flame
   will burn. He means that the vengeance of God would be such as would
   consume the whole people: for God has in various ways begun to chastise
   the people, but, as we have seen, without any advantage. The Prophet
   then says here that the last stroke remained, and that the Lord would
   wholly destroy men so refractory, and whom he could not hitherto
   restore to a sound mind by moderate punishments. For he had in a
   measure spared them, though he had treated them sharply and severely,
   and given them time to repent. Hence, when the Prophet saw that they
   were wholly irreclaimable, he says, that it now only remained that the
   Lord should at once utterly consume them.

   He adds, As the garden of Eden the land is before them, and after them
   it is the land of solitude; and so (and also) there will be no escape
   from them. Here the Prophet warns the Jews, that though they inhabited
   a most pleasant country and one especially fruitful, there was no
   reason for them to flatter themselves, for God could convert the
   fairest lands into a waste. He therefore compares Judea to the garden
   of Eden or to Paradise. But such also was the state of Sodom, as Moses
   shows. What did it avail the Sodomites that they dwelt as in Paradise,
   that they inhabited a rich and fertile land, and thought themselves to
   be nourished as in the bosom of God? So also now the Prophet says,
   "Though the land is like Paradise, yet when the enemy shall march
   through it, a universal waste shall follow, a scattering shall
   everywhere follow, there shall be no cultivation, no pleasantness, no
   appearance of inhabited land, for the enemy will destroy every thing "
   His purpose was to prevent the Jews, by confiding in God's blessing,
   which they had hitherto experienced, from heedlessly disregarding in
   future his vengeance; for his wrath would in a moment consume and
   devour whatever fruitfulness the land had hitherto possessed. This is
   the meaning. He therefore concludes that there would be no escape from
   these enemies, the Assyrians, because they would come armed with a
   command to reduce to nothing the whole land.

   He afterwards adds many similitudes, which any one of himself can
   sufficiently understand: I shall not therefore be long in explaining
   them, and many words would be superfluous. As the appearance of horses
   their appearance, and as horsemen, so will they run. This verse sets
   forth again the suddenness of vengeance, as though the Prophet had
   said, that long distance would be no obstacle, for the Assyrians would
   quickly move and occupy Judea; for distance deceived the Jews, and they
   thought that there would be a long respite to them. Hence the Prophet
   here removes this vain confidence, when he says that they would be like
   horses and horsemen. He then adds, --

   Like the sound of chariots. They expound mrkvvt merecabut, chariots,
   though the Hebrews rather think them to be harnesses or saddles as we
   call them; but yet I prefer to view them as chariots; for what the
   Prophet says, that they shall leap on the tops of mountains like the
   sound of chariots, would not be suitably applied to the trappings of
   horses. They then shall leap on tops of mountains -- but how? as
   chariots, that is, they shall come with great force, or make a great
   and terrible noise. And he speaks of the tops of mountains for there we
   know the noise is greater when there is any commotion. The Prophet,
   therefore, does in every way amplify God's vengeance, that he might
   awaken the Jews, who by their indifference had too long provoked the
   Lord's wrath.

   Like the sound, he says, of the flame of fire, or of a fiery flame,
   devouring the stubble. He compares the Assyrians to a flame, which
   consumes all things; and he compares the Jews to stubble, though they
   thought themselves fortified by many forces and strongholds.

   At length he adds, As a strong people, prepared for battle; their face
   the people will dread, and all faces shall gather blackness. By these
   words the Prophet intimates that the Assyrians at their coming would be
   supplied with such power as would, by report only, lay prostrate all
   people. But if the Assyrians should be so formidable to all people,
   what could the Jews do? In short, the Prophet here shows that the Jews
   would by no means be able to resist enemies so powerful; for they would
   by their fame alone so lay prostrate all people, that none would dare
   to rise up against them. He then compares them to giants. As giants, he
   says, they will run here and there; as men of war they will climb the
   wall, and man (that is, every one) in his ways shall walk. The Prophet
   heaps together these various expressions, that the Jews might know that
   they had to do with the irresistible hand of God, and that they would
   in vain implore assistance here and there; for they could find no
   relief in the whole world, when God executed his vengeance in so
   formidable a manner. He says further, they shall not stop their goings,
   though some render the words, "They shall not inquire respecting their
   ways;" for he had said before, "They shall proceed in their ways:" then
   the meaning is, They shall not come like strangers, who, when they
   journey through unknown regions, make anxious inquiries, whether any be
   lying in wait, whether there be any turnings in the road, whether the
   ways be difficult and perplexed: They shall not inquire, he says; they
   shall securely proceed, as though the road was open to them, as though
   the whole country was known to them. This part also serves to show
   celerity, that the Jews might dread the vengeance of God the same as if
   it was quite nigh them.

   He then adds, A man shall not push his brother. By this mode of
   speaking the Prophet means that they would come in perfect order, so
   that the multitude would create no confusion, as it is mostly the case:
   for it is very difficult for an army to march in regular order without
   tumult, like two or three men walking together. For when a hundred
   horsemen march together some commonly hinder others. When therefore so
   large a number assemble together, it can hardly be possible for them
   not to retard and impede one another. But the Prophet declares that
   this would not be the case with the Assyrians, for the Lord would
   direct their goings. Though then the Lord would bring so large a
   multitude, it would yet be so well arranged and in such order, that no
   one would push his companion, or be any hindrance to him. A man, he
   says, shall in his way proceed, even without any impediment.

   And on swords they shall fall, and shall not be wounded: that is, they
   shall not only be strong men of war, so that they shall intrepidly face
   every kind of danger; but they shall also escape unhurt from all
   weapons; though they may rush on swords like madmen and show no care
   for themselves, they shall not yet be wounded. But this may be taken in
   a still simpler way, "They shall not be wounded" that is, as if they
   could not be wounded. And it seems to me to be the genuine sense of the
   Prophet, that they would not entertain any fear of death, so as
   cautiously to attack their enemies, but would with impunity provoke
   death itself by casting themselves on the very swords: they would not
   then fear any wound, but dare to face swords as if they were wholly
   harmless to them. Some render the word, "they shall not covet;" and
   then the word means as if the Prophet had said, that they would not be
   covetous of money. But this meaning can hardly suit this place; and we
   see that the best sense seems to be, that they would heedlessly rush on
   swords, as though they could not be wounded.

   It afterwards follows, Through the city shall they march; over the wall
   shall they run here and there; into houses shall they climb; through
   the windows shall they enter like a thief. The Prophet here shows that
   the Jews in vain trusted in their fortified cities, for the enemies
   would easily penetrate into them. They shall march, he says, through
   the city, that is, as though there were no gates to it. The meaning
   then is, that though Judea abounded in cities, which seemed impregnable
   and appeared sufficient to arrest the course of enemies, as it had
   happened almost always, so that great armies were forced to desist when
   any strong fortified city stood in their way; yet the Prophet says that
   cities would be no impediment to the Assyrians at their coming to
   Judea, for they would march through the city, as along a plain road,
   where no gates are closed against them. They shall then march through
   the midst of cities as through a plain or open fields. To the same
   purpose is what follows, They shall run here and there over the wall,
   he says. These are indeed hyperbolical words; yet, when we consider how
   slow men are to fear punishment, we must allow that the Prophet in
   these expressions does not exceed moderation. They shall then run up
   and down through the city; that is, "In vain you expect that there will
   be to you any rest or quietness, for ye think that you sill be able for
   a time to sustain the onsets of your enemies: This," he says, "will by
   no means be the case, for they shall run here and there over the wall,
   as though it were a plain. Besides, they shall climb into the houses,
   and enter in through the windows, and do this as a thief; that is,
   though there should be no hostile attack, yet they shall stealthily and
   secretly penetrate into your houses: when there will be a great tumult,
   when the whole regions shall meet in arms, and when ye will think
   yourselves able to resist, they will then as thieves quietly enter into
   your houses and come in through the windows, and ye shall not be able
   to close up the passage against them."

   Then he adds, Before their face shall the earth tremble, and in anguish
   shall be the heavens; the sun and the moon shall become dark, and the
   stars shall withdraw their brightness. The Prophet speaks here more
   hyperbolically; but we must ever remember that he addressed men
   extremely stupid: it then behaved him to speak in an unusual manner,
   that he might touch their feelings; for it avails nothing to speak in
   all ordinary way to perverse men, especially to those who have divested
   themselves of all shame, and whom Satan has fascinated, so that they
   fear nothing and grieve at nothing. When therefore each stupidity lays
   hold on the minds of men, God must thunder that his word may be heard.
   As then the listlessness of the people was monstrous, so it was
   necessary, so to speak, for the Prophet to utter monstrous words. This
   is the reason why he now says, Before their face (namely, that of the
   enemies) shall the land tremble; and then he adds, The heavens also
   shall be in anguish; not that the heavens would fear the Assyrians; but
   the Prophet intimates that such would be the vengeance, that it would
   terrify the whole world; and this he intimates, that the Jews might
   cease to expect any subterfuges, for they flattered themselves, as
   though they could fly on the clouds, or could find for themselves some
   hiding-places or some corners at a distance. The Prophet gives them to
   understand that the whole world would be full of horror, when the Lord
   would come furnished with his army. He speaks also of the sun and the
   moon; as though he said, "There will be no more any hope of aid from
   created things; for the vital light itself shall fail, when the Lord
   shall pour forth the flood of his fury: The sun and the moon, he says,
   shall become dark; and the stars shall withhold their brightness.
   Though then ye lift up your eyes, not even a spark of light will there
   be to comfort you, for darkness on every side will cover you; and ye
   shall know by heaven as well as by earth that God is angry with you.
   Here, in short, he shuts up against the Jews every avenue to hope; for
   not only the Assyrian will rage on earth, but God will also give signs
   of vengeance from heaven, so that the sun will be constrained to show
   such a sign, as well as the moon and all the stars.

   He at last adds, And Jehovah will utter his voice before his army. The
   Prophet seems in this verse to anticipate whatever objection men might
   adduce. "O! thou denounces on us great terrors, and as if the Assyrians
   were not to be counted as men, as if no other people were in the world,
   as if there was no other army, as if there were no other forces, as if
   none else had courage; but if the Assyrians are at this day formidable,
   they have yet neighbors who can gather a force sufficient easily to
   oppose them " And Egypt was then a populous country, and well
   fortified; and who would not have said that the Egyptians were equal to
   the Assyrians? and the Jews also thought themselves safe through a
   treaty with them. And then there was Syria; and there were many
   kingdoms, with which the Jews might have boasted that they were
   surrounded, so that no access to them was open to the Assyrians; for
   however insufficient were the people of Moab or the people of Amman,
   yet they were all joined together, even Edom, and Ammon, and Moab: and
   then Tyrus and Sidon, and the many neighboring kingdoms, might
   certainly have been sufficient to resist the Assyrians. Now, that no
   one might object all this, the Prophet shortly anticipates it by
   saying, that God would be the leader of his army; as though he had
   said, "I have already declared this to be the hand of God: for the
   Assyrians will not come here of their own accord; that is, without
   being stirred up by God: but as this truth has not as yet sufficiently
   moved your feelings, know that God will be the leader of this army: God
   will send forth his voice before his army." Here he distinctly calls
   the Assyrians the attendants of God; they shall not then come as
   soldiers hired by their own king, they shall not come as carrying on
   war for an earthly king, but the Lord himself shall guide them, and by
   his voice encourage them. By this expression the Prophet shows that the
   Jews would not have a contest with one nation only, but also with God
   himself and with all his celestial power.

   He therefore says, God will utter his voice before his army; for very
   great will be his camp. He again repeats that the multitude which was
   to execute the biddings of God would be so great, that the Jews would
   seek forces in vain to resist it. Strong, he says, is he who executes
   his word. He expresses more clearly what I have stated already, that
   though cupidity impelled the Assyrians, that though they were intent on
   rapine and plunder, yet they would not come merely through an impulse
   of their own, but that the Lord would prepare them and use them as his
   instruments: "Powerful, then, is he who does the word of God; that is,
   who executes his command; not that the Assyrians designed to show
   regard to God or to offer to him their service, as the faithful do, who
   willingly devote themselves to Him; but that the Lord by his secret
   providence guided them and employed them to punish his own people.

   He afterwards adds in the last place, For great will be the day of
   Jehovah and terrible, and who will endure it? In this clause he shows
   that the vengeance would be such as would reduce the Jews to nothing,
   and that it was now time to repent, and that if they still turned a
   deaf ear to what the Prophet denounces, God would punish their
   perverseness.

   Now with regard to what he says, that strong is he who does the word of
   God, we have elsewhere reminded you that men serve God in two ways, --
   they either execute his commands willingly, or are led to do so by a
   blind impulse. The angels and the faithful perform God's commands,
   because they are guided by the spirit of obedience; but the wicked
   also, and the devil who is their head, fulfill God's biddings; this,
   however, is not to be imputed to them as obedience, for they are only
   led by their own wicked purposes, and seek to destroy, as far as they
   can, the whole government of God; but they are constrained, willing or
   unwilling, to obey God, not of their own accord or willingly, as I have
   said, but the Lord turns all their efforts to answer the end which he
   has decreed. Whatever, then, Satan and the wicked attempt to do, they
   at the same time serve God and obey his commands; and though they rage
   against God, he yet holds them in by his bridle, and also so guides
   their attempts and their purposes as to answer his own ends. In this
   sense, then, it is, that Joel says, that the Assyrians would do the
   word of God; not that it was their purpose to obey God, not that God
   had commanded them anything, but he puts the word of the Lord here for
   his secret purpose. As, then, the wicked perform no voluntary obedience
   to God, but constrained, when they execute God's commands; so there is
   a twofold command or word of God: there is the command by which he
   teaches his own children and leads them to obey him; and there is
   another, a hidden command, when he deigns not to address men, and shows
   not what pleases him or what he means to do, but suffers them to be led
   by their own sinful desires; in the meantime, he has his own secret
   purpose, which by them he executes though without their intention.

   Prayer.

   Grant, almighty God, that as thou invites us daily with so much
   kindness and love, and makes known to us thy paternal goodwill, which
   thou didst once show to us in Christ thy Son, -- O grant, that, being
   allured by thy goodness, we may surrender ourselves wholly to thee, and
   become so teachable and submissive, that wherever thou guidest us by
   thy Spirit thou mayest follow us with every blessing: let us not, in
   the meantime, be deaf to thy warnings; and whenever we deviate from the
   right way, grant that we may immediately awake when thou warnest us,
   and return to the right path, and deign thou also to embrace us and
   reconcile us to thyself through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Joel 2:12-13

   12. Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all
   your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:

   12. Atque etiam nunc dicet Jehova, convertimini ad me in toto corde
   vestro, et in jejunio, et in fletu, et in planctu.

   13. And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord
   your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
   kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

   13. Et scindite cor vestrum, et non vestimenta vestra, et convertimini
   ad Jehovam Deum vestrum, quia ipse propitius et misericors, longus ad
   iram, et multus clementia, et poenitebit eum super malo.


   The Prophet, having proclaimed the dreadful judgment which we have
   noticed, now shows that he did not intend to terrify the people without
   reason, but, on the contrary, to encourage them to repentance; which he
   could not do without offering to them the hope of pardon; for as we
   have said before, and as it may be collected from the whole of
   Scripture, men cannot be restored to the right ways except they
   entertain a hope of God's mercy inasmuch as he who has been ungodly,
   when he despairs, wholly disregards himself, observing no restraint.
   Hence the Prophet now represents God as propitious and merciful, that
   he might thus kindly allure the people to repentance.

   He says first, [3]And even now the Lord says, Turn ye to me. The
   Prophet exhorts the people, not in his own name, but speaks in the
   person of God himself. He might indeed have borne witness to the favor
   which he proclaimed; but the discourse becomes more striking by
   introducing God as the speaker. And there is a great importance in the
   words, even now; for when one considers what we have noticed in the
   beginning of the chapter, a prospect of relief could hardly have been
   deemed possible. God had, indeed, in various ways, tried to restore the
   people to the right way; but, as we have seen, the greater part had
   become so void of feeling, that the scourges of God were wholly
   ineffectual; there remained, then, nothing but the utter destruction
   which the Prophet threatened them with at the beginning of the second
   chapter. Yet, in this state of despair, he still sets forth some hope
   of mercy, provided they turned to him; even now, he says. The particles
   vgm ugam are full of emphasis, "even now" that is, "Though ye have too
   long abused God's forbearance, and with regard to you, the opportunity
   is past, for ye have closed the door against yourselves; yet even now,
   -- which no one could have expected, and indeed what ought to be
   thought incredible by yourselves, -- even now God waits for you, and
   invites you to entertain hope of salvation." But it was necessary that
   these two particles, even now, should be added; for it is not in the
   power of men to fix for themselves, as they please, the season for
   mercy. God here shows the acceptable time, as Isaiah says (Isaiah 49:8)
   to be, when he has not yet rejected men, but when he offers to be
   propitious. We must then remember that the Prophet gives not here
   liberty to men to delay the time, as the profane and scorners are wont
   to do, who trifle with God from day to day; but the Prophet here shows
   that we must obey the voice of God, when he invites us, as also Isaiah
   says, Behold now the time accepted, behold the day of salvation: seek
   God now, for he is near; call on him while he may be found.' So then,
   as I have reminded you, these two particles, even now, are added, that
   men may be made attentive to the voice of God when he invites them,
   that they may not delay till tomorrow, for the Lord may then close the
   door, and repentance may be too late. We at the same time see how
   indulgently God bears with men, since he left a hope of pardon to a
   people so obstinate and almost past recovery.

   Even now, he says, turn ye to me with your whole heart. The Prophet
   here reminds us that we must not act feignedly with God; for men are
   ever disposed to trifle with him. We indeed see what almost the whole
   world is wont to do. God graciously meets us and is ready to receive us
   unto favor, though we have a hundred times alienated ourselves from
   him; but we bring nothing but hypocrisy and disguise: hence the Prophet
   declares here distinctly, that this dissimulation does not please God,
   and that they can hide nothing, who only pretend some sort of
   repentance by external signs, and that what is required is the serious
   and sincere feeling of the heart. This is what he means by the whole
   heart; not that perfect repentance can be formed in men, but the whole
   or complete heart is opposed to a divided heart: for men well
   understand that God is not ignorant; yet they divide their heart, and
   when they bestow some portion on God, they think that he is satisfied;
   and in the meantime there remains an interior and some hidden
   perverseness, which separates them far from God. This vice the Prophet
   now condemns, when he says, Turn with the whole heart. He then shows
   that it is an hypocrisy abominable to God, when men keep the greater
   part of their heart, as it were, closed up, and think it enough, if
   only they bring, so to speak, some volatile feeling.

   He afterwards adds, fasting, and weeping, and mourning; and by these
   words he shows how grievously they had sinned; as though he said, that
   they deserved not only one kind of destruction, but were worthy of
   hundred deaths; that God therefore would not now be content with any
   common repentance, and except they came suppliantly and deeply felt
   their own guilt. It is indeed true, that we ought daily and even
   constantly to sigh, because we continue almost every hour to provoke
   God's wrath against us; but the Prophet here speaks of solemn fasting,
   because the people had so grievously offended God that there was
   required some extraordinary confession, such as he here describes. Come
   then to me with fasting, and weeping, and wailing" that is "Show at
   length that you are guilty and submissively deprecate the vengeance
   which ye have through your wickedness deserved." He speaks like a
   judge, when he tells the criminal, not to act dissemblingly, but simply
   to confess his fault. The guilty are indeed wont to weave many excuses
   to avoid punishment; but when the judge deems a man guilty, and he is
   abundantly proved to be so, he says, "What good can you do? for these
   your shuffling and subterfuges make your case worse: for now I hold you
   bound, and you cannot escape by these shifts, and will only the more
   provoke my displeasure. If then you wish me to show you favor, own how
   grievously you have offended, and without any coloring; confess now
   that you are worthy of death, and that nothing else remains for you,
   except I mercifully pardon you: for if you try to extenuate your crime,
   if you attempt by some excuse to seek reprief, you will gain nothing."
   So now does the Lord deal with this people: Turn to me, he says; first,
   sincerely; then with fasting, with weeping, and with wailing; that is,
   "Let it appear that you suppliantly deprecate the destruction which ye
   have deserved, for moderate repentance will not do, inasmuch as ye are
   guilty before me of so many crimes." We now apprehend the Prophet's
   meaning.

   He then subjoins, Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to
   Jehovah your God. The Prophet again repeats that we ought to deal
   sincerely with God; for all those ceremonies, by which men imagine that
   they discharge their duties, are mere mockeries, when they are not
   preceded by a pure and sincere heart. But as they were wont under
   mournful circumstances to rend their garments, he therefore says, "God
   has become now insensible to these customs; for with regard to men, ye
   are ceremonious enough, and more than enough: ye indeed rend your
   garments, and thus draw pity from men, and yet your heart remains
   whole, there is no rending, no opening; Rend then your heart," that is,
   "Leave off thus to mock God, as ye have been wont to do, and begin with
   your heart." It is indeed certain that the orientals were given to many
   ceremonies; but the vice the Prophet here condemns in the Jews is
   natural as it were to all men; so that every one of us is inclined to
   hypocrisy, and has need of having his attention drawn to the sincerity
   of the heart. We must then remember that this truth is to be set forth
   at all times and to all nations. Let any one search himself and he will
   find that he labors under this evil, -- that he would rather reed his
   garment than his heart. And since the Jews usually observed this
   custom, the Prophet does not without reason deride it, and say, that it
   was of no account with God except they rent their hearts. But when he
   bids them to rend their hearts and not their garments, though he seems
   to repudiate that external practice, he does not yet distinctly condemn
   it, but intimates that it was a lawful thing, provided the heart was
   rent. Now this expression, Rend the heart, ought not to be deemed
   harsh, for it is to be referred to the external practice: when they
   rent the garments, they made themselves naked before God and put off
   all ornaments; but he wished them to be displeased with themselves, and
   rather to make bare the heart itself. The heart of hypocrites, we know,
   is wrapped up, and they ever have recourse to hiding places, that they
   may avoid the presence of God. Then the similitude is most suitable,
   when the Prophet bids them to rend the heart. Besides, the passage is
   clear enough, and needs not many remarks; it means, that God regards
   the real feeling of the heart, as it is said in Jeremiah [4:14]; he is
   not content with ocular obedience, such as men exhibit, but he would
   have us to deal with him in sincerity and truth.

   Hence he repeats again, Turn to Jehovah your God. Here the Prophet
   shows, from what God is, that men foolishly and grossly deceive
   themselves when they would please God with their ceremonies: "What!" he
   says, "have you to do with a child?" For the import of the words is
   this, -- "When an offense against man is to be removed, ye anxiously
   come to him: now when ye perceive that God is angry with you, ye think
   that he will be propitious to you, if ye only trifle with him; can God
   bear such a reproach?" We hence see what the Prophet means when he
   says, Turn to Jehovah your God; that is, "Remember that you have not to
   do with a block of wood or with a stone, but with your God, who
   searches hearts, and whom mortals can by no crafts deceive " The same
   is said by Jeremiah, Israel, if thou turnest, turn to me,' (Jeremiah
   4:1;) that is, "Pretend not to turn by circuitous courses and windings,
   but come in a direct way, and with a real feeling of heart, for I am he
   who calls thee " So also now the Prophet says, Turn to Jehovah your God

   Then follows the promise of pardon, [4]For he is propitious and
   merciful. We have already said that repentance is preached in vain,
   except men entertain a hope of salvation; for they can never be brought
   to fear God truly, unless they trust in him as their Father, as it is
   stated in Psalm 130:4 With thee is propitiation that thou mayest be
   feared.' Hence, whenever the Prophets were anxious to effect anything
   by their doctrine, while exhorting the people to repentance, they
   joined to the invitation "Come," the second part, "Ye shall not come in
   vain." This "Come," comprehends all exhortations to repentance; "Ye
   shall not come in vain," includes this testimony respecting God's
   grace, that He will never reject miserable sinners, provided they
   return to him with the heart. The Prophet then now engaged on this
   second head; God, he says, is propitious and merciful. And this
   connection is to be observed by us; for as Satan fills us with
   insensibility when God invites us, so also he draws us away into
   despair when God denounces judgment, when he shows that it is not time
   for sleep. "What good will you gain?" Thus Satan by his craft
   disheartens us, that we may labor in vain, when we seek to be
   reconciled to God. Hence, whenever Scripture exhorts us to repentance,
   let us learn to join this second part, "God invites us not in vain." If
   then we return to him, he will be instantly inclined to grant
   forgiveness; for he wills not that miserable men should labor in vain
   or be tormented. This is the benefit of which the Prophet speaks when
   he says that God is propitious and merciful.

   He afterwards adds, that he is slow to wraths and abundant in goodness.
   These testimonies respecting God occur often in other places; and all
   the Prophets, as well as David, have borrowed these declarations from
   Exodus 34:6; where the nature of God is described; and He is said there
   to be propitious and merciful, slow to wrath, and abundant in goodness.
   Though there is no need of dwelling longer on these words, as we
   perceive the Prophet's design; yet more extended remarks will not be
   superfluous since the Prophet so much at large recommends the mercy of
   God. Though men too much indulge themselves in security, yet when God
   calls them to himself, they are not able to receive his favor; though
   he may testify twice or thrice that he will be propitious to them, yet
   he cannot persuade them but with great difficulty. This is the reason
   why the Prophet, after having said that God is propitious and merciful,
   adds, that he is slow to wrath, and abundant in goodness; it was, that
   the Jews might overcome their distrust, and that however much despair
   might keep them back, they might not yet hesitate to come to God,
   seeing that he declares himself to be so merciful.

   He at last adds, He will repent of the evil. The Prophet here not only
   describes the nature of God, but goes further and says, that God, who
   is by nature placable, will not remain fixed in his purpose, when he
   sees people returning to him in sincerity; but that he suffers himself
   to be turned to show favor, so as to remit the punishment which he had
   previously denounced. And it is a mode of speaking which often occurs
   in Scripture, that God repents of evil; not that he really changes his
   purpose, but this is said according to the apprehensions of men: for
   God is in himself immutable, and is said to turn from his, purpose,
   when he remits to man the punishment he has previously threatened.
   Whatever proceeds from God's mouth ought to be regarded as an
   inviolable decree; and yet God often threatens us conditionally, and
   though the condition be not expressed it is nevertheless to be
   understood: but when he is pacified to us and relaxes the punishment,
   which was in a manner already decreed according to the external word,
   he is then said to repent. And we know, that as we do not apprehend God
   such as he is, he is therefore described to us in such a way as we can
   comprehend, according to the measure of our infirmity. Hence God often
   puts on the character of men, as though he were like them; and as this
   mode of speaking is common, and we have spoken of it elsewhere, I now
   pass it by more briefly. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:14

   14. Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
   behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord
   your God?

   14. Quis novit an revertatur et poeniteat eum, et relinquat post se
   (alii vertunt, post eum; ego tamen malo sic transferre, Relinquat post
   se) benedictionem, oblationem et libamen Jehovae Deo vestro?


   The Prophet seems at first sight to leave men here perplexed and
   doubtful; and yet in the last verse, as we have seen, he had Offered a
   hope of favor, provided they sincerely repented. Hence the Prophet
   seems not to pursue the same subject, but rather to vary it: and we
   have already said, that all exhortations would be frigid, nay, useless,
   by which God stirs us up to repentance, except he were to testify that
   he is ready to be reconciled. Seeing then that the Prophet here leaves
   the minds of men in suspense, he seems to rescind what he has before
   alleged respecting God's mercy. But we must understand that this is a
   mode of speaking which often occurs in Scripture. For wherever God is
   set forth to us as one hardly willing to pardon, it is done to rouse
   our slothfulness, and also to shake off our negligence. We are at first
   torpid when God invites us, except he applies his many goads; and then
   we act formally in coming to him: it is hence needful that both these
   vices should be corrected in us, -- our torpor must be roused, -- and
   those self-complacences, in which we too much indulge ourselves, must
   be shaken off. And this is the object of the Prophet; for he addresses,
   as we have seen, men almost past recovery. If he had only said, God is
   ready to pardon, if he had used this way of speaking, they would have
   come negligently, and would not have been sufficiently touched by the
   fear of God: hence the Prophet here, as it were, debates the matter
   with them, "Even though we ought justly to despair of pardon, (for we
   are unworthy of being received by God,) yet there is no reason why we
   should despair; for who knows" which means "God is placable and we must
   not despair."

   The Prophet then sets forth here the difficulty of obtaining pardon,
   not to leave men in suspense, for this would be contrary to his former
   doctrine; but to create in them a desire for the grace of God, that
   they might by degrees gather courage, and yet not immediately rise to
   confidence, but that they might come anxiously to God, and with much
   deliberation, duly considering their offenses. We now understand the
   purpose of the Prophet.

   But this will be easier understood by supposing two gradations in
   repentance. Then the first step is, when men feel how grievously they
   have offended. Here sorrow is not to be immediately removed after the
   manner of impostors, who cajole the consciences of men, so that they
   indulge themselves, and deceive themselves, with empty self-flatteries.
   For the physician does not immediately ease pain, but considers what is
   more necessary: it may be he will increase it, for a thorough clearing
   may be needful. So also do the Prophets of God, when they observe
   trembling consciences, they do not immediately apply soothing
   consolations, but on the contrary show that they ought not, as we have
   already said, to trifle with God, and exhort them while willingly
   running to God, to set before them his terrible judgment, that they may
   be more and more humbled. The second step is, when the Prophets cheer
   the minds of men, and show that God now willingly meets them, and
   desires nothing more than to see men willing to be reconciled to him.

   The Prophet is now urging them to take the first step, when he says,
   Who knows whether the Lord will turn? But some may object and say,
   "Then the Prophet has spoken inconsistently; for first he has described
   God as merciful, and has spoken of his goodness without any reserve;
   and then he throws in a doubt: he seems here to observe no
   consistency." I answer, that the Prophets of God do not always very
   anxiously hold to what seems consistent in their discourses; and
   farther, that the Prophet has not spoken here in vain or
   inconsiderately; for he, in the first place, generally sets forth God
   as merciful, and afterwards addresses particularly a people who were
   almost past recovery, and says, "Though ye think that it is all over
   with you as to your salvation, and ye deserve to be rejected by God,
   yet ye ought not to continue in this state; rather entertain a hope of
   pardon " This is what the Prophet had in view; he throws in no doubt,
   so as to make the sinner uncertain, whether or not he could obtain
   pardons; but as I have said, he wished only to rouse torpidity, and
   also to shake off vain self-flatteries.

   He then adds, And leave after him a blessing. We here see more clearly
   what I have already said, that the Prophet, considering the state of
   those whom he addressed, states a difficulty; for the Jews were not to
   escape temporary punishment, and the Prophet did not intend to dismiss
   them in a secure state, as though God would inflict on them no
   punishment; nay, he wished to bend their necks that they might receive
   the strokes of God, and calmly submit to his correction. But all hope
   might have been lost, when the Jews saw, that though the Prophet had
   declared that God would be propitious, they were yet not spared, but
   suffered severe punishment for their sins, -- "What does this mean? Has
   God then disappointed us? We hoped that he would be propitious, and yet
   he ceases not to be angry with us." Hence the Prophet now subjoins,
   [5]Who knows whether he will leave behind him a blessing?

   What is this -- behind him? What does it mean? Even this, that as God
   was to be a severe judge to punish the people's wickedness, the Prophet
   now says, "Though God beats you with his rods, he can yet relieve you
   by administering comfort. Ye indeed think that you are beaten almost to
   death; but the Lord will temperate his wrath, so that a blessing will
   follow these most grievous punishments " We now, then, understand the
   purpose of the Prophet: for he does not simply promise pardon to the
   Jews, but mitigates the dread of punishment, that is, that though God
   would chastise them, he would yet give place to mercy. Then God will
   leave behind him a blessing; that is "These strokes shall not be
   incurable " And this admonition is very necessary, whenever God deals
   severely with us; for when we feel his wrath, we then think that there
   is no grace remaining. It is then not without reason that the Prophet
   says, that God leaves behind him a blessing; which means, that when he
   shall pass by us with his rod, he will yet restrain his severity, so
   that some blessing will remain.

   He afterwards adds, mnchh vnsk lyhvh 'lhykm meneche unesac laIeuve
   Aleicam, an offering and a libation, he says, to Jehovah your God. This
   has been designedly added, that the Jews might entertain more hope. For
   with regard to them, they had deserved to be wholly exterminated a
   hundred times; yea, they deserved to pine away utterly through famine:
   but the Prophet intimates here, that God would have a regard for his
   own glory and his worship. "Though," he says, "we have deserved to
   perish by famine, yet God will be moved by another consideration, even
   this, -- that there may be some offering, that there may be some
   libation in the temple: since then God has chosen us a people to
   himself, and has required the first-fruits to be offered to him, and
   has consecrated for himself all our provision and all our produce in
   the first-fruits, and also in the daily offerings, though he has now
   resolved to consume us with famine and want, yet that his worship may
   continue, he will make the land fruitful to us, corn and wine will yet
   be produced for us," But the Prophet does not mean that there would
   only be so much corn as would be enough for offerings, or only so much
   wine as would be sufficient for libations; but he means, as I have
   already said, that though God would not provide for the safety of the
   people, he would yet have a regard for his own glory. God required the
   corn and the wine to be offered to him, not that he needed them, but
   because he consecrated to himself our provision. As then he would have
   the food and provisions, on which we live, to be sacred to him, he will
   not allow them wholly to fail. "God will yet surely pity us, and he
   will pity us, because he has deigned to choose us a people to himself,
   and so to join us with himself, that he wishes to eat, as it were, with
   us." For God seemed then to partake, as it were, of the same table with
   his people; for the law required bread or the ears of corn, and also
   wine, to be offered to God: not that he, as I have said, needed such
   supports; but that he might show that he had all things in common with
   his people. This communion then, or fellow-participation of God with
   his chosen people, gave them more hope; and this is what the Prophet
   had in view.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest us so foolish in nourishing our
   vices, and also so ensnared by the gratifications of the flesh, that
   without being constrained we hardly return to thee, -- O grant, that we
   may feel the weight of thy wrath, and be so touched with the dread of
   it, as to return gladly to thee, laying aside every dissimulation, and
   devote ourselves so entirely to thy service, that it may appear that we
   have from the heart repented, and that We have not trifled with thee by
   an empty pretense, but have offered to thee our hearts as a sacrifice,
   so that we and all our works might be sacred offerings to thee through
   our whole life, that thy name may be glorified in us through Christ our
   Lord. Amen.

   Joel 2:15-17

   15. Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:

   15. Clangite tuba in Sion, sanctificate jejunium, indicite conventum:

   16. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders,
   gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the
   bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.

   16. Colligite populum, sanctificate coetum, coedunate senes, colligite
   parvulos et sugentes ubera, et egrediatur sponsus e penetrali suo et
   sponsa e thalamo suo.

   17. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch
   and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not
   thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them:
   wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?

   17. Inter atrium et altare plorent sacerdotes, ministri Jehovae, et
   dicant, Propitius esto Jehova super populum tuum; et ne des
   haereditatem tuam in opprobrium, ut dominentur super eos gentes: cur
   dicent in populis, Ubi est Deus corum?


   Here again the Prophet reminds them that there was need of deep
   repentance; for not only individuals had transgressed, but the whole
   people had become guilty before God; and we also know how many and
   grievous their sins had been. There is no wonder then that the Prophet
   requires a public profession of repentance.

   He bids them first to sound the trumpet in Zion. This custom, as we
   have seen at the beginning of the chapter, was in common use under the
   Law; they summoned their meetings by the sound of trumpets. There is
   then no doubt but that the Prophet here refers to an extraordinary
   meeting. They sounded the trumpets whenever they called the people to
   the festivals. But it must have been unusual for the Jews to proclaim a
   fast on account of God's heavy judgment, which was to come on them
   unless it was prevented. He then shows the purpose of this, bidding
   them to sanctify a fast By this word qds kodesh, he means a
   proclamation for a holy purpose. Sanctify, then a fast, that is,
   Proclaim a fast in the name of God.

   We slightly touched on the subject of fasting in the first chapter, but
   deferred a fuller discussion to this place. Fasting, we know, is not of
   itself a meritorious work, as the Papists imagine it to be: there is,
   indeed, strictly speaking, no work meritorious. But the Papists dream
   that fasting, in addition to its merit and worth, is also by itself of
   much avail in the worship of God; and yet fasting, when regarded in
   itself is an indifferent work. [5] It is not then approved by God,
   except for its end; it must be connected with something else, otherwise
   it is a vain thing. Men, by private fastings prepare themselves for the
   exercise of prayer, or they mortify their own flesh, or seek a remedy
   for some hidden vices. Now I do not call fasting temperance; for the
   children of God, we know, ought through their whole life to be sober
   and temperate in their habits; but fasting, I regard that to be, when
   something is abstracted from our moderate allowance: and such a fast,
   when practiced privately, is, as I have said, either a preparation for
   the exercise of prayer, or a means to mortify the flesh, or a remedy
   for some vices.

   But as to a public fast, it is a solemn confession of guilt, when men
   suppliantly approach the throne of God, acknowledge themselves worthy
   of death, and yet ask pardon for their sins. Fasting then, with regard
   to God, is similar to black and mean garments and a long beard before
   earthly judges. The criminal goes not before the judge in a splendid
   dress, with all his fine things, but casts away every thing that was
   before elegant in his appearance, and by his uncombed hair and long
   beard he tries to excite the compassion of his judge. There is, at the
   same time, another reason for fasting; for when we have to do with men,
   we wish to please their eyes and conciliate their favor; and he who
   fasts, not only testifies openly that he is guilty, but he also reminds
   himself of his guilt; for as we are not sufficiently touched by the
   sense of God's wrath, those aids are useful which help to excite and
   affect us. He then who fasts, excites himself the more to penitence.

   We now perceive the right use of fasting. But it is of public fasting
   that the Prophet speaks here. For what purpose? That the Jews, whom he
   had before summoned, might present themselves before God's tribunal,
   and that they might come there, not with vain excuses, but with humble
   prayer. This is the design of fasting. We now see how foolishly the
   Papists have abused fasting; for they think it to be a meritorious
   work; they imagine that God is honored by abstinence from meat; they
   also mention those benefits of fasting to which I have referred; but
   they join fasts with festivals, as if there was some religion in
   abstaining from flesh or certain meats. We now then perceive by what
   gross puerilities the Papists trifle with God. We must then carefully
   notice the end in view, whenever the Scripture speaks of fasting; for
   all things will be confounded, except we lay hold on the principle
   which I have stated -- that fasting ought ever to be connected with its
   end. We shall now proceed.

   Proclaim, he says, a meeting tsrh otsare is not properly an assembly,
   but the deed itself: [6] hence also the word is transferred to
   festivals. Proclaim, then, a meeting, call the people, sanctify the
   assembly. The word, sanctify, seems to be taken here in a sense
   different from what it had been before. The people, in order to engage
   in holy services, performed those rites, as it is well known, by which
   they cleansed themselves from their pollutions. No one entered the
   temple without washing; and no one offered a sacrifice without
   abstaining from an intercourse with his wife. The Prophet then alludes
   to these legal purgations when he says Sanctify the assembly.

   He afterwards adds, Bring together the old, gather the young sucking
   the breasts. With regard to the old, we have said before that they are
   separately named, because they ought to have taken the lead by their
   example; and further a greater guilt belonged to them, for we know that
   it is a duty incumbent on the old to govern others, and, as it were, to
   hold the reins. But when the old themselves become dissolute, and
   restrain not the lusts of the young, they are doubly culpable before
   God. It is no wonder then that the Prophet bids here the old to be
   called; for it became them to be the leaders of others in confessing
   their repentance. But what follows seems strange. He would have the
   young, sucking the breasts, to be assembled. Why are these brought in
   as involved in guilt? Besides, the people were to own their repentance;
   and yet infants are without understanding and knowledge; so that they
   could not humble themselves before God. It must, then, have been a
   mockery and a vain show; nay, the Prophet seems to encourage the people
   in hypocrisy by bidding young infants to assemble together with men and
   women. To this I answer, that children ought to have been brought
   together, that those grown up and advanced in years might through them
   perceive what they deserved; for the wrath of God, we know, reached to
   the very infants, yea, and to brute animals: when God puts forth his
   hand to punish any people, neither asses nor oxen are exempt from the
   common scourge. Since, then, God's wrath comes upon brute animals and
   upon young infants, it is no wonder that the Lord bids all to come
   forth publicly and to make a confession of repentance; and we see the
   same to have been the case with brute animals; and when, if the Lord
   grants, we shall come to [6]the Prophet Jonah, we shall then speak on
   this subject. The Ninevites, when they proclaimed a fast, not only
   abstained themselves from meat and drink, but constrained also their
   oxen and horses to do the same. Why? Because the very elements were
   involved, as it were, with them in the same guilt: "Lord, we have
   polluted the earth; whatever we possess we have also polluted by our
   sins; the oxen the horses, and the asses, are in themselves innocent,
   but they have contracted contagion from our vices: that we may
   therefore obtain mercy, we not only offer ourselves suppliantly before
   thy face, but we bring also our oxen and horses; for if thou exercises
   the fullest severity against us, thou wilt destroy whatever is in our
   possession." So also now, when the Prophet bids infants to be brought
   before God, it is done on account of their parents. Infants were in
   themselves innocent with regard to the crimes of which he speaks; but
   yet the Lord could have justly destroyed the infants together with
   those of advanced age. It is then no wonder that in order to pacify
   God's wrath the very infants are summoned with the rest: but as I have
   already said, the reason is on account of their parents, that the
   parents themselves might perceive what they deserved before God, and
   that they might the more abhor their sins by observing that God would
   take vengeance on their children, except he was pacified. For they
   ought to have reasoned from the less to the greater: "See, if God
   exercises his own right towards us, there is destruction not only
   hanging over us, but also over our children; if they are guilty through
   our crimes, what can we say of ourselves, who are the authors of these
   evils? The whole blame belongs to us; then severe and dreadful will be
   God's vengeance on us, except we be reconciled to him."

   We now then perceive why infants were called, together with their
   parents; not that they might confess their penitence, as that was not
   compatible with their age, but that their parents might be more moved,
   and that such a sight might touch their feelings, and that dread might
   also seize them on seeing that their children were doomed to die with
   them for no other reason, but that by their contagion and wickedness
   they had infected the whole land and everything that the Lord had
   bestowed on them.

   He afterwards subjoins, Let the bridegroom go from his closet, or
   recess, and the bride from her chamber. It is the same as though the
   Prophet had bidden every joy to cease among the people; for it was of
   itself no evil to celebrate nuptials; but it behooved the people to
   abstain from every rejoicing on seeing the wrath of God now suspended
   over them. Hence, things in themselves lawful ought for a time to be
   laid aside when God appears angry with us; for it is no season for
   nuptials or for joyful feasts, when God's wrath is kindled, when the
   darkness of death spreads all around. No wonder, then, that the Prophet
   bids the bridegroom and the bride to come forth from their chamber,
   that is, to cast aside every joy, and to defer their nuptials to a more
   suitable time, and now to undergo their delights, for the Lord appeared
   armed against all. It would have been then to provoke, as it were, His
   wrath, to indulge heedlessly in pleasures, when he wished not only to
   terrify, but almost to frighten to death those who had sinned; for when
   the Lord threatens vengeance, what else is indifference but a mockery
   of his power? "I have called you to weeping and wailing; but ye have
   said, We will feast:' as I live, saith the Lord, this iniquity shall
   never be blotted out." We see how extremely displeased the Lord appears
   there to be with those who, having been called to weeping and fasting,
   did yet indulge themselves in their pleasures; for such, as I have
   said, altogether laugh to scorn the power of God. The Prophet's
   exhortation ought then to be noticed, when he bids the bridegroom and
   the bride to leave their nuptials, and to put on the same mournful
   appearance as the rest of the people. He thus shook off heedlessness
   from all, since God had appeared with tokens of his wrath. This is the
   sum of the whole.

   Then it follows, Between the court and the altar let the priests, the
   ministers of Jehovah, weep. It was the priests' office, we know, to
   pray in the name of the whole people; and now the Prophet follows this
   order. It was not, indeed, peculiar to the priests to pray and to ask
   pardon of God; but they prayed in the name of all the people. The
   reason must be well known to us; for God intended by these legal types
   to remind the Jews, that they could not offer prayers to him, except
   through some mediator; the people were unworthy to offer prayers by
   themselves. Hence the priest was, as it were, the middle person. The
   whole of this is to be referred to Christ; for by him we now pray; he
   is the Mediator who intercedes for us. The people stood then afar off,
   we now dare to come nigh to God; for the vail is rent, and through
   Christ we are all made priests. Hence, we are allowed in familiar way
   and in confidence to call God our Father: and yet without Christ's
   intercession, no access to God would be open to us. This then was the
   reason for the legal appointment. Hence the Prophet now says, Let the
   priests weep; not that he wished the people in the meantime to neglect
   their duty; but he expresses what had been prescribed by the law of
   God; that is, that the priests should offer supplications in the name
   of the people.

   And he says, Between the court and the altar; for the people remained
   in the court, the priests themselves had a court by its side which they
   called the sacerdotal court; but the people's court was over against
   the sanctuary. Then the priest stood, as it were, in the middle between
   God, that is, the ark of the covenant, and the people: the people also
   were standing there. We now perceive that what the Prophet meant was,
   that the people had the priests as their mediators to offer prayers;
   and yet the confession of them all was public. He calls the priests the
   ministers of Jehovah, as we have before found. He thus designates their
   office; as though he had said, that they were not more worthy than the
   rest of the people, as though they excelled by their own virtue or
   merits; but that the Lord had conferred this honor on the tribe of Levi
   by choosing them to be his ministers. It was then on account of their
   office that they came nearer to God, and not for any merit in their own
   works.

   He further adds, Spare, Lord, or be propitious to, thy people; and give
   not thy heritage to reproach, that the Gentiles may rule over them.
   Here the Prophet leaves nothing to the priests, but to flee to God's
   mercy; as though he had said that now no plea remained for the people,
   and that they were greatly deceived if they pretended any excuse, and
   that their whole hope was in God's mercy. He afterwards shows the
   ground on which they were to seek and to hope for mercy; and he calls
   their attention to God's gratuitous covenant, Give not thy heritage for
   a reproach to the Gentiles. By these words he shows, that if the Jews
   depended on themselves, they were past recovery; for they had so often
   and in such various ways provoked God's wrath, that they could not hope
   for any pardon: they had also been so obstinate that the door as it
   were had been closed against them on account of their hardness. But the
   Prophet here reminds them, that as they had been freely chosen by God
   as his peculiar people, there remained for them a hope of deliverance,
   but that it ought not to have been sought in any other way. We now then
   understand the design of the Prophet, when he speaks of God's heritage;
   as though he had said, that the people could now undertake nothing to
   pacify God, had they not been God's heritage: Give not then thy
   heritage to reproach. He had in view the threatening, which he had
   before mentioned; for it was an extreme kind of vengeance, when the
   Lord determined to visit his people with utter destruction; after
   having worn them out and consumed them by famine and want, God resolved
   wholly to consume them by the sword of enemies. It is then to this
   vengeance that he now alludes when he says, That the Gentiles may not
   rule over them. It is therefore absurd, as many do, to connect with
   this the discourse concerning the locusts: such a thing is wholly
   inconsistent with the design of the Prophet. [7]

   It is then added, Why should they say among the people, Where is their
   God? The Prophet now adduces another reason, by which the Jews might
   propitiate God, and that is, because his own glory is concerned: this
   reason has indeed an affinity to the former, for God could not expose
   his heritage to the reproaches of the Gentiles without subjecting also
   his holy name to their blasphemies. But the Prophet shows here more
   distinctly that God's glory would be subject to reproach among the
   nations, if he dealt with the people according to the full demands of
   justice; for the Gentiles would contemptuously deride him, as though he
   could not save his people. Hence in this second clause he reminds us,
   that when engaged in seeking pardon, we ought to place before our eyes
   The glory of God, that we ought not to seek our own salvation without
   remembering the holy name of God, which ought of right to be preferred
   to all other things. And at the same time he strengthens also the hope
   of the people, when he teaches that the glory of God is connected with
   the salvation of those who had sinned; as though he had said, "God,
   that he may provide for his own glory, will have mercy on you." They
   must then have come more willingly to God's presences when they saw
   that their salvation was connected with the glory of God, and that they
   would be saved that the name of God might be preserved safe and free
   from blasphemies.

   We now then perceive what the Prophet meant in this verse: he first
   strips the Jews of all confidence in works, showing that nothing
   remained for them except they fled to God's free mercy. He then shows
   that this mercy is folded on God's gratuitous covenant, because they
   were his heritage. In the third place, he shows that God would be
   merciful to them from a regard to his own glory, lest he should expose
   it to the reproaches of the Gentiles, if he exercised extreme severity
   towards his people. Let us now proceed --

   [6] That is, restraint. Literally it is, Proclaim a restraint. And as
   it means a restraint generally from labor as well as from food, it is
   applied to designate a feast-day, when men are detained or restrained
   from labor. -- Ed.

   [7] Dr. Henderson, in his learned work on the Minor Prophets, lately
   published, agrees with Calvin in rejecting the interpretation alluded
   to here, though adopted by many learned men. He considers that the
   Assyrians, and not locusts, are described in the beginning of this
   chapter and that the Prophet "employs language borrowed from the
   appearance and movements of these insects, in order to make a deeper
   impression upon his hearers, whose minds were full of ideas derived
   from them as instruments of the calamity under which they were
   suffering." The locusts in the first chapter are spoken of as having
   already appeared; but the judgment detailed in this chapter is
   represented as future. -- Ed.

   Joel 2:18-19

   18. Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people.

   18. Et aemulatus est (aemulabitur, ad verbum) Jehova (hoc est, zelo
   ducetur Jehova) super terram suam, et propitius erit (et miserabitur,
   vel, parcet; nam chml est parcere) populo suo.

   19. Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will
   send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith:
   and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen.

   19. Et respondit Jehova (vel, respondebit) et dicit (vel, dicet) populo
   suo, Ecce ego mitto vobis triticum et mustum et oleum, et saturabimini
   eo (vel illis potius, est mutatio numeri,) et non dabo vos amplius
   opprobium inter Gentes.


   The Prophet here again repeats, that prayers would not be in vain,
   provided the Jews truly humbled themselves before God. Then God, he
   says, will be jealous for his land and spare his people. He confirms
   what I have already said that God would deal mercifully with his
   people, because they were his heritage, that is because he had chosen
   them for himself. For the title of heritage, whence does it proceed
   except from the gratuitous covenant of God? for the Jews were not more
   excellent than others, but election was the only fountain from which
   the Jews had to draw any hope. We now then see why these words, God
   will be jealous for his land, are added; as though he said "Though this
   land has been polluted by the wickedness of men, yet God has
   consecrated it to himself: He will, therefore, regard his own covenant,
   and thus turn away his face from looking on their sins." He will spare,
   he says, his people, that is, his chosen people: for, as I have said,
   the Prophet no doubt ascribes here the safety of the people, and the
   hope of their safety, to the gratuitous election of God; for the
   jealousy of God is nothing else but the vehemence and ardor of his
   paternal love. God could not, indeed, express how ardently he loves
   those whom he has chosen without borrowing, as it were, what belongs to
   men. For we know that passions appertain not to him; but he is set
   forth as a father, who burns with jealousy when he sees his son
   ill-treated; he acknowledges his own blood, his bowels are excited, --
   or, as a husband, who, on seeing dishonor done to his wife, is moved;
   and though he had been a hundred times offended, he yet forgets every
   offense; for he regards that sacred union between himself and his wife.
   Such a character, then, does God assume, that he might the better
   express how much and how intensely he loves his own elect. Hence he
   says, God will be jealous for his land. As he has hitherto been
   inflamed with just wrath, so now a contrary feeling will overcome the
   former; not that God is agitated by various passions, as I have already
   said, but this mode of speaking transferred from men, is adopted on
   account of our ignorance.

   He afterwards says, God has answered [8] and said to his people,
   Behold, I will send to you corn, wine, and oil. The Prophet does not
   here recite what had been done, but, on the contrary, declares, that
   God in future would be reconciled to them; as though he said, "I have
   hitherto been a herald of war, and bidden all to prepare themselves for
   the coming evil: but now I am a messenger to proclaim peace to you; if
   only you are resolved to turn to God, and to turn unfeignedly, I do now
   testify to you that God will be propitious to you; and as to your
   prayers know that they are already heard; that is, know that as soon as
   they were conceived, they were heard by the Lord." Hence he says, He
   has answered; that is "If, moved by my exhortation, ye return with
   sincerity to God, he will meet you, nay, he has already met you; he
   waits not until ye have done all that ye ought to do; but when he bids
   you to come to his temple and to weep, he at the same time wipes off
   your tears, he removes every cause of sorrow and anxiety." God, then,
   has answered; that is, "I am to you a certain and sufficient witness,
   that your prayers have been already accepted before God, though, as I
   have before reminded you, ye have not offered them."

   And, at the same time, he speaks of the effect, Behold, I will send to
   you corn, wine, and oil; and ye shall be satisfied. Here, by the
   effects, he proves that God would be propitious; for want of food was
   the first evidence of God's displeasure, to be followed by the
   destruction which the Prophet had threatened. What does he say now? God
   will restore to you abundance of corn, wine, and oil; and he says
   further, I will not give you to the Gentiles for a reproach that they
   may rule over you

   We now then apprehend the meaning of the Prophet; for he not only
   promises that God would be placable but also declares that he was
   already placable; and this he confirms by external tokens; for God
   would immediately remove the sins of his wrath, and turn them into
   blessings. Hence he says, He will give you abundance of corn, wine, and
   oil, so as fully to satisfy you.' As they had perceived that God was
   angry with them by the sterility of the land, and also by its produce
   being consumed by chafers, by locusts, and other animals or insects; so
   now the Lord would testify his love to them by the abounding
   fruitfulness of every thing. And then he joins another sentence, I will
   not give you any more for a reproach to the Gentiles. When he says,
   "any more," he intimates that they had been before exposed to reproach;
   and we indeed know that they were then suffering many evils; but there
   remained that destruction of which we have heard. God does then here
   promise, that they should no more be subject to the reproaches of the
   Gentiles provided they repented; for the Prophet ever speaks
   conditionally. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] There is no reason for rendering this in the past tense: it is in
   the same predicament with the verb, "will be jealous," in the former
   verse, and ought to be rendered like it in the future time, "will
   answer." The comment founded on this rendering, though true in itself,
   is yet too refined, and suits not this place. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:20

   20. But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
   drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the
   east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink
   shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done
   great things.

   20. Et Aquilonarem procul abigam a vobis, et disjiciam eum ad terram
   desertam et siccitatis: facies ejus ad mare orientale, et terminum ejus
   (disjiciam; ego enim apo tou koinou repeto) ad mare novissimum: et
   ascend et foetor ejus, et ascendet putredo ejus; quia magnificavit ad
   faciendum (hoc est, quia magnifice se extulit ad faciendum.)


   In this verse he more fully confirms the Jews, that they might not be
   afraid of reproach from the Gentiles. It may have been that the
   Assyrians were now in readiness, prepared for war; it was then
   difficult to free the Jews from every fear. The Prophet had said
   generally that they would be no more subject to the mockeries of the
   Gentiles; but yet fear could not but be felt by them. "We see the
   Assyrians already armed; and what can we expect but to be devoured by
   them? for we are not able to resist them." Anxiety then must have
   constantly tormented the Jews, had he not distinctly and in express
   words declared, "It is in God's power to drive away the Assyrians, and
   to confound all their attempts." The Prophet, therefore, is now on this
   subject. The Northlander, [9] he says, will I remove far from you. The
   Chaldeans and the Assyrians, we know, were northward of Judea. He then
   means here by the North those enemies, whose preparations terrified the
   Jews. Hence he says, I will drive them from you, and drive them far
   into a land of desert and of drought [10] . By these words he
   intimates, that though furnished with the greatest forces, and gaping
   for the land of Judea, and ready in their cupidity to devour it, the
   Syrians would yet return home without effecting anything; I will cast
   them into a desert land. In vain, he says, they covet your abundance,
   and desire to satisfy themselves with the fertility of your land; for I
   will drive them and their dread away.

   He then adds, His face to the east sea, and his rear to the hindmost
   sea; that is, I will scatter them here and there, so that his front
   shall be to one sea, (supposed to be the Salt Sea,) and his extremity
   to the hindermost sea, which was doubtless the Mediterranean: for the
   Salt Sea was east to the Jews, that is, it lies, as it is well known,
   towards the east. We now perceive in part what the Prophet means. But
   it must, at the same time, be added, that the Prophet removes fear from
   the Jews, which occupied their minds by observing the power of the
   Assyrians so great and extensive. "What is to be done? though God is
   present with us, and protects us by his help, yet how will he resist
   the Assyrians, for that army will fill the land". "God will yet find
   means," says the Prophet; "though the Assyrians should occupy the whole
   land, from the Salt or the East Sea to the Meridian or Mediterranean
   Sea, yet will God drive away this vast multitude: there is no reason
   then that ye should fear." Hence the Prophet has designedly set forth
   how terrible the Assyrian forces would be, that he might show that they
   could not be resisted, unless the Lord should disperse them and
   disappoint all their efforts. At last he adds, And his ill savor shall
   ascend: but I am not able to finish to-day.

   [9] Dr. Henderson agrees with Calvin in rendering this word, Northern
   or Highlander, and quotes Coverdale as rendering it, Him of the North.
   He considers this word as of "prime importance in the interpretation of
   this prophecy." Locusts visited Palestine not from the north, but from
   the south. "That, however," he adds, "which determines the question, is
   the addition of the patronymic y to tsphvn, indicating that the North
   was not merely the quarter whence the subject of the discourse came,
   but that its native country lay to the North of Palestine; just as
   htymny, the Temanite, means the Southern, etc. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we continue to excite thy wrath against
   us, and are so insensible, though thou exhortest us daily to
   repentance, -- O grant, that what thy Prophet teaches may penetrate
   into our hearts, and be like a sounding trumpet, that we may be really
   and sincerely made humble before thee, and be so touched with the sense
   of thy wrath, that we may learn to put off all the depraved affections
   of our flesh, and not merely to deplore the sins we have already
   committed: and do thou also look upon us in future, that we may
   diligently walk in thy fear, and consecrate ourselves wholly to thee;
   and as thou hast deigned to choose us for thine inheritance, and gather
   us under thy Christ, may we so live under him as our leader, until we
   be at length gathered into thy celestial kingdom to enjoy that happy
   rest, which thou hast promised to us, and which thou promisest also
   daily, and which has been purchased by the blood of the same, our Lord
   Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Lecture Forty-fourth

   Yesterday the Prophet spake of the northern enemy, and said that it was
   in God's power to drive him far away, that he might not hurt the
   people, that his vast army would not prevent the dispersion of his
   power and enterprises. Now he adds this, which we could not finish
   yesterday, Ascend will his ill savor, and ascend will his rottenness;
   for highly has he borne or [7]exalted himself to do his purpose The
   Prophet expresses here more than in the former sentence, and that is,
   that God would turn to reproach the whole power of the Assyrian. The
   reason he subjoins deserves to be noticed, He has highly exalted
   himself in his doings,' which means, that he was elated with great
   pride, thinking he could do anything; therefore he says, Ascend will
   his rottenness and ill savor.' This contains a very striking allusion;
   for when men deliberate about great things, it is the game as if they
   were to raise up themselves on high; and we also observe that hither
   tend their designs, who are engaged in difficult and arduous
   undertakings; for they are not content with their lots but try to climb
   above the clouds. Since then the design of all mortals is to rise
   aloft, when they seek for themselves more than what is just, the
   Prophet, deriding this folly, says, "Ascend will the ill savor of the
   Assyrian, as a bad smell ascends from a putrid carcass. He thinks," he
   says, "that he can do what he pleases, as though heaven and earth were
   under his control: his power, enterprises forces and splendor, shall
   not ascend; but his ill savor only shall ascend as from a dead
   carcass." Why so? "He has mightily exalted himself," he says, "to do
   his purpose."

   He now understand the design of the Prophet: and hence this useful
   instruction may be gathered, that God so checks the foolish confidence
   of those who pride themselves on their own strength, that he not only
   casts them down, but also turns their glory into shame, so that nothing
   ascends from them but ill savor and the smell of rottenness. Now
   follows what is of an opposite character: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:21

   21. Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great
   things.

   21. Ne timeas terra, exulta et laetare; quia magnifice extulit se
   Jehova ad faciendum.


   Here he shows that God would have his turn to exalt himself, which the
   Assyrian presumptuously attempted to do. For God seems for a time to
   lie still, when he withholds himself, when he puts not forth his power,
   but waits to see the tendency of the insane conspiracies and the
   Satanic madness of those who rise up against him and his Church. But
   having for a time thus restrained himself, he at length comes forth;
   and this is what the Prophet means when he says, God has highly exalted
   himself to do his purpose. The Assyrian first attempted this; but now
   the Lord in his turn will raise up himself. God indeed could have done
   this before, but he would not; and we see this to be his usual mode of
   proceeding, to connive at the presumption of men, till the ripened time
   comes which he has predetermined; and then he dissipates in a moment
   their enterprises.

   God, then, has now nobly exalted himself; therefore rejoice and exult,
   O Land. But he says first, Fear not, O Land; and then, Exult and
   rejoice For it was necessary, in the first place, to remove the fear
   with which the minds of all were now seized. The Prophet, then, begins
   with consolation; for the Jews could have hardly entertained any joy,
   except the fear that oppressed them was first shaken off. Hence the
   Prophet maintains due order by saying, "Fear not, O Land, but rather
   exult and rejoice." He afterwards subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:22

   22. Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
   wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and
   the vine do yield their strength.

   22. Ne timeatis bestiae agri, quia germinarunt pascua deserti, quia
   arbor protulit fructum suum, ficulnea et vitis protulerunt virtutem
   (vel, substantiam) suam.


   Here the Prophet turns his address to the beasts; not that his
   instruction suited them; but it was a more efficacious mode of
   speaking, when he invited the very beasts to a participation of the
   people's joy; for except the Jews had been made to know that God's
   wrath was now nigh at hand, no consolation which the Prophet has
   hitherto applied would have been of any weight with them. But now since
   they perceived that God's wrath did not only suspend over them, but
   extended much farther, even to the beasts, and since the Lord would
   have mercy on them, so that his blessing would be partaken in common by
   the beasts and brute animals, the address was far more impressive. We
   hence see that the Prophet, for the best reason, directed his discourse
   to the very beasts, though destitute of mind and discernment. For in
   addressing brute animals he addressed men with double force; that is,
   he impressed their minds more effectually, so that they might seriously
   confess how great was God's wrath, and also how great would be his
   blessing.

   Beasts, he says, fear not. Then the beasts of the field ought to have
   dreaded the judgment of God which he had before denounced; for except
   God had been pacified to his people, the fire of his wrath would have
   consumed the whole land, trees and pastures; so all the beasts must
   have been famished. But now when God is reconciled to his people, his
   blessing will smile on the brute animals. What then is to be said of
   men? For God is properly propitious to them, and not to brute animals.
   We hence see that the fruit of reconciliation is made more evident,
   when it is in part extended to the brute creation.

   He therefore says, Fear not, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures
   of the desert will grow, the trees will bring forth their fruit. By
   these words the Prophet intimates, that had God's wrath toward his
   people been implacable, the sterility of the land would not have been
   improved. Now then whence came so sudden a change that the pastures
   grew, that the trees produced their fruits, both the fig-tree and the
   vine, except that God was pleased to bless the land, after having
   received men into favor? We now then apprehend the meaning of the
   Prophet, even this, -- that the land would be made by an angry God to
   execute his judgment, and that there would be no remedy for the
   barrenness of the land until men propitiated God. This is the sum of
   the whole. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:23

   23. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your
   God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will
   cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter
   rain in the first month

   23. Et filii Sion exultate, et gaudete in Jehova Deo vestro, quia dedit
   vobis pluviam ad justitiam (alii vertunt, doctorem justitiae; sed de eo
   paulo post dicemus) et descendere faciet vobis imbrem pluviam (vel,
   pluviam tempestivam, ut vertunt: dicemus etiam de hac voce) et pluviam
   in mense primo.


   He now exhorts the Jews also to rejoice, but in a way different from
   that of the land and of the beasts. Rejoice, he says, in your God. For
   the beasts and the sheep, while rejoicing, cannot raise their thoughts
   higher than to their food: hence, the joy of brute animals, as they
   say, terminates in its object. But the Prophet sets forth God before
   the Jews as the ground of their joy. We then see how he distinguishes
   them from brute animals from the land and other elements; for he not
   only bids them to rejoice in meat and drink, in the abundance of
   provisions, but he also bids them to rejoice in the Lord their God; and
   he says no more, "The land will yield its strength, or the vines and
   fig-trees, or the trees, will produce their fruit, and the pastures
   will grow;" no, he speaks not now in this manner, but he says "God
   himself will give you rain:" for he had to do with men, endued with
   understanding, yea, with those very Jews who had been from their
   childhood taught in the law of God: he speaks, not only of the land,
   not only of bread and wine, but of the Giver himself.

   He then reminds them of God's blessing, and declares that God would be
   so propitious to them as to pour down his grace upon them, and act the
   part of a father and a guardian towards them. God then, he says, will
   bring forth or give to you rain according to what is necessary. Some
   translate hmvrh emure a teacher; and the meaning of the word, we know,
   is doubtful. At the same time mvrh mure is very often taken for rain,
   and sometimes generally, and sometimes for a particular kind of rain,
   as we shall presently see. Though then mvrh mure signifies a teacher,
   yet the context here seems not to allow that sense. They who have thus
   taken it seem to have been led by this one reason, -- that it is absurd
   to set in the first place, and as it were on a higher grade, those
   fading blessings which belong only to the support and nourishment of
   the body. But this reason is very foolish; for the Prophets, we know,
   lead children as it were by initial principles to a higher doctrine. No
   wonder then that the Prophet here affords them a taste of God's favor
   in blessings belonging to the body; he afterwards ascends higher, as we
   shall see: and this view is certainly what the context demands; for the
   Prophet says at last, "I will hereafter pour my Spirit on all flesh,"
   etc. In these words the Prophet commends the favor of God, which ought
   to be held as the most valuable: but he begins now with temporal
   benefits, that he might lead by degrees, and by various steps, a
   people, rude and weak, to something higher.

   Then the word, teacher, by no means suits this place; and we must mark
   also what immediately follows. He introduces a word derived from mvrh
   mure; he afterwards adds mvrh mure the second time, which no doubt,
   means rain; all confess this, and confess it to be taken for rain in
   the same verse. When all agree then on this point, it seems somewhat
   strained to render it in the same verse a teacher and also rain;
   especially since we find that the Prophet's object is this, -- to make
   the people to recognize God's blessing in outward things. There is also
   another thing which has lead astray these interpreters. There follows
   immediately the word ltsdqh latsadke, according to what is just. When
   they join together these word, hmvrh ltsdqh emure latsadke, they ask,
   What is the rain of righteousness? They have hence thought that a
   teacher is here meant. But we know that mspht and tsdqh meshapheth and
   tsadke are often taken in Scripture for a just measure, for equity.
   "God then will not deal with you unequally as hitherto; but having been
   reconciled to you, he will reassume the part of a father, and will also
   observe towards you a legitimate order; for things have been on both
   sides in confusion, inasmuch as ye have been carrying on war against
   God, and your wickedness has subverted the whole order of nature. But
   now, God being pacified towards you, there will be on both sides an
   equable state of things, everything will be in a fitting condition; he
   will not deal with you any more in an irregular manner." We now then
   perceive the real meaning of the Prophets and see how frivolous are the
   reasons which influenced these interpreters, who have rendered the
   words, "Teacher of righteousness." I do not love strained expositions.

   Let us now return to the words of the Prophet: He will give to you, he
   says, rain according is what is fit; then he adds, He will make to
   descend on you showering rain, (using another word;) and he adds again
   the word mvrh mure, which, no doubt, means rain, and no one denies
   this. But yet it seems that the word gsm geshem has here a specific
   meaning, and some think it to be a violent shower, occasioned by a
   storm or tempest; and yet we may gather from many parts of Scripture
   that the word means rain in general. Now mvrh mure seems here to be
   taken for the rain of September, which the Greeks call txoimon,
   proimon; and so they call mlqvs melkush opsimon, opsimon, or the latter
   rain, as a common interpreter has rendered it. And the cultivated land,
   we know, needs these two rains, that is, after sowing, and when the
   fruit is ripening, -- after sowing, that the ground by receiving
   moisture may make the seed to grow; for it then wants moisture to
   nourish the roots. Hence, the rain of September or October, which is
   after sowing, is rightly called seasonable rain; and the Greeks, as I
   have already said, call it proimon proimon; and James, following them,
   so calls it in James 5, He will give you rain,' he says, both of the
   first time and the late rain,' that is, of the month of March. For in
   those warm climates the harvests we know, is earlier than with us. We
   here gather the corn in July but they gather it there in May. The fruit
   then ripens with them in March, when they need the late rain. And in
   Jeremiah 5 it appears quite evident, that mvrh mure, as in this place,
   is called the rain, which comes down after sowing; for God says there,
   I will give you,' etc., and first he uses the general word gsm geshem,
   and then he adds the two kinds of rain, which are also mentioned here;
   and afterwards he adds, In their time,' that is, each rain in its time
   and season. -- Then mvrh mure has its time, and mlqvs melkush also has
   its time; otherwise the words of the prophet would not be consistent.

   We now see what the Prophet means. Of the word mlqvm melkush we have
   said something in [8]Hosea. Then the Prophet says now, that God would
   be so propitious to the Jews, as to neglect no means of testifying his
   favor towards them; for he would give them rain in the month of October
   and in the month of March, to fertilize the ground after sowing, and
   before the harvest or before the fruit came to maturity. Here then is
   promised to the Jews that the land would be made fertile by natural
   means. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:24

   24. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow
   with wine and oil.

   24. Et implebuntur horrea frumento et resonabunt torcularia vino
   (musto, ad verbum: diximus de hac voce prius,) et oleo.


   He goes on with the same subject in this verse, and shows the effects
   of rain; for when the earth is irrigated and satiated with sufficient
   moisture, it brings forth fruit, rich and plentiful. God then will
   cause that the rains shall not be useless, for the floors shall be full
   of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine as well as oil. He
   afterwards adds --

   Joel 2:25

   25. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the
   cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army
   which I sent among you.

   25. Et reddam vobis annos (pro aliis annis, subaudiendum est) quibus
   comedit locusta, bruchus, eruca (chsyl, alii vertunt, rubiginem: sed
   dixi primo capite me non adeo solicitum esse de istis vocibus, quia
   etiam ignotae sunt hodie ipsis Judaeis; sed certum est esse insecta,
   quae corrumpunt omnes terrae fruges, ut tunc diximus,) exercitus meus
   magnus, quem miseram ad vos.


   The Prophet confirms what he had previously said, and states what is of
   an opposite character, -- that God can as easily restore a rich
   fruitfulness to the land as he had before rendered it barren by sending
   devouring insects. I will give you years, (for the other years,) he
   says; and that the Jews might more fully understand that all this was
   in God's hand, he expressly declares that the cankerworms, the chafers,
   and the locusts [11] , were his army and as it were his hired army,
   whom he had employed as it seemed good to him. The spoilers, then,
   which had destroyed the whole produce of the land, were, as the Prophet
   declares, the messengers of God: it was not, he says, by chance that
   the locusts, or the cankerworms, or the chafers came; but God hired
   these soldiers, they were his forces and his army to distress the whole
   people; then famine and want consumed them. It is not then to no
   purpose that the Prophet mentions here that these destructive insects
   were God's army; it is to show more fully what is here promised; for
   God, who had by this army devoured the whole increase of the land, can
   now easily restore plenty for the barrenness of past years. Now, when
   any one lays down his arms, the land is afterwards cultivated, and
   brings forth its usual fruit: so the Lord also now shows, that the land
   had been barren, because he had sent forth his army, which laid waste
   its whole produce. But now, he says, when I shall restore you to favor,
   there will be no army to devour your fruit: the land then will nourish
   you, for there will be nothing to prevent you to receive its wonted
   produce.

   Had not the Jews been made assured that the land had been sterile,
   because the locusts, and the chafers, and the cankerworms, were the
   army which the Lord had prepared they might have ever dreaded these
   spoilers: "Surely the locusts will spring up, the chafers and the
   cankerworms will come, to devour all the fruit." The Prophet shows that
   this happened not by chance: "Now then, when God shall be reconciled to
   you, the land will yield its increase, and nothing shall hinder you
   from enjoying its abundance."

   [9]By calling this army great, he shows that God has no need of strong
   forces to subdue men; for when he prepares locusts and insects, which
   are but little things, they snatch food from the mouths of men and
   leave them in want; though no one puts forth a sword against them, they
   yet pine away with hunger. The Prophet then derides here the arrogance
   of men, and shows that God needs not do much, when he intends to reduce
   them to nothing. Let us now proceed --

   Joel 2:26

   26. And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name
   of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my
   people shall never be ashamed.

   26. Et comedetis comedendo et vos satiando, et laudabitis nomen Jehovae
   Dei vestri; quia egit vobiscum mirabiliter (ad miraculum,) et non
   pudefiet populus meus in perpetuum.


   He now concludes what he has hitherto said of God's blessing. As the
   Jews were starving while God was offended, so he promises that when
   reconciled to him they should have abundance of produce from the land:
   Ye shall eat plentifully, he says, and satisfy yourselves. But he
   mentions also their gratitude; for it was an evidence of true
   repentance when they praised the name of God, whom they understood to
   be the giver of their abundance; for he had before proved that the land
   was under his power, when he consumed its whole substance, so that none
   of it came to supply the wants of man. Hence the Prophet exhorts them
   to give thanks, that they might thus declare that they from the heart
   repented. Ye shall then praise the name of Jehovah your God". Why?
   "Because he will deal with you wonderfully. He takes away here every
   plea for ignorance. We know how difficult it is to lead men to do this
   act of religion, for which we yet confess that we were born; for what
   is more natural than to acknowledge God's bounty towards us, when we
   enjoy many blessings? But yet, though God in various ways stimulates
   us, he cannot draw from us genuine gratitude. This is the reason why
   the Prophet now says, "God will deal with you wonderfully: though ye
   are stupid, God will yet by his power awaken you; for he will not deal
   with you in a common way." He then mentions something miraculous, that
   he might leave to the Jews no excuse, in case they considered not God's
   bounty and perceived not in this change, first, what they had deserved
   and then how merciful God had been to them: for this change could not
   have been ascribed to chance; nor was it a common thing, that when the
   Jews had been for four successive years nearly consumed with wants and
   when the enemy was at hand, they should see the land now fruitful, that
   they should see it freed from destructive insects, that they should be
   also at peace, and not disturbed by the dread of any foreign enemy.
   Since the Lord, then, would beyond hope give them a serene instead of a
   turbulent sky, should not such a wonderful change deeply affect them?
   This is what the Prophet now means, -- "As the Lord will deal with you
   wonderfully, there will be no excuse for your torpidity, if ye will not
   be diligent in praising his name."

   Not ashamed, he says, shall my people be for ever. The Jews are here
   reminded by implication of their former disgrace; for they had been
   greatly confounded; though enemies touched them not, no, not even with
   their finger, they yet died through famine; an enemy was also prepared,
   as we have seen, to destroy them. They were therefore frightened with
   dread, and also perplexed with their own evils, by which God had almost
   worn them out. The Prophet says now, My people shall not be ashamed for
   ever, intimating that God would at length relieve his people from their
   evils, that they might not, as hitherto, be ashamed. He at last
   subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:27

   27. And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am
   the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

   27. Et cognoscetis, quia in medio Israel ego, et ego Jehova Deus
   vester, et nullus praeterea: et non pudefiet populus meus in seculum.


   He repeats the same sentence; and in the beginning of the verse he
   unfolds what I have already said -- that the miracle would be such as
   to constrain the people to praise God. Ye shall know that I am in the
   midst of Israel: and this was the case, because God showed not in an
   ordinary way his kindness to them, and especially because it had been
   foretold, and also because this reason had been adduced -- that God was
   mindful of his covenant. The manner, then, in which he dealt with them,
   and farther, the prediction itself, left to the people no pretext for
   ignorance. Hence the Prophet now says, Ye shall know that I am in the
   midst of Israel,' and still more, that I am Jehovah your God.' By these
   words the Prophet reminds us, that the deliverance of the people from
   their evils was to be wholly ascribed to the gratuitous mercy of God;
   for we have already seen, that things would have been past hope, had
   not this consolation been added -- Turn ye even now to me.' The Prophet
   therefore repeats, that there would be no other reason why God would
   deal so kindly with his people, and so mercifully spare them, but this
   -- that he dwelt in the midst of Israel: but whence was this dwelling,
   except that God had gratuitously chosen this people? This indeed
   availed much to raise up the people; for how could they have hoped that
   God would be propitious to them, had they not been reminded of this
   truth that God was dwelling in the midst of them? Not because they were
   worthy, but because he deigned to come down to them.

   He afterwards adds, And none else. By this sentence the Prophet more
   sharply stimulates them to return immediately to God; for if they
   deferred longer disappointment would be in delay. That the Jews, then,
   might not, after their usual manner, procrastinate, he says that there
   is no other God; and thus he shows that there was no remedy for their
   evils, except they sought to be reconciled to God. "There is then no
   God besides me, and I dwell in the midst of thee." The Lord claims to
   himself every power, and then kindly invites the people to himself, and
   for this reason, -- because he dwells in the midst of them. That the
   people, then, might not form other expectations, God shows that all
   their hope was in him alone. He farther shows, that salvation was not
   to be sought afar off, provided the people had not forgotten the
   covenant, that God was dwelling in the midst of them. But a higher
   doctrine follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:28

   28. And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit
   upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your
   old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

   28. Et accidet post sic (hoc est, postea,) effundam Spiritum meum super
   omnem carnem: et prophetabunt filii vestri et filiae vestrae: senes
   vestri somnia sommabunt: juvenes vestri (aut, viri electi) visiones
   videbunt.


   We have explained why the Prophet began with earthly blessings. One may
   indeed think that this order is not regular; for Christ does not in
   vain remind us, that the kingdom of God ought to be first sought, and
   that other things shall be added in their place, (Matthew 6;) for food,
   and every thing that belongs to this frail life, are, as it were,
   additions to the spiritual life. But the Prophet designedly mentioned
   first the evidence of God's favor in outward benefits; for we see how
   slow the perceptions of men are, and how slothful they are in seeking
   spiritual life. As, then, men rise to things above with so much
   difficulty, the Prophet makes use of the best helps; and we must indeed
   be dealt with as we usually deal with children. For as there is not so
   much discernment in them as to be influenced by reasons, we set before
   them what is suitable to their weak and simple comprehension; so the
   Prophet did; for he showed first that God would be kind to the Jews in
   food for the body, and having used this as a help, he then added,
   Afterwards I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh.

   By these words the Prophet reminds us, that people act absurdly when
   they are satisfied with vanishing things, when they ask of God nothing
   more excellent than to be pampered like brute animals; for in what do
   the children of God differ from asses and dogs, except they aspire
   after spiritual life? The Prophet, then, after having set before them
   lower things, as though they were children, now brings before them a
   more solid doctrine, (for thus they were to be led,) and affords them a
   taste of the favor of God in its external signs. "Ascend, then, now,"
   he says, "to spiritual life: for the fountain is one and the same;
   though when earthly benefits occupy and engross your attention, ye no
   doubt pollute them. But God feeds you, not to fill and pamper you; for
   he would not have you to be like brute animals. Then know that your
   bodies are fed, and that God gives support to you, that ye may aspire
   after spiritual life; for he leads you to this as by the hand; be this
   then your object." We now, then, understand why the Prophet did not at
   first speak of the spiritual grace of God; but he comes to it now. He
   began with temporal benefits, for it was needful that an untutored
   people should be thus led by degrees, that on account of their
   infirmity, sluggishness, and dullness, they might thus make better
   progress, until they understood that God would for this end be a Father
   to them.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we want so many aids while in this
   frail life, and as it is a shadowy life, we cannot pass a moment,
   except thou dost continually, and at all times, supply through thy
   bounty what is needful, -- O grant, that we may so profit by thy so
   many benefits, that we may learn to raise our minds upwards, and ever
   aspire after celestial life, to which by thy gospel thou invites us so
   kindly and sweetly every day, that being gathered into thy celestial
   kingdom, we may enjoy that perfect felicity, which has been procured
   for us by the blood of thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Lecture Forty-fifth

   And it shall be, that I shall afterwards pour my Spirit upon all flesh,
   and prophesy shall your sons and your daughters and your old men shall
   dreams dream, and your young men shall visions see. We mentioned in our
   last lecture why the Prophet now at length speaks of the spiritual
   grace of God, having before spoken of earthly blessings. The order may
   seem indeed irregular; but it can be easily accounted for. The Prophet
   said first that God, being reconciled to the people, would openly
   manifest this by external proofs, by restoring abundance of wine and
   corn; for the almost wearing out of the people by famine and want,
   being the evidence of God's vengeance, the Prophet made the testimony
   of reconciliation to be in tokens of a contrary kind. But as the
   restoration of the Church consists not either in the fruitfulness of
   the land, or in the abundance of provisions, the Prophet now raises
   higher the thoughts of the godly, and makes them to look for the
   spiritual grace of God: hence he says, I shall afterwards pour my
   Spirit upon all flesh

   The Prophet, no doubt, promises here something greater than what the
   fathers under the Law had experienced. The gift of the Spirit, we know,
   was enjoyed even by the ancients; but the Prophet promises not what the
   faithful had before found; but, as we have said, something greater: and
   this may easily be gathered from the word here used, "pour out;" for
   sphk shephek means not to distill, but to pour forth in great
   abundance; and God did not pour out his Holy Spirit so abundantly and
   so largely under the law as after the manifestation of Christ. Since,
   then, the gift of the Spirit was more copiously given to the Church
   after the advent of Christ, the Prophet uses here an unwonted
   expression -- that God would pour out his Spirit.

   Another circumstance is added, upon all flesh. Though the Prophets, as
   we know, had formerly their colleges, yet they were but few in number.
   As then the gift of prophecy was rare among the Jews, the Prophets in
   order to show that God would deal more bountifully to his new Church
   when restored, says, that he would pour out his Spirit upon all flesh.
   He then intimates that all in common would be partakers of the gift of
   the Spirit, and of its rich abundance, while under the law a few had
   but a sparing taste of it. We now then perceive the design of the
   Prophet; it was to make a manifest difference between the state of the
   ancient people and the state of the new Church, of the restoration of
   which he now speaks. The comparison is, that God would not only endow a
   few with his Spirit, but the whole mass of the people, and then that he
   would enrich his faithful with all kinds of gifts, so that the Spirit
   would seem to be poured forth in full abundance: I will then pour out
   my Spirit upon all flesh. We hence learn how absurdly the Greek
   interpreter has rendered this, "I will pour out from my Spirit:" for he
   diminishes this promise by saying, "From my Spirit," as though God
   promised here some small portion of his Spirit; while, on the contrary
   the Prophet speaks of abundance, and intended to express it.

   It follows, Prophesy shall your sons and your daughters. The Prophet
   now proceeds to explain what he had said, unfolding at large what he
   meant by the expression, "upon all flesh," which was this, -- that the
   whole people would prophesy, or that the gift of prophecy would be
   common and prevail every where among all the Jews, in a new and unusual
   manner. The ancients had also Prophets though in number few; but now
   the Prophet extends this gift and favor to all orders: Prophesy then
   shall your sons and your daughters, he says, so that he does not
   exclude women.

   He afterwards mentions two kinds of prophesying, Your old men shall
   dreams dream, and your young men shall visions see. "Young men" mean
   literally "chosen," vchvrym bechurim: but as in middle age strength
   prevails most in man, those who possess vigor and judgment, and as yet
   retain their strength, are called "chosen:" hence by "chosen" he means
   those of mature age. When God manifested himself to the Prophets, it
   was usually done, we know, by dreams and visions, as it is said in
   Numbers 12: this was, as we may say, the ordinary method. The Prophet
   now refers to these two modes of communication, and says, that the gift
   of prophecy would be common to men and women, to the old and those of
   middle age. We now perceive the import of this verse. There is then no
   difference between dreams and visions, only the Prophet mentions these
   two kinds, that readers might better understand, that what the Prophet
   had stated before generally would be common to all.

   But I have already said that this prophecy must be referred to the
   advent of Christ; for we know that what is here described was not
   fulfilled until after Christ appeared in the world: and the Prophet now
   preaches of the new restoration of the Church, which we know, was
   suspended until the Gospel was proclaimed. Let us now then see whether
   God, after Christ was revealed, performed what he had spoken by his
   Prophet. Peter, in Acts 2, says, that this prophecy was fulfilled when
   the Spirit was sent. But it may be objected, that all were not endued
   with the gift of prophecy, even when God opened all the treasures of
   his grace; and Paul says that they were not all prophets even when the
   Church especially flourished; and experience proves the same. How then
   could Peter say, that this -- that God would pour out his Spirit upon
   all flesh, was fulfilled? To give a reply to this is not difficult: let
   us only remember, that the Prophet speaks comparatively, as the
   Scripture is wont to do. He affirms not in express terms that all would
   be partakers of this gift, but that in comparison with the ancient
   Church, this gift would be as it were common, and that it was so is
   well known: for if any one compares the ancient Church with that
   abundance which God vouchsafed to his people after Christ's advent, he
   will certainly find true what I say -- that the Spirit of God, who was
   given only to few under the law, was poured out upon all flesh. True
   then is what the Prophet says, provided this contrast is to be
   understood -- that God was much more bountiful towards his new Church
   than formerly towards the fathers: for the Prophets then were not many,
   but they were many under the gospel.

   We must also remember that the Prophet hyperbolically extols the grace
   of God; for such is our stupidity and dullness, that we can never
   sufficiently comprehend the grace of God, except it is set forth to us
   in hyperbolical language; nor is there indeed any excess in the thing
   itself, if we take a right view of it: but as we hardly understand the
   hundredth part of God's gifts, when he presents them before our eyes,
   it was needful to add a commendation, calculated to elevate our
   thoughts. The spirit of God is then constrained to speak hyperbolically
   on account of our torpidity or rather carelessness. We need not however
   to fear, lest our thoughts should go beyond the words; for when God
   would carry us above the heavens, we can hardly ascend two or three
   feet.

   We now then perceive why the Prophet mentions all flesh without
   exception: first, there were more Prophets, as I have said, under the
   gospel than under the law; hence, the comparison is very suitable; --
   and, secondly the Prophet speaks not here of the public office of
   teaching, for he calls those Prophets who had not been called to teach,
   but who were endued with so much of the light of truth, that they might
   be compared with the Prophets; and certainly the knowledge which
   flourished in the primitive Church was such, that the meanest were in
   many respects equal to the ancient Prophets; for what did God confer on
   the ancient Prophets except the power of foretelling something to come?
   It was a special gift, and very limited. Besides these predictions are
   hardly worthy to be compared with the celestial wisdom made known in
   the gospel. Faith then after the coming of Christ, if rightly estimated
   according to its value, far excels the gift of prophecy. And so the
   Prophet here, not without reason, dignifies with so honorable name
   those who were private men, and to whom was not intrusted the office of
   teaching among the people, but who were only illuminated; for their
   light was much superior to the gift of prophecy in many of those who
   lived under the law. We now understand what the Prophet means when he
   makes the Spirit of God to be common, without distinction, to all the
   godly, so that they possess what excels the gift of prophesying.

   Now as to the two kinds of gifts mentioned here, it must be observed,
   that the Prophet spoke according to what was commonly known among the
   people: for as the Jews were accustomed to dreams and visions, the
   Prophet therefore made use of these terms; and this manner of speaking
   occurs often in the Prophets, and it ought to be borne in mind by us.
   When they speak of the worship of God, they mention sacrifices, They
   shall come and bring frankincense and gold; they shall lead camels
   laden with the wealth of the land.' In short, in their prophecies they
   raise altars and build a temple: and yet no such things were seen after
   Christ appeared: for the Gentiles came not to Jerusalem to offer
   sacrifices; nay, shortly after the temple was destroyed, there was no
   altar among them, and the whole legal worship ceased. What then is to
   be understood by such expressions, as -- that people shall come from
   all places to sacrifice together? Even this -- They set forth under a
   visible form the spiritual worship of God. It is so in this place; as
   it was the usual way among the ancients that God manifested himself by
   dreams and visions to the Prophets, so he says, your old men shall
   dreams dream, and your young men shall visions see: but the Prophet no
   doubt sets forth under these forms of speech that light of knowledge in
   which the new Church excelled after Christ appeared: he indeed compares
   the light of faith to prophecy, as we have already stated; but he
   accommodates his manner of speaking or his discourse to the
   comprehension of his people, for he knew whom he addressed. All the
   Prophets have followed the same rule; There shall be offered a
   sacrifice,' says Malachi, from the rising to the setting of the sun.'
   What is this sacrifice? The Papists take this for the mass; "Then under
   the kingdom of Christ there is to be some sacrifice; and we do not now
   offer to God sheep and calves; it therefore follows, that there is to
   be the sacrifice of bread and wine:" and this is said, as though the
   Prophet had thus refinedly philosophized on the word, sacrifice, while
   he was teaching a rude people according to what they could bear. But
   what he meant was, that the worship of God would be universal among all
   nations. The same thing is intended by Joel when he says, I shall pour
   forth my Spirit upon all flesh: your old men shall dreams dream, and
   your young men shall visions see. We now see the whole meaning of the
   Prophet. Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 2:29

   29. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days
   will I pour out my spirit.

   29. Atque etiam super servoset super ancillas in diebus illis effundam
   Spiritum meam.


   As the particle gm gam amplifies in Hebrew, it seems singular that the
   Prophet now limits to a few a gift common to all; for he had previously
   said, "Upon all flesh will I pour out my Spirit;" and now, "Upon
   servants and handmaids;" and he puts down "Also". If he had simply said
   "Upon servants and handmaids will I pour out my Spirit," there would
   have been no inconsistency, for it would have been the explanation of
   his former statement; for we know that what the Prophet says of all men
   must be taken with exception, inasmuch as many who were unbelievers
   were without this gift, and even those who before excelled in some sort
   of divine knowledge; we indeed know that the Jews were blinded, and we
   also know that not all among the common people were partakers of this
   excellent gift. There is no doubt, therefore, but that this which is
   said of "all flesh," must be limited to the Church. It would not, then,
   have appeared strange, had the Prophet now added, "Upon servants and
   handmaids;" but the particles vgm ugam, "And also," create difficulty:
   it is a way of speaking to enlarge on what has been said, but here it
   seems not to enlarge; for to pour out the Spirit upon all the people,
   is more than to pour it out on servants and handmaids. The solution is
   twofold: the particles vgm ugam are sometimes to be taken
   confirmatively. I have blessed him,' said Isaac of his son Jacob, and
   also blessed shall he be.' So in this place we may take the words of
   the Prophet to be, yea surely, being a repetition serving to confirm
   what had been said: but I prefer another sense; for the Prophet, I
   doubt not, meant here to add something more incredible than what he had
   previously said, "Upon servants and maid-servants will I pour out my
   Spirit," that is, even upon those who were before Prophets; for they
   shall be enriched with a new gift, and shall gain increasing knowledge
   after the restoration of the Church, which is now approaching. We
   apprehend this to be the meaning of the Prophet. He had promised the
   grace of the Spirit to the whole body of the faithful, which appears,
   as I have said, from comparing the ancient state with our own: but now,
   after having spoken of the mass or the common people, he comes to the
   Prophets, who were superior to others who before performed the office
   of teaching, who attained rank and degree in the Church; these also
   shall gain accessions; that is, "My Spirit shall not only be
   conspicuous in the ignorant and the common people, but also in the
   Prophets themselves."

   Surely it is a greater thing when they are taught who were before
   superior to others, and whom the Lord had set over the Church, and when
   they appear as new men, after having received a gift which the Lord had
   not previously conferred on them. When, therefore, new light appears in
   such men, it is certainly a greater thing than when the Spirit is
   poured out on the common people. We now then see the Prophet's meaning
   as to the servants and the handmaids. [12]

   He then repeats, In those days, intimating that so sudden and
   incredible the change will be, that Prophets will seem to have been
   before untaught men; for a much more excellent doctrine shall be given
   them. Then God shall so pour out his Spirits that all the ancient
   prophecies will appear obscure and of no value, compared with the great
   and extraordinary light which Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, will
   bring at his rising. And he mentions "handmaids", for there were, we
   know, Prophetesses under the Law. Let us now go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] However true in itself is what is here advanced, yet the
   exposition seems rather too refined, and what the passage does not
   require. The difficulty stated will vanish, when we consider that "all
   flesh" is a general expression, afterwards particularized and limited:
   and "and all flesh," according to what is subsequently specified,
   evidently means all conditions of men, men in all states and of every
   age, and not the whole of mankind. "And also," in verse 29, is very
   emphatical, as the persons afterwards mentioned were of the lowest
   grade, "servants and handmaids," that is, slaves: and such were many of
   the first converts to Christianity. See Galatians 3:28; Colossians
   3:11. Though the word for servants' does not necessarily mean those in
   a servile condition, yet it has that meaning. The same is true of the
   word for handmaids. Hagar, expressly called a bondwoman by Paul, is
   called by this name, Genesis 16:1. And to view the words as signifying
   slaves, would make the prophecy more striking, as being literally
   fulfilled at the first promulgation of the Gospel.

   Joel 2:30-31

   30. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and
   fire, and pillars of smoke.

   30. Et ponam (statuam) prodigia in coelis et terra, sanguinem et ignem
   et columnas nubis.

   31. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
   before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.

   31. Sol vertetur in tenebras et luna in sanguinem, antequam veniat dies
   Jehovae magnus et terribilis.


   The Prophet seems here to contradict himself; for he had hitherto
   promised that God would deal kindly and bountifully with his people;
   and every thing he has said tended to elevate the spirits of the people
   and fill them with joy: but now he seems again to threaten them with
   God's wrath and to strike miserable men with fear; who had not as yet a
   breathing time; for at the time the Prophet spoke, the Jews, we know,
   were in the greatest sorrow. What then is his purpose in adding a new
   cause of grief, as though they had not sorrow and lamentation enough?
   But it is rather an admonition than a threatening. The Prophet warns
   them of what would be, lest the faithful should promise themselves some
   happy condition in this world, and an exemption from all cares and
   troubles; for we know how prone men are to self-indulgence. When God
   promises any thing, they flatter themselves and harbor vain thoughts,
   as though they were beyond the reach of harm, and free from every grief
   and every evil. Such indulgence the flesh contrives for itself. Hence
   the Prophet reminds us, that though God would bountifully feed his
   Church, supply his people with food, and testify by external tokens his
   paternal love, and though also he would pour out his Spirit, (a token
   far more remarkable,) yet the faithful would continue to be distressed
   with many troubles; for God designs not to deal too delicately with his
   Church on earth; but when he gives tokens of his kindness he at the
   same time mingles some exercises for patience, lest the faithful should
   become self-indulgent or sleep on earthly blessings, but that they may
   ever seek higher things.

   We now then understand the Prophet's design: he intends not to threaten
   the faithful, but rather to warn them, lest they should deceive
   themselves with empty dreams, or expect what is never to be, that is,
   to enjoy a happy rest in this world. Besides, the Prophet regards also
   another thing: we know indeed that men are hardly led to seek the grace
   of God, except when they are, as it were, forcibly drawn; hence
   spiritual life is neglected, and whatever belongs to the celestial
   kingdom, when we have all kinds of supplies on earth. The Prophet then
   commends here the spiritual grace of which he speaks, for this reason,
   -- that the condition of men would be miserable, were not the Lord to
   exhilarate their minds and refresh them with the comfort which we have
   already noticed. -- How so? [11]There will be prodigies in heaven and
   on earth, the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
   blood, and all things shall be in disorder and in horrible darkness.
   What then would become of men, were not God to shine on them by the
   grace of his Spirit, to support them under such a confusion in heaven
   and on earth, and to show himself to be their Father?

   We then see that this was added for the fuller commendation of God's
   grace, that men might know, that they would be much more miserable if
   God called them not to himself by the shining light of his Spirit. And
   that this was the Prophet's design, we may learn from the discourse of
   Christ, which he made to his disciples a short time before his death.
   They asked what would be the sign of his coming, when he reminded them
   of the destruction of the temple, (Matthew 24:3-25:46). They thought
   that he would immediately accomplish that triumph of which they had
   heard, that they would be made participators of that eternal beatitude
   of which Christ had so often spoken to them. Christ then warned them
   not to be deluded with so gross a notion. He spoke of the destruction
   of Jerusalem, and then declared that all these things would be only the
   presages of evils -- "These," he says, "shall be only the preludes; for
   tumults will arise, wars shall be, and all places will be full of
   calamities; in a word, there will be an immense mass of all evils." As
   Christ then corrected the mistake, with which the minds of the
   disciples were imbued, so the Prophet here checks vain imaginations,
   lest the faithful should think that Christ's kingdom would be earthly,
   and fix their minds on corn and wine, on pleasures and quietness, on
   the conveniences of the present life: I will give you, he says,
   prodigies in heaven and on earth blood, fire, and dark clouds; the sun
   all be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before it shall
   come -- the day of Jehovah, great and terrible

   We now see why the Prophet adds here this sad catalogue, and how well
   these things harmonize together, -- that God would testify his paternal
   love by the manifestation of Christ, -- and that he would exhibit
   tokens of his wrath, which would fill the whole world with anxiety and
   fear.

   What he says of blood and darkness is, no doubt, to be taken
   metaphorically for a disordered state of things; for we know that
   calamities are often compared to obscurity and darkness. It is the same
   as though he said, "So great will be the succession of evils, that the
   whole order of nature will seem to be subverted that the very elements
   will put on a new form; the sun, which illuminates the earth, will be
   turned into darkness, the moon into blood; the calamities which shall
   come will take away every token of God's kindness. Then nothing will
   remain, but that men, sunk, as it were, in the deepest abyss of all
   evils, will seek some spark of grace from God and never find it; for
   heaven will be dark, the earth will be covered with thick darkness." We
   then see that the Prophet does not express what would be, word for
   word, nor is he to be understood as speaking, as they say, literally,
   but he uses a figurative mode of speaking, by which he sets forth such
   a dreadful state of things, that the very elements would put on a new
   appearance; for the sun would not any more perform its office, and the
   moon would refuse its light to the earth. As God, then, would take away
   all tokens of his favor, so the Prophet, by blood, by darkness and by
   dark clouds, sets forth metaphorically that sorrows by which the minds
   of men would necessarily be possessed.

   Now if any one asks, why by the coming of Christ was God's wrath more
   stirred up against men? for this may seem to be without reason. To this
   I answer, that it was, as it were accidental: for if Christ had been
   received as he ought to have been, if all embraced him with due
   reverence, he would have certainly been the giver, not only of
   spiritual grace, but also of earthly happiness. The felicity of all,
   then, would have in every respect been made complete by the coming of
   Christ, had not their wickedness and ingratitude kindled up anew the
   wrath of God; and we see what a flood of evils burst forth immediately
   after the preaching of the gospel. Now when we consider how severely
   God afflicted his people formerly, we cannot but say that much heavier
   have been the calamities inflicted on the world since the manifestation
   of Christ, -- whence this? Even because the world's ingratitude had
   arrived to its highest point, as indeed it is at this day: for the
   light of the gospel has gone forth again, and God has exhibited himself
   to the world as a Father, and we see how great is the wickedness and
   perversity of men in rejecting the gifts of God; we see some
   contemptuously rejecting the Gospel, and others impelled by satanic
   fury to resist the doctrine of Christ; we see them making a boast of
   their blasphemies, and we see them kindled with cruel rage and
   breathing slaughters against the children of God; we see the world full
   of ungodly men and of the despisers of God; we see an awful contempt of
   God's grace prevailing everywhere: we see such an unbridled
   licentiousness in wickedness, that it ought to make us ashamed of
   ourselves and weary of our life. Since, then, the world is so
   ungrateful for such a favor, is it a wonder that God should show more
   dreadful tokens of his vengeance? For certainly at this day, when we
   closely examine the condition of the world, we find that all are
   miserable, and even those who applaud themselves, and whom the world
   admire as semigods. How can it be otherwise? The common people,
   doubtless, groan under their miseries, and that because God thus
   punishes the contempt of his grace, which he has again offered to us,
   and which is so unworthily rejected. Inasmuch, then, as so base an
   ingratitude on the part of men has provoked God's wrath, it is no
   wonder that the sound of his scourges is everywhere heard: for the
   servant who knows his lord's will and does it not, is worthy, as Christ
   declares, of heavier stripes, (Luke 12.) And what happens through the
   whole world is, that after God has shone by his gospel, after Christ
   has everywhere proclaimed reconciliation, they now openly fall away,
   and show that they prefer having God angry than propitious to them: for
   when the gospel is rejected, what else is it but to declare war against
   God, and to scorn and not to receive the reconciliation which God is
   ready to give, and of which he treats of his own accord with men?

   It is then no wonder that the Prophet says here, that the world would
   be full of darkness after the appearance of Christ, who is the Sun of
   Righteousness, and who has shone upon us with his salvation: but it
   was, as it were, accidental, that God exhibited himself with so much
   severity to the world, when yet it was the acceptable time, when it was
   the day of salvation and of good-will; for the world suffered not that
   to be fulfilled which God had promised to us by the Prophet Joel, nor
   received the Spirit of adoption, when they might have safely fled to
   God; nay, when God was ready to cherish them in his own bosom. But
   since they were refractory and untractable, it was necessary for God to
   visit such perverseness in an unusual manner. It is no wonder then that
   the Prophet says, that in those days there shall be prodigies in heaven
   and on earth, for the sun shall be turned into darkness, etc., before
   it shall come -- the day of Jehovah, great and terrible

   It may be asked what day the Prophet refers to: for he has hitherto
   spoken of the first coming of Christ; and there seems to be some
   inconsistency in this place. I answer, that the Prophet includes the
   whole kingdom of Christ, from the beginning to the end; and this is
   well understood, and in other places we have stated that the Prophets
   common speak in this manner: for when the discourse is concerning
   Christ's kingdom, they sometimes refer to its commencement only, and
   sometimes they speak of its termination; but they often mark out by one
   delineation the whole course of the kingdom of Christ, from its
   beginning to its end; and such is the case here. The Prophet, by
   saying, After those days I will pour out my Spirit,' no doubt meant
   that this, as we have explained, would be fulfilled when Christ should
   commence his kingdom, and make it known through the teaching of the
   gospel: Christ poured out then his Spirit. But as the kingdom of Christ
   is not for a few days, or for a short time, but continues its course to
   the end of the word, the Prophet turns his attention to that day or
   that time, and says, "There shall, in the meanwhile, be the greatest
   calamities: and whosoever shall not flee to the grace of God shall be
   very miserable; they shall never find rest nor comfort, nor the light
   of life, for the world shall be sunk in darkness; and God shall take
   away from the sun, the moon, the elements, and all other aids, the
   tokens of his favor; and he will show himself everywhere to be angry
   and offended with men." The Prophet further shows, that these evils of
   which he speaks would not be for a few days or a few years, but
   perpetual; Before,' he says, the day of Jehovah, great and terrible,
   shall come.' In short, he means that all the scourges of God, which he
   had hitherto mentioned, would be, as it were, preparations to subdue
   the hearts of men, that they might with reverence and submission
   receive Christ. As, therefore, men carry by nature a high spirit, and
   cannot bend their neck to recede the yoke of Christ, hence the Prophet
   says here that they were to be subdued by severe scourges, when God
   would remove all evidences of his love, and fill heaven and earth with
   dread. Thus, then, he would in a manner change the hardness and
   contumacy which is innate in men, that they might know that they had to
   do with God. And, at the same time, the Prophet reminds them, that
   unless they were amended by these scourges, something more dreadful
   remained for them, -- the Judge would at last come from heaven, not
   only to clothe the sun and moon in darkness, but to turn life into
   death. It would, indeed, be far better for the reprobate to die a
   hundred times than always to live and thus to sustain eternal death in
   life itself.

   The Prophet then means, that men persisting in their obstinacy shall
   meet with something more grievous and more ruinous than the evils of
   this life, for they must all at last stand before the tribunal of the
   celestial Judge: for the day of Jehovah, great and terrible, will come.
   He refers, in this sentence, to unbelievers and rebels against God; for
   when Christ shall come, he will be a Redeemer to the godly; no day in
   their whole life will shine on them so pleasantly; so far will this day
   be from bringing terror and fear to them, that they are bidden, while
   expecting it, to lift up their heads, which is a token of cheerfulness
   and joy. But as the Prophet Joel's object was to humble the confident
   pride of the flesh, and as he addressed the refractory and the
   rebellious, it is no wonder that he sets before them what is terrific
   and dreadful.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are now surrounded on every side by so
   many miseries, and as our condition is such, that amidst groans and
   continual sorrows, our life could be hardly sustained without being
   supported by spiritual grace, -- O grant, that we may learn to look on
   the face of thine Anointed, and seek comfort from him, and such a
   comfort as may not engross our minds, or at least not retain us in the
   world, but raise our thoughts to heaven, and daily sell to our hearts
   the testimony of our adoption, and that though many evils must be borne
   by us in this world, we may yet continue to pursue our course, and to
   fight and to strive with invincible perseverance, until having at
   length finished all our struggles, we reach that blessed rest, which
   has been obtained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son, our
   Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Joel 2:32

   32. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of
   the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
   be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord
   shall call.

   32. Et erit, quisquis invocaverit nomen Jehovae liberabitur: quia in
   monte Sion et in Jerusalem erit evasio, sicuti promisit Jehova, et in
   residuis quos Jehova vocaverit.


   We said yesterday that the Prophet denounced future calamities, that he
   might thus stimulate men, distressed by many evils, to seek God: we
   indeed know how tardy we are by nature, except the Lord goads us
   continually. The subject, then, on which we discoursed yesterday tended
   to show, that as so many and so grievous calamities would press on the
   Jews, all would be miserable who fled not to God, and that this
   consolation only would remain to them in their extreme evils: but now
   the Prophet seasonably adds, Whosoever shall call on the name of the
   Lord shall be delivered. Having then stimulated men to seek God, he now
   gives them firm assurance of being saved, provided they in sincerity
   and from the heart fled to God.

   This is indeed a remarkable passage, for God declares that the
   invocation of his name in a despairing condition is a sure port of
   safety. What the Prophet had said was certainly dreadful, -- that the
   whole order of nature would be so changed, that no spark of light would
   appear, and that all places would be filled with darkness. What,
   therefore, he says now is the same as though he declared, that if men
   called on the name of God, life would be found in the grave. They who
   seem to be even in despair, and from whom God seems to have taken away
   every hope of grace, provided they call on the name of God, will be
   saved, as the Prophet declares, though they be in so great a despair,
   and in so deep an abyss. This circumstance ought to be carefully
   noticed; for if any one takes this sentence of the Prophet by itself,
   though then it would not be frigid, it would not yet be so striking;
   but when these two things are joined together, -- that God will be the
   judge of the world, who will not spare the wickedness of men, but will
   execute dreadful vengeance, -- and that yet salvation will be given to
   all who will call on the name of the Lord, we see how efficacious the
   promise is; for God offers life to us in death, and light in the
   darkest grave.

   There is, therefore, great importance in the expression, vhyh ueie,
   Then it shall be;' for the copulative is to be regarded as an adverb of
   time, Then whosoever shall invoke the name of the Lord,' etc. And he
   uses the word "deliver;" for it was needful to show that the saved
   differ nothing from the lost. Had the Prophet used the word "preserve,"
   he would have spoken less distinctly; but now when he promises
   deliverance, he bids us to set up this shield against trials even the
   heaviest; for God possesses power sufficiently great to deliver us,
   provided only we call on him.

   We now then understand what the Prophet had in view: He shows that God
   would have us to call on him not only in prosperity, but also in the
   extreme state of despair. It is the same as though God had called to
   himself the dead, and declared that it was in his power to restore life
   to them and bring them out of the grave. Since then God invites here
   the lost and the dead, there is no reason why even the heaviest
   distresses should preclude an access for us or for our prayers; for we
   ought to break through all these obstacles. The more grievous, then,
   our troubles are, the more confidence we ought to entertain; for God
   offers his grace, not only to the miserable, but also to those in utter
   despair. The Prophet did not threaten a common evil to the Jews, but
   declared that by the coming of Christ all things would be full of
   horror: after this denunciation he now subjoins, Whosoever shall call
   on the name of the Lord shall be delivered.'

   But as Paul cites this place in Romans 10, and extends it to the
   Gentiles, we must inquire in what sense he takes the testimony of the
   Prophet. Paul means to prove that adoption was common to the Gentiles,
   that it was lawful for them to flee to God, and familiarly to invoke
   him as a Father: Whosoever,' he says, shall call on the name of the
   Lord shall be saved.' He hence proves that the Gospel ought to have
   been preached even to the Gentiles, as invocation arises from faith:
   for except God shines on us by his word, we cannot come to him; faith,
   then, is ever the mother of prayer. Paul seems to lay stress on the
   universal particle, Whosoever; as though he said, that Joel did not
   speak of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles, that he testified
   that God would indiscriminately, and without exception, receive all who
   would seek him. But Paul appears to misapply the Prophet's words; for
   Joel no doubt addresses here the people, to whom he was appointed as a
   teacher and prophet. What Paul then applies generally to all mankind
   seems not to have been so intended by the Prophet. But to this there is
   an easy answer; for the Prophets after having spoken of the kingdom of
   Christ, had no doubt this truth in view, that the blessing in the seed
   of Abraham had been promised to all nations; and when he afterwards
   described the miserable state in which the whole world would be, he
   certainly meant to rouse even the Gentiles, who had been aliens from
   the Church, to seek God in common with his elect people: the promise,
   then, which immediately follows, is also addressed to the Gentiles,
   otherwise there would be no consistency in the discourse of the
   Prophet. We therefore see that Paul most fitly accommodates this place
   to his subject: for the main thing to be held is this, that the
   blessing in Christ was promised not only to the children of Abraham but
   also to all the Gentiles. When, therefore, the Prophet describes the
   kingdom of Christ, it is no wonder that he addresses the Jews and
   Gentiles in common: and then, what he said of the state of the world,
   that it would be full of horrible darkness, undoubtedly refers, not to
   the Jews only, but also to the Gentiles. Why was this done, except to
   show that nothing else remains for them but to flee to God? We then see
   that an access is here opened to the Gentiles that they may with one
   consent call on God together with the Jews.

   If there is promised salvation and deliverance to all who shall call on
   the name of the Lord, it follows as Paul reasons that the doctrine of
   the Gospel belongs to the Gentiles also; for their mouths must have
   otherwise been closed, yea, and the mouths of us all: had not God
   himself anticipated us by his word, and exhorted us to pray, we must
   have been dumb. It would have been a great presumption in us to present
   ourselves before God, except he had given us confidence and promised to
   hear us. If then the liberty of praying is common to all, it follows
   that the doctrine of salvation is common to all. We must now also add,
   that as deliverance is promised to all who shall call on the name of
   God, his own power is taken from God, when salvation is sought in any
   other but in him alone: and we know that this is an offering which he
   claims exclusively for himself. If, then, we desire to be delivered,
   the only remedy is, to call on the name of Jehovah.

   He afterwards adds, For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
   deliverance, as Jehovah has promised. The Prophet here intimates, that
   though the people might seem apparently to have been destroyed, yet God
   would be mindful of his covenant so as to gather the remnant. Such,
   indeed, was the slaughter of the people, that no hope whatever,
   according to the flesh, remained; for they were scattered through
   various parts of the world; there was no social body, no distinct
   nation, no civil government, no worship of God. Who, then, could have
   thought that the Church of God would survive? Nay, the probability was,
   that after thirty or fifty years, the name of Abraham and of his seed
   would have become wholly extinct; for they had joined in one body with
   the Chaldees and the Assyrians. That scattering then was, as it were,
   the death of the whole nation. But God, by Joel, declares here, that
   there would yet be deliverance in mount Zion and in Jerusalem; that is,
   "Though I shall for a time exterminate this people, that the land may
   remain desolate, there shall yet be a restoration, and I will again
   gather a certain body, a Church, on mount Zion and in Jerusalem." This
   is the substance.

   We learn from this place, that however much God may afflict his Church,
   it will yet be perpetuated in the world; for it can no more be
   destroyed than the very truth of God, which is eternal and immutable.
   God indeed promises, not only that the state of the Church shall be
   perpetual, but that there will be, as long as the sun and moon shall
   shine in heaven, some people on earth to call on his name. Since it is
   so, it follows, that the Church cannot be utterly subverted or wholly
   perish, however severely and heavily the Lord may chastise it. However
   great then the scattering of the Church may be, the Lord will yet
   gather members, that there may be a people on earth to show, that he
   who is in heaven is true and faithful to his promises. And this truth
   deserves a careful attention; for when we see the Church scattered,
   immediately this doubt creeps into our minds, "Does God intend wholly
   to destroy all his people, -- does he mean to exterminate all the seed
   of the faithful?" Then let this passage be remembered, "In mount Zion
   there will be deliverance," after the Lord shall have punished the
   profane despisers of his name, who abused his patience, and falsely
   professed his name.

   But he adds, As Jehovah has promised, which serves for confirmation;
   for the Prophet bids us here to regard God rather than our own state.
   When indeed we believe our eyes, we cannot but think sometimes that it
   is all over with the Church; for when God inflicts heavy punishment on
   his servants, there seems to us no remedy; and when we believe the
   diseases of the Church to be incurable, our hearts immediately fail us,
   except God's promise comes to our minds. Hence the Prophet recalls our
   thoughts to God, as though he had said, "Judge not of the safety of the
   Church by sight, but stand and rely on the word of God: he has spoken,
   he has said, that the Church shall be perpetual." Let us plant our foot
   on this promise, and never doubt but that the Lord will perform what he
   has declared.

   But it is subjoined by the Prophet as a sort of correction, And in the
   remnant whom Jehovah shall call: and it was necessary to state this
   distinctly, lest hypocrites, as they usually do, abuse what had been
   said. They who occupy high stations in the Church, and pass in name for
   the children of God, swell, we know, with great confidences and boldly
   trifle with God; for they think that he is bound to them, when they
   make a show either of external badges or of profession, in which they
   glory before men: they think this display sufficient. We may indeed
   gather from many parts of Scripture, that the Jews were inflated with
   this false presumption of the flesh, that they imagined God to be bound
   to them. Hence the Prophet shows, that he did not address all the Jews
   indiscriminately, because many of them were spurious children of
   Abraham, and had become degenerated. If then under this pretense alone
   they wished to lay hold on the promise of salvation, the Prophet shows
   that they were excluded from the Church of God, since they were not
   legitimate children, after having departed from the faith and piety of
   their father Abraham. He therefore mentions remnant: and by this word
   be means, in short, that the whole multitude could not be saved, but
   only a small number.

   When therefore we speak of the salvation of the Church, we ought not to
   gather into one bundle all who profess themselves to be the children of
   God; for we see that hardly one in a hundred worship God in truth and
   without hypocrisy, for the greater part abuse his name. We see, at this
   day, how dishonest is the boasting of the Papists; for they think that
   the Church of God dwells among them, and they scorn us because we are
   few. When we say that the Church of God is to be known by the word and
   the pure administration of the sacraments, "Indeed," they say, "could
   God have forsaken so many people among whom the gospel has been
   preached?" They think that after Christ has been once made known, his
   grace remains fixed, and cannot by any means be taken away whatever may
   be the impiety of men. Since then the Papists so shamefully lay claim
   to the name of Church, because they are many in number, it is no wonder
   that the Prophet, who had the same contest with the Jews and
   Israelites, had here expressly mentioned a remnant; as though he said,
   "In vain do the ungodly boast of God's name, since he regards them not
   as his people." The same truth we observe in Psalm 15, and in Psalm 24;
   where the citizens of the Church are described; they are not those who
   pride themselves on external symbols, but who worship God with a
   sincere heart, and deal honestly with their neighbors; such dwell on
   the mountain of God. It was not a difficult thing for hypocrites to
   thrust themselves into the sanctuary, and to present there their
   sacrifices to God; but the Prophet shows that none are owned by God,
   but those who have a sincere heart and pure hands. So also in this
   place Joel says, that this Church indeed would be saved, but not the
   vast multitude, -- who then? the remnant only.

   But the clause which follows must be noticed, Whom Jehovah shall call.
   We have already seen that the Church of God consists often of a very
   small number; for God counts not any his children, but those who devote
   themselves sincerely and from the heart to his service, as Paul says
   Whosoever calls on the name of God, let him depart from iniquity;' and
   many such are not found in the world.

   But it is not enough to hold, that the Church of God is only in the
   remnant; it must be also added that the remnant abide in God's Church
   for no other reason but that the Lord has called them. Whence then is
   it that there is a portion in the Church, which shall remain safe,
   while the whole world seems to be doomed to destruction? It is from the
   calling of God. And there is no doubt but that the Prophet means by the
   word, call, gratuitous election. The Lord is indeed often said to call
   men, when he invites them by the voice of his gospel; but there is what
   surpasses that, a hidden call, when God destines for himself those whom
   he purposes to save. There is then an inward call, which dwells in the
   secret counsel of God; and then follows the call, by which he makes us
   really the partakers of his adoption. Now the Prophet means, that those
   who will be the remnant shall not stand by their own power, but because
   they have been called from above, that is, elected. But that the
   election of God is not to be separated from the outward call, I allow;
   and yet this order ought to be maintained, that God, before he
   testifies his election to men, adopts them first to himself in his own
   secret counsel. The meaning is, that calling is here opposed to all
   human merits, and also to virtue and human efforts; as though he said,
   "Men attain not this for themselves, that they continue a remnant and
   are safe, when God visits the sins of the world; but they are preserved
   by his grace alone, because they have been chosen." Paul also speaks of
   the remnant in Romans 11, and wisely considers that passage, I have
   kept for myself seven thousand.' [1 Kings 19:18.]

   It is then God's peculiar province to keep those who fail not: and
   hence Paul says that they are the remnant of grace; for if God's mercy
   were taken away, there would be no remnant among the whole human race.
   All, we indeed know, are worthy of death, without any difference: it is
   therefore the election of God alone which makes the difference between
   some and others. Thus we see that the gratuitous goodness of God is
   extolled by the Prophet, when he says that a remnant shall be saved,
   who shall be called by the Lord: for it is not in the power of men to
   keep themselves unless they are elected; and the gratuitous goodness of
   God is the security as it were of their salvation. Now follows --

   Chapter 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:1-3

   1. For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring
   again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

   1. Quia ecce, diebus illis et tempore illo, quo convertam captivitatem
   Jehudah et Jerusalem;

   2 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the
   valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and
   for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and
   parted my land.

   2 Et congregabo (tunc congregabo) omnes gentes, et descendere faciam in
   vallem Jesephat, et disceptabo illic cum ipsis super populo meo et
   super haereditate mea Israel, quia disperserunt inter gentes et partiti
   sunt terram meam (addemus et hunc etiam versum.)

   3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an
   harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.

   3 Et super populo meo jecerunt sortem et posuerunt, puerum pro scorto
   (hoc est, addixerunt pro scorto) et pullam vendiderunt pro vino ut
   biberunt.


   The Prophet confirms in these words what he had before taught
   respecting the restoration of the Church; for it was a thing difficult
   to be believed: when the body of the people was so mutilated, when
   their name was obliterated, when all power was abolished, when the
   worship of God also, together with the temple, was subverted, when
   there was no more any form of a kingdom, or even of any civil
   government, who could have thought that God had any concern for a
   people in such a wretched condition? It is then no wonder that the
   Prophet speaks so much at large of the restoration of the Church; he
   did so, that he might more fully confirm what would have otherwise been
   incredible.

   He therefore says, Behold, in those days, and at that time, in which I
   shall restore the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I shall then make
   all Gentiles to come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And the
   Prophet says this, because the Jews were then hated by all people, and
   were the execration and the dregs of the whole world. As many nations
   as were under heaven, so many were the enemies of the Jews. A fall then
   inter despair was easy, when they saw the whole world incensed against
   them: "Though God may wish to redeem us, there are yet so many
   obstacles, that we must necessarily perish; not only the Assyrians are
   enraged against us, but we have found even greater hatred in our own
   neighbors." We, indeed, know that the Moabites, the Ammonites, the
   Syrians, the Sidonians, the Idumeans, the Philistines, and, in short,
   all in the surrounding countries, were very hostile to the Jews. Seeing
   then every access to their land was closed up to the Jews, it was
   difficult to entertain any hope of deliverance, though God encouraged
   them. For this reason the Prophet now says, that God would be the judge
   of the whole world, and that it was in his purpose and power to call
   together all the Gentiles, as though he said, "Let not the number and
   variety of enemies frighten you: the Assyrians alone, I know, are not
   your enemies, but also all your neighbors; but when I undertake the
   defense of your cause, I shall be alone sufficient to protect you; and
   however much all people may oppose, they shall not prevail. Then
   believe that I shall be a sufficient defender, and shall deliver you
   from the hand of all the nations " We now perceive the Prophet's design
   when he declares, that God would come to the valley of Jehoshaphat, and
   there call together all nations.

   But the Prophet says, In those days, and at that time, when the Lord
   shall restore the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, etc. This time the
   Jews limit to their return: they therefore think, that when liberty to
   return was granted them by Cyrus and Darius, what the Prophet declares
   here was then fulfilled; Christian doctors apply this prediction to the
   coming of Christ; but both interpret the words of the Prophet otherwise
   than the drift of the passage requires. The Prophet, no doubt, speaks
   here of the deliverance we have just noticed, and at the same time
   includes the kingdom of Christ; and this, as we have seen in other
   parts, is very commonly done. While then the prophets testify that God
   would be the redeemer of his people, and promise deliverance from
   Babylonian exile, they lead the faithful, as it were, by a continuous
   train or course, to the kingdom of Christ. For what else was the Jewish
   restoration, but a prelude of that true and real redemptions afterwards
   effected by Christ? The Prophet then does not speak only of the coming
   of Christ, or of the return of the Jews, but includes the whole of
   redemption, which was only begun when the Lord restored his people from
   the Babylonian exile; it will then go on from the first coming of
   Christ to the last day; as though he said, "When God will redeem his
   people, it will not be a short or momentary benefit, but he will
   continue his favor until he shall visit with punishment all the enemies
   of his Church." In a word, the Prophet here shows, that God will not be
   a half Redeemer, but will continue to work until he completes
   everything necessary for the happy state of his Church, and makes it in
   every respect perfect. This is the import of the whole.

   We also see that the Prophet Haggai speaks in the same manner of the
   second temple, -- that the glory of the second temple shall be greater
   than that of the first, (Haggai 2) He, however referred, no doubt, to
   the prophecy of Ezekiel; and Ezekiel speaks of the second temple, which
   was to be built after the return of the people from exile. Be it so,
   yet Ezekiel did not confine to four or five ages what he said of the
   second temple: on the contrary he meant that the favor of God would be
   continued to the coming of Christ: so also Joel means here, when he
   says, When God shall restore the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, he
   will then call together all the nations; as though he said, "God will
   pour out not a small portion of grace, but will become the complete
   Redeemer of his people; and when the whole world shall rise against
   him, he will yet prevail; he will undertake the cause of his Church,
   and will secure the salvation of his people. Whosoever then will
   attempt to delay or hinder the restoration of the Church, shall by no
   means succeed; for the Lord, the defender of his people, will judge all
   nations."

   Let us now see why the Prophet particularly mentions the valley of
   Jehoshaphat. Many think that valley to be intended, which was called
   the Valley of Blessing, where Jehoshaphat obtained a signal and a
   memorable victory, when yet he was not provided with large forces, and
   when many nations conspired against him. Though Jehoshaphat fought
   against a large army with a few people, he yet wonderfully succeeded;
   and the people there presented thanks to God, and gave a name to the
   place. Hence, many think that this valley is mentioned, that the
   Prophet might remind the Jews how wonderfully they were saved; for
   their enemies had come for the very purpose of destroying the whole of
   God's people, and thought that this was wholly in their power. The
   memory then of this history must have animated the minds of the godly
   with a good hope; for God then undertook the cause of a small number
   against a vast multitude; yea, against many and powerful nations. And
   this view seems to me probable. Some place this valley of Jehoshaphat
   half way between the Mount of Olives and the city; but how probable
   their conjecture is I know not.

   Unquestionably, with regard to this passage, their opinion, in my
   judgment, is the most correct, who think that there is here a recalling
   to mind of God's favor, which may in all ages encourage the faithful to
   entertain hope of their salvation. Some, however, prefer to take the
   word as an appellative; and no doubt yhvspht ieushaphath means the
   judgment of God; and so they render it, "The valley of the judgment of
   God." If this is approved I do not oppose. And, doubtless, though it be
   a proper name, and the Prophet speak here of that holy King, to
   encourage the Jews to follow his example, he yet alludes, no doubt, to
   the judgment of God, or to the contest which he would undertake for the
   sake of his people: for it immediately follows vk sphtty mm sm
   uneshaphathti omem shim, "And I will contend with them there:" and this
   verb is derived from spht shephath. Hence also, if it be the proper
   name of a place, and taken from that of the King, the Prophet here
   meant, that its etymology should be considered; as though he said, "God
   will call all nations to judgment, and for this end, that he may dwell
   in the midst of his people, and really testify and prove this."

   Some apply this passage to the last judgment, but in too strained a
   manner. Hence also has arisen the figment, that the whole world shall
   be assembled in the valley of Jehoshaphat: but the world, we know,
   became infected with such delirious things, when the light of sound
   doctrine was extinguished; and no wonder, that the world should be
   fascinated with such gross comments, after it had so profaned the
   worship of God. [13]

   But with respect to the intention of the Prophets he, no doubt,
   mentions here the valley of Jehoshaphat, that the Jews might entertain
   the hope that God would be the guardian of their safety; for he says
   everywhere that he would dwell among them, as we have also seen in the
   last chapter, "And God will dwell in the midst of you." So also now he
   means the same, I will assemble all nations, and make them to come down
   to the valley of Jehoshaphat; that is, though the land shall for a time
   be uncultivated and waste, yet the Lord will gather his people, and
   show that he is the judge of the whole world; he will raise a trophy in
   the land of Judah, which will be nobler than if the people had ever
   been safe and entire: for how much soever all nations may strive to
   destroy the remnant, as we know they did, though few remained; yet God
   will sit in the valley of Jehoshaphat, he will have there his own
   tribunal, that he may keep his people, and defend them from all
   injuries. At the same time, what I have before noticed must be borne in
   mind; for he names here the valley of Jehoshaphat rather than
   Jerusalem, because of the memorable deliverance they had there, when
   God discomfited so many people, when great armies were in an instant
   destroyed and without the aid of men. Since God then delivered his
   people at that time in an especial manner through his incredible power,
   it is no wonder that he records here the name of the valley of
   Jehoshaphat.

   I will contend, he says, with them there for my people, and for my
   heritage, Israel. By these words the Prophet shows how precious to God
   is the salvation of his chosen people; for it is no ordinary thing for
   God to condescend to undertake their cause, as though he himself were
   offended and wronged; and God contends, because he would have all
   things in common with us. We now then, see the reason of this
   contention, -- even because God so regards the salvation of his people,
   that he deems himself wronged in their person; as it is said in another
   place, "He who toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye". And to
   confirm his doctrine still more, the Prophet adds, For mine heritage,
   Israel. God calls Israel here his heritage, to strengthen distressed
   minds, and also to comfort them; for if the Jews had only fixed their
   minds on their own state, they could not but think themselves unworthy
   of being regarded by God; for they were deemed abominable by all
   nations; and we also know that they were severely chastised for having
   departed from all godliness and for having, as it were, wholly
   alienated themselves from God. Since, then, they were like a corrupted
   body, they could not but despond in their adversity: but the Prophet
   here comes to their assistance, and brings forward the word heritage,
   as though he said, "God will execute judgment for you, not that ye are
   worthy, but because he has chosen you: for he will never forget the
   covenant which he made with your father Abraham " We see, then, the
   reason he mentions heritage: it was, that the Jews might not despair on
   account of their sins; and at the same time he commends, as before, the
   gratuitous mercy of God, as though he had said, "The reason for your
   redemption is no other, but that God has allotted to himself the
   posterity of Abraham and designed them to be his peculiar people " What
   remains we must defer until to-morrow.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou not only invites us continually by
   the voice of thy Gospel to seek thee, but also offerest to us thy Son
   as our Mediator, through whom an access to thee is open, that we may
   find thee a propitious Father, -- O grant, that relying on thy kind
   invitation, we may through life exercise ourselves in prayer: and as so
   many evils disturb us on all sides, and so many wants distress and
   oppress us, may we be led more earnestly to call on thee, and, in the
   meantime, be never wearied in this exercise of prayer; that, being
   through life heard by thee, we may at length be gathered to thy eternal
   kingdom, where we shall enjoy that salvation which thou hast promised
   to us, and of which also thou daily testifiest to us by thy Gospel, and
   be for ever united to thy only begotten Son, of whom we are how
   members; that we may be partakers of all the blessings, which he has
   obtained for us by his death. Amen.

   Lecture Forty-seventh.

   We said in our yesterday's Lecture, that God proves the singular love
   he has to his Church by condescending to undertake her cause, and
   contend as a worldly man would do for his paternal inheritance. He
   says, that his heritage, Israel, had been dispersed among the nations;
   as though he said, that it was an intolerable thing that enemies
   should, like robbers, thus divide his heritage. He speaks first of the
   people, then of the land; for God, as it is well known, consecrated the
   land to himself, and he would not have it occupied by profane nations.
   There was then a twofold sacrilege, -- the people were carried away
   into distant lands, and others were sent to inhabit and possess their
   land, which God had destined for his children and elect people.

   There follows now another indignity still greater; for they cast lot on
   God's people, -- On my people they have cast lot, and prostituted a boy
   for a harlot, and a girl have they sold for wine, that they might
   drink. By these words the Prophet enhances the injury done them; for
   the Jews had been reproachfully treated. Some measure of humanity is
   mostly shown when men are sold; but the Prophet here complains in the
   person of God, that the Jews had been exposed to sale, as though they
   were the off scourings of mankind, and of no account. They have cast
   lots he says; and this was to show contempt; and the Prophet expresses
   more clearly what he meant, and says, that a boy had been given for a
   harlot, and a girl for wine. Some consider the Prophet as saying, that
   boys were prostituted to base and scandalous purposes; but I prefer
   another view, -- that the enemies sold them for a mean price to gratify
   their gluttony, or their lust; as though the Prophet had said, that the
   Jews had to endure a grievous reproach by being set to sale, as they
   say, and that at the lowest price. He farther adds another kind of
   contempt; for whatever price the enemies procured by selling, they
   spent it either on harlot or on feasting. We hence see that a twofold
   injury is here mentioned, -- the Jews had been so despised as not to be
   regarded as men, and had been sold not for the usual prices, but had
   been disposed of in contempt by their enemies almost for nothing; --
   and the other reproach was, that the price obtained for them was
   afterwards spent on gluttony and whoredom: yet this people was sacred
   to God. Now this contumelious treatment, the Prophet says, God would
   not endure, but would avenge such a wrong as if done to himself. This
   is then the meaning.

   But the reason which induces me thus to interpret the Prophet is
   because he says that a girl was sold for wine, as the boy for a harlot;
   and the construction of the Prophet's words is the same. It is indeed
   certain that in the latter clause the Prophet meant nothing else but
   that the price was wickedly spent for vile and shameful purposes; then
   the former clause must be understood in the same way. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:4-6

   4. Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the
   coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye
   recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon
   your own head;

   4. Atque etiam, quid vobis mecum Tyre et Sidon, et cuncti termini
   Palestinae? An mercedem vobis rependitis mihi? Etsi confertis hoc in
   me, velox (subito) rependam mercedem vestram in caput vestrum;

   5. Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into
   your temples my goodly pleasant things:

   5. Quia argentum meum et aurum meum abstulistis, et desiderabilia mea
   bona transtulistis in templa vestra (alii, palatia.)

   6. The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye
   sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their
   border.

   6. Et filios Jehudah et filios Jerusalem vendidistis filiis Graecorum,
   ut elongaretis eos a termino suo (hoc est, procul abduceretis eos a
   finibus suis.)


   God expostulates here with Tyre and Sidon, and other neighboring
   nations, and shows that they vexed his people without cause Had they
   been provoked some excuse might have been made; but since they made war
   of their own accord, the wrong was doubled. This is what God means
   these words. What have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Sidon? He indeed
   continues the subject before explained: but he speaks of the concern
   here as hid own; he seems not now to undertake the protection of his
   own people, but detents his own cause. "What have ye to do with me?" he
   says. God then interposes himself; as though he said, that the Syrians
   and Sidonians were not only called by him to judgment because they had
   unjustly wronged his people, and brought many troubles on men deserving
   no such things; but he says also, that he stood up in his own defense.
   "What have I to do with you, O Syrians and Sidonians?" as we say in
   French, Qu'avons-nous a desmeller? (what have we to decide?) Now the
   Prophet had this in view, that the Syrians and Sidonians became
   voluntary enemies to the Jews, when they had no dispute with them; and
   this, as we have said, was less to be borne. "What then have ye to do
   with me, O Syrians and Sidonians? Do I owe anything to you? Am I under
   any obligation to you? Do ye repay me my recompense?" that is, "Can you
   boast of any reason or just pretense for making, war on my people?" He
   then means, that there had been no wrong done to the Syrians and
   Sidonians, which they could now retaliate, but that they made an attack
   through their own wickedness, and were only impelled by avarice or
   cruelty thus to harass the miserable Jews: "Ye repay not," he says, "a
   recompense to me; for ye cannot pretend that any wrong has been done to
   you by me."

   But if ye repay this to me, he says, I will swiftly return the
   recompense on your head. gml gimel means not only to repay, as the
   Hebrew scholars ever render it, but also to confer, to bestow,
   (conferre, ut loquuntur Latine) as it has been stated in another place.
   What shall I repay to the Lord for all the things which he has
   recompensed to me?' This is the common version; but it is an improper
   and inconsistent mode of speaking. David no doubt refers to God's
   benefits; then it is, What shall I repay for all the benefits which the
   Lord has bestowed on me?' Then he who first does wrong, or bestows
   good, is said to recompense; and this is the sense in this place. If
   ye,' he says, thus deal with me, "swiftly", mhrh mere suddenly (for the
   word is to be taken as an adverb,) will I return recompense on your
   head;' that is, "Ye shall not be unpunished, since ye have acted so
   unjustly with me and my people." We now perceive the whole meaning of
   the Prophet: He enhances the crime of the Syrians and Sidonians,
   because they willfully distressed the Jews, and joined themselves to
   their foreign enemies, for the purpose of seizing on a part of the
   spoil. As, then, vicinity softened not their minds, their inhumanity
   was on this account more fully proved. But, as I have said, the Lord
   here places himself between the two parties, to intimate, that he
   performs his own proper office when he takes care of the safety of his
   Church.

   He afterwards shows that this wickedness should not be unpunished -- If
   ye deal thus with me, he says, I shall swiftly (suddenly) return the
   recompense on your heads. This passage contains a singular consolation;
   for God declares that whatever evils the faithful endure belong to him,
   and also that he will not suffer those under his protection and defense
   to be distressed with impunity, but will quickly return recompense on
   the heads of those who unjustly injure his heritage. We now understand
   the Prophet's design: he doubtless intended to support the minds of the
   godly with this thought, -- that their afflictions are objects of
   concern with God and that he will shortly be the avenger of them,
   however necessary it may be that they should for a time be thus
   violently and reproachfully treated by wicked men.

   Let us now proceed: He says that their silver and their gold had been
   taken away by the Syrians and the Sidonians. All who were the neighbors
   of that people, no doubt, derived gain from their calamity, as is
   usually the case. They were at first ill disposed towards them; there
   was then a new temptation; they gaped after booty: and they showed
   themselves openly their enemies, when they saw that there was hope of
   gain. Such was the case with the Syrians and Sidonians. There is no
   doubt, but that they sedulously courted the favor of the Assyrians,
   that they helped them with provisions and other things, that they might
   partake of the spoil. It was, therefore, no wonder that gold and silver
   was taken away by them, for the carriage of them to Assyria would have
   been tedious: and, as I have just hinted, it is usually the case, that
   conquerors gratify those by whom they have been assisted. Many extend
   this plunder generally to the whole wealth of the people; that is, that
   the enemies plundered what gold and silver there was in Judea, and that
   the Sidonians got a portion of it for themselves. But there seems to
   have been a special complaint, that the sacred vessels of the temple
   were taken away by the Syrians and Sidonians: I therefore prefer to
   render the word, temples, rather than palaces. Some say, Ye have
   carried away my silver and my gold to your palaces.' Though the word is
   capable of two meanings, yet the Prophet, I have no doubt, refers here
   to the temples. The Syrians, then, and the Sidonians profaned the
   silver and the gold of the temple by dedicating them to their idols;
   they adorned their idols with spoils taken from the only true God. This
   was the reason why God was so exceedingly displeased. There was,
   indeed, a cause why God, as we have said, contended for the whole
   nation of Israel: but it was a far more heinous wrong to spoil the
   temple, and to strip it of its ornaments, and then to adorn idols with
   its sacred vessels; for God was thus treated with scorn; and in
   contempt of him, the Syrians and Sidonians built, as it were, a trophy
   of victory in their own dens, where they performed sacrilegious acts in
   worshipping fictitious gods.

   Ye have taken away, he says, my gold and silver, and my desirable good
   things. God speaks here after the manner of men; for it is certain that
   even under the law he stood in no need of gold or silver, or of other
   precious things; he wished the temple to be adorned with vessels and
   other valuable furniture for the sake of the ignorant (rudis -- rude)
   people; for the Jews could not have been preserved in pure and right
   worship, had not God assisted their weak faith by these helps.
   (adminiculis -- props, aids) But yet, as obedience is acceptable to
   him, he says that whatever was an ornament in the temple was a
   desirable thing to him; while, at the same time, by speaking thus, he
   put on, as I have said, a character not his own, as he has no need of
   such things, nor is he delighted with them. We ought not, indeed, to
   imagine God to be like a child, who takes delight in gold and silver
   and such things; but what is said here was intended for the benefit of
   the people, that they might know that God approved of that worship, for
   it was according to his command. He therefore calls every thing that
   was in the temple desirable, Ye have, he says, carried away into your
   temples my desirable good things.

   It follows, And the children of Judah, and the children of Jerusalem,
   have ye sold to the children of the Grecians [14] . There is here
   another complaint subjoined, -- that the Syrians and Sidonians had been
   sacrilegious towards God, that they had cruelly treated God's afflicted
   people. In the last verse, God inveighed against the Syrians, and
   Sidonians for having prostituted to their idols gold and silver stolen
   from him; he now again returns to the Jews themselves, who, he says,
   had been sold to the children of the Grecians; that is, to people
   beyond the sea: for as Javan passed into Europe, he includes under that
   name the nations beyond the sea. And he says, that they sold the Jews
   to the Greeks that they might drive them far from their own borders, so
   that there might be no hope of return. Here the cruelty of the Syrians
   and Sidonians becomes more evident; for they took care to drive those
   wretched men far away, that no return to their country might be open to
   them, but that they might be wholly expatriated.

   We now perceive what the Prophet had in view: He intended that the
   faithful though trodden under foot by the nations, should yet have
   allayed their grief by some consolation, and know that they were not
   neglected by God; and that though he connived at their evils for a
   time, he would yet be their defender, and would contend for them as for
   his own heritage, because they had been so unjustly treated. He
   afterwards adds --

   Joel 3:7

   7. Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold
   them, and will return your recompense upon your own head:

   7. Ecce ego excitabo eos e loco in quem vendidistis eos, et rependam
   mercedem vestram in caput vestrum.


   The Prophet declares here more fully and expressly, that God had not so
   deserted the Jews, but that he intended, in course of time, to stretch
   forth his hand to them again. It was indeed a temporary desertion: but
   it behaved the faithful in the meantime to rely on this assurance, --
   that God purposed again to restore his people: and of this the Prophet
   now speaks, Behold, he says, I will raise them from the place unto
   which ye have sold them; as though he said "Neither distance of place,
   nor the intervening sea, will hinder me from restoring my people." As
   then the Syrians and Sidonians thought that the Jews were precluded a
   return to their country, because they were taken away into distant
   parts of the world, God says that this would be no obstacle in his way
   to collect again his Church.

   But it may he asked, When has this prediction been fulfilled? as we
   indeed know that the Jews have never returned to their own country: for
   shortly after their return from exile, they were in various ways
   diminished; and at length the most grievous calamities followed, which
   consumed the greatest part of the people. Since this then has been the
   condition of that nation, we ought to inquire whether Christ has
   collected the Jews, who had been far dispersed. We indeed know that
   they were then especially scattered; for the land of Judea never ceased
   to be distressed by continual wars until Jerusalem was destroyed, and
   the people were almost wholly consumed. Since then it has been so, when
   can we say that this prediction has been fulfilled? Many explain the
   words allegorically, and say, that the Prophet speaks of apostles and
   martyrs, who, through various persecutions, were driven into different
   parts; but this is a strained view. I therefore do not doubt, but that
   here he refers to a spiritual gathering: and it is certain that God,
   since the appearance of Christ, has joined together his Church by the
   bond of faith; for not only that people have united together in one,
   but also the Gentiles, who were before alienated from the Church, and
   had no intercourse with it, have been collected into one body. We hence
   see, that what the Prophet says has been spiritually fulfilled; even
   the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have been redeemed
   by the Lord, and restored again, not on foot or by sea; for Jerusalem
   has been built everywhere as it is said in Zechariah.

   I will therefore gather them, he says; and he adds, I will return
   recompense on your head He again confirms what he said before, -- that
   though the ungodly should exult, while ruling over the children of God,
   their cruelty would not be unpunished; for they shall find that the
   Church is never neglected by God; though he may subject it to various
   troubles, and exercise its patience, and even chastise it, he will yet
   be ever its defender. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:8

   8. And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the
   children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people
   far off: for the LORD hath spoken it

   8. Et vendam filios vestros et filias vestras in manum filiorum
   Jehadah, et vendent eos Sabaeis, genti lonquinquae, quia Jehovah
   loquutus est.


   The Prophet describes here a wonderful change: the Syrians and
   Sidonians did sell the Jews; but who is to be the seller now? God
   himself will take this office, -- I, he says, will sell your children,
   as though he said, "The Jews shall subdue you and reduce you to
   bondage," -- by whose authority? "It shall be, as if they bought you at
   my hands." He means that this servitude would be legitimate; and thus
   he makes the Jews to be different from the Syrians and Sidonians, who
   had been violent robbers, and unjustly seized on what was not their
   own: and hence the manner of the sale is thus described, -- "I myself
   shall be the author of this change, and the thing shall be done by my
   authority, as if I had interposed my own name;" and the Jews themselves
   shall sell, he says, your sons and your daughters to the Sabeans, a
   distant nation; that is, the people of the East: for the Prophet, I
   doubt not, by mentioning a part for the whole, meant here to designate
   Eastern nations, such as the Persians and Medes; but he says, that the
   Tyrians and Sidonians shall be driven to the meet distant countries;
   for the Sabeans were very far distant from the Phoenician Sea, and were
   known as being very nigh the Indians. [15]

   But it may be asked here, When has God executed this judgment? for the
   Jews never possessed such power as to be able to subdue neighboring
   nations, and to sell them at pleasure to unknown merchants. It would
   indeed be foolish and puerile to insist here on a literal fulfillment:
   at the same time, I do not say, that the Prophet speaks allegorically;
   for I am disposed to keep from allegories, as there is in them nothing
   sound nor solid: but I must yet say that there is a figurative language
   used here, when it is said, that the Syrians and Sidonians shall be
   sold and driven here and there into distant countries, and that this
   shall be done for the sake of God's chosen people and his Church, as
   though the Jews were to be the sellers. When God says, "I will sell,"
   it is not meant that he is to descend from heaven for the purpose of
   selling, but that he will execute judgment on them; and then the second
   clause, -- that they shall be sold by the Jews, derives its meaning
   from the first; and this cannot be a common sake, as if the Jews were
   to receive a price and make a merchandise of them. But God declares
   that the Jews would be the sellers, because in this manner he signifies
   his vengeance for the wrong done to them; that is, by selling them to
   the Sabeans, a distant nation. We further know, that the changes which
   then followed were such that God turned upside down nearly the whole
   world; for he drove the Syrian and the Sidonians to the most distant
   countries. No one could have thought that this was done for the sake of
   the Jews, who were hated and abominated by all. But yet God declares,
   that he would do this from regard to his Church even sell the Syrians
   and the Sidonians, though it was commonly unknown to men; for it was
   the hidden judgment of God. But the faithful who had been already
   taught that God would do this, were reminded by the event how precious
   to God is his heritage, since he avenges those wrongs, the memory of
   which had long before been buried. This then is the import of the
   whole. The Prophet now subjoins --

   successors. On the capture of Tyre by the Grecian monarch, 13,000 of
   the inhabitants were sold into slavery. When he took Gaza also, he put
   10,000 of the citizens to death and sold the rest, with the women and
   children, for slaves." -- Dr. Henderson.

   Joel 3:9-11

   9. Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty
   men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:

   9. Publicate hoc in Gentibus, sanctificate proelium, excitate robustos,
   venient, ascendent omnes viri bellatores.

   10. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into
   spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

   10. Concidite vomeres vestros in gladios et falces vestras in lanceas;
   debilis dicat, Ego sum robustus.

   11. Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
   yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come
   down, O Lord.

   11. Congregamini et venite omnes gentes, congregamini in circuitu (hoc
   est, undique congregamini;) illic prosteruet Jehova fortes tuos.


   Some think these words were announced lest the people, being terrified
   by their evils, should become wholly dejected; and they elicit this
   meaning, -- that God placed this dreadful spectacle of evils before
   their eyes, that the Jews might prepare and strengthen themselves for
   enduring them; that though nations should everywhere rise up, they
   might yet abide arm in the hope, that God would be the defender of his
   own Church. But the Prophet, I doubt not, continues the same discourse,
   and denounces war on the heathen nations, who had molested the Church
   with so many troubles; Publish this, he says, among the nations,
   proclaim war, rouse the strong; let them come, let them ascend: and we
   know how necessary it was by such means to confirm what he had
   previously said: for the ungodly are moved by no threats, nay, they
   laugh to scorn all God's judgments; while the faithful yielding to
   their evils, can hardly raise up their minds, even though God promises
   to be a helper to them. Except, then, the matter had been set forth as
   painted before their eyes they would not have experienced the power of
   consolation. Hence the lively representation we see here was intended
   for this end, -- that the people, being led to view the whole event,
   might entertain hope of their future salvation, while they now saw God
   collecting his army, and mustering his forces to punish the enemies of
   his Church. The faithful, then not only hearing by mere words that this
   would be, but also seeing, as it were, with their eyes what the Lord
   sets forth by a figure, and a lively representation, were more
   effectually impressed and felt more assured that God would become at
   length their deliverer.

   We now then see why the Prophet here bids war to be everywhere
   announced and proclaimed, and also why he bids the strong to assemble,
   and all warlike men to ascend; as though he said, "The Lord will not
   disappoint you with empty words, but will come provided with an army to
   save you. When ye hear, then, that he will be the author of your
   salvation, think also that all nations are in his power, and that the
   whole world can in a moment be roused up by his rod, so that all its
   forces may from all quarters come together, and all the power of the
   world meet in obedience to him. Know, then, that being provided with
   his forces, he comes not to you naked, nor feeds you with mere words,
   as they are wont to do who have no help to give but words only: this is
   not what God does; for he can even to-day execute what he has
   denounced; but he stays for the ripened time. In the meanwhile, give
   him his honor, and know that there is not wanting the means to protect
   you, if he wished; but he would have you for a time to be subject to
   the cross and to tribulations that he may at length avenge the wrongs
   done to you."

   It may be now asked who are the nations meant by the Prophet? for he
   said before, that God would visit all nations with punishment, whereas,
   there was then no nation in the world friendly to the Jews. But in this
   there is nothing inconsistent; for God caused all the enemies of the
   Church to assail one another on every side, and to destroy themselves
   with mutual slaughters. Hence, when he designed to take vengeance on
   the Tyrians and Sidonians, he roused up the Persian and Medes; and when
   he purposed to punish the Persian and Medes, he called the Greeks into
   Asia; and he had before brought low the Assyrians. Thus he armed all
   nations, but each in its turn; and one after the other underwent the
   punishment they deserved. And so the expression of the Prophet must not
   be taken in a too restricted sense, as though the Lord would at the
   same time collect an army from the whole world, to punish the enemies
   of his Church; but that he rouses the whole world, so that some suffer
   punishment from others; and yet no enemy of the Church remains
   unpunished. We now perceive the Prophet's objects in saying, Publish
   this among the nations; that is, God will move dreadful tumults through
   the whole world, and will do this for the sake of his Church: for
   though he exposes his people to many miseries, he will yet have the
   remnant, as we have before seen, to be saved.

   He afterwards adds, Beat your plowshares into swords. When Isaiah and
   Micah prophesied of the kingdom of Christ, they said, Beat your swords
   into pruninghooks, and your spears into plowshares', (Isaiah 2:4, Micah
   4:3.) This sentence is now inverted by Joel. The words of Isaiah and
   Micah were intended figuratively to show that the world would be at
   peace when Christ reconciled men to God, and taught them to cultivate
   brotherly kindness. But the Prophet says here, that there would be
   turbulent commotions everywhere, so that there would be no use made of
   the plough or of the pruninghook; husbandmen would cease from their
   labor, the land would remain waste; for this is the case when a whole
   country is exposed to violence; no one dares go out, all desert their
   fields, cultivation is neglected. Hence the Prophet says, Turn your
   plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears;' that is,
   field labor will cease, and all will strenuously apply themselves to
   war. And let the weak say, I am strong, for there will then be no
   exemption from war. Excuses, we know, availed formerly on the ground of
   age or disease, when soldiers were collected; and if any one could have
   pleaded disease, he was dismissed; but the Prophet says, that there
   will be no exemption then; "God", he says, "will excuse none, he will
   compel all to become warriors, he will even draw out all the sick from
   their beds; all will be constrained to put on arms". It hence appears
   how ardently the Lord loves his Church, since he spares no nations and
   no people, and exempts none from punishment; for all who have vexed the
   Church must necessarily receive their recompense. Since then God so
   severely punishes the enemies of his Church, he thereby gives a
   singular evidence of his paternal love to us.

   At length he concludes, There will Jehovah overthrow thy mighty ones.
   Though the Prophet uses the singular number, "thy", he no doubt refers
   to the whole earth; as though he said, "Whatever enemies there may be
   to my people, I will cut them down, however strong they may be." We now
   perceive that everything the Prophet has hitherto said has been for
   this end -- to show, that God takes care of the safety of his Church,
   even in its heaviest afflictions, and that he will be the avenger of
   wrongs, after having for a time tried the patience of his people and
   chastised their faults -- that there will be a turn in the state of
   things, so that the condition of the Church will be ever more
   desirable, even under its greatest evils, than of those whom the Lord
   bears with and indulges, and on whom he does not so quickly take
   vengeance.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are assailed on every side by enemies,
   and as not only the wicked according to the flesh are incensed against
   us, but Satan also musters his forces and contrives in various ways to
   ruin us, -- O grant, that we being furnished with the courage thy
   Spirit bestows, may fight to the end under thy guidance and never be
   wearied under any evils. And may we, at the same time, be humbled under
   thy mighty hand when it pleases thee to afflict us and so sustain all
   our troubles that with a courageous mind we may strive for that victory
   which thou promises to us, and that having completed all our struggles
   we may at length attain that blessed rest which is reserved for us in
   heaven through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Joel 3:12

   12. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
   Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.

   12. Expergefiant et ascendant gentes ad vallem Josaphat: quia illic
   sedebo ad judicandum omnes gentes ex circuitu.


   The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, -- that God will at length
   become an avenger of the wrongs of his people, when they shall be
   unjustly harassed by profane men. We indeed know that God does not
   immediately succor his servants but rests as though he did not regard
   their troubles; but this he does to try their patience; and then at a
   suitable time he declares that he had not been indifferent, but had
   noticed the evils done to them, and deferred punishment until the
   wickedness of his enemies had been completed. So he says now, that God
   will at length be the defender of his people against all the nations
   assembled from every quarter in the valley of Jehoshaphat. Of this
   valley we have said enough already. But the chief thing is, that the
   afflictions of the Church shall not go unpunished; for God at the right
   time will ascend his tribunal, and cause all nations from every part of
   the earth to assemble and to be there judged. Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:13

   13. Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down;
   for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is
   great.

   13. Mittite falcem, quia maturuit messis: venite, descendite, quia
   plenum est torcular, refertae sunt cuppae, quia multiplicata est
   malitia ipsorum.


   As God defers his judgments when miserable men groan under their
   burdens, the Prophet uses a form of speech, which represents God as not
   delaying, but, on the contrary, as hastening to judgment, though this
   be not perceived by carnal minds; for these two things well agree
   together -- God waiting his opportunity as to the ungodly and
   suspending the punishment they deserve -- and yet quickly accelerating
   their destruction; for he is said to defer with respect to men, because
   one day with us is like a hundred years; and he is said to hasten,
   because he knows the exact points of time. So he says in this place,
   Put forth the sickle, for the harvest has ripened. He uses metaphorical
   words, but he afterwards expresses without a figure what he means and
   says, that their wickedness had multiplied

   But there are here two metaphors, the one taken from the harvest, and
   the other from the vintage. The Prophet calls those reapers who have
   been destined to execute his judgment; for God makes use as it were of
   the hired work of men, and employs their hands here and there as he
   wills. He afterwards adds another metaphor, taken from the vintage,
   Full, he says, are the presses and the vats overflow; and at last he
   expresses what they mean, -- that their wickedness had multiplied, that
   is, that it was overflowing. God said to Abraham, that the wickedness
   of the Canaanites was not then completed; and long was the space which
   he mentioned for he said that after four hundred years he would take
   vengeance on the enemies of his people: that was a long time; and
   Abraham might have objected and said "Why should God rest for so long a
   time?" The answer was this, -- that their wickedness was not as yet
   completed. But the Prophet says here, that their wickedness had
   multiplied; he therefore gives to God's servants the hope of near
   vengeance, as when the harvest approaches and the vintage is nigh at
   hand; for then all have their minds refreshed with joy. Such is the
   Prophet's design; to encourage the faithful in their hope and
   expectation of a near deliverance, he declares that the iniquities of
   their enemies had now reached their full measure, so that God was now
   ready to execute on them his vengeance. This is the purport of the
   whole. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:14

   14. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of
   the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

   14. Populi, populi in vale concisionis (vel, tribulae,) quia propinquus
   dies Jehovae in valle concisionis.


   The Prophet confirms the same truth; but he multiplies words, because
   the devastation of the Church might have taken away all hope from God's
   servants; for who could have said that the Church could be restored
   when it was so miserably wasted, yea, almost reduced to nothing? For
   the people were so scattered that the name of Israel was of no account.
   The people then had ceased to exist, for they had lost their name; in
   short, the constitution of the Church was dissolved, and all might have
   said, that the people were given up to thousand modes of destruction,
   as all execrated the name of Israel. Since it was so, whatever the
   Prophets said of the restoration of the people might certainly have
   seemed incredible. The repetition then is not superfluous, when the
   Prophet in various forms of words testifies and affirms that God would
   abide faithful, and that, though Israel should perish according to what
   men could see, yet God had power enough to vivify the people when dead:
   hence the Prophet speaks emphatically, Nations! Nations! for he assumes
   here the character of a herald, as indeed this office had been
   committed to him, and shows that his predictions would not be
   fruitless, that he declared not words which would vanish into air, but
   that whatever he declared in God's name was full of power and energy.
   It might indeed have appeared ridiculous in the Prophet to summon all
   nations since his doctrine was laughed to scorn, even at Jerusalem. How
   could his voice penetrate to the utmost borders of the world and be
   there heard? Though hidden then was the power of this prediction, it
   yet showed itself at last, and it was really made evident that the
   Prophet spoke not in vain.

   Besides, he addresses the nations as though they could hear; but he
   raises thus his voice, and nobly triumphs over all the wicked for the
   sake of the godly, though the wicked then proudly ruled and with high
   disdain: "They shall come," he says, "at length before God's tribunal,
   though they now tread the Church under foot; yea, the nations, the
   nations." He does not now mention the valley of Jehoshaphat, but of
   concision. chrvph cheruts some take for a fixed decree; but the word
   means a sledge or an instrument for threshing. We know not the mode of
   threshing used by the Jews, but it is evident from several passages
   that chrvph cheruts was an instrument with which they were wont to
   thresh; and I am inclined to adopt this sense; for the Prophet had
   first called God's judgment a harvest, then he compared it to presses.
   But if the word "concision" is more approved, I object not; at the same
   time, I do not doubt but that the Prophet alludes to threshing, as he
   ascribes to God his own office, that of scattering nations, who seem
   now to have conspired for the destruction of the Church. If any one
   considers it to mean a fixed decree, or a cutting off, as it means in
   Isaiah, I make no objection; for many give this interpretation. I have,
   however, explained what I most approve.

   As to the drift of the subject, there is no ambiguity; the meaning of
   the Prophet is, -- that God will so punish all the ungodly, that he
   will cut down and scatter them all, as when the corn is threshed on the
   floor.

   At last he adds, that nigh was the day of Jehovah in the valley of the
   sledge. He intimates, that though God as yet connived at their
   wickedness, yet the day was coming on, unknown indeed to men, and that
   he would come at length to that valley, that is, that he would inflict
   such punishment as would prove that he was the protector of his people.
   Of this valley we have spoken already; and no doubt he has throughout a
   reference to it, otherwise he would not have used a suitable language,
   when he said, Ascend into the valley. But what is to ascend into the
   valley? for, on the contrary, he ought to have spoken of descending.
   But he compares Judea with other parts of the world; and it is, as it
   is well known elevated in its situation. Then the higher situation of
   Judea well agrees with the ascent of which the Prophet speaks. But he
   ever means that God would so punish the nations as to make it evident
   that he did this in favor of his Church, as we shall soon see more
   clearly. But he says --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:15

   15. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
   withdraw their shining.

   15. Sol et luna obscurabuntur (vel, contrahent nigredinem,) et stellae
   retrahent splendorem suum.


   I have already explained this verse in [12]chapter 2: the Prophet, as
   we then stated, describes in these words the terrible judgment of God,
   in order to shake off the indifference of men, who carelessly hear and
   despise all threatening, except the Lord storms their hearts. These
   figurative expressions then are intended to awaken the ungodly, and to
   make them know that it is a serious matter when the Lord proclaims his
   judgment. Let us now go on with the passage --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:16

   16. The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
   Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will
   be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.

   16. Et Jehova e Sion rugiet, et e Jerusalem dabit (edat) vocem suam; et
   contremiscent coeli et terra: et Jehova spes erit populo suo, et
   fortitudo filiis Israel.


   The Prophet explains here more clearly his object, or the end for which
   he had hitherto spoken of God's judgment; for what we have heard served
   only to spread terror: but now the Prophet shows that his purpose was
   to console the faithful, and to give some relief to their troubles and
   sorrows. This is the reason why he introduces God as roaring from Zion
   and crying from Jerusalem. Roaring is ascribed to God, inasmuch as he
   compares himself in another place to a lion, when representing himself
   as the faithful protector of the salvation of his people: "I will be,"
   he says, "like the lion, who suffers not the prey to be taken from him,
   but boldly defends it with all the fierceness he possesses: so also
   will I do, I will not suffer my people to be taken from me." In this
   sense does the Prophet now say, that God will roar from Zion. God had
   been for a time despised; for the nations had prevailed against his
   chosen people, and plundered them at their pleasure; and God then
   exercised not his power. Since God had been for a time still, the
   Prophet says now, that he will not always conceal himself, but that he
   will undertake the defense of his people, and be like a lion; for he
   will rise up in dreadful violence against all his enemies.

   And tremble, he says, shall the heaven and the earth. As almost the
   whole world was opposed to his elect people, the Prophet carefully
   dwells on this point, that nothing might hinder the faithful from
   looking for the redemption promised to them: "Though the heaven and the
   earth," he says, "raise oppositions God will yet prevail by his
   wonderful power. Tremble, he says, shall all the elements; what, then,
   will men do? Though they muster all their forces, and try all means,
   can they close up the way against the Lord, that he may not deliver his
   people?" We now understand the Prophet's design in speaking of the
   shaking of heaven and earth.

   He at last adds, God will be a hope to his people, and strength to the
   children of Israel. In this part he gives a sufficient proof of what I
   have stated, -- that he denounces extreme vengeance on the nations for
   the sake of his Church; for the Lord will at length pity his people,
   though they may seem to have perished before he succors them. However
   past hope then the people may be in their own estimation and in that of
   all others, yet God will again raise up the expectation of all the
   godly, who shall remain, and will inspire them with new courage. He
   speaks in general of the children of Israel; but what he says belongs
   only to the remnant, of which the Prophet had lately spoken; for not
   all, we know, who derive their origin from the fathers according to the
   flesh, were true Israelites. The Prophet refers here to the true
   Church; and hence Israel ought to be taken for the genuine and
   legitimate children of Abraham; as Christ, in the person of Nathanael,
   calls those true Israelites who imitated the faith of their father
   Abraham. I shall to-day finish this Prophet; I do not therefore dwell
   much on every sentence. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:17

   17. So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my
   holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no
   strangers pass through her any more.

   17. Et cognoscetis quod ego sim Jehova Deus vester, habitans iu Sion,
   monte sanctitatis meae: et erit Jerusalem sanctitas, et alieni non
   transibunt per eam amplius.


   This is a confirmation of the preceding doctrine, ye shall know, he
   says, that I am your God. The Prophet intimates that the favor of God
   had been so hidden during the afflictions of the people, that they
   could not but think that they were forsaken by God. His word ought
   indeed to be sufficient for us in the greatest evils; for though God
   may cast us into the deepest gulfs, yet when he shines upon us by his
   word, it ought to be a consolation abundantly available to sustain our
   souls. But yet, unless God really appears, we are confounded, and ask
   where is his power. For this reason the Prophet now says, that the
   faithful shall at length know, that is, really know him as their God.

   There is a twofold knowledge, -- the knowledge of faith, received from
   his word, -- and the knowledge of experience, as we say, derived from
   actual enjoyment. The faithful ever acknowledge that salvation is laid
   up for them in God; but sometimes they stagger and suffer grievous
   torments in their minds, and are tossed here and there. However it may
   be with them, they certainly do not by actual enjoyment know God to be
   their Father. The Prophet therefore now treats of real knowledge, when
   he says, that they shall know that they have a God, -- how are they to
   know this? By experience. Now this passage teaches us, that though God
   should not put forth his hand manifestly to help us, we ought yet to
   entertain good hope of his favor; for the Prophet spoke for this end,
   -- that the godly might, before the event or the accomplishment of the
   prophecy should come, look to God and cast on him all their cares. Then
   the faithful, before they had real knowledge, knew God to be their
   Father, and hence hesitated not to flee to him though what the Prophet
   testified had not yet been visibly accomplished.

   Dwelling in Zion, the mountain of my holiness: This has been designedly
   added, that the faithful might know, that God made not a covenant in
   vain with Abraham, that mount Zion had not in vain been chosen, that
   they might there call on God; for we must have our attention called to
   the promises, otherwise all doctrine will become frigid. Now we know
   that all the promises have been founded on a covenant, that is, because
   God had adopted the people, and afterwards deposited his covenant in
   the hand of David, and then he designated mount Zion as his sanctuary.
   Since, then, all the promises flow from this fountain, it was necessary
   to call the attention of the Jews to the covenant: and this is the
   reason why the Prophet says now that God dwells in Zion; for otherwise
   this doctrine would no doubt only lead to superstition. God, indeed, we
   know, cannot be included within the circumference of any place, much
   less could he be confined to the narrow limits of the temple; but he
   dwelt on mount Zion on account of his own law, because he made a
   covenant with Abraham, and afterwards with David.

   It then follows, And Jerusalem shall be holy, and aliens shall not pass
   through it any more. While he declares that Jerusalem shall be holy, he
   exempts it at the same time from profanation. We know that it is a
   common mode of speaking in Scripture, and what often occurs, that God's
   heritage is holy, and also, that they profaned it. Hence, when the
   people were exposed as a prey to the pleasure of their enemies, the
   heritage of God became forsaken and polluted, profane men trod
   Jerusalem as it were under foot. But now the Prophet exempts the holy
   city from this pollution, as though he said, "The Lord will not allow
   his people to be thus miserably harassed, and will show that this city
   has been chosen by him, and that he has in it his dwelling. Aliens then
   shall no more pass through it -- Why? For it is first the holy city of
   God, and then, of his Church.

   But as this promise extends to the whole kingdom of Christ, God
   doubtless makes here a general promise, that he will be the protector
   of his Church, that it may not be subject to the will of enemies; and
   yet we see that it often happens otherwise. But this ought to be
   imputed to our sins, for we make the breaches. God would, indeed be a
   wall and a rampart to us, as it is said elsewhere, (Isaiah 26:1;) but
   we betray his Church by our sins. Hence aliens occupy a place in it: Ye
   we see at this day; for Antichrist, as it has been foretold, has now
   for ages exercised dominion in God's sanctuary. Since it is so, we
   ought to mourn at seeing God's holy Church profaned. Let us yet know,
   that God will take care to gather his elect, and to cleanse them from
   every pollution and defilement. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:18-19

   18. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall
   drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the
   rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth
   of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim.

   18. Et erit in die illa, stillabunt montes mustum, et colles decurrere
   facient lac; et omnes rivi Jehudah emittent aquas (hoc est, descendere
   facient,) et fons e domo Jehovae egredietur et irrigabit vallem Sittim.

   19. Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
   wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because
   they have shed innocent blood in their land.

   19. Aegyptus in solitudinem erit, et Edom in desertum solitudinis erit,
   propter vexationem filiorum Jehudah; quia fuderunt sanguinem innoxium
   (vel, purum) in terra sua (vel, ipsorum.)


   The Prophet here declares that God will be so bountiful to his people,
   that no good things will be wanting to them either in abundance or
   variety. When God then shall restore his Church, it will abound, he
   says, in every kind of blessing: for this is the meaning of this
   language, Distill new wine shall the mountains, and the hills shall
   make milk to run down; and all rivers also shall have abundant waters,
   and a fountain shall arise from the house of Judah to irrigate the
   valley of Shittim. We now perceive the design of Joel. But we must
   remember that when the Prophets so splendidly extol the blessings of
   God, they intend not to fill the minds of the godly with thoughts about
   eating and drinking; but profane men lay hold on such passages as
   though the Lord intended to gratify their appetite. We know, indeed,
   that God's children differ much from swine: hence God fills not the
   faithful with earthly things, for this would not be useful for their
   salvation. At the same time, he thus enlarges on his blessings, that we
   may know that no happiness shall in any way be wanting to us, when God
   shall be propitious to us. We hence see that our Prophet so speaks of
   God's earthly blessings, that he fills not the minds of the godly with
   these things but desires to raise them above, as though he said, that
   the Israelites would in every way be happy, after having in the first
   place been reconciled to God. For whence came their miseries and
   distresses of every kind, but from their sins? Since, then, all
   troubles, all evils, are signs of God's wrath and alienation, it is no
   wonder that the Lord, when he declares that he will be propitious to
   them, adds also the proofs of his paternal love, as he does here: and
   we know that it was necessary for that rude people, while under the
   elements of the Law, to be thus instructed; for they could not as yet
   take solid food, as we know that the ancients under the Law were like
   children. But it is enough for us to understand the design of the Holy
   Spirit, namely, that God will satisfy his people with the abundance of
   all good things, as far as it will be for their benefit. Since God now
   calls us directly to heaven, and raises our minds to the spiritual
   life, what Paul says ought to be sufficient, -- that to godliness is
   given the hope, not only of future life, but also of that which is
   present, (1 Timothy 4;) for God will bless us on the earth, but it will
   be, as we have already observed, according to the measure of our
   infirmity.

   The valley of Shittim was nigh the borders of the Moabites, as we learn
   from Numbers 25:1, and Joshua 2:1. Now when the Prophet says, that
   waters, flowing from the holy fountains would irrigate the valley of
   Shittim, it is the same as though he said, that the blessing of God in
   Judea would be so abundant, as to diffuse itself far and wide, even to
   desert valleys.

   But he afterwards joins, that the Egyptians and Idumeans would be
   sterile and dry in the midst of this great abundance of blessings, for
   they were professed enemies to the Church. Hence God in this verse
   declares that they shall not be partakers of his bounty; that though
   all Judea would be irrigated, though it would abound in honeys milk,
   and wine, yet these would remain barren and empty; Mizraim, then, shall
   be a solitude, Edom shall be a desert of solitude. Why? Because of the
   troubles, he says, brought on the children of Judah. God again confirms
   this truth, that he has such a concern for his Church, that he will
   avenge wrongs done to it. God, then, does not always come to our help
   when we are unjustly oppressed, though he has taken us under his
   protection; but he suffers us for a time to endure our evils; and yet
   the end will show, that we have been ever dear to him and precious in
   his sight. So he says now, that for the harassments which the Egyptians
   and Idumeans occasioned to the children of Judah, they shall be
   destitute, notwithstanding the abundance of all good things.

   Because they shed, he says, innocent blood in their (or, in their own)
   land. If we refer this to Egypt and Idumea, the sense will be, that
   they had not protected fugitives, but, on the contrary, cruelly slew
   them, as though they had been sworn enemies. Many, we know, during
   times of distress, fled to Egypt and Idumea, to seek refuge there. As,
   then, the Egyptians had been so inhuman towards the distressed, the
   Prophet threatens them with vengeance. But I prefer to view what is
   said as having been done in Judea; they have then shed innocent Blood,
   that is, in Judea itself. As God had consecrated this land to himself
   to pollute it with unjust slaughters was a more atrocious crime.
   Forasmuch then as the Egyptians and Idumeans thus treated the Jews, and
   slew them in their own country in a base manner, though they were
   abiding quietly at home, it is no wonder that God declares, that he
   would be the avenger of these wrongs. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:20

   20. But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to
   generation.

   20. Et Jehudah in aeternum habitabit (alii passive accipiunt,
   habitabitur) et Jerusalem erit in generationem et generationem.


   God here testifies that his redemption would not be for a short time,
   but that its fruit would be for a long, period, yea, perpetual: for it
   would be but a small thing for the Church to be redeemed, except God
   kept it safe under his own power. This second thing the Prophet now
   adds, -- that Judah shall always remain safe, and that Jerusalem shall
   be for a continued succession of ages. The ungodly, we know, sometimes
   flourish for a time, though before God they are already doomed to
   destruction. But the Prophet here declares, that the fruit of the
   redemption he promises will be eternal: for God is not led to deliver
   his Church only for a moment, but he will follow it with perpetual
   favor, and remain constant in his purpose and ever like himself; he is
   therefore the eternal and faithful protector of his people. The last
   verse follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Joel 3:21

   21. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the
   Lord dwelleth in Zion.

   21. Et mundabo sanguinem corum, non mundavi: et Jehova habitans in
   Sion.


   The beginning of the verse is in various ways explained. Some make a
   stop after cleanse thus, "I will cleanse, yet their blood I will not
   cleanse;" as though God had said, that he would forgive heathen nations
   all their other wrongs, but could not forgive them the great cruelty
   they had exercised against his elect. So the sense would be, "Avarice
   may be borne, I could pass by robberies; but, since they slew my
   people, I am in this case wholly unforgiving." Hence, according to this
   view, God shows how precious to him is the life of his saints, inasmuch
   as he says, that he will not be pacified towards those ungodly men who
   have shed innocent blood. But this sense seems rather too forced.
   Others render thus, "Their blood will I cleanse, and will not cleanse,"
   that is, "I will cleanse the Jews from their defilements, but I will
   not use extreme severity;" as he says also in Isaiah 48, I will not
   refine thee as gold or silver, for thou wouldest turn all into dross.'
   They hence think that God promises here such a cleansing of the Church,
   as that he would not use extreme rigor, but moderate his cleansing, as
   it is needful with regard to our defilements, of which we are all so
   full.

   But this sense seems to me more simple, -- that God would cleanse the
   blood which he had not cleansed; as though he said, "I have not
   hitherto cleansed the pollutions of my people; they are then become, as
   it were, putrid in their sins; but now I will begin to purify all their
   wickedness, that they may shine pure before me." There is a relative
   understood as is often the case in Hebrew. But nqh neke is taken in
   Jeremiah 30:11, in another sense, that God will exterminate his Church:
   but we cannot in this place elicit any other meaning than that God will
   cleanse his Church from pollutions; for the Prophet, no doubt, means
   the defilements of which the people were full. They will not, then, be
   able to enjoy the favor of God while lying in their filth. Now God, in
   promising to be a Redeemer, comes to the very fountain and the first
   thing, -- that he will wash away their filth; for how could God be the
   Redeemer of the people, except he blotted out their sins? For as long
   as he imputes sins to us, he must necessarily be angry with us, we must
   be necessarily altogether alienated from him and deprived of his
   blessing. He then does not say in vain that he will be a purifier; for
   when pollutions are cleansed, there follows another thing, which we
   have already noticed as to this, future redemption, and with this --

   He at last concludes and says And Jehovah shall dwell in Zion. The
   Prophet recalls again the attention of the people to the covenant; as
   though he said, "God has willingly and bountifully promised all that
   has been mentioned, not because the people have deserved this, but
   because God has deigned long ago to adopt the children of Abraham, and
   has chosen mount Zion as his habitation." He shows then this to be the
   reason why God was now inclined to mercy, and would save a people, who
   had a hundred times destroyed themselves by their sins.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we have, in this world, to fight
   continually, not only with one kind of enemies, but with numberless
   enemies, and not only with flesh and blood, but also with the devil,
   the prince of darkness, -- O grant, that, being armed with thy power,
   we may persevere in this contest; and when thou afflictest us for our
   sins, may we learn to humble ourselves, and so submit to thy authority,
   that we may hope for the redemption promised to us; and though tokens
   of thy displeasure may often appear to us, may we yet ever raise up our
   minds by hope to heaven, and from thence look for thy only begotten
   Son, until, coming as the Judge of the world, he gathers us and brings
   us to the fruition of that blessed and eternal life, which he has
   obtained for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Lecture Forty-ninth

   He shows himself the time when he began to discharge his office of a
   teacher; but it does not appear how long he prophesied. The Jews
   indeed, think that his course was long; he continued his office, as
   they write, under four kings. But he mentions here only the reigns of
   Uzziah and Jeroboam. His purpose was to mark the time when he began to
   execute his office of a Prophet, but not to express how long he labored
   for God in that office; and why he mentions only the beginning, we
   shall in its proper place notice. It is, indeed, certain, that he
   commenced his work under king Uzziah, and under king Jeroboam: and this
   also is to be noticed, that he was appointed a Prophet to the kingdom
   of Israel. For though he arose from the tribe of Judah, yet the Lord,
   as we shall see set him over the kingdom of Israel. He sometimes turns
   his discourse to the tribe of Judah, but only, as it were,
   accidentally, and as occasion led him; for he mainly addressed the Ten
   Tribes. I now come to his words.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 1:1

   1. The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw
   concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days
   of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the
   earthquake.

   1. Verba Amos, qui fuit inter pastores (vel, pecuarios) ex Tucua: quae
   vidit super Israel diebus Uzziah regis Juhudah, et diebus Jarobeam
   filii Joas regis Israel, biennio ante motum (vel chasma) terrae.
   nominibus, quia de sensu Prophetae satis constabit. Nunc venio ad
   inscriptionem libri.)


   Amos boasts not here, in speaking of his own words, that he adduced
   anything as from himself, but avows himself to be only the minister of
   God; for he immediately adds that he received them by a vision. God
   himself raised up the Prophets and employed their labor; And, at the
   same time, guided them by his Spirit, that they might not announce
   anything but what had been received from him, but faithfully deliver
   what had proceeded from him alone. These two things then, well agree
   together, -- that the prophecies which follow were the words of Amos
   and that they were words revealed to him from above; for the word chzh,
   chese, which Amos uses, properly means, to see by revelation; [16] and
   these revelations were called prophecies.

   But he says, that he was among the shepherds of Tekoa. This was a mean
   towns and had been shortly before surrounded by walls and had ever been
   previously a village. He then mentions not his country, because it was
   celebrated, or as though he could derive thereby more authority or
   renown: but, on the contrary he calls himself a Tekoan, because God
   drew him forth from an obscure place, that he might set him over the
   whole kingdom of Israel. They are therefore mistaken, as I think, who
   suppose that Amos was called one of the shepherds on account of his
   riches, and the number of his flocks; for when I weigh every thing, I
   see not how could this be. I indeed allow that nqdym, nukodim are not
   only shepherds who do the work, but men possessing flocks, carrying on
   a large business; for the king of Moab is said to have been a nqd,
   nukod, and that he fed large flocks; but it was by hired shepherds. As
   to the Prophets I do not see how this can be applied to him; for Tekoa
   was not a place famous for wealth; and as I have said, it was a small
   town, and of no opulence. I do not then doubt, but that Amos, by saying
   that he was a shepherd, pours contempt on the pride of the king of
   Israel, and of the whole people; for as they had not deigned to hear
   the Prophets of God, a keeper of sheep was sent to them.

   It must be further noticed, that he is not called a shepherd of Tekoa,
   but from Tekoa; and interpreters have not observed this preposition. We
   shall see in [13]chapter seven, that though Amos sprang from the tribe
   of Judah, he yet dwelt in the kingdom of Israel: for the priest, after
   he had slandered him before the king, bade him to go elsewhere, and to
   eat his own bread, and not to disturb the peace of the country. He
   therefore dwelt there as a stranger in a land not his own. Had he been
   rich, and possessing much wealth, he would have surely dwelt at home:
   why should he change his place? Since then it appears evident, that he
   was a sojourner in the land of Israel, he was, no doubt, one of the
   common people. So that his low condition (ignobilitias--ignobility) was
   intended for this purpose, -- that God might thereby repress the
   arrogance of the king of Israel, and of the whole people; for we know
   how much inflated they were on account of the fruitfulness of their
   land and their riches. Hence Amos was set over them as a Prophet, being
   a shepherd, whom God had brought from the sheepfolds.

   The time also is to be observed, when he is said to have seen these
   prophecies; it was in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, two years
   before the earth-quake, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.
   What the state of that time was, I described in explaining the
   prophecies of [14]Hosea. Sacred history relates that the kingdom of
   Israel flourished under the second Jeroboam; for though he was an
   ungodly and wicked man, yet God spared then his people, and caused that
   not only the ten tribes should remain entire, but also that Jeroboam
   should enlarge his kingdom; for he had recovered some cities which had
   been lost. The state of the people was then tranquil, and their
   prosperity was such as filled them with pride, as it commonly happens.
   Uzziah also so reigned over the tribe of Judah, that nothing adverse
   prevailed there. Shortly after followed the earthquake. The time this
   earthquake happened, sacred history does not mention. But Josephus
   says, that it was when Uzziah seized on the priestly office, and was
   smitten with leprosy. He therefore makes that stroke of leprosy and the
   earthquake to be at the same time. But Amos, as well as other Prophets,
   spoke of it as a thing well known: thus Zechariah, after the people's
   return, refers to it in chapter 14: (Zechariah 14:5),

   There shall be to you a terror,
   such as was in the earthquake under king Uzziah.'

   He states not the year, but it was then commonly known.

   Then the Prophet meant nothing more than to show by this event, that he
   denounced God's vengeance on the Israelites, when they were in
   prosperity, and were immersed, as it were, in their pleasures. And
   satiety, as it ever happens, made them ferocious; hence he was not well
   received; but his authority is hereby more confirmed to us; for he did
   not flatter the people in their prosperity, but severely reproved them;
   and he also predicted what could not be foreseen by human judgment,
   nay, what seemed to be altogether improbable. Had he not then been
   endued with the heavenly Spirit, he could not have foretold future
   calamities, when the Jews, as I have already said, as well as the
   Israelites, and others, promised themselves all kinds of prosperity;
   for God then spared the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah, nor
   did he execute his judgment on neighboring nations.

   We must now observe this also, that the words which he saw were
   concerning Israel. We hence learn, as I have already said that the
   Prophet was specifically appointed for the Israelites, though born
   elsewhere. But how and on what occasion he migrated into the kingdom of
   Israel, we know not; and as to the subject in hand, it matters not
   much: but it is probable, as I have said before, that this was
   designedly done, that God might check the insolence of the people, who
   flattered themselves so much in their prosperity. Since, then, the
   Israelites had hitherto rejected God's servants, they were now
   constrained to hear a foreigner and a shepherd condemning them for
   their sins, and exercising the office of a judge: he who proclaims, an
   impending destruction is a celestial herald. This being the case, we
   hence see that God had not in vain employed the ministry of this
   Prophet; for he is wont to choose the weak things of the world to
   confound the strong, (1 Corinthians 1) and he takes Prophets and
   teachers from the lowest grade to humble the dignity of the world, and
   puts the invaluable treasure of his doctrine in earthly vessels, that
   his power, as Paul teaches us, may be made more evident (2 Corinthians
   4:7.)

   But there was a special reason as to the Prophet Amos; for he was sent
   on purpose severely to reprove the ten tribes: and, as we shall see, he
   handled them with great asperity. For he was not polite, but proved
   that he had to do with those who were not to be treated as men, but as
   brute beasts; yea, worse in obstinacy than brute beasts; for there is
   some docility in oxen and cows, and especially in sheep, for they hear
   the voice of their shepherd, and follow where he leads them. The
   Israelites were all stubbornness, and wholly untamable. It was then
   necessary to set over them a teacher who would not treat them
   courteously, but exercise towards them his native rusticity. Let us now
   proceed; for of the kingdom of Uzziah and of Jeroboam the son of Joash,
   the second of that name, we have spoken on the in [15]Hosea 1:1. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] There is an incongruity in our language in saying, "The words of
   Amos, which he saw." To see words, except when written, is no proper
   expression. To avoid this, Newcome has paraphrased the passage thus, --
   "Which had come to him in a vision." There would be no necessity for
   this, had we a suitable term for "words," which in Hebrew has the same
   latitude of meaning with logos in Greek. Dathius renders it, Effata,
   oracles. They were the things, the matters, the events, which the
   Prophet saw, or were discovered to him in a supernatural manner. The
   faculty of sight seems to have been used, because scenes were presented
   often to the prophets, when these communications were made to them; and
   then seeing became the term to designate these divine revelations, when
   nothing but messages, either of mercy or of judgment, were conveyed to
   the prophets. -- Ed.

   Amos 1:2

   2. And he said, The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from
   Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the
   top of Carmel shall wither.

   2. Et dixit, Jehova e Sion ruget, et e Jerusalem edet (vel, emittet)
   vocem suam; et lugebunt (vel, disperibunt) habitacula pastorum; et
   arescet (vel, pudefiet) vertex Carmeli. [17]


   He employs here the same words which we explained yesterday in the
   [16]Lecture on Joel; but for another purpose. By saying, Jehovah from
   Zion shall roar,' Joel intended to set forth the power of God, who had
   been for a time silent, as though he was not able to repel his enemies.
   As God was then despised by the ungodly, Joel declares that he had
   power, by which he could instantly break down and destroy all his
   enemies and defend his Church and chosen people. But now Amos, as he
   addresses the Israelites, does here defend the pure worship of God from
   all contempt and declares to the Israelites, that how much soever they
   wearied themselves in their superstitions they still worshipped their
   own devices; for God repudiated all the religion they thought they had.
   There is, then, to be understood an implied or indirect contrast
   between mount Zion and the temples which the first Jeroboam built in
   Dan and Bethel. The Israelites imagined that they worshipped the God of
   their father Abraham; and there were in those places greater displays
   (pompae -- pomps) than at Jerusalem. But the Prophet Amos pours
   contempt on all these fictitious forms of worship; as though he said,
   "Ye indeed boast that the God of Abraham is honored and worshipped by
   you; but ye are degenerate, ye are covenant breakers, ye are perfidious
   towards God; he dwells not with you, for the sanctuaries, which you
   have made for yourselves, are nothing but brothels; God has chosen no
   habitation for himself, except mount Zion; there is his perpetual rest:
   Roar then will Jehovah from Zion."

   We now see what the Prophet had in view: for he not only shows here,
   that God was the author of his doctrine, but at the same time
   distinguishes between the true God and the idols, which the first
   Jeroboam made, when by this artifice he intended to withdraw the ten
   tribes from the house of David and wholly to alienate them from the
   tribe of Judah: it was then that he set up the calves in Dan and
   Bethel. The Prophet now shows that all these superstitions are
   condemned by the true God: Jehovah then shall roar from Zion, he will
   utter his voice from Jerusalem. He no doubt wished here to terrify the
   Israelites, who thought they had peace with God. Since, then, they
   abused his long-suffering, Amos now says that they would find at length
   that he was not asleep. "When God then shall long bear with your
   iniquities, he will at last rise up for judgment."

   By roaring is signified, as we said yesterday, the terrible voice of
   God; but the Prophet here speaks of God's voice, rather than of what
   are called actual judgments really executed, that the Israelites might
   learn that the examples of punishments which God executes in the world
   happen not by chance, or at random, but proceed from his threatening;
   in short, the Prophet intimates that all punishments which God inflicts
   on the ungodly and the despisers of his word, are only the executions
   of what the Prophets proclaimed, in order that men, should there be any
   hope of their repentance, might anticipate the destruction which they
   hear to be nigh. The Prophet then commends here very highly the truth
   of what God teaches, by saying that it is not what vanishes, but what
   is accomplished; for when he destroys nations and kingdoms, it comes to
   pass according to prophecies: God then shall utter his voice from
   Jerusalem

   Then it follows, And mourn shall the habitations of shepherds 'vl,
   abel, means to mourn, and also to be laid waste, and to perish. Either
   sense will well suit this place. If we read, mourn, etc., then we must
   render the following thus, and ashamed shall be the head, or top, of
   Carmel. But if we read, perish, etc., then the verb vs besh must be
   translated, wither; and as we know that there were rich pastures on
   Carmel, I prefer this second rendering: wither then shall the top of
   Carmel; and the first clause must be taken thus, and perish shall the
   habitations of shepherds

   As to what is intended, we understand the Prophet's meaning to be, that
   whatever was pleasant and valuable in the kingdom of Israel would now
   shortly perish, because God would utter his voice from Zion The meaning
   then is this, -- "Ye now lie secure, but God will soon, and even
   suddenly, put forth his power to destroy you; and this he will do,
   because he denounces on you destruction now by me, and will raise up
   other Prophets to be heralds of his vengeance: this will God execute by
   foreign and heathen nations; but yet your destruction will be according
   to these threatening which ye now count as nothing. Ye indeed think
   them to be empty words; but God will at length show that what he
   declares will be fully accomplished."

   With respect to Carmel, there were two mountains of this name; but as
   they were both very fertile, there is no need to take much trouble to
   inquire of which Carmel the Prophet speaks. Sufficient is what has been
   said, -- that such a judgment is denounced on the kingdom of Israel as
   would consume all its fatness; for as we shall hereafter see, and the
   same thing has been already stated by the Prophet [17]Hosea, there was
   great fertility as to pastures in that kingdom.

   We must, at the same time, observe, that the Prophet, who was a
   shepherd, speaks according to his own character, and the manner of life
   which he followed. Another might have said, Mourn shall the whole
   country, tremble shall the palaces,' or something like this; but the
   Prophet speaks of mount Carmel, and of the habitations of shepherds,
   for he was a shepherd. His doctrine no doubt was despised, and many
   profane men probably said, "What! he thinks that he is still with his
   cows and with his sheep; he boasts that he is God's prophet, and yet he
   is ever engrossed by his stalls and his sheepfolds." It is then by no
   means improbable, but that he was thus derided by scornful men: but he
   purposely intended to blunt their petulance, by mingling with what he
   said as a Prophets those kinds of expressions which savored of his
   occupation as a shepherd. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] Rendered literally from the Hebrew, this verse is a fine specimen
   of sublime simplicity: the poetical inversion of words is preserved: --
   And he said,-- Jehovah from Zion will roar,
   And from Jerusalem will he send forth his voice;
   Then mourn with the inhabitants of shepherds,
   And wither will the top of Carmel. The roarings of lions are dreadful
   to shepherds. God's voice is either of mercy or of judgment; it is the
   latter here, and evidently that of drought, (see Amos 5:6,) as the
   withering of Carmel was to be the effect. -- Ed.

   Amos 1:3-5

   3. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for
   four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have
   threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

   3. Sic dixit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Damasci et super quatuor
   non ero propitius ei; quia trituraverunt serris (vel, tribulis ferreis)
   Gilead.

   4. But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour
   the palaces of Benhadad.

   4. Et mittam ignem in domum Chasael, et vorabit palatia Ben-Adad.

   5. I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant
   from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house
   of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir,
   saith the Lord.

   5. Et confringam vectem Damasci et excidam habitatorem ex Bikath-Aven
   (vel, ex planitie Aven, vel, molestiae vel, doloris: alii vertunt, ex
   templo idoli) et tenentem sceptrum e domo Eden (alii appellative
   accipiunt, e domo voluptatis;) et transferetur populus Syriae Kirah (in
   Kir) dicit Jehova.


   It is singular that Amos said that his words were concerning Israel,
   and that he should now turn to speak of Damascus and the country of
   Syria. This seems inconsistent; for why does he not perform the office
   committed to him? why does he not reprove the Israelites? why does he
   not threaten them? why does he not show their sins? and why does he
   speak of the destruction then nigh to the people of Syria? But it is
   right here to consider what his design was. He shows briefly, in the
   last verse, that ruin was nigh the Israelites; for God, who had
   hitherto spared them, was now resolved to ascend his tribunal. But now,
   that he might better prepare the Israelites, he shows that God, as a
   judge, would call all the neighboring nations to an account. For had
   the Prophet threatened the Israelites only, they might have thought
   that what they suffered was by chance, when they saw the like things
   happening to their neighbors: "How is it credible that these evils and
   calamities have flowed from God's vengeance, since the Idumeans, the
   Moabites, the Ammonites, the Syrians, and the Sidonians, are implicated
   in these evils in common with ourselves? For if God's hand pursues us,
   it is the same with them: and if it is fate, that with blind force
   exercises its rule over the Moabites, the Idumeans, and the Syrians,
   the same thing, doubtless, is to be thought of our case." Thus all the
   authority of the Prophet must have lost its power, except the
   Israelites were made to know that God is the judge of all nations.

   We must also bear in mind, that the kingdom of Israel was laid waste,
   together with other neighboring countries, as war had spread far and
   wide; for the Assyrian, like a violent storm, had extended through the
   whole of that part of the world. Not only, then, the Israelites were
   distressed by adversities at that time, but all the nations of which
   Amos prophesied. It was hence necessary to add the catalogue which we
   here find, that the Israelites might have as many confirmations
   respecting God's vengeance, as the examples which were presented to
   their eyes, in the dire calamities which everywhere prevailed. This is
   to be borne in mind. And then the Prophet regarded another thing: If
   the Idumeans, the Moabites, the Syrians, and Ammonites, were to be
   treated so severely, and the Prophet had not connected the Israelites
   with them, they might have thought that they were to be exempted from
   the common punishments because God would be propitious to them; for
   hypocrites ever harden themselves the more, whenever God spares them:
   "See, the Ammonites and the Moabites are punished; the Idumeans, the
   Syrians, and other nations, are visited with judgment: God then is
   angry with all these; but we are his children, for he is indulgent to
   us." But the Prophet puts here the Israelites in the same bundle with
   the Moabites, the Idumeans, and other heathen nations; as though he
   said, "God will not spare your neighbors; but think not that ye shall
   be exempt from his vengeance, when they shall be led to punishment; I
   now declare to you that God will be the judge of you all together."

   We now apprehend the design of the Prophet. He wished here to set
   before the eyes of the Israelites the punishment of others to awaken
   them, and also to induce them to examine themselves for we often see,
   that those who are intractable and refractory in their disposition,
   when directly addressed are not very attentive; but when they hear of
   the sins of others, and especially when they hear something of
   punishment, they will attend. The Prophet therefore designed by degrees
   to lead the Israelites to a teachable state of mind, for he knew them
   to be torpid in their indulgences, and also blinded by presumption, so
   that they could not be easily brought under the yoke: hence he sets
   before them the punishment which was soon to fall on neighboring
   nations.

   We must yet observe that there was another reason I do not throw aside
   what I have already mentioned; but the Prophet no doubt had this also
   in view, -- that God would punish the Syrians, because they cruelly
   raged against the Israelites especially against Gilead and its
   inhabitants. As God, then, would inflict so grievous a punishment on
   the Syrians, because they so cruelly treated the inhabitants of Gilead,
   what was to be expected by the Israelites themselves who had been
   insolent towards God, who had violated his worship who had robbed him
   of his honor, who had in their turn destroyed one another! For, as we
   shall hereafter see, there was among them no equity, no humanity; they
   had forgotten all reason. Since, then, the Israelites were such, how
   could they hope that so many and so detestable crimes should go
   unpunished, when they saw that the Syrians, though uncircumcised, were
   not to be spared, because they so cruelly treated professed enemies, on
   whom they lawfully made war?

   I now come to the words of the Prophet: Thus saith Jehovah, For three
   transgressions of Damascus, and for four, will not be propitious to it;
   literally, I will not convert it [18] : but I take this actively that
   God would not turn himself to mercy, or that he would not be propitious
   to Damascus. We know that Damascus was the capital of Syria; And the
   Prophet here, by mentioning a part for the whole, threatens the whole
   people, and summons all the Syrians to God's tribunal, because they had
   inhumanely treated, as we shall see, the city of Gilead. But he says,
   God will not be propitious for three and four transgressions of
   Damascus. Some take this meaning, "For three transgressions I have been
   propitious, for four I will not be." But there is no need of adding
   anything to the Prophet's words; for the most suitable sense here is
   that for the many sins of Damascus God would not be propitious to it:
   and the Prophet, I have no doubt, intended by the two numbers to set
   forth the irreclaimable perverseness of the Syrians. Seven in Scripture
   is an indefinite number, and is taken, as it is well known, to express
   what is countless. By saying then, three and four transgressions, it is
   the same as if he had said seven: but the Prophet more strikingly
   intimates the progress the Syrians made in their transgressions, until
   they became so perverse that there was no hope of repentance. This then
   is the reason, that God declares that he would no more forgive the
   Syrians, inasmuch as without measure or limit they burst forth into
   transgressions and ceased not, though a time for change was given them.
   This is the true meaning. And the Prophet repeats the same form of
   speech in speaking of Gaza, of Amman, of Edom, and of other nations.

   Let us learn from this place, that God, whom the world regards as too
   cruel, when he takes vengeance on sins, shows really and by sure proof
   the truth of what he declares so often of himself in Scripture, and
   that is, that he bears long and does not quickly take vengeance: though
   men are worthy to perish yet the Lord suspends his judgments. We have a
   remarkable proof of this in these prophecies; for the Prophet speaks
   not only of one people but of many. Hence God endured many
   transgressions not only in the Syrians, but also in other nations:
   there was not then a country in which a testimony to God's forbearance
   did not exist. It hence appears, that the world unjustly complains of
   too much rigor, when God takes vengeance, for he ever waits till
   iniquity, as it was stated yesterday, reaches its highest point.

   There is besides presented to us here a dreadful spectacle of sins
   among so many nations. At the same time, when we compare that age with
   ours, it is certain that greater integrity existed then: all kinds of
   evils so overflow at this day, that compared with the present, the time
   of Amos was the golden age; and yet we hear him declaring here, that
   the people of Judah and of Israel, and all the other nations, were
   monstrously wicked, so that God could not bring them to repentance. For
   he testifies not here in vain, that he would punish wickedness wholly
   obstinate since they had not turned to him, who had advanced to the
   number seven; that is, who had sinned, as it has been before stated,
   without measure or limits: and this ought also to be noticed in the
   Prophet's words; but I cannot now proceed farther.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] Eam non restituam -- I will not restore it.' -- Bishop Lowth. Of
   all commentators, Dathius gives the best explanation of the first part
   of this verse. His remarks are these: -- "There is here mentioned a
   fourth sin, for which God would no longer defer punishment. The three
   sins, which had preceded the fourth, signify all those sins which they
   had besides committed, a definite number being put for a number
   indefinite." But as to the phrase, l' 'syvnv, non avertam illud -- I
   will not turn it away,' so as to forgive it, that is, the fourth sin,
   he seems not to have been so felicitous; for the reference is evidently
   to Damascus. It will admit of either these renderings, -- "I will not
   restore it," that is, to favor; or "I will not turn away from it," so
   as to let it go unpunished. The whole verse I would render thus: --
   Thus saith Jehova, --
   For three transgressions of Damascus,
   Yea, for the fourth, I will not turn away from it;
   For it threshed Gelead with iron wains. Literally, it is, "they
   threshed;" for it is usual with the prophets, when speaking of a city
   or people, to pass from the singular to the plural number. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest us to be of a disposition so
   hard and rebellious, that we are not, without great difficulty, drawn
   to thee, -- O grant, that we may at least be subdued by the
   threatenings thou daily denouncest on us, and be so subdued, that being
   also drawn by thy word, we may give up ourselves to thee, and not only
   suffer ourselves to be constrained by punishments and collections, but
   also obey thee with a willing mind, and most readily offer ourselves to
   thee as a sacrifice of obedience, so that being ruled by the Spirit of
   thy Son, we may at length attain that blessed rest, which has been
   prepared for us by the same thy Son our Lord. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Fiftieth

   We explained in yesterday's Lecture, that what the Prophet means by the
   three and four transgressions of Damascus, is perverse and incurable
   wickedness; for God here declares that he had borne long enough with
   the sins of Damascus, and that now he is in a manner forced to proceed
   to extreme rigor, seeing that there was no hope of amendment. But what
   follows may seem strange; for immediately the Prophet subjoins, Because
   they have threshed Gilead with iron wains, or serrated machines. He
   records here only one wickedness: where, then, were the seven of which
   he spoke? The answer may be easily given. By naming the three and four
   sins of Damascus, he means not different kinds of sins, but rather the
   perverseness which we have mentioned; for they had been extremely
   rebellious against God, and God had suspended his vengeance, till it
   became evident that they were unhealable. It was, therefore, not
   necessary to mention here seven different sins; for it was enough that
   Damascus, which means the kingdom of Syria, was held bound by such a
   degree of obstinacy, that no remedy could be applied to its
   transgressions; for it had for a long time tried the patience of God.

   Now the Prophet subjoins, I will send fire unto the house of Hazael,
   which will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. The Prophet speaks still of
   the kingdom of Syria; for we know that both Ben-hadad and Hazael were
   kings of Syria. But Jerome is much mistaken, who thinks that Ben-hadad
   was here put in the second place, as if he had been the successor of
   Hazael, [19] while sacred history relates that Hazael came to Elisha
   when Ben-hadad was ill in his bed, (2 Kings 8:9;) and he was sent to
   request an answer. Now the Prophet declared that Hazael would be the
   king of Syria, and declared this not without tears; for he pitied his
   own people, of which this Syrian would be the destroyer. After he
   returned home, he strangled Ben-hadad, and took to himself the royal
   dignity. But it is common enough in Scripture to speak of a thing
   present, and then, as in this place, to add what has past, I will send
   fire into the house of Hazael, and this fire will devour the palaces of
   Ben-hadad; as though he said, "I will destroy the kingdom of Syria, I
   will consume it as with burning." But he first names the house of
   Hazael, and then the palaces of Ben-hadad; as though he said, "No
   ancientness shall preserve that kingdom from being destroyed." For,
   metaphorically, under the word fire, he designates every kind of
   consumption; and we know how great is the violence of fire. It is then
   as though he said, that no wealth, no strength, no fortifications,
   would stand in the way to prevent the kingdom of Syria from being
   destroyed.

   He then adds, I will break in pieces the bar of Damascus The Prophet
   confirms what he had already said; for Damascus, being strongly
   fortified, might have seemed unassailable. By bar, the Prophet,
   mentioning a part for the whole, meant strongholds and everything which
   could keep out enemies. Nothing, then, shall prevent enemies from
   taking possession of the city of Damascus. How so? Because the Lord
   will break in pieces its bars.

   It is then added, I will cut off, or destroy, the inhabitant from
   Bikoth Aven, or from the plain of Aven. It is uncertain whether this
   was the proper name of a place or not, though this is probable; and yet
   it means a plain, derived from a verb, which signifies to cut into two,
   or divide, because a plain or a valley divides or separates mountains;
   hence a valley or plain is called in Hebrew a division. Now, we know
   that there were most delightful plains in the kingdom of Syria, and
   even near Damascus. Aven also may have been the name of a place, though
   it means in Hebrew trouble or laborer. But whatever it may have been,
   the Prophet no doubt declares here, that all the plains nigh Damascus,
   and in the kingdom of Syria, would be deprived of their inhabitants. I
   will then destroy the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and the holder
   of the scepter from the house of Eden, or from the house of pleasure.
   This also may have been the name of a place, and from its situation a
   region, which, by its pleasantness greatly delighted its inhabitants.
   But the Prophet, I have no doubt, alludes, in these two words, to
   trouble and pleasure Removed, he says, shall be the people of Syria
   into Kir. The purport of this is, that the kingdom of Syria would be
   wasted, so that the people would be taken into Assyria; for the Prophet
   declares that the Assyrians would be the conquerors, and remove the
   spoils into their own kingdom, and lead away the people as captives;
   for the word city, as a part for the whole, is put here for the whole
   land. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] There were two Ben-hadads: the one whom Hazael strangled, 2 Kings
   8:15; and his son who succeeded him, 2 Kings 13:3. But ben-hadad seems
   to have been the name of many of the kings of Syria, as Pharaoh was the
   common name of the kings of Egypt. Hence the palaces of Ben-ha-dad were
   probably those built by several kings of that name. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 1:6-8

   6. Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,
   I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away
   captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:

   6. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Gazae et super quatuor,
   non ero propitius ei, quia transtulerunt captivitatem perfectam, ut
   concluderent in Edom:

   7. But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the
   palaces thereof:

   7. Et mittam ignem in murum Gazae, qui devorabit palatia ejus:

   8. And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth
   the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and
   the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.

   8. Et excidam habitatorem de Azoto et tenentem sceptrum de Ascalon; et
   convertam (vel, reducam) manum meam super Ekron, et peribunt reliquiae
   Philistinorum, dicit Dominus Jehova.


   Amos directs here his discourse against Gaza, which the Philistine
   occupied. It was situated in the tribe of Judah, towards the sea; but
   as the Anakims were its inhabitants, the Philistine kept possession of
   it. Then the Jews had these enemies as aktorekous, (guardians of the
   shore), who had a greater opportunity of doing harm from being so near:
   and we may learn from the Prophet's words, that the Philistines, who
   dwelt at Gaza, when they saw the Israelites oppressed by their enemies,
   joined their forces to foreign allies, and that the Jews did the same.
   God then now denounces punishment on them.

   As to the word, Gaza, some think that it was given to the city, because
   Cambyses, when warring with the Egyptians, had deposited there his
   money and valuable furniture; and because the Persian call a treasure,
   gaza; but this is frivolous. We indeed know that the Greek translators
   ever put g (gamma) for an , (oin); as of Omorrha they make Gomorrha, so
   of Oza they make Gaza. Besides, the city had this name before the time
   of Cambyses. It was then more probably thus called from its strength:
   and that the Greeks rendered it Gaza was according to their usual
   practice, as I have said as to other words. But there were two Gazas;
   when the first was demolished, the inhabitants built another near the
   sea. Hence Luke, in the 8^th chapter of the Acts says, that Gaza was a
   desert; and he thus makes a difference between Gaza on the sea-side and
   the old one, which had been previously demolished. But Amos speaks of
   the first Gaza; for he threatens to it that destruction, through which
   it happened that the city was removed to the shores of the
   Mediterranean.

   I come now to the Prophet's words: "God, he says, will not be
   propitious to Gaza for three and four transgressions, as the Philistine
   had so provoked God, that they were now wholly unworthy of pardon and
   mercy. I reminded you in yesterday's Lecture, that there is presented
   to us here a sad spectacle, but yet useful; for we here see so many
   people in such a corrupted state, that their wickedness was become to
   God intolerable: but at this day the state of things in the world is
   more corrupt, for iniquity overflows like a deluge. Whatever then men
   may think of their evils, the Lord from heaven sees how great and how
   irreclaimable is their obstinacy. It is nothing that some throw blame
   on others, or look for some alleviation, since all are ungodly and
   wicked: for we see that God here declares that he would, at the same
   time, take vengeance on many nations. The Idumeans might then have
   objected, and said, that their neighbors were nothing better; others
   might have made the same excuse; every one might have had his defense
   ready, if such a pretext availed, that all were alike implicated in the
   same guilt and wickedness. But we see that God appears here as a judge
   against all nations. Let us not then be deceived by vain delusions,
   when we see that others are like us; let every one know that he must
   bear his own burden before God: I will not then be propitious for three
   and for four transgressions

   Because they carried away, he says, a complete captivity The Prophet
   records here a special crime, -- that the Gazites took away Jews and
   Israelites, and removed them as captives into Idumea, and confined them
   there. I have already said that it was not the Prophet's design to
   enumerate all their sins, but that he was content to mention one crime,
   that the Israelites might understand that they were involved in a
   heavier guilt, because they had grievously offended both God and men.
   If then so severe a vengeance was to be taken on Gaza, they ought to
   have known, that a heavier vengeance awaited them, because they were
   guilty of more and greater sins. But he says that they had effected a
   complete captivity, inasmuch as they had spared neither women, nor
   children, nor old men; for captivity is called perfect or complete,
   when no distinction is made, but when all are taken away
   indiscriminately, without any selection. They then carried away a
   complete captivity, so that no pity either for sex or for age touched
   them: that they might shut them up, he says, in Edom.

   Now follows a denunciation of punishment, -- that God would send a fire
   on the wall of Gaza, to devour its palaces. And it hence appears that
   Gaza was a splendid town, and sumptuously built; and for this reason
   the Prophet speaks of its palaces. He shows, at the same time, that
   neither strength nor wealth would prevent God from executing the
   punishment which the Gazites deserved. He names also other cities of
   Palestine, even Ascalon and Azdod, or Azotus, and Ecron. These cities
   the Philistine then possessed. The Prophet then intimates, that
   wheresoever they might flee, there would be no safe place for them; for
   the Lord would expose as a prey to enemies, not only Gaza, but also all
   the other cities. We may conclude that Ascalon was the first city; for
   there was the royal residence, though Gaza was the capital of the whole
   nation; it might yet be that the pleasantness of its situation, and
   other attractions, might have induced the king to reside there, though
   it was not the metropolis; Him then who holds the scepter I will cut
   off from Ascalon. He at last concludes, that all the remnants of
   Palestine would be destroyed. Now, whenever God denounces destruction
   on the Jews, he ever gives some hope, and says that the remnant would
   be saved: but here the Prophet declares that whatever remained of that
   nation would be destroyed; for God purposed to destroy them altogether,
   and also their very name.

   He therefore adds, that Jehovah Lord had spoken, saith the Lord Jehovah
   This was added for confirmation; for the Philistine were then in
   possession of many and strong defenses, so that they boldly laughed to
   scorn the threatening of the Prophet. He therefore brings forward here
   the name of God. Now follows the prediction respecting Tyrus: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 1:9-10

   9. Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for
   four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they
   delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the
   brotherly covenant:

   9. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Tyri et super quatuor non
   ero ei propitius, quia concluserunt captivitatem perfectam in Edom, et
   non recordati sunt foederis fratrum:

   10. But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the
   palaces thereof.

   10. Et mittam ignem in murum Tyri, qui comedet palatia ejus.


   He uses nearly the same words respecting Tyrus which he did respecting
   Gaza, and charges it with the same sin, which was that of removing the
   Jews from their country, as refugees and exiles, into Idumea, and of
   selling them as captives to the Idumeans. As of all the rest, he
   declares the same of Tyrus, that they had not lightly sinned, and that
   therefore no moderate chastisement was sufficient; for they had for a
   long time abused God's forbearance, and had become stubborn in their
   wickedness.

   But what he says, that they had not been mindful of the covenant of
   brethren, some refer to Hiram and David; for we know that they had a
   brotherly intercourse, and called each other by the name of brothers;
   so great was the kindness between them. Some then think that the
   Tyrians are here condemned for having forgotten this covenant; for
   there ought to have remained among them some regard for the friendship
   which had existed between the two kings. But I know not whether this is
   too strained a view: I rather incline to another, and that is, that the
   Syrians delivered up the Jews and the Israelites to the Idumeans, when
   yet they knew them to be brethren: and they who implicate themselves in
   a matter of this kind are by no means excusable. When I see one
   conspiring for the ruin of his own brother, I see a detestable and a
   monstrous thing; if I abhor not a participation in the same crime, I am
   involved in the same guilt. When therefore the Syrians saw the Idumeans
   raging cruelly against their brethren, for they were descended from the
   same family, they ought doubtless to have shown to the Idumeans how
   alienated they were from all humanity and how perfidious they were
   against their own brethren and relatives. Now the Prophet says, that
   they had been unmindful of the covenant of brethren, because they made
   themselves assistants in so great and execrable a crime as that of
   carrying away Jews into Idumea, and of shutting them up there, when
   they knew that the Idumeans sought nothing else but the entire ruin of
   their own brethren. This seems to be the real meaning of the Prophet.

   But he adds, that God would send a fire on the wall of Tyrus to consume
   its palaces. When this happened, cannot with certainty be known: for
   though Tyrus was demolished by Alexander, as Gaza also was, these
   cities, I doubt not, suffered this calamity long before the coming of
   Alexander of Macedon; and it is probable, as I have already reminded
   you, that the Assyrians laid waste these countries, and also took
   possession of Tyrus, though they did not demolish that city; for in
   Alexander's time there was no king there, it had been changed into a
   republic; the people were free, and had the chief authority. There must
   then have been there no small changes, for the state of the city and
   its government were wholly different from what they had been. We may
   then conclude that Tyrus was laid waste by the Assyrians, but
   afterwards recovered strength, and was a free city in the time of
   Alexander the Great. Let us now proceed: for I dwell not on every word,
   as we see that the same expressions are repeated by the Prophet.

   Amos 1:11-12

   11. Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
   four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did
   pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his
   anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:

   11. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Edom et super quatuor non
   ero ei propitius, quia persequutus est gladio fratrem suum, et violavit
   misericordias suas, et diripuit in seculum ira ejus, et indignationem
   servavit perpetuo:

   12. But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces
   of Bozrah.

   12. Et mittam ignem in Theman, qui comedet palatia Bozrah.


   The Prophet now passes to the Idumeans themselves. He had denounced
   ruin on the uncircumcised nations who delivered up the Jews into their
   hands: but they deserved a much heavier punishment, because their crime
   was much more atrocious. The Idumeans derived their origin, as it is
   well known, from their common father Isaac and bore the same symbol of
   God's covenant, for they were circumcised. Since nearness of blood, and
   that sacred union, could not make them gentle to the Jews, we hence
   perceive how brutal was their inhumanity. They were then unworthy of
   being forgiven by God, when he became so severe a judge against heathen
   nations. But the Prophet says now, that the Idumeans had sinned more
   than their neighbors, and that their obstinacy was unhealable and that
   hence they could no longer be borne, for they had too long abused God's
   forbearance, who had withheld his vengeance until this time.

   He charges them with this crime, that they pursued their brother with
   the sword. There is here an anomaly of the number, for he speaks of the
   whole people. Edom then pursued his brother, that is, the Jews. But the
   Prophet has intentionally put the singular number to enhance their
   crime: for he here placed here, as it were, two men, Edom and Jacob,
   who were really brothers, and even twins. Was it not then a most
   execrable ferocity in Edom to pursue his own brother Jacob? He then
   sets before us here two nations as two men, that he might more fully
   exhibit the barbarity of the Idumeans in forgetting their kindred, and
   in venting their rage against their own blood. They have then pursued
   their brother with the sword; that is, they have been avowed enemies,
   for they had joined themselves to heathen nations. When the Assyrians
   came against the Israelites, the Idumeans put on arms: and this,
   perhaps, happened before that war; for when the Syrians and Israelites
   conspired against the Jews, it is probable that the Idumeans joined in
   the same alliance. However this may have been, the Prophet reproaches
   them with cruelty for arming themselves against their own kindred,
   without any regard for their own blood.

   He afterwards adds, They have destroyed their own compassions; some
   render the words, "their own bowels;" and others in a strained and
   improper manner transfer the relative to the sons of Jacob, as though
   the Prophet had said, that Edom had destroyed the compassions, which
   were due, on account of their near relationship, from the posterity of
   Jacob. But the sense of the Prophet is clearly this, -- that they
   destroyed their own compassions, which means, that they put off all
   sense of religion, and cast aside the first affections of nature. He
   then calls those the compassions of Edom, even such as he ought to have
   been influenced by: but as he had thrown aside all regard for humanity,
   there was not in him that compassion which he ought to have had.

   He then adds, His anger has perpetually raged He now compares the
   cruelty of the Idumeans to that of wild beasts; for they raged like
   fierce wild animals, and spared not their own blood. They then raged
   perpetually, even endlessly, and retained their indignation
   perpetually. The Prophet seems here to allude to Edom or Esau, the
   father of the nation; for he cherished long, we know, his wrath against
   his brother; as he dared not to kill his brother during his father's
   life. Hence he said, I will wait till my father's death, then I will
   avenge myself, (Genesis 27:41) Since Esau then nourished this cruel
   hatred against his brother Jacob, the prophet here charges his
   posterity with the same crime; as though he had said, that they were
   too much like their father, or too much retained his perverse
   disposition, as they cherished and ever retained revenge in their
   hearts, and were wholly implacable. There may have been other causes of
   hatred between the Idumeans and the posterity of Jacob: but they ought,
   notwithstanding, whatever displeasure there may have been, to have
   forgiven their brethren. It was a monstrous thing past endurance, when
   a regard for their own blood did not reconcile those who were, by
   sacred bonds, connected together. We now perceive the object of the
   Prophet: and we here learn, that the Idumeans were more severely
   condemned than those mentioned before, and for this reason, -- because
   they raged so cruelly against their own kindred.

   He says in the last place, I will send fire on Teman, to consume the
   palaces of Bozrah By fire he ever means any kind of destruction. But he
   compares God's vengeance to a burning fire. We know that when fire has
   once taken hold, not only on a house, but on a whole city, there is no
   remedy. So now the Prophet says, that God's vengeance would be
   dreadful, that it would consume whatever hatred there was among them: I
   will then send fire on Teman; which, as it is well known, was the first
   city of Idumea. Let us now proceed --

   Amos 1:13-15

   13. Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of the children of
   Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;
   because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they
   might enlarge their border:

   13. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus filiorum Ammon, et super
   quatuor non ero ei propitius; quia secuerunt gravidas (praegnantes)
   Gilead, ut propagarent suum terminum:

   14. But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour
   the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest
   in the day of the whirlwind:

   14. Et accendam ignem in muro Rabbah, qui vorabit palatia ejus in
   clamore (vel, jubilo) in die proelii, in turbine die tempestatis:

   15. And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
   together, saith the LORD.

   15. Et transibit rex eorum in captivitatem, ipse et principes ejus
   simul, dicit Jehova.


   He now prophesies against the Ammonites, who also derived their origin
   from the same common stock; for they were the posterity of Lot, as it
   is well known; and Lot was counted as the son of Abraham, as Abraham,
   having taken him with him from his country brought him up, no doubt, as
   his own son. Then Abraham was the common father of the Jews and of the
   Ammonites. Now, when the children of Ammon, without any regard to
   relationship, joined their forces to those of enemies, and conspired
   together, their cruelty admitted of no excuse. And there is no doubt
   but that they were guilty of many other crimes; but God, by his
   Prophet, enumerates not all the sins for which he had purposed to
   punish them, and only points out distinctly, as in passing, but one
   sin, and generally declares, that such people were utterly past hope,
   for they had hardened themselves in their wickedness.

   He therefore says of the children of Ammon, that they rent the pregnant
   women Some take hrvt, erut, for hrym, erim, mountains; but I see not
   what can induce them, unless they think it strange that pregnant women
   were rent, that the Ammonites might extend further their borders; and
   for this ends it would be more suitable to regard the word as meaning
   mountains; as though he said, "They have cut through mountains, even
   the earth itself; there has been no obstacle through which the
   Ammonites have not made their way: an insatiable cupidity has so
   inflamed them, that they have rent the very mountains, and destroyed
   the whole order of nature." Others take mountains metaphorically for
   fortified cities; for when one seeks to take possession of a kingdoms
   cities stand in his way like mountains. But this exposition is too
   strained.

   Now, since hrvt, erut, mean women with child, the word, I doubt not, is
   to be taken in its genuine and usual sense, as we see it to be done in
   Hosea. [Hoseah 13:16.] But why does the Prophet say, that the Ammonites
   had rent pregnant women? It is to show, that their cupidity was so
   frantic, that they abstained not from any kind of cruelty. It is
   possible that one be so avaricious as to seek to devour up the whole
   earth, and yet be inclined to clemency. Alexander, the Macedonian,
   though a bloody man, did yet show some measure of kindness: but there
   have been others much more cruel; as the Persian, of whom Isaiah
   speaks, who desired not money, but shed blood, (Isaiah 13:17) So the
   Prophet says here of the Ammonites, that they not only, by unlawful
   means, extended their borders, used violence and became robbers who
   spoiled others of their property, but also that they did not spare even
   women with child. Now this is the worst thing in the storming of towns.
   When a town has wearied out an enemy, both pregnant women, and
   children, and infants may, through fury, be destroyed: but this is a
   rare thing, and never allowed, except under peculiar circumstances. He
   then reproaches the Ammonites, not only for their cupidity, but also
   for having committed every kind of cruelty to satisfy their greediness:
   they have then torn asunder women with child, that they might extend
   their borders.

   I will therefore kindle a fire in the wall of rvh, Rabe, which shall
   devour its palaces, (the Prophet adds nothing new, I shall therefore go
   on,) and this by tumult, or by clamour, in the day of war. The Prophet
   means that enemies would come and suddenly lay waste the kingdom of
   Ammon; and that this would be the case, as a sudden fire lays hold on
   wood, in the day of war; that is as soon as the enemy attacked them, it
   would immediately put them to fight, and execute the vengeance they
   deserved, by a whirlwind in the day of tempest By these figurative
   terms the Prophet intimates that the calamity destructive to the
   Ammonites, would be sudden.

   He finally adds, And their king shall go into captivity, he and his
   princes together As mlkm, melcam, was an idol of the people, some
   regard it here as a proper name; but he says, mlkm hv' vsryv, melcam
   eva ushariu, their king, he and his princes;' hence the Prophet, no
   doubt, names the king of Ammon, for he joins with him his princes. He
   says then that the ruin of the kingdom would be such, that the king
   himself would be led captive by the Assyrians. This prediction was no
   doubt fulfilled, though there is no history of it extant.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast designed, by so many
   examples, to teach the world the fear of thy name, we may improve under
   thy mighty hand, and not abuse thy forbearance, nor gather for
   ourselves a treasure of dreadful vengeance by our obstinacy and
   irreclaimable wickedness, but seasonably repent while thou invites us,
   and while it is the accepted time, and while thou offerest to us
   reconciliation, that being brought to nothing in ourselves, we may
   gather courage through grace, which is offered to us through Christ our
   Lord. Amen.

   Amos 2:1-3

   1. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,
   I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the
   bones of the king of Edom into lime:

   1. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Moab et super quatuor non
   convertam eum (vel, non convertam me, sicut prius diximus,) quia ipse
   combussitossa regis Edom in calcem:

   2. But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of
   Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the
   sound of the trumpet:

   2. Et mittam ignem in Moab qui comedet palatia, (qryvt, alii vertunt
   urbium appellative: sed magis arbitror esse proprium nomen loci) et
   morietur in tumultu Moab, in strepitu, in clangore tubae.

   3. And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay
   all the princes thereof with him, saith the Lord.

   3. Et excidam judicem e medio ejus, et omnes principes ejus occidam cum
   eo, dicit Jehova.


   Now Amos prophesies here against the Moabites, and proclaims respecting
   them what we have noticed respecting the other nations, -- that the
   Moabites were wholly perverse, that no repentance would be hoped for,
   as they had added crimes to crimes, and reached the highest pitch of
   wickedness; for, as we have said, the number, seven, imports this. The
   Prophet then charges the Moabites here with perverseness: and hence we
   learn that God's vengeance did not come hastily upon them, for their
   wickedness was intolerable since they thus followed their crimes. But
   he mentions one thing in particular, -- that they had burnt the bones
   of the king of Edom.

   Some take bones here for courage, as though the Prophet had said, that
   the whole strength of Edom had been reduced into ashes: but this is a
   strained exposition; and its authors themselves confess that they are
   forced to it by necessity, when yet there is none. The comment given by
   the Rabbis does not please them, -- that the body of a certain king had
   been burnt, and then that the Moabites had strangely applied the ashes
   for making a cement instead of lime. Thus the Rabbis trifle in their
   usual way; for when an obscure place occurs, they immediately invent
   some fable; though there be no history, yet they exercise their wit in
   fabulous glosses; and this I wholly dislike: but what need there is of
   running to allegory, when we may simply take what the Prophet says,
   that the body of the king of Edom had been burnt: for the Prophet, I
   doubt not, charges the Moabites with barbarous cruelty. To dig up the
   bodies of enemies, and to burn their bones, -- this is an inhuman deed,
   and wholly barbarous. But it was more detestable in the Moabites, who
   had some connection with the people of Edom; for they descended from
   the same family; and the memory of that relationship ought to have
   continued, since Abraham brought up Lot, the father of the Moabites;
   and thus the Moabites were under an obligation to the Idumeans. If then
   any humanity existed in them, they ought to have restrained their
   passions, so as not to treat so cruelly their brethren. Now, when they
   exceeded all moderation in war, and raged against dead bodies, and
   burnt the bones of the dead, it was, as I have said, an extremely
   barbarous conduct. The meaning then is, that the Moabites could no
   longer be borne with; for in this one instance, they gave an example of
   savage cruelty. Had there been a drop of humanity in them, they would
   have treated more kindly their brethren, the Idumeans; but they burnt
   into lime, that is, into ashes, the bones of the king of Edom, and
   thereby proved that they had forgotten all humanity and justice. We now
   understand the Prophet's meaning.

   He therefore adds a threatening, I will send a fire on Moab, which
   shall devour the palaces of qryvt, Koriut We have stated that what the
   Prophet means by these modes of speaking is that God would consume the
   Moabites by a violent punishment as by a burning fire, that fortified
   places could not hinder him from executing his vengeance, and that
   though they were proud of their palaces, yet these would avail them
   nothing.

   And he subjoins, Moab shall die with tumult, with noise, with the sound
   of the trumpet; that is, I will send strong enemies, who will come and
   make no peace with the Moabites, but will take possession of every
   place, and of fortified cities, by force and by the sword. For what the
   Prophet means by tumult, by shouting, by the sound of the trumpet, is,
   that the Moabites would not come under the power of their enemies by
   certain agreements and compacts, as when a voluntary surrender is made,
   which usually mitigates the hostile rage of enemies; no, he says, it
   shall not be so; for their enemies shall have not only their wealth but
   their lives also.

   He finally adds, And I will cut off the judge from the midst of her,
   and will slay her princes, saith Jehovah. God here declares, that the
   kingdom of the Moabites and the people shall be no more; for we know
   that men cannot exist as a body without some civil government. Wherever
   then there is an assemblage of men, there must be princes to rule and
   govern them. Hence, when God declares that there would be no more a
   judge among the Moabites, it is the same thing as if he had said, that
   their name would be blotted out; for had the people of Moab continued,
   some princes must have necessarily, as we have said, remained among
   them. When princes then are destroyed, the people must also perish, for
   there is no security for them. The Prophet then denounces not here a
   temporary punishment on the Moabites, but utter ruin, from which they
   were never to rise. This is the meaning. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 2:4-5

   4. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for
   four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have
   despised the law of the Lord, and have not kept his commandments, and
   their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have
   walked:

   4. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Jehudah, et super quatuor
   non convertam cum; quia spreverunt (vel, abjecerunt) legem Jehovae, et
   statuta ejus non custodierunt; et errare eos fecerunt mendacia sua,
   post quae ambulaverunt patres ipsorum:

   5. But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces
   of Jerusalem.

   5. Et mittam ignem in Jehudah, qui devorabit palatia Jerusalem.


   Amos turns now his discourse to the tribe of Judah, and to that
   kingdom, which still continued in the family of David. He has hitherto
   spoken of heathen and uncircumcised nations: what he said of them was a
   prelude of the destruction which was nigh the chosen people; for when
   God spared not others who had through ignorance sinned, what was to
   become of the people of Israel, who had been taught in the law? For a
   servant, knowing his master's will, and doing it not, is worthy of many
   stripes, (Luke 12:47) God could not, then, forgive the children of
   Abraham, whom he had adopted as his peculiar people, when he inflicted
   each grievous punishments on heathen nations, whose ignorance, as it is
   commonly thought by men, was excusable. It is indeed true, that all who
   sin without law will justly perish, as Paul says in Romans 2, but when
   a comparison is made between the children of Israel and the wretched
   heathens, who were immersed in errors, the latter were doubtless worthy
   of being pardoned, when compared with that people who had betrayed
   their perverseness, and, as it were, designedly resolved to bring on
   themselves the vengeance of God.

   The Prophet then having hitherto spoken of the Gentiles, turns his
   discourse now to the chosen people, the children of Abraham. But he
   speaks of the tribe of Judah, from which he sprang, as I said at the
   beginning; and he did this, lest any one should charge him with
   favoring his own countrymen: he had, indeed, migrated into the kingdom
   of Israel; but he was there a stranger. We shall now see how severely
   he reproved them. Had he, then, been silent as to the tribe of Judah,
   he might have been subject to calumny; for many might have said, that
   there was a collusion between him and his own countrymen and that he
   concealed their vices, and that he fiercely inveighed against their
   neighbors, through a wicked emulation, in order to transfer the kingdom
   again into the family of David. Hence, that no such suspicion might
   tarnish his doctrine, the Prophet here summons to judgment the tribe of
   Judah, and speaks in no milder language of the Jews than of other
   nations: for he says, that they, through their stubbornness, had so
   provoked God's wrath, that there was no hope of pardon; for such was
   the mass of their vices, that God would now justly execute extreme
   vengeance, as a moderate chastisement would not be sufficient. We now
   then understand the Prophet's design.

   I come now to the words: For they have despised, he says, the law of
   Jehovah. Here he charges the Jews with apostasy; for they had cast
   aside the worship of God, and the pure doctrine of religion. This was a
   crime the most grievous. We hence see, that the Prophet condemns here
   freely and honestly as it became him, the vices of his own people, so
   that there was no room for calumny, when he afterwards became a severe
   censor and reprover of the Israelites; for he does not lightly touch on
   something wrong in the tribe of Judah, but says that they were
   apostates and perfidious, having cast aside the law of God. But it may
   be asked, why the Prophet charges the Jews with a crime so atrocious,
   since religion, as we have seen in the Prophecies of Hosea, still
   existed among them? But to this there is a ready answer: the worship of
   God was become corrupt among them, though they had not so openly
   departed from it as the Israelites. There remained, indeed,
   circumcision among the Israelites; but their sacrifices were
   pollutions, their temples were brothels: they thought that they
   worshipped God; but as a temple had been built at Bethel contrary to
   God's command, the whole worship was a profanation. The Jews were
   somewhat purer; but they, we know, had also degenerated from the
   genuine worship of God. Hence the Prophet does not unjustly say here,
   that they had despised the law of God.

   But we must notice the explanation which immediately follows, -- that
   they kept not his statutes. The way then by which Amos proves that the
   Jews were covenant-breakers, and that having repudiated God's law, they
   had fallen into wicked superstitions, is by saying, that they kept not
   the precepts of God. It may, however, appear that he treats them here
   with too much severity; for one might not altogether keep God's
   commands either through ignorance or carelessness, or some other fault,
   and yet be not a covenant-breaker or an apostate. I answer, -- That in
   these words of the Prophet, not mere negligence is blamed in the Jews;
   but they are condemned for designedly, that is, knowingly and willfully
   departing from the commandments of God, and devising for themselves
   various modes of worship. It is not then to keep the precepts of God,
   when men continue not under his law, but audaciously contrive for
   themselves new forms of worship; they regard not what God commands, but
   lay hold on anything pleasing that comes to their minds. This crime the
   Prophet now condemns in the Jews: and hence it was that they had
   despised the law of God. For men should never assume so much as to
   change any thing in the worship of God; but due reverence for God ought
   to influence them: were they persuaded of this -- that there is no
   wisdom but what comes from God -- they would surely confine themselves
   within his commands. Whenever then they invent new and fictitious forms
   of worship, they sufficiently show that they regard not what the Lord
   wills, what he enjoins, what he forbids. Thus, then, they despise his
   law, and even cast it away.

   This is a remarkable passage; for we see, first, that a most grievous
   sin is condemned by the Prophet, and that sin is, that the Jews
   confined not themselves to God's law, but took the liberty of
   innovating; this is one thing: and we also learn how much God values
   obedience, which is better, as it is said in another place, than all
   sacrifices, (1 Samuel 15:22) And that we may not think this a light or
   a trifling sin, let us notice the expression -- that they despised the
   law of God. Every one ought to dread this as the most monstrous thing;
   for we cannot despise the law of God without insulting his majesty. And
   yet the Holy Spirit declares here, that we repudiate and reject the law
   of God, except we wholly follow what it commands, and continue within
   the limits prescribed by it. We now perceive what the Prophet means.

   But he also adds, that their own lies deceived or caused them to go
   astray. He here confirms his preceding doctrine; for the Jews had ever
   a defense ready at hand, that they did with good intent what the
   Prophet condemned in them. They, forsooth! sedulously worshipped God,
   though they mixed their own leaven, by which their sacrifices were
   corrupted: it was not their purpose to spend their substance in vain,
   to undergo great expenses in sacrifices, and to undertake much labor,
   had they not thought that it was service acceptable to God! As then the
   pretense of good intention, (as they say,) ever deceives the
   unbelieving, the Prophet condemns this pretense, and shows it to be
   wholly fallacious, and of no avail. "It is nothing," he says, "that
   they pretend before God some good intention; their own lies deceive
   them." And Amos, no doubt, mentions here these lies, in opposition to
   the commands of God. As soon then as men swerve from God's word, they
   involve themselves in many delusions, and cannot but go astray; and
   this is deserving of special notice. We indeed see how much wisdom the
   world claims for itself: for as soon as we invent anything we are
   greatly delighted with it; and the ape, according to the old proverb,
   is ever pleased with its own offspring. But this vice especially
   prevails, when by our devices we corrupt and adulterate the worship of
   God. Hence the Prophet here declares, that whatever is added to God's
   word, and whatever men invent in their own brains is a lie: "All this,"
   he says, "is nothing but imposture." We now see of what avail is good
   intention: by this indeed men harden themselves; but they cannot make
   the Lord to retract what he has once declared by the mouth of his
   Prophet. Let us then take heed to continue within the boundaries of
   God's word, and never to leap over either on this or on that side; for
   when we turn aside ever so little from the pure word of God, we become
   immediately involved in many deceptions.

   It then follows, After which have walked their fathers; literally it
   is, Which their fathers have walked after them: [20] but we have given
   the sense. The Prophet here exaggerates their sin, the insatiable rage
   of the people; for the children now followed their fathers. This vice,
   we know, prevailed in all ages among the Jews; leaving the word of God,
   they ever followed their own dreams, and the delusions of Satan. Since
   God had now often tried to correct this vice by his Prophets, and no
   fruit followed, the Prophet charges them here with hardness, and by
   this circumstance enhances the sin of the Jews: "It is nothing new," he
   says, "for children to imitate their fathers, and to be wholly like
   them: they are then the bad eggs of bad ravens." So also said Stephen,

   Ye are hard and uncircumcised in heart, and resist the Holy Spirit, as
   your fathers also did formerly,' (Acts 7:51.)

   We now understand the intention of the Prophet.

   But we hence learn of what avail is the subterfuge resorted to by the
   Papists, when they boast of antiquity. For they set up against the Law,
   the Prophets, and the Gospel, this shield, -- that theirs is the old
   religion, that they have not been the first founders, but that they
   follow what has been handed down to them from early times, and observed
   for many ages. When the Papists boastingly declare all this, they think
   that they say enough to put God to silence, and wholly to reject his
   Word. But we see how frivolous is this sort of caviling, and how
   worthless before God: for the Prophet does not concede to the Jews the
   example of the fathers as an excuse, but sets forth their sin as being
   greater because they followed their perfidious fathers, who had
   forsaken the Law of the Lord. The same thing is also said by Ezekiel,

   After the precepts of your fathers walk not,'
   (Ezekiel 20:18.)

   We now see what sort of crime is that of which the Prophet speaks. At
   last a threatening follows, "The Lord saith, Fire will I send on Judah,
   which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.' But all this we have
   already explained. Let us now proceed --

   Amos 2:6

   6. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for
   four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold
   the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;

   6. Sic dicit Jehova, Super tribus sceleribus Israel et super quatuor
   non convertam cum (vel, ad eum,) quia emerunt (vel, vendiderunt: quidam
   enim deducunt a krt, et putant m esse literam formalem nominis: alii
   autem deducunt a mkr quod est vendere vel mercari; sed sensus Prophetae
   eodem redit, quia intelligit quasi ad nundinationem expositos fuisse
   justos; ideoque proestabit vertere, pretium ipsorum; quasi diceret,
   commercium non secus ac de merce voenale fuisse habitum; quoniam ergo
   emerunt) justum pro argento, et miserum pro calceamentis.


   The Prophet here assails the Israelites, to whom he had been sent, as
   we have said at the beginning. He now omits every reference to other
   nations; for his business was with the Israelites to whom he was
   especially appointed a teacher. But he wished to set before them, as in
   various mirrors, the judgment of God, which awaited them, that he might
   the more effectually awaken them: and he wished also to exhibit in the
   Jews themselves an example of the extreme vengeance of God, though
   there was greater purity among them, at least a purer religion, and
   more reverence for God prevailed as yet among them. He in this way
   prepared the Israelites, that they might not obstinately and proudly
   reject his doctrine. He now then addresses them, and says that they
   continued unmoved in their many sins. The import of the whole is, that
   if the Moabites, the Idumeans, the Tyrians, the Sidonians, and other
   nations, and that if the Jews as well as these were irreclaimable in
   their obstinacy, so that their diseases were incurable, and their
   wickedness such as God could no longer endure, the Israelites were also
   in the same condition; for they also continued perverse in their
   wickedness, and provoked God, and repented not, though God had waited
   long, and exhorted them to repent.

   It is now meet for us to bear in mind what we have before said, -- that
   if impiety was so rampant in that age, and the contempt of God so
   prevailed, that men could not be restored to a sane mind, and if
   iniquity everywhere overflowed, (for Amos accuses not a few people, but
   many nations,) let us at this day beware, lest such corruptions prevail
   among us; for, certainly, the world is now much worse than it was then:
   nay, since the Prophet says here, that both the Israelites and the Jews
   were wholly irreclaimable in their obstinacy, there is no excuse for us
   at this day for deceiving ourselves with an empty name, because we have
   the symbol of faith, having been baptized; and in case we have other
   marks, which seem to belong to the Church of God, let us not think that
   we are therefore free from guilt, if we allow ourselves that unruliness
   condemned here by the Prophet both in the Israelites and in the Jews;
   for they had become hardened against all instructions, against all
   warnings. Let, then, these examples rouse our attention, lest we, like
   them, harden ourselves so much as to constrain the Lord to execute on
   us extreme vengeance.

   Let us now especially observe what the Prophet lays to the charge of
   Israel. He begins with their cruel deeds; but the whole book is taken
   up with reproofs; there is to the very end a continued accusation as to
   those crimes which then prevailed among the people of Israel. He does
   not then point out only one particular crime, as with respect to the
   other nations; but he scrutinizes all the vices of which the people
   were guilty, as though he would thoroughly anatomize them. But these we
   shall notice in their proper order.

   Now as to the first thing, the Prophet says, that the just among the
   Israelites was sold for silver, yea, for shoes. It may be asked, Why is
   it that he does not begin with those superstitions, in which they
   surpassed the Jews? for if God had resolved to destroy Jerusalem and
   his own temple, because they had fallen away into superstitious and
   spurious modes of worship, how much more ought such a judgment to have
   been executed on the Israelites, as they had perverted the whole law,
   and had become wholly degenerate; and even circumcision was nothing but
   a profanation of God's covenant? Why, then, does not the Prophet touch
   on this point? To this I answer, -- That as superstition had now for
   many years prevailed among them, the Prophet does not make this now his
   subject; but we shall hereafter see, that he has not spared these
   ungodly deprivations which had grown rampant among the Israelites. He
   indeed sharply arraigns all their superstitions; but he does this in
   its suitable place. It was now necessary to begin with common evils;
   and this was far more opportune than if he had at first spoken of
   superstitions; for they might have said, that they did indeed worship
   God. He therefore preferred condemning the Jews for alienating
   themselves from the pure commandments of God; and as to the Israelites,
   he reproves here their gross vices. But after having charged them with
   cruelty, shameless rapacity, and many lusts, after having exposed their
   filthy abominations, he then takes the occasion, as being then more
   suitable of exclaiming against superstitions. This order our Prophet
   designedly observed, as we shall see more fully from the connection of
   his discourse.

   I now return to the words, that they sold the just for silver, and the
   poor for shoes. He means that there was no justice nor equity among the
   Israelites, for they made a sale of the children of God: and it was a
   most shameful thing, that there was no remedy for injuries. For we
   hence, no doubt, learn, that the Prophet levels his reproof against the
   judges who then exercised authority. The just, he says, is sold for
   silver: this could not apply to private individuals, but to judges, to
   whom it belonged to extend a helping hand to the miserable and the
   poor, to avenge wrongs, and to give to every one his right. It is then
   the same as though the Prophet had said, that unbridled licentiousness
   reigned triumphant among the Israelites, so that just men were exposed
   as a prey, and were set, as it were, on sale. He says, first, that they
   were sold for silver, and then he adds for shoes: and this ought to be
   carefully observed; for when once men begin to turn aside from the
   right course, they abandon themselves to evil without any shame. When
   an attempt is first made to draw aside a man that is just and upright
   and free from what is corrupt, he is not immediately overcome; though a
   great price may be offered to him, he will yet stand firm: but when he
   has sold his integrity for ten pieces of gold, he may afterwards be
   easily bought, as the case is usually will women. A woman, while she is
   pure, cannot be easily drawn away from her conjugal fidelity: she may
   yet be corrupted by a great price; and when once corrupted, she will
   afterwards prostitute herself, so that she may be bought for a crust of
   bread. The same is the case with judges. They, then, who at first covet
   silver, that is, who cannot be corrupted except by a rich and fat
   bribe, will afterwards barter their integrity for the meanest reward;
   for there is no shame any more remaining in them. This is what the
   Prophet points out in these words, -- That they sold the just for
   silver; that is, that they sold him for a high price, and then that
   they were corrupted by the meanest gift, that if one offered them a
   pair of shoes, they would be ready without any blush of shame to
   receive such a bribe.

   We now then see the crime of which Amos accused the Israelites. They
   could not raise an objection here, which they might have done, if he
   touched their superstitions. He wished therefore to acquire authority
   by reprobating first their manifest and obvious crimes. He afterwards,
   as it has been stated, speaks in its proper place, of that fictitious
   worship, which they, after having rejected the Law of God, embraced. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 2:7

   7. That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and
   turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in
   unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

   7. Anhelantes super pulverem terrae ad caput inopum, viam miserorum
   (vel, pauperum) deflectere facient: vir et pater ejus ingredientur ad
   puellam ut profanent nomen sanctum meam (vel, nomen sanctitatis meae.)


   Here Amos charges them first with insatiable avarice; they panted for
   the heads of the poor on the dust of the earth. This place is in my
   judgment not well understood. s'ph, shaph, means to pant and to
   breathe, and is taken often metaphorically as signifying to desire:
   hence some render the words, "They desire the heads of the poor to be
   in the dust of the earth;" that is, they are anxious to see the
   innocent cast down and prostrate on the ground. But there is no need of
   many words to refute this comment; for ye see that it is strained.
   Others say, that in their cupidity they cast down the miserable into
   the dust; they therefore think that a depraved cupidity is connected
   with violence, and they put the lust for the deed itself.

   But what need there is of having recourse to these extraneous meanings,
   when the words of the Prophet are in themselves plain and clear enough?
   He says that they [18]panted for the heads of the poor on the ground;
   as though he had said, that they were not content with casting down the
   miserable, but that they gaped anxiously, until they wholly destroyed
   them. There is then nothing to be changed or added in the Prophet's
   words, which harmonize well together, and mean, that through cupidity
   they panted for the heads of the poor, after the poor had been cast
   down, and were laid prostrate in the dust. The very misery of the poor,
   whom they saw to be in their power, and lying at their feet, ought to
   have satisfied them: but when such an insatiable cupidity still
   inflamed them, that they panted for more punishment on the poor and the
   miserable, was it not a fury wholly outrageous? We now perceive the
   Prophet's meaning: He points out again what he has said in the former
   verse, -- that the Israelites were given to rapacity, avarice, and
   cruelty of every kind.

   He adds at last, and the way of the miserable they pervert. He still
   inveighs against the judges; for it can hardly comport with what
   belongs to private individuals, but it properly appertains to judges to
   pervert justice, and to violate equity for bribery; so that he who had
   the best cause became the loser, because he brought no bribe
   sufficiently ample. We now see what was the accusation he alleged
   against the Israelites. But there follows another charge, that of
   indulgence in lusts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, almighty God, that since we see so grievous punishments formerly
   executed on unbelievers who had never tasted of the pure knowledge of
   thy word, we may be warned by their example, so as to abstain from all
   wickedness, and to continue in pure obedience to thy word; and that, as
   thou hast made known to us that thou hatest all those superstitions and
   depravations by which we turn aside from thy word, -- O grant, that we
   may ever be attentive to that role which has been prescribed to us by
   thee in the Law, as well as in the Prophets and in the Gospel, so that
   we may constantly abide in thy precepts, and be wholly dependent on the
   words of thy month, and never turn aside either to the right hand or to
   the left, but glorify thy name, as thou has commanded us, by offering
   to thee a true, sincere, and spiritual worship, through Christ our
   Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-second

   It follows, in the seventh verse, that the son and the father entered
   in into the same maid. The Prophet here charges the people of Israel
   with the unbridled lusts which prevailed then among them; which were
   promiscuous and even incestuous. It is, we know, a detestable
   monstrosity when a father and a son have connection with the same
   woman; for the common feeling of mankind abhors such flagitousness. But
   the Israelites were so much addicted to their own lusts, that the
   father and the son had the same woman in common; as indeed it must
   happen when men allow themselves excessive indulgences. A strumpet
   will, indeed, readily admit a son and a father without any difference,
   for she has no shame; and no fear of God restrains abandoned women
   given up to filthiness. It hence becomes a common thing for a father
   and a son to pollute themselves by an incestuous concubinage. But it is
   no diminution of guilt before God, when men, blinded by their lusts,
   make no difference, and without any discrimination, and without any
   shame, follow their own sinful propensities. Whenever this happens, it
   certainly proves that there is no fear of God, and that even the common
   feeling of nature is extinct. Hence the Prophet now justly condemns in
   the Israelites this crime, that the father and the son entered in into
   the same woman.

   An amplification of this crime is also added, -- that they thus
   polluted the holy name of God. We indeed know that the people of Israel
   were chosen for this end -- that the name of God might be supplicated
   by them; and well known is that declaration, often repeated by Moses,

   Be ye holy, for I am holy' (Leviticus 11:44)

   Hence the children of Israel could not defile themselves without
   polluting at the same time the name of God, which was engraven on them.
   God then complains here of this profanation; for the children of Israel
   not only contaminated themselves, but also profaned whatever was sacred
   among them, inasmuch as the name of God was exposed to reproach, when
   the people thus gave way to their filthy lusts. We now understand what
   the Prophet means. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 2:8

   8. And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every
   altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their
   god.

   8. Et super vestes oppignoratas accubuerunt prope omne altare, et vinum
   damnatorum biberunt in domo Dei sui.


   Here the Prophet again inveighs against the people's avariciousness,
   and addresses his discourse especially to the chief men; for what he
   mentions could not have been done by the common people, as the lower
   and humbler classes could not make feasts by means of spoils gained by
   judicial proceedings. The Prophet then condemns here, no doubt, the
   luxury and rapacity of men in high stations. They lie down, he says, on
   pledged clothes nigh every altar. God had forbidden, in his law, to
   take from a poor man a pledge, the need of which he had for the support
   of life and daily use, (Exodus 22:26) For instance, it was prohibited
   by the law to take from a poor man his cloak or his coat, or to take
   the covering of his bed, or any thing else of which he had need. But
   the Prophet now accuses the Israelites, that they took away pledges and
   clothes without any distinction, and lay down on them nigh their
   altars. This belonged to the rich.

   Then follows another clause, which, strictly speaking, must be
   restricted to the judges and governors, They have drunk the wine of the
   condemned in the house, or in the temple, of their God This may also be
   understood of the rich, who were wont to indulge in luxury by means of
   ill-gotten spoils: for they litigated without cause; and when they
   gained judgment in their favor, they thought it lawful to fare more
   sumptuously. This expression of the Prophet may therefore be extended
   to any of the rich. But he seems here to condemn more specifically the
   cruelty and rapaciousness of the judges. We now then perceive what the
   Prophet had in view by saying, that they lay down on pledged garments.

   He then says that they drank wine derived from fines, which had been
   laid on the condemned. But this circumstance, that is added, ought to
   be observed, -- that they lay down near altars and drank in the very
   temple: for the Prophet here laughs to scorn the gross superstition of
   the Israelites, that they thought that they were discharging their duty
   towards God, provided they came to the temple and offered sacrifices at
   the altar. Thus, indeed, are hypocrites wont to appease God, as if one
   by puppets played with a child. This has been a wickedness very common
   in all ages, and is here laid to the charge of the Israelites by the
   Prophet: they dared with an open front to enter the temple, and there
   to bring the pledged garments, and to feast on their spoils. Hypocrites
   do ever make a den of thieves of God's temple, (Matthew 21:13) for they
   think that all things are lawful for them, provided they put on the
   appearance, by external worship, of being devoted to God. Since, then,
   the Israelites promised themselves impunity and took liberty to sin,
   because they performed religious ceremonies, the Prophet here sharply
   reproves them: they even dared to make God a witness of their cruelty
   by bringing pledged garments and by blending their spoils with their
   sacrifices, as though God had a participation with robbers.

   We hence see that rapaciousness and avarice are not alone condemned
   here by the Prophet, but that the gross superstition of the Israelites
   is also reprobated, because they thought that there would be no
   punishment for them, though they plundered and robbed the poor,
   provided they reserved a part of the spoil for God, as though a
   sacrifice from what had been unjustly got were not an abomination to
   him.

   But it may be asked, Why does the Prophet thus condemn the Israelites
   for they had no sacred temple; and we also know (as it has been
   elsewhere stated) that the temples, in which they thought that they
   worshipped God, were filthy brothels, and full of all obscenity. How is
   it, then, that the Prophet now so sharply inveighs against them,
   because they mingled their spoils with their impure sacrifices? To this
   the answer is, That he had regard to their views, and derided the
   grossness of their minds, that they thus childishly trifled with the
   God whom they imagined for themselves. We say the same at this day to
   the Papists, -- that they blend profane with sacred things, when they
   prostitute their masses, and also when they trifle with God in their
   ceremonies. It is certain that whatever the Papists do is an
   abomination; for the whole of religion is with them adulterated: but
   they yet cease not to wrong God, whose name they pretend to profess.
   Such also were then the Israelites: though they professed still to
   worship God, they were yet sacrilegious; though they offered sacrifices
   to the calves in Dan and in Bethel, they yet reproached God, for they
   ever abused his name. This, then, is the crime the Prophet now condemns
   in them. But what I have said must be remembered, -- that this blind
   assurance is reprehended in the Israelites, that they thought spoils to
   be lawful provided they professed to worship God: but they thus
   rendered double their crime, as we have said; for they tried to make
   God the associate of robbers, mingling as they did their pollutions
   with their sacrifices. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 2:9-12

   9. Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
   height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed
   his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

   9. Et ego exterminavi Amorrhaeum a facie ipsorum, cujus proceritas erat
   sicut proceritas cedrorum, et qui fortis erat sicut quercus; et perdidi
   fructum ejus superne et radicem ejus subtus.

   10. Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty
   years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

   10. Et ego eduxi vos e terra Egypti, et deduxi vos (ambulare feci vos
   ad verbum) in deserto per quadraginta annos ad possidendam terram
   Amorrhaei.

   11. And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
   for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the
   Lord

   11. Et suscitavi ex filiis vestris prophetas, et ex juvenibus vestris
   Nazaraeos: annon etiam hoc, filii Israel? dicit Jehovah.

   12. But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
   prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

   12. Et propinastis Nazaraeis vinum, et super prophetis mandastis,
   dicendo, Non prophetabitis.


   God expostulates here with the Israelites for their ingratitude. He
   records the benefits he had before conferred on that people; and then
   shows how unworthily and disgracefully they had conducted themselves;
   for they forgot their many blessings and proudly despised God, and
   acted as if they were like other nations, and not bound to God for the
   singular benefit of adoption. The sum then is that God here complains
   that he had ill bestowed his blessings; and he reproves the people for
   their impiety, inasmuch as they did not lead a holier life after having
   been freely redeemed.

   He says first, I have exterminated the Amorite before their face. God
   shows here that he was disgracefully defrauded by the Israelites, for
   whose sake he had previously destroyed the Amorites. For why were the
   Amorites exterminated, but that God would cleanse the land, and also,
   that he might give there a dwelling to his own people, that he might be
   purely worshipped? Then the people of Israel ought to have given up
   themselves wholly to the service of God; but as they neglected to do
   this, they frustrated the purpose of God, who had expelled the Amorites
   from that land, yea, and entirely destroyed them. The first complaint
   then is, that the children of Israel were nothing better than the
   Amorites, though God had given them the land, which was taken from its
   natives, that they might dwell in it, and on the condition, that his
   name should be there worshipped. Hence the Prophets say elsewhere, that
   they were Amorites. They ought to have been a new people; but as they
   followed the examples of others, in what did they differ from them?
   They are therefore called their posterity. But the Prophet speaks not
   here so severely; he only reproves the Israelites, because they
   differed in nothing from the Amorites, whom they knew to have been
   destroyed that they might be introduced into their place, and succeed
   to their inheritance.

   It is then added, that the Amorites were tall in stature, and also that
   they were strong men. By these words the Prophet intimates that the
   Amorites were not conquered by the people's valor, but by the wonderful
   power of God. We indeed know that they were dreaded by the people of
   Israel, for they were like giants. Then the Prophet speaks here of
   their height and strength, that the Israelites might consider that they
   overcame them not by their own valor, but that the land was given them
   by a miracle, for they had to do with giants, on whom they could hardly
   dare to look. It was then God who prostrated the cedars and the oaks
   before his people. We hence learn, that the Israelites could not boast
   of their own strengths as though they took possession of the land,
   because by means of war they ejected their enemies; for this was done
   by the singular kindness of God. They could not indeed have contended
   with their enemies, had not that been fulfilled which the Lord had so
   often foretold, For you, while still, I will fight,' (Exodus 14:14) We
   now perceive the Prophet's intention. But we may hence farther learn,
   that the Israelites had not possessed the land, because they were more
   excellent than the Amorites, its ancient inhabitants; but because it so
   pleased God. There was therefore no reason for the people of Israel to
   be proud on account of any excellency. It hence appears that they, who
   did not consider this remarkable kindness done to them, were more than
   doubly ungrateful to God.

   He says that their fruit above and root below were destroyed. By this
   metaphor God enlarges on what he said before, that the Amorites had
   been exterminated, so that none of them remained. "I have demolished,"
   he says, or, "I have entirely destroyed the root beneath and the fruit
   above; I have extinguished the very name of the nation." And yet the
   Israelites were not better, though the Amorites were thus destroyed;
   but having succeeded in their place, they became like them: this was
   utterly inexcusable. The more severe God's vengeance had been towards
   the Amorites, the more ought the Israelites to have extolled his favor:
   but when with closed eyes they passed by so remarkable a testimony of
   God's paternal love, it appears that they were extremely wicked and
   ungrateful.

   He afterwards subjoins, I have made you to ascend from the land of
   Egypt; I have made you to walk in the desert for forty years, in order
   to possess the land of the Amorite. The circumstances here specified
   are intended to confirm the same thing, that God had miraculously
   redeemed his people. Men, we know, for the most part extenuate the
   favors of God; nay, this evil is innate in us. This is the reason why
   the Prophet so largely describes and extols the redemption of the
   people. Hence he says now that they had been led out of the land of
   Egypt. And they ought to have remembered what had been their condition
   in Egypt; for there they were most miserably oppressed. When therefore
   that coming out was set before them, it was the same as if God had
   reminded them how shamefully they had been treated, and how hard had
   been their bondage in Egypt. That beginning ought to have humbled them,
   and also to have stimulated them to the cultivation of piety. When now
   they proudly exulted against God, when no recollection of their
   deliverance laid hold on them, this vice is justly laid to their charge
   by the Prophet: "See," he says, "I have brought you forth from the land
   of Egypt; what were ye then? what was your nobility? what was your
   wealth or riches? what was your power? For the Egyptians treated you as
   the vilest slaves; your condition then was extremely ignominious; ye
   were as lost, and I redeemed you: and now buried is the recollection of
   so illustrious a kindness, which deserved to be for ever remembered."

   He afterwards adds, I have made you to walk, etc. The Prophet here
   reminds them of the desert, that the Israelites might know that God
   might have justly closed up against them an entrance into the land,
   though he had promised it for an inheritance to Abraham. For how was it
   that the Lord led them about for so long a time, except that they, as
   far as they could, had denied God, and rendered themselves unworthy of
   enjoying the promised land? Then the Prophet indirectly blames the
   Israelites here for having been the cause why God detained them for
   forty years without introducing them immediately into the promised
   land; which might have easily been done, had they not closed the door
   against themselves by their ingratitude. This is one reason why the
   Prophet now speaks of the forty years. And then, as God had in various
   ways testified his kindness towards the Israelites, he had thus bound
   them the more to himself; but an ungodly forgetfulness had buried all
   his favors. God daily rained manna on them from heaven; he also gave
   them drink from a dry rock; he guided them during the day by a pillar
   of cloud, and in the night by fire: and we also know how often God bore
   with them, and how many proofs he gave them of his forbearance. The
   Prophet, then, by speaking here of the forty years, meant to counsel
   the Israelites to call to mind the many favors, by which they were
   bound to God, while they were miraculously led by him for forty years
   in the desert.

   He now subjoins, I have raised from your sons Prophets, and Nazarites
   from your young or strong men, (for vchrym, becharim, as we have
   elsewhere said, are called by the Hebrews chosen men;) then from your
   youth or chosen men have I raised Nazarites. Was it not so, O children
   of Israel? or certainly it was so: for the particle 'ph, aph, sometimes
   is a simple affirmation, and sometimes an addition. Is not then all
   this true, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. God first reminds them
   that he had raised up Prophets from their sons. It if a remarkable
   proof of God's love, that he deigns to guide his people by Prophets:
   for if God were to speak himself from heaven, or to send his angels
   down, it would apparently be much more dignified; but when he so
   condescends as to employ mortal men and our own brethren, who are the
   agents of his Spirit, in whom he dwells, and by whose mouth he speaks,
   it cannot indeed be esteemed as highly as it deserves, that the Lord
   should thus accommodate himself to us in so familiar a manner. This is
   the reason why he now says, that he had raised up Prophets from their
   sons. They might have objected and said, that he had introduced the
   Law, and that then the heaven was moved, and that the earth shook: but
   he speaks of his daily favor in having been pleased to speak
   continually to his people, as it were, from mouth to mouth, and this by
   men: I have raised up, he says, Prophets from your sons; that is, "I
   have chosen angels from the midst of you." The Prophets are indeed, as
   it were, celestial ambassadors, and God commands them to be heard, the
   same as if he himself appeared in a visible form. Since then he choose
   angels from the midst of us, is not this an invaluable favor? We hence
   see how much force is contained in this reproof, when the Lord says,
   that Prophets had been chosen from his own people.

   And he mentions also the Nazarites. It appears sufficiently evident
   from Numbers 6:1-8, why God appointed Nazarites. Nothing is more
   difficult, we know, than to induce men to follow a common rule; for
   they ever seek something new; and hence have arisen so many devices, so
   many additions, in short, so many leavenings by which God's worship is
   corrupted; for each wishes to be more holy than another, and affects
   some singularity. In case then any one had a wish to consecrate himself
   to God beyond what was commonly required, the Lord instituted a
   peculiar observance, that the people might not attempt any thing
   without at least his permission. Hence, when any one wished to
   consecrate himself to God, though they were all holy, he yet observed
   certain regulations: he abstained from wine; he allowed his hair to
   grow; in a word, he observed those ceremonial rites which we find in
   the chapter already referred to. God now reminds the Israelites that he
   had omitted nothing calculated to preserve them pure and holy, and
   entire in his worship.

   After having related these two things, he asks them, Is not all this
   true? The facts were indeed well known: then the question, it may be
   said, was superfluous. But the Prophet designedly asked the Israelites
   the question here -- Is it not so? that he might more deeply touch
   their hearts. We indeed often despise things well known, and we see how
   many heedlessly allow what they hear, and pass by things without any
   thought. Such must have been the torpidity of the Israelites; they
   might have confessed without disputing that all this was true, -- that
   the Lord had raised up Prophets from their children, and that he had
   given to them that peculiar service of which we have spoken; but they
   mighty at the same time, have contemptuously overlooked the whole, had
   not this been added: "What do ye mean, O Israelites? ye do indeed see
   that nothing has been left undone by me to retain you in my service:
   how then is it now, that your lust leads you away from me, and that
   having shaken off the yoke, ye grow thus wanton against me?" We now
   perceive why the Prophet inserted this clause, for it was necessary
   that the Israelites should be more sharply roused, that being
   convicted, they might acknowledge their guilt.

   But it now follows, Ye have to the Nazarites quaffed wine, and on the
   Prophets ye have laid a command, that they should not prophesy God
   complains here that the service which he had instituted had been
   violated by the people. It seems indeed a light offense, that wine had
   been given to the Nazarites; for the kingdom of God, we know, is not
   meat and drink, (1 Corinthians 8:8) though this saying of Paul was not
   yet made known, it was yet true in all ages. It was then lawful for the
   Nazarites to drink wine, provided they used moderation. To this the
   simple answer is that it was lawful to drink wine, for they of their
   own accord undertook to abstain from it. In similar manner God forbade
   the priests to drink wine or strong drink whenever they entered the
   temple. God indeed did not wish to be served with this kind of
   ceremony; but his intention was to show, by such a rite, that a greater
   temperance is required in priests than in the people in general. His
   purpose then to withdraw them from the common mode of living, when they
   entered the temple; for they were as mediators between God and his
   people: they ought then to have consecrated themselves in a special
   manner. We now see that the priests were reminded by this external
   symbol, that greater holiness was required in them than in the people.
   The same thing must be also said of the Nazarites. The Nazarites might
   drink wine; but during the time they consecrated themselves to God,
   they were not allowed to drink wine, that they might thereby
   acknowledge that they were in a manner separated from the common habits
   of men, and were come nearer to God. We now understand why it was not
   lawful for the Nazarites to drink wine.

   But it is frivolous for the Papists to pretend this example, and to
   introduce it in defense of their superstitions, and of their foolish
   and rash vows, which they undertake without any regard to God: for God
   expressly sanctioned and confirmed whatever the Nazarites did under the
   law. Let the Papists show a proof for their monastic vows, and foolish
   rites, by which they now trifle with God. We also know that there is a
   great difference between the Nazarites and the Papal monks; for the
   monks vow perpetual celibacy; others vow abstinence from flesh during
   life; and these things are done foolishly and rashly. They indeed think
   that the worship of God consists in these trifles. They promise what is
   not in their own power; for they renounce marriage, when they know not
   whether they are endued with the gift of chastity. And to abstain from
   flesh all their life is more foolish still, because they make this to
   be a part of God's service. I do, at the same time, wonder that they
   bring forward this example, since there are none so holy under the
   Papacy as to abstain from wine. As for the Carthusians and other monks
   of the holier sort, they seem determined to take revenge on abstinence
   from flesh, for they choose the sweetest and the liveliest wine; as
   though they intended to get a compensation for the loss and deprivation
   they undergo, when they pledge to God their abstinence from flesh, by
   reserving the best wine for themselves. These things are extremely
   ludicrous. Besides it is a sufficient reply if we adduce what I have
   already said, that the Nazarites did nothing under the law but what God
   in his word approved and sanctioned.

   Since God then so sharply and severely reproved the Israelites for
   giving wine to the Nazarites, what must be expected now, when we
   transgress the chief commandments of God, when we corrupt his whole
   spiritual worship? It seemed apparently but a venial sin, so to speak,
   in the Nazarites to drink wine. Had they become wanton or robbed, or
   had they done wrong to their brethren, or committed forgery, the charge
   against them would have doubtless been much more atrocious. Yet the
   Prophet does not now abstain from bitterly complaining that they drank
   wine. Then, since God would have us to worship him in a spiritual
   manner, a much heavier charge lies against us, if we violate his
   spiritual worship. As, for instance, if we now pollute the sacraments,
   if we corrupt the purity of divine worship, if we treat his word with
   scorn, yea, if we transgress as to these main points of religion, much
   less is our excuse. Let us then remember that the Prophet here reproves
   the Israelites for giving wine to the Nazarites.

   He then adds, that they commanded the Prophets not to prophesy. It is
   certain that the Prophets were not forbidden to speak, at least
   expressly forbidden: but when the liberty of teaching faithfully as
   they ought to do is taken away from God's servants, and a command to
   this effect is given them, it is the same thing as to reject wholly
   their doctrine. The Israelites wished Prophets to be among them; and
   yet they could not endure their plain reproofs. But when they had
   polluted the worship of God, when their whole conduct became dissolute,
   the Prophets sharply inveighed against them: this freedom could not be
   endured by the Israelites; they wished to be spared and flattered. What
   then the Prophet now lays to their charge is that they forbade God's
   servants to declare the word freely and honestly as God had commanded
   them. Hence he says, On the Prophets they have laid a charge, that they
   should not prophesy.

   This evil reigns in the world at this day. It would indeed be an
   execrable audacity wholly to reject the Lord's word; this is what even
   ungodly men dare not openly to do: but they wish at the same time some
   middle course to be adopted, that God might not fully exercise
   authority over them. They then would gladly put restraint on the Holy
   Spirit, so as not to allow him to speak but within certain limitations:
   "See, we willingly allow thee some things, but this we cannot bear: so
   much asperity is extremely odious." And under the Papacy at this day
   the liberty of prophesying is wholly suppressed: and among us how many
   there are who wish to impose laws on God's servants beyond which they
   are not to pass? But we see what the Prophet says here, -- that the
   word of God is repudiated when the freedom of teaching is restrained,
   and men wish to be flattered, and desire their sins to be covered, and
   cannot bear free admonitions.

   Let us also notice the word command, which the Prophet uses. tsvh,
   tsue, means to order, to command, or to determine, in an authoritative
   manner. The Prophet then does not expostulate with them, because there
   were many who clamored, who murmured against the Prophets, as it is
   always the case; but he rather condemns the audacity of the chief men
   for daring to consult how they might silence the Prophets, and not
   allow them the free liberty of teaching, as we find it to be done even
   now. For not only in taverns and lurking-places do the ungodly clamor
   when their sins are severely reproved, but they also go forth publicly
   and complain that too much liberty is allowed the ministers of the
   word, and that some course ought to be adopted to make them speak more
   moderately. It is then this sacrilege that the Prophet now rebukes,
   when he says, that the ungodly commanded the Prophets, that they should
   not prophecy, as though they made a law, as though they wished to
   proclaim a decree, that the Prophets should not speak so boldly and so
   freely. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 2:13

   13. Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full
   of sheaves.

   13. Ecce ego angustians (vel, angustiatus, constrictus, vel,
   constringens) in loco vestro (vel, sub vobis,) sicuti constringitur
   plaustrum quod plenum est manipulo (id est, manipulis.)


   The verb yq, oik, in Hebrew is often transitive, and it is also a
   neuter. This place then may admit of two interpretations. The first is,
   that God was pressed under the Israelites, as a wagon groans under too
   much weight; and so God expostulates by Isaiah, that he was weighed
   down by the Israelites, Ye constrain me,' he says, to labor under your
   sins' (Isaiah 1:14) The sense then, that God was pressed down under
   them, may be viewed as not unsuitable: and yet the more received
   interpretation is this, "Behold, I will bind you fast as a wagon is
   bound." I am, however, more inclined to take the first meaning, -- that
   God here reprehends the Israelites, because he had been pressed down by
   them: for tchtykm, tacheticam, properly signifies, "Under you," which
   some render, but strainedly, "Is your place:" for when the verb is
   transitive, they say, that tchtykm, tacheticam, must be rendered "In
   your place:" but this is frigid and forced; and the whole passage will
   run better, if we say, "I am bound fast under you, as though ye were a
   wagon full of sheaves; [21] " that is, "Ye are to me intolerable." For
   God carried that people on his shoulders; and when they loaded him with
   the burden of iniquities, it is no wonder that he said that they were
   like a wagon -- a wagon filled with many sheaves: "Ye are light as
   wind, but ye are also to me very burdensome, and I am forced at length
   to shake you off:" and this he afterwards shows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] This verse has caused great labor to commentators; and many have
   been the views given. The first difficulty is in the words rendered in
   our version, "under you." tcht and with the Iod commonly added when
   there is a suffix, often occurs, and means on doubt, an place, a spot,
   a standing, as in the following passages: Exodus 10:23; 16:29; 1 Samuel
   14:9; Habakkuk 3:16; and this seems to be its meaning here. Then the
   second difficulty is about "the cart" or wagon. Some consider it to be
   the vehicle to carry corn; and others, the machine to thresh it as
   Newcome and others do: but this view is not consistent with the other
   expressions used in this clause. A critic, quoted by Poole, evidently
   gives the meaning in these words, Sensus est, q.d. Ego vos in eas
   angustas adducam, unde vos ipsos mimime expedire valeatis -- "The sense
   is, as though he said, I will bring you to those straits, from which ye
   will by no means be able to deliver yourselves." I would then translate
   the verse thus: -- Behold, I will confine you in your place,
   As a wagon confines its load--the sheaves;
   or word for word,
   As a wagon confines the filling of it -- the sheaf. The rendering of
   the last line by Newcome is certainly not what the original will bear;
   his translation of the whole verse is this: -- Therefore, behold I will
   press your place,
   As a loaded corn-wain presseth its sheaves. It is not pressing or
   crushing that corresponds with the contents of the following verses,
   but confining and reducing to straits from which they could not escape.
   -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only redeemed us by the
   blood of thy only begotten Son, but also guides us during our earthly
   pilgrimage, and suppliest us with whatever is needful, -- O grant, that
   we may not be unmindful of so many favors, and turn away from thee and
   follow our sinful desires, but that we may continue bound to thy
   service, and never burden thee with our sins, but submit ourselves
   willingly to thee in true obedience, that by glorifying thy name we may
   carry thee both in body and soul, until thou at length gatherest us
   into that blessed kingdom which has been obtained for us by the blood
   of thy Son. Amen.

   Amos 2:14-16

   14. Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong
   shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver
   himself:

   14. Peribit fuga a veloce, et fortis non roborabit vires suas, et
   robustus non servabit (non liberabit) animam suam:

   15. Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift
   of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the
   horse deliver himself.

   15. Et tenens arcum non stabit, et velox pedibus suis non liberabit,
   neque ascensor equi liberabit animam suam.

   16. And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in
   that day, saith the Lord

   16. Et qui robustus est corde suo inter fortes nudus fugiet die illa,
   dicit Jehova.


   I explained yesterday the verse, in which the Prophet says, in the name
   of God, that the people were like a grievous and heavy burden, as
   though they were a wagon laden with many sheaves. I stated that the
   Prophet's words are differently explained by many interpreters, who
   give this view, -- that God compares himself to a loaded wagon, under
   which the people were to be crushed. But no necessity constrains us to
   take the same verb in two senses, active and neuter, as they do; and
   then the comparison seems not quite suitable; and farther, it is
   better, as I have said, to say, that God complains, that he was loaded
   and pressed down under the people, than to render tchtykm, tacheticm,
   "In your place;" for this is wholly a strained rendering. But most
   suitable is the Prophet's meaning, when understood as the complaint of
   God, that it was a grievous thing to bear the burdens of the people,
   when he saw that they were men of levity, and, at the same time,
   burdensome.

   Hence the Prophet now denounces vengeance such as they deserved; and he
   says first, Perish shall flight from the swift, etc., that is, no one
   will be so swift as to escape by fleeing; and the valiant shall do
   nothing by fighting; for it is to confirm strength when one resists an
   adversary and repels assaults. The valiant, therefore, shall fight with
   no advantage; and then, The strong shall not deliver his own life: he
   who holds the bow shall not stand; that is, he who is equipped with a
   bow, and repels his enemy at a distance, shall not be able to stand in
   his place. He who is swift on foot shall not be able to flee, nor he
   who mounts a horse; which means that whether footmen or horsemen, they
   shall not, by their celerity, be able to escape death. And, lastly, he
   who is stout and intrepid in heart among the valiant shall flee away
   naked, being content with life alone, and only anxious to provide for
   his own safety.

   The Prophet intimates by all these words, that so grievous would be the
   slaughter of the people, that it would be a miracle if any should
   escape.

   We now then see how severely the prophet at the very beginning handled
   this people. He no doubt observed their great obduracy: for he would
   not have assailed them so sharply at first, had they not been for a
   long time rebellious and had despised all warnings and threatening.
   Amos was not the first who addressed them; but the Israelites had
   hardened themselves against all threatenings before he came to them. It
   therefore behaved him sharply to reprove them, as God treats men
   according to their disposition. I come now to the third chapter.

   Chapter 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 3:1-2

   1. Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you, O children of
   Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of
   Egypt, saying,

   1. Audite verbum hoc quod pronunciat Jehova super vos, filii Israel,
   super totam familiam eduxi (vel, ascendere feci) e terra Aegypti,
   dicendo,

   2. You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I
   will punish you for all your iniquities.

   2. Tantummodo vos cognovi ex omnibus familiis terrae: propterea
   visitabo super vos omnes iniquitates vestras.


   The Prophet wished doubtless by these words to confirm his own
   authority, for he saw that his doctrine was regarded with contempt: and
   it is probable that the words recited here were not only once delivered
   by him, but had been often repeated. We know how great was the pride
   and confidence of that people: it was therefore needful to beat it
   down, that they might be habituated to dread and fear, when God
   reproved them by his Prophets.

   It was then the common mode of speaking, when he said, Hear the word
   which God has spoken concerning your, O children of Israel. He brings
   forward here the name of God, that they might know that they had not to
   do with a mortal man, or with a shepherd, such as he was. We then
   observe here, what I have just referred to, and that is, that the
   Prophet seeks to strengthen his authority as a teacher, that he might
   gain more respect among the people. But he adds, concerning the whole
   family which I brought up out of Egypt It is certain that this
   discourse was not addressed except to the ten tribes; why, then, does
   the Prophet speak here so generally? Even because the kingdom of Israel
   formed the greater portion of the race of Abraham, and on this account
   they boasted that the adoption continued to be possessed by them.
   Since, then, they despised the tribe of Judah, and the half-tribe of
   Benjamin, which was connected with it, and had ever boasted of their
   great number, the Prophet says here, by way of concession, that they
   were indeed the blessed seed, the posterity of Abraham; in a word, the
   elect people, whom God had redeemed from Egypt. Then the Prophet
   includes not here the kingdom of Judah, but concedes to the Israelites
   what they boasted, -- that they were the elect people, the holy race of
   Abraham, the very nation which had been miraculously delivered. "Let,
   then," he says, "all these boastings be granted, yet God will not, on
   this account, desist from executing his judgment upon them."

   We now apprehend the design of the Prophet: he first seeks to gain
   respect for his doctrine, and takes occasion to speak of his own
   vocation, that he brought nothing of his own, but only discharged
   faithfully the office committed to him; yea, that he was the organ of
   the Holy Spirit, and adduced nothing from his own mind, but only spoke
   what the Lord had commanded him. And then, as the Israelites, relying
   on their large number, thought that wrong was done them, when they were
   severely reprehended by the Prophets, and as there was an absurd
   rivalship between them and the kingdom of Judah, the Prophet concedes
   to them that for which they were foolishly proud; but, at the same
   time, he shows that they in vain confided in their number, inasmuch as
   God summoned them to judgment, though they were the elect people, and
   the holy seed, and the redeemed nation. These are the main points.

   The Prophet afterwards declares what he had in charge, Only you have I
   known of all the families of the earth: I will therefore visit you for
   your iniquities. Many think that he still concedes to the Israelites
   what they were wont to boast of, -- that they were separated from the
   common class of men, because the Lord had adopted them: but it seems
   rather to be a reproach cast on them. God then brings forward here his
   benefits, of which we noticed yesterday a similar instance, that he
   might enhance the more the sin of the people, in returning the worst
   recompense to God, by whom they had been so liberally and so kindly
   treated: "I," he says, "have loved you only." It is indeed true, that
   the Israelites, as we have in other places often observed, gloried in
   their privileges; but the Prophet seems not to have this in view. God
   then expostulates with them for being so ungrateful: You only, he says,
   have I known. It is indeed certain that God's care is extended to the
   whole human race, yea even to oxen and asses, and to the very sparrows.
   Even the young of ravens cry to him, and the smallest bird is fed by
   him. We hence see that God's providence extends to all mortal beings;
   but yet not in an equal degree. God has ever known all men so as to
   give what is needful to preserve life. God has, therefore, made his sun
   to rise on all the human race, and has also made the earth to produce
   food. Then as to the necessaries of life, he performs the office of a
   Father towards all men. But he has known his chosen people, because he
   has separated them from other nations, that they might be like his own
   family. Israel, then, is said to be known, because God favored them
   alone with a gratuitous adoption, and designed them to be a peculiar
   people to himself. This is the knowledge of which the Prophet now
   speaks.

   But by saying that they only, rq, rek, had been known, he shows that
   they had been chosen through God's singular favor, for there was no
   difference between the seed of Abraham and other nations, when regarded
   in themselves, otherwise this exception would have been superfluous.
   For if there had been any superiority or merit in the people of Israel,
   this objection might have readily been made, "We have indeed been
   chosen, but not without cause, for God had respect to our worthiness."
   But as they in nothing differed from other nations, and as the
   condition of all was alike by nature, the Lord upbraids them with this,
   that he had known them only; as though he said "How has it happened,
   that ye are my peculiar possession and heritage? Has it been by your
   merit? Has it been because I was more bound to you than to other
   nations? Ye cannot allege these things. It has therefore been my
   gratuitous adoption. Ye are then the more bound to me, and less
   excusable is your ingratitude for rendering to me so unjust a
   recompense." So also Paul says, Who makes thee to differ?' (1
   Corinthians 4:7) He wished to show that every excellency in men ought
   to be ascribed to God. For the same purpose it is said here, you only
   have I loved and known of all the families of the earth: "What were
   you? Ye were even the children of Adam, as all other nations; the same
   has been the beginning of all. There is then no reason for you to say,
   that I was attached to you by any prepossession; I freely chose you and
   chose you alone." All this tends to amplify grace; and ingratitude on
   their part does hereby appear more evident. For had God spoken these
   words of his general benefits, the guilt of his chosen people would not
   have been so great: but when he says that they only had been chosen,
   when others were passed by, their impiety seemed doubtless more base
   and wicked in not acknowledging God in their turn, so as to devote
   themselves wholly to Him, to whom they owed every thing.

   And the bounty of God shines forth also in this respect, that he had
   known the Israelites alone, though there were many other nations. Had
   God owed any thing to men, he would not have kept it from them; this is
   certain. But since he repudiated all other nations, it follows, that
   they were justly rejected, when he made no account of them. Whence then
   was it that he chose the Israelites? We here see how highly is God's
   grace exalted by this comparison of one people with all other nations.
   And the same thing also appears from these words, of all the families
   of the earth; as though God had said, "There were many nations in the
   world, the number of men was very great; but I regarded them all as
   nothing, that I might take you under my protection; and thus I was
   content with a small number, when all men were mine; and this I have
   done through mere favor, for there was nothing in you by which ye
   excelled others, nor could they allege that they were unjustly
   rejected. Since then I preferred you of my own will, it is evident that
   I was under no obligation to you." We now then understand the design of
   the Prophet's words.

   He then subjoins, I will therefore visit upon you your iniquities. God
   declares here, that the Israelites would have to suffer a heavier
   judgment, because they acknowledged not their obligations to God, but
   seemed willfully to despise his favor and to scorn him, the author of
   so many blessings. Since then the Israelites were bound by so many and
   so singular benefits, and they at the same time were as wicked as other
   nations the Prophet shows, that they deserved a heavier punishment, and
   that God's judgment, such as they deserved, was nigh at hand. This is
   the substance of the whole. It now follows --

   Amos 3:3-8

   3. Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

   3. An duo ambulabunt simul nisi inter ipsos conveniat?

   4. Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young
   lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

   4. An rugiet leo in sylva et praeda non erit ei? an dabit leo (vel,
   leunculus edet, vel, emittet) vocem suam e cubili suo (vel, lustro)
   quum nihil ceperit?

   5. Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him?
   shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at
   all?

   5. An cadet avis super laqueum ad terram absque aucupe (et auceps non
   erit ei? Ad verbum;) an tollet auceps laqueum ex terra priusquam
   capturam ceperit? (ad verbum, et capiendo non capiet: sed ego redidi
   sensum Prophetae.)

   6. Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?
   shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?

   6. An clanget tuba in urbe et populus non contremiscet? An erit malum
   in urbe quod Jehova non fecerit?

   7. Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret
   unto his servants the prophets.

   7. Quia (vel, certe) non faciet Dominator Jehova quidquam nisi
   revelaverit secretum suum servis suis Prophetis.

   8. The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God hath spoken,
   who can but prophesy?

   8. Leo rugivit, quis non timeat? Dominator Jehova locutus est, quis non
   prophetet?


   The Prophet here accumulates similitudes which may, however, be reduced
   to five particulars. He first shows that he uttered no empty words, but
   had God's authority for what he said; and he appeals to him as his
   witness and approver: this is one thing. Then he shows that God
   designedly announces the punishment he would inflict on transgressors,
   that they might in time repent, and that he does not cry out for no
   reason, as unreflecting men grow angry for nothing, but that he is
   driven to anger by just causes, and therefore terrifies them by his
   Prophets. He teaches, thirdly, that nothing happens by chance, that the
   Israelites might thereby be made to consider more attentively the
   judgments of God. In the fourth place, he declares that men are
   extremely stupid, when they are not moved by the threats which they
   hear proceed from God. He intimates, in the fifth place, that the
   execution of them was ready to take place, and that when God has
   denounced anything, his threatenings are not vain, such as those by
   which children are terrified.

   These, then, are the five points, which we shall hereafter notice in
   their due order. He at the same time confirms what he said at the
   beginning of the chapter, -- that God did not suddenly take vengeance
   on the Israelites, but called them to repentance, provided they were
   healable. He had indeed spoken before more distinctly, For three
   transgressions, and for four, I will not be propitious to them:' but
   now he demands attention from the people of Israel, "Hear this ye
   children of Israel, Will two men walk together, except they agree among
   themselves?" By these words he teaches, that though God might have
   immediately and unexpectedly brought punishment on them, he yet spared
   them and suspended his judgment, until they repented, provided they
   were not wholly irreclaimable. Amos now then confirms the truth, that
   God would not punish the Israelites, as he might justly, but would
   first try whether there was any hope of repentance.

   Let us now come to the first similitude; he asks Will two walk together
   without agreeing? Some forcibly misapply the Prophet's words, as though
   the meaning was, that God was constrained to depart from that people,
   because he saw that they were going astray so perversely after their
   lusts. The sense, according to these, would be, "Do you wish me to walk
   with you?" that is "Do you wish that my blessing should dwell among
   you, that I should show to you, as usual, my paternal love, and
   bountifully support you? Why then do ye not walk with me, or, why
   should there not be a mutual consent? Why do ye not respond to me? for
   I am ready to walk with you." But this exposition, as ye see, is too
   strained. There are other two, which are these, -- either that the
   Prophet intimates here that so many of God's servants did not, as it
   were with one mouth, threaten the Israelites in vain, -- or, that the
   consent of which he speaks was that of God with his Prophets. This last
   exposition being rather obscure, requires to be more clearly explained.
   Some, then, take the sense of this verse to be the following, -- "I am
   not alone in denouncing punishment on you; for God has before warned
   you by other Prophets; many of them still live; and ye see how well we
   agree together: we have not conspired after the manner of men, and it
   has not happened by any agreements that Isaiah and Micah denounce on
   you what ye hear from my mouth. It is then a hidden accordance, which
   proceeds from the Holy Spirit." This sense is not unsuitable.

   But there is a third equally befitting, to which I have briefly
   referred, and that is, that the Prophet here affirms that he speaks by
   God's command, as when two agree together, when they follow the same
   road; as when one meets with a chance companion, he asks him where he
   goes, and when he answers that he is going to a certain place, he says
   I am going on the same road with you. Then Amos by this similitude very
   fitly sets forth the accordance between God and his Prophets; for they
   did not rashly obtrude themselves so as to announce anything according
   to their own will, but waited for the call of God, and were fully
   persuaded that they did not by any chance go astray, but kept the road
   which the Lord had pointed out. This could not itself have been a
   sufficiently satisfactory proof of his call; but the Prophet had
   already entered on his course of teaching; and though nearly the whole
   people clamored against him, he yet had given no obscure proofs of his
   call. He does not then here mention the whole evidence, as though he
   intended to show that he was from the beginning the Prophet of God; but
   he only confirms, by way of reproof, what his teaching had before
   sufficiently attested. Hence he asks, Will two walk together except
   they agree among themselves? as though he said, "Ye are mistaken in
   judging of me, as though I were alone, and in making no account of God:
   ye think me to be a shepherd, and this is true; but it ought to be
   added, that I am sent by God and endued with the gift of prophecy.
   Since then I speak by God's Spirit, I do not walk alone; for God goes
   before, and I am his companion. Know then that whatever I bring forward
   proceeds not from me, but God is the author of what I teach."

   This seems to be the genuine meaning of the Prophet: by this similitude
   he affirms that he faithfully discharged his office, for he had not
   separated himself from God, but was his companion: as when two agree
   together to travel the same road; so also he shows that he and God were
   agreed. If, however, the former interpretation be more approved, I will
   not dispute the point; that is, that the Prophet here confirms his own
   doctrine by alleging that he was not alone, but had other colleagues;
   for it was no common confirmation, when it appeared evident that the
   other Prophets added their testimony to what he taught. As, however, he
   does not apply this similitude in this way, I know not whether such was
   his design: I have therefore brought forward what seems to me to be a
   simpler view.

   The second similitude follows, Will a lion roar in the forest without a
   prey? Will a lion send forth his voice from his den when he has caught
   nothing? By this verse he intimates that God does not cry out for
   nothing by his Prophets; for ungodly men supposed that the air was only
   made to reverberate by an empty sound, when the Prophets threatened,
   "These," they said, "are mere words;" as though indeed they could not
   find that the necessity of crying arose from themselves, because they
   had provoked God by their vices. Hence the Prophet, meeting their
   objection, says, "If lions roar not, except when they have obtained a
   prey, shall God cry from heaven and send forth his voice as far as the
   earth, when there is no prey?" The meaning is, that the word of God was
   very shamefully despised by the Israelites, as though there was no
   reason for crying, as though God was trifling with them. His word is
   indeed precious, and is not thrown heedlessly into the air, as if it
   were a mere refuse; but it is an invaluable seed. Since the Lord cries,
   it is not, says Amos, without a lawful cause. How so? The lions do not
   indeed roar without prey; God then does not cry by his Prophets, except
   for the best reason. It hence follows that the Israelites were hitherto
   extremely stupid inasmuch as they did not listen with more earnestness
   and attention to the teaching of the Prophets, as though God had
   uttered only an empty sound.

   The third similitude now follows, [19]Will a bird fall on the earth, he
   says, without a fowler? The Prophet means here that nothing happens
   without being foreseen by God; for as nets are laid for birds, so God
   ensnares men by his hidden punishments. Unexpectedly indeed calamity
   comes, and it is commonly ascribed to chance; but the Prophet here
   reminds us that God stretches his nets, in which men are caught, though
   they think that chance rules, and observe not the hand of God. They are
   deceived, he says; for the bird foresees not the ensnaring prepared for
   him; but yet he falls not on the earth without the fowler: for nets
   weave not themselves by chance, but they are made by the industry of
   the man who catches birds. So also calamities do not happen by chance,
   but proceed from the secret purpose of God. But we must observe, that
   similitudes ought not to be too strictly applied to the subject in
   hand. Were one to asks how God could compare himself here to a fowler,
   as there is craft and artifice employed in catching innocent birds,
   when nets are laid for them, it would be a frivolous question; for it
   is evident enough what the Prophet meant, and that the design of his
   words was to show, that punishments fall on men, and that they are
   ensnared through the secret purpose of God; for God has long ago
   foreseen what he will do, though men act heedlessly, as the birds who
   foresee nothing.

   Then it follows in the fourth place, Will the fowler remove his snare
   before he has made a capture? In this second clause the Prophet
   intimates that the threatening of God would not be without effect; for
   he will execute whatever he declares. It is indeed certain, that
   fowlers often return home empty, and gather their nets though they have
   taken nothing; but the Prophet, as I have said, in using these
   similitudes, only states what fowlers usually do, when they are in hope
   of some prey. As for instance, when one spreads his nets, he will wait,
   and will not gather his nets until he takes some prey, if so be that a
   prey should come; he may indeed wait in vain all night. Then as fowlers
   are not wearied, and wish not to lose their labor after they have
   spread their nets, so also the Prophet says that God does not in vain
   proclaim his threatenings to serve as empty bugbears, but that his nets
   remain until he has taken his prey; which means, that God will really
   execute what he has threatened by his Prophets. The meaning then is,
   that God's word is not ineffectual, but when God declares any thing, it
   is sure to be accomplished: and hence he reproves the Israelites for
   receiving so heedlessly and with deaf ears all God's threatening, as
   though he was only trifling with them. "It will not be," he says, "as
   you expect; for God will take his prey before he takes up his nets."

   He adds, in the last place, Shall a trumpet sound and the people
   tremble not? Here he reprehends, as I have said, the torpidity of the
   people, to whom all threatening were a sport: "When a trumpet sounds,"
   he says, "all tremble; for it is a signal of danger. All then either
   fly for aid or stand amazed, when the trumpet sounds. God himself
   cries, his voice deserves much more attention than the trumpet which
   fills men's minds with dread; and yet it is a sound uttered to the
   deaf. What then does this prove, but that madness possesses the minds
   of men? Are they not destitute of all judgment and of every power of
   reason?" We hence see that the Prophet in these words intended to show,
   that the Israelites were in a manner fascinated by the devil, for they
   had no thought of evils; and though they knew that God sounded the
   trumpet and denounced ruin, they yet remained heedless, and were no
   more moved than if all things were in a quiet state. What remains I
   cannot now finish.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou art pleased daily to exhort us to
   repentance, and dost not suddenly execute thy judgment by which we
   might be in an instant overwhelmed, but givest us time to seek
   reconciliation, -- O grant, that we may now attend to thy teaching, and
   all thy admonitions and threatenings, and become teachable and obedient
   to thee, lest thou be constrained on finding us hardened against thy
   threatening, and wholly irreclaimable, to bring on us extreme
   vengeance: make us then so to submit ourselves to thee in the spirit of
   teachableness and obedience, that being placed under the protection of
   thy Son, we may truly call on thee as our Father, and find thee to be
   so in reality, when thou shalt show to us that paternal love, which
   thou hast promised, and which we have all experienced from the
   beginning, who have truly and from the heart called on thy name,
   through the same, even Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-fourth

   In our last Lecture were noticed these words of Amos -- that a whole
   people tremble at the sound of a trumpet; he now seems to add a
   sentence wholly different, and says, No calamity happens, except
   through God. But he had before said what we already noticed respecting
   the sound of the trumpet, that the people might understand that nothing
   happens by accident, and that punishments are, for just reasons,
   inflicted by the Lord; and this he soon after confirms by saying, that
   God did nothing, without having first revealed his secret to his
   Prophets. The meaning then is that the people at Israel were extremely
   stupid for not having repented after so many warnings; nay, they
   remained still in their perverseness, though they had been constrained
   by the most powerful means.

   We now then comprehend what the Prophet means; but that the whole
   subject may be made more clear, let us notice this intervening
   sentence, there is no evil in the city which God has not done. By these
   words the Prophet reminds us, that calamities happen not by chance, as
   the vulgar of mankind believe; for the words, "Prosperous or adverse
   fortunes" are, we know, in the mouths of all, as though God was idle in
   heaven, and took no care of human affairs. Hence, whatever happens, the
   world usually ascribes it to fortune. But the Prophet here shows that
   the government of this world is administered by God, and that nothing
   happens except through his power. He does not, indeed, treat here of
   sin: but the Prophet, according to the usual practice, calls whatever
   is adverse to us, rh, roe, evil. Whatever, then, we naturally shun, is
   usually called an evil; and this mode of speaking Amos follows here, as
   God is said by Isaiah to have in his power night and day, light and
   darkness, good and evil, (Isaiah 45:7) When good and evil are spoken of
   there, it is certain that what is referred to is prosperity and
   adversity. So also here, the Prophet teaches that men are chastised by
   God whenever anything adverse happens to them, as though he said that
   fortune rules not, as the world imagines, and that things do not take
   place at random; but that God is at all times the judge of the world.
   In short, Amos wished to recall the people to an examination of their
   lives, as though he summoned them to the tribunal of God; and he showed
   by evident external tokens that God was justly offended with the
   Israelites: "Ye see that you are severely dealt with, do you think that
   God sleeps idly in heaven? Since nothing happens but by the will of
   God, he now designs to awaken you by treating you with so much
   sharpness and severity, so that you may know your vices." We now then
   perceive the design of the Prophet in saying, that there was no evil in
   the city which God had not done.

   In a similar manner, also, does God by Jeremiah sharply expostulate
   with the people, because they imputed slaughters in war, famine, and
   other evils, to fortune. When, therefore, any calamity happened, the
   Jews complained of bad fortune, as the world are wont to do. God was
   displeased and severely reproved this profane notion; for the
   government of the world was thus taken away from him: for, were any
   thing to take place against his will, so much would be abstracted from
   his power; and farther men would grow hardened in their sins; for
   however grievously he might punish them, they would not yet acknowledge
   his hand: they might indeed cry out under the strokes, and feel how
   severe his scourges were; but they would not regard the hand of the
   striker, which is the principal thing, as it is stated elsewhere,
   (Isaiah 9:13) Then the Prophet takes this as granted, that, whenever
   any calamity happens, men are extremely stupid, if they are not roused
   and reflect on their sins, and consider the tokens of God's wrath, so
   as to flee to him, and confess themselves guilty and implore his mercy.

   But he had before spoken of the sound of the trumpet; for every excuse
   was thereby taken away from the Israelites, as God had not only
   recalled them to the right way by his scourges but also preceded these
   by his word: and he shows how justly he was displeased with them; hence
   the Prophet adds another sentence, For the Lord Jehovah will do nothing
   without revealing his secret to his servants, the Prophets. The Prophet
   declares in this verse, that God dealt not with the Israelites as with
   heathen nations; for God punished other people without warning them by
   his word; he summoned to judgment neither the Idumeans, nor the
   Ammonites, nor the Egyptians, but executed his vengeance, though he
   never addressed them. Different was his dealing with the Israelites;
   for God not only brought on them such punishment as they deserved, but
   he preceded it by His word, and showed beforehand what evil was nigh
   them, that they might anticipate it; he indeed gave them time to
   repent, and was ready to pardon them, had they been capable of being
   restored. Now then the Prophet aggravates the guilt of the people,
   because they had not only been chastised by the Lord, but they might,
   if they chose, have turned aside their punishment; instead of doing so
   they hardened themselves in their wickedness.

   God then will do nothing without revealing his secret to his servants,
   the Prophets. This ought to be confined to that people, and it ought
   also to be confined to the punishments of which the Prophet speaks. It
   is certain that God executes many judgments which are hid both from men
   and angels; and Amos did not intend to impose a necessity on God, as if
   he was not free to do any thing without previously revealing it; such
   was not the Prophet's design; but his object was simply to condemn the
   Israelites for their irreclaimable perverseness and obstinacy, that,
   having been warned, they did not seriously think of repenting, but
   despised all God's threatening, and even scorned them. God then will do
   nothing, that is, "God will not treat you in an ordinary way, as he
   does with other nations, whom he chastises without speaking to them.
   They, for the most part, understand not what is done; but God in a
   paternal manner kindly reminds you of your sins, shows why he resolves
   to chastise you and forewarns you, that you may have time to seek and
   ask forgiveness."

   God therefore reveals his secret to his Prophets; that is, "He does not
   suddenly or unexpectedly punish you, as he might do, and as ye see that
   he does with respect to others; but he proclaims what he will do, and
   sends his messengers, as though they were heralds sent to denounce war
   on you; and at the same time they open a way for reconciliation,
   provided ye are not wholly past recovery, and perverse in your
   wickedness. Ye are then doubly inexcusable, if God can do nothing by
   his word and by the punishment which he afterwards subjoins to his
   word." We now comprehend the object of the Prophet. Then foolish is the
   question, at least unreasonable, "Does God here bind himself by a
   certain law, that he will do nothing, but what he previously reveals to
   his Prophets?" For Amos means not this, but only affirms that it was
   the common method which the Lord adopted in chastising that people. It
   is certain, that the Prophets did not know many things; for God
   distributed his Spirit to them by measure: all things then were not
   revealed to the Prophets. But Amos here only intimates that God did not
   deal with his chosen people as he did with heathen nations; for these
   often found God unexpectedly displeased with them, and had no time to
   reflect, that they might repent. Much more kindly and mercifully has
   God acted, says Amos, with that people; for God was unwilling suddenly
   to overwhelm or to surprise them, but has warned them by his Prophets.
   We see how widely this doctrine opens; but it is enough to understand
   the Prophet's design, and to know the purpose to which his discourse
   ought to be applied.

   God then will do nothing without revealing first his secret to the
   Prophets. He calls it a secret, because men are perplexed when God
   executes vengeance on them, and stand amazed: but when they are in time
   warned, then what God designs becomes evident to them, and they know
   the cause and the source of punishment. Thus then the secret is
   revealed which was hid from miserable men: and the guilt of the people
   is doubled, when, after these threatening, they do not repent.

   It now follows, The lion roars who would not fear? The Lord Jehovah
   speaks, who would not prophesy? In this verse the Prophet reproved the
   Israelites for their usual contentions with the Prophets when their
   sins were sharply reprehended. Thus indeed are men wont to do; they
   consider not that Prophets are sent from above, and that there is a
   charge committed to them. Hence, when Prophets are severe in their
   words, the world clamors and wrangles: "What do these men intend? Why
   do they urge us so much? Why do they not allow us to rest quietly? for
   they provoke against us the wrath of God." Whenever then men are
   roused, they immediately menace God's Prophets with strife and
   contention, and regard not threatening as coming from God himself. This
   vice the Prophet now condemns: The lion roars, he says, who would not
   fear? God speaks, who would not prophesy? "Ye think that I am your
   adversary; but ye can gain nothing by quarreling with me: were I
   silent, the voice of God would of itself be formidable enough. The evil
   then proceeds not from my mouth, but from God's command; for I am
   constrained, willing or unwilling, to obey God: he has chosen me to be
   a Prophet, and has showed what he intends that I should proclaim. What
   can I do, he says? I am not at liberty to invent revelations; but I
   faithfully bring forth to you what has been delivered to me by the
   Lord. How great then is your madness, that ye contend with me, and
   consider not that your strife and contention is with God himself?" We
   now see what the Prophet meant, and also understand, why he adduced the
   four similitudes, of which we have already spoken. I now proceed with
   the remaining context.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 3:9

   9. Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of
   Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and
   behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the
   midst thereof.

   9. Promulgate in palatiis Asdod, et in palatiis terrae Aegypti, et
   dicite, Congregamini super montes Samaria, et videte tumultus multos
   (vel, concussiones multas) in medio ejus, et oppressiones in medio
   ejus.


   Amos begins here to set judges over the Israelites; for they would not
   patiently submit to God's judgment: and he constitutes and sets over
   them as judges the Egyptians and Idumeans. This prophecy no doubt
   increasingly exasperated the minds of the people, who were already very
   refractory and rebellious; but yet this was necessary. God, indeed, had
   cited them to his tribunal, as long as a hope of reconciliation
   remained: when they became angry on account of God's threatening,
   clamored against his servants, yea, and obstinately disputed, as though
   they were guilty of no fault, what remained, but that God should
   constitute judges over them, whom the Prophet names, even the Egyptians
   and Idumeans? "Ye cannot bear my judgment; unbelievers, who are already
   condemned, shall pronounce sentence upon you. I am indeed your
   legitimate judge; but as ye have repudiated me, I will prove to you how
   true my judgment is; I will be silent, the Egyptians shall speak." And
   who were these Egyptians? Even those who were equally guilty with the
   Israelites, and labored under the same charges, or were at least not
   far from deserving a similar punishment; and yet God would compel the
   Israelites to hear the sentence that was to be pronounced on them by
   the Egyptians and Idumeans. We know how proudly the Israelites gloried
   in their primogeniture; but the Lord here exposes to scorn this
   arrogance, because they made such bad use of his benefits. We now then
   perceive the Prophet's intention.

   Publish, he says, in the palaces of Ashdod, in the palaces of the land
   of Egypt, and say -- what? "Assemble on the mountains of Samaria." He
   would have the Egyptians and the Idumeans to meet together, and the
   mountains of Samaria to be as it were the theater, though the idea of a
   tribunal is more suitable to the similitude that is used. It was then,
   as though the Egyptians and Idumeans were to be seated on an elevated
   place; and God were to set before them the oppressions, the robberies
   and iniquitous pillages, which prevailed in the kingdom of Israel.
   Assemble then on the mountains of Samaria. The Prophet alludes to the
   situation of the country: for though Samaria was situated on a plain,
   [22] there were yet mountains around it; and they thought themselves
   hid there, and were as wine settled on its lees. God says now, "Let the
   Egyptians and Idumeans meet and view the scene; I will allot them a
   place, from which they can see how greatly all kinds of iniquity
   prevail in the kingdom of Israel. They indeed dwell in their plain, and
   think themselves sufficiently defended by the mountains around; but
   from these mountains even the very blind will be able to see how
   abominable and shameful is their condition."

   Let them come and see, he says, the oppressions in the midst of her.
   The word he uses is mhvmt, meumet, tumults; but he means oppressions,
   committed without any regard to reason or justice, when all things are
   done with glamour and violence. "Let them see then the oppressions, let
   them see the distresses." He speaks of their deeds; he afterwards
   mentions the persons; but the Prophet means the same thing, though he
   uses different forms of expression, that is, that the kingdom of Israel
   was filled with many crimes; for plunder of every kind prevailed there
   and men kept within no bounds of moderation, but by tumult and clamor
   pillaged the poor and the miserable. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22] This is a mistake: Samaria was situated on a hill, and not on a
   plain: but there were hills or mountains surrounding it; so that what
   is said here equally applies to the place. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 3:10

   10. For they know not to do right, saith the Lord, who store up
   violence and robbery in their palaces.

   10. Et non noverunt facere rectum, dicit Jehova, thesaurizantes rapinam
   et praedam in palatiis suis.


   In this verse he confirms what I have already said of oppressions: he
   says that they despised every thing right. But not to know this lessens
   not their guilt, as though they ignorantly offended; but the Prophet
   means, on the contrary, that they had cast away far from them
   everything that was just and allowed themselves all liberty in sinning,
   without any discrimination, without any shame; as though he said, "They
   are brute animals, who are void of all judgments of all reason, and of
   all shame; for they seek not to have a light understanding any more."
   here then he accuses the Israelites of wilful blindness; for they
   hardened themselves in every evil, and extinguished all judgments shame
   and reasons so that they no longer distinguished between what was just
   and unjust: and he mentions one thing in particular -- that they
   accumulated much wealth by plunder and robbery. The Israelites were no
   doubt guilty of many other crimes; but by stating a part for the whole,
   he mentions one thing which includes other things, and intimates, that
   the people were wholly given to all kinds of crimes, and that as they
   had cast aside every shame, obliterated every distinction, and
   repudiated every regard for justice, they abandoned themselves to every
   kind of wickedness. This, is the import of the Prophet's words.

   But our Prophet points out here the gross sins of the Israelites,
   because he had previously constituted the blind as their judges. Hence
   it was the same as though he had said, "Though the Egyptians and the
   Idumeans are void of light, yet your iniquity is so palpable, that they
   will be able to perceive it. There is indeed no necessity of any subtle
   disputation, since plunders and pillages are carried on with so much
   violence, since no moderation or equity is any longer observed, and no
   shame exists; but men rush headlong with blind impetuosity into every
   kind of evil; so that the very blind, though without eyes, can know
   what your state is. Then the Egyptians and Idumeans will perceive your
   vices, when located on the neighboring mountains." This is the meaning.
   It now follows --

   Amos 3:11-12

   11. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; An adversary there shall be even
   round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee,
   and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

   11. Propterea sic dicit Dominus Jehova, Adversarius et quidem in
   circuitu terrae, et tollet abs te robur tuum et diripientur palatia
   tua.

   12. Thus saith the Lord; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the
   lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be
   taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus
   in a couch.

   12. Sic dicit Jehova, Quemadmodum eripit pastor ex ore leonis duo crura
   vel externam partem auris, sic eripientur filii Israel qui habitant in
   Samaria in angulo lecti, et in Damasco tanquam in grabato.


   The Prophet here announces the punishment God would inflict on the
   Israelites. An enemy, he says, and indeed one around you, etc. Some
   think tsr, tsar, to be a verb in the imperative mood; but this cannot
   be maintained. But Amos, here declares that an enemy was near the
   Israelites, who would besiege them on every side. The ungodly are ever
   wont to seek escapes, and if they see the smallest hole, they think
   that they can escape. Strange is the presumption of men with regard to
   God: when they see themselves hemmed in, they are really frightened,
   yea, they become wholly disheartened; but yet they seek subterfuges on
   the right hand and on the left, and never submit to God except when
   constrained. This is the reason why the Prophet now says, that an enemy
   was near, and indeed around them; as though he said, "You have no
   reason to think that there is any way of escape open to you; for God
   has hemmed you in on every side; there is therefore a siege which so
   confines you, that you in vain hope to escape." An enemy, he says, is
   indeed around -- around the whole land, who will take away from thee
   thy strength. Here the Prophet removes from the Israelites their vain
   confidence; for they could not think of God's vengeance, while looking
   on their own power. They indeed thought that they had sufficient
   protection in their own large number, riches, and arms, as men are wont
   to set up against God what proceeds from himself, as though creatures
   could do anything against him, and as though God could not take away,
   when he pleases, what he has given: and yet such is the blindness of
   men. Hence the Prophet says, that all the wealth and all the strength
   in which the Israelites excelled would be useless, inasmuch as an
   enemy, he says, armed by God, shall take from thee thy strength; and
   thy palaces shall be plundered.

   In the next verse he leaves some hope, though this is not avowedly
   done. For when he says that some would be saved, as when a shepherd
   snatches from the jaws of a lion the ear of a sheep or two legs, it is
   not the Prophet's design to mitigate the severe judgment of which he
   had before spoken; but shows, on the contrary, that when any should be
   saved, it would not be because the people would defend themselves, or
   were able to resist; but that it would be as when a trembling shepherd
   snatches some small portion of a spoil from the lion's mouth. We must
   bear in mind what I have just said of the proud confidence of the
   people; for the Israelites thought that they were safe enough from
   danger; and therefore despised all threatenings. But what does Amos
   say? "Think not," he says, "that there will be any defense for you, for
   your enemies will be like lions, and there will be no more strength in
   you to resist them than in sheep when not only wolves but lions, seize
   them and take them as their prey." When any thing is then saved, it is
   as it were by a miracle; the shepherd may perhaps take a part of the
   ear or two legs from the lion's mouth when he is satisfied. The
   shepherd dares not to contend with the lion; he always runs away from
   him, but the lion will have his prey and devour it at his pleasure;
   when he leaves a part of the ear or two legs, the shepherd will then
   seize on them, and say, "See, how many sheep have been devoured by
   lions:" and these will be the proof's of his loss. So now the Prophet
   says, "The Lord will expose you as a prey to your enemies, and their
   rapacity will not be less dreaded by you than that of a lion: in vain
   then ye think yourselves defended by your forces; for what is a sheep
   to a lion? But if any part of you should remain, it will be like an ear
   or a leg: and still more, -- as when a lion devours a sheep, and leaves
   nothing after having taken his prey until he is satisfied, so shall it
   happen to you".

   They are then mistaken who think that the preceding commination is here
   designedly mitigated; for the Prophet does not do this, but continues
   the same subject, and shows that the whole people would become a prey,
   that their enemies would be like lions, and that they would have no
   strength to resist. Some hope, I indeed allow, is here given to the
   people; for, as it has been before seen, God intended that there should
   ever be some remnant as a seed among that chosen people. This, I admit,
   is true: but we must yet regard what the Prophet treats of; and what he
   had in view. He then did not intend here expressly to console the
   Israelites; though incidentally he says, that some would remain, yet
   his object was to show that the whole kingdom was now given up as a
   prey to lions, and that nothing would be saved except a very small
   portion, as when a shepherd carries away an ear when the wolves and
   lions had been satiated. [23] It follows --

   Amos 3:13-14

   13. Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the
   God of hosts,

   13. Audite et testificamini in domo Jacob, dicit Dominus Jehova, Deus
   exercituum,

   14. That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel
   upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the
   altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.

   14. Quia die quo visitabo scelera Israel super ipsum, etiam visitabo
   super altaria Bethel: et scindentur cornua altaris et cadent ad terram.


   Amos, I have no doubt, added this passage, to show that the
   superstitions, in which he knew the Israelites falsely trusted, would
   be so far from being of any help to them, that they would, on the
   contrary, lead them to ruin, because the people were by them provoking
   God's wrath the more against themselves. When the Israelites heard that
   God was offended with them, they looked on their sacrifices and other
   superstitions, as their shield and cover: for thus do hypocrites mock
   God. But we know that the sacrifices offered at Bethel were mere
   profanations; for the whole worship was spurious. God had indeed chosen
   to himself a place where he designed sacrifices to be offered. The
   Israelites built a temple without any command, nay, against the
   manifest prohibition of God. Since then they had thus violated and
   corrupted the whole worship of God, strange was their madness to dare
   to obtrude on God their superstitions, as though they could thus pacify
   his displeasure! The Prophet then rebukes now this stupidity and says,
   In the day when God shall visit the sins of Israel, he will inflict
   punishment on the altars of Bethel By the sins, which the Prophet
   mentions, he means plunder, unjust exactions, robbery, and similar
   crimes; for there prevailed then, as we have seen, among the people, an
   unbridled cruelty, avarice, and perfidiousness.

   Hence he says now, When God shall visit the sins of Israel; that is,
   when he shall punish avarice, pride, and cruelty; when he shall execute
   vengeance on pillages and robberies, he shall then visit also the
   altars of Bethel. The Israelites thought that God would be propitious
   to them while they sacrificed though they were wholly abandoned in
   their lives: they indeed thought that every uncleanness was purified by
   their expiations; and they thought that God was satisfied while they
   performed an external worship. Hence, when they offered sacrifices,
   they imagined that they thus made a compact with God, and presented
   such a compensation, that he dared not to punish their sins. Their own
   fancy greatly deceives them," says Amos. For, as we know, this was, at
   the same time, their principal sin, -- that they rashly dared to change
   the worship of God, that they dared to build a temple without his
   command; in short, that they had violated the whole law. God then will
   begin with superstitions in executing judgment for the sins of the
   people. We now then understand the Prophet's design in saying, that God
   would visit the altars of Bethel when inflicting punishment on the sins
   of Israel.

   But as it was difficult to produce conviction on this subject, the
   Prophet here invites attention, Hear ye, and testify, he says, in the
   house of Jacob. Having bidden them to hear, he introduces God as the
   speaker: for the Israelites, as we know they were wont to do, might
   have pretended that Amos had, without authority, threatened such a
   punishment. "Nothing is mine," he says. We then see the design of this
   address, when he says, Hear: he shows God to be the author of this
   prophecy, and that nothing was his own but the ministration. Hear ye,
   then, and testify in the house of Jacob By the word testify, he seals
   his prophecy that it might have more weight, that they might not think
   that it was a mere mockery, but might know that God was dealing
   seriously with them, Then testify ye in the house of Jacob. And for the
   same purpose are the titles which he ascribes to God, The Lord Jehovah,
   he says, the God of hosts He might have used only one word, "Thus saith
   Jehovah," as the prophets mostly do; but he ascribes dominion to him,
   and he also brings before them his power, -- for what end? To strike
   the Israelites with terror, that vain flatteries might no longer, as
   heretofore, take possession of them; but that they might understand,
   that so far were they from doing anything towards pacifying God's wrath
   by their superstitions, that they thereby the more provoked him.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as we so provoke thee daily by our
   sins, that we are worthy of eternal destruction, and no good remains in
   us, and though we are severely chastised with temporal punishments,
   thou dost not yet take from us the hope of that mercy, which thou hast
   promised in thy Son to those who truly and from the heart repent and
   call on thee as their Father, -- O grant, that being touched with the
   sense of our evils, we may, in true humility, and with the genuine
   feeling of penitence, offer ourselves as a sacrifice to thee, and seek
   pardon with such groaning, that having undergone temporal punishments,
   we may finally enjoy that grace which is laid up for all sinners, who
   truly and from the heart turn to thee and implore that mercy which has
   been prepared for all those who really prove themselves to be the
   members of thine only begotten Son. Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-fifth

   One thing escaped me yesterday: pain in my head prevented me to look on
   the book. The Prophet says in the twelfth verse, that the children of
   Israel would be so delivered as when a shepherd rescues only an ear, or
   some part of a sheep: he adds, "So the children of Israel shall be
   rescued who dwell in Samaria in a corner of a bed, and at Damascus on a
   couch This similitude I did not explain. Some think that Damascus is
   here compared with Samaria, as the more opulent city; for Jeroboam the
   Second had extended the limits of his kingdom to that city, and subdued
   some portion of the kingdom of Syria: they then suppose, that Samaria
   is called a corner of a bed on account of its confined state, and
   Damascus a couch; but there is no reason for this. He might have better
   called Damascus a bed. Others give this exposition, "They who shall
   escape among the people of Israeli shall not be the valiant and the
   brave, who will oppose the attack of the enemy, or with arms in hand
   defend themselves; but those shall be safe who will hide themselves and
   flee to their beds." But the Prophet seems here to compare Damascus and
   Samaria to beds for this reason, because the Israelites thought that
   they would find in them a safe receptacle: "Thought then ye dwell at
   Samaria and Damascus as in a safe nest, it will yet be a miracle if a
   few of you will escape; it will be as when a shepherd carries away the
   ear of a sheep, after the lion has satiated himself." This seems to be
   the genuine meaning of the Prophet; for I doubt not but that he derides
   the foolish confidence in which the Israelites indulged themselves,
   thinking that they were secure from all danger when shut up within the
   gates of Samaria or of Damascus. "Ye think that these nests will be
   safe for you; but lions, shall break through, and hardly one in a
   hundred, or in a thousand, shall in a corner of a bed escape; it will
   be as when a lion leaves an ear or part of a leg." Let us now proceed
   --

   Amos 3:15

   15. And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the
   houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end,
   saith the Lord.

   15. Et percutiam domum hyemalem cum domo aestiva, et peribunt domus
   eburneae et deficient domus magnae, dicit Jehova.


   Amos shows again that in vain the great people trusted in their wealth
   and fortified places; for these could not hinder God from drawing them
   forth to punishment. As then abundance blinds men, and as they imagine
   themselves to be as it were inaccessible, especially when dwelling in
   great palaces, the Prophet here declares, that these houses would be no
   impediment to prevent God's vengeance to break through; I will then
   destroy the winter-house together with the summer-house. Amos no doubt
   intended by this paraphrase to designate the palaces. The poor deem it
   enough to have a cottage both for winter and summer; for they change
   not the parts of their buildings, so as to inhabit the hotter in
   winter, and to refresh themselves in the colder during summer: no such
   advantage is possessed by the poor, for they are content with the same
   dwelling through life. But as the rich sought warmth in winter, and had
   their summer compartments, the Prophet says, that their large and
   magnificent buildings would be no protection to the rich, for God's
   vengeance would penetrate through them; I will destroy then the winter
   with the summer house

   And then he says, Fail shall the houses of ivory. We now see more
   clearly that the Prophet speaks here against the rich and the wealthy,
   who inhabited splendid and magnificent palaces. Perish then shall the
   houses of ivory and fail shall the great houses; some say, many houses,
   but improperly; for the Prophet continues the same idea; and as he had
   before mentioned houses of ivory so he now calls them great houses; for
   they were not only built for use and convenience, like common and
   plebeian houses, but also for show and display; for the rich, we know,
   are ever lavish and profuse, not only in their table and dress, but
   also in their palaces. This is the meaning. Now follows --

   Chapter 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:1

   1. Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
   Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to
   their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

   1. Audite verbum hoc vaccae Basan, qui estis in monte Samariae, quae
   opprimitis pauperes, quae conteritis egenos, quae dicitis dominis
   eorum, Affer et bibemus.


   He who divided the chapters seems not to have well considered the
   Prophet's argument: for he pursues here his reproof of the rich, and he
   had been prophesying against the chief men in the kingdom of Israel. We
   indeed know how much ferocity there is in the rich, when they become
   formidable to others by their power. Hence the Prophet here laughs to
   scorn their arrogance: Hear, he says, this word; as though he said, "I
   see how it will be; for these great and pompous men will haughtily
   despise my threatening, they will not think themselves exposed to God's
   judgment; and they will also think that wrong is done to them: they
   will inquire, Who I am,' and ask, How dares a shepherd assail them with
   so much boldness?' "Hear then ye cows; as though he said, that he cared
   not for the greatness in which they prided themselves. "What then is
   your wealth? It is even fatness: then I make no more account of you
   than of cows; ye are become fat; but your power will not terrify me;
   your riches will not deprive me of the liberty of treating you as it
   becomes me and as God has commanded me." We hence see that the Prophet
   here assails with scorn the chief men of the kingdom, who wished to be
   sacred and untouched. The Prophet asks by what privilege they meant to
   excuse themselves for not hearing the word of the Lord. If they pleaded
   their riches and their own authority; "These," he says, "are fatness
   and grossness; ye are at the same time cows and I will regard you as
   cows; and I will not deal with you less freely than I do with my
   cattle." We now then perceive the Prophet's intention.

   But he goes on with his similitude: for though he here accuses the
   chiefs of the kingdom of oppressing the innocent and of distressing the
   poor, he yet addresses them in the feminine gender, who dwell, he says,
   on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who consume the
   needy, who say, etc. He does not think them worthy of the name of men;
   and yet they wished to be viewed a class separate from the common
   people, as though they were some heroes or halfgods. The Prophet, by
   way of contempt, calls them here cows; and he also withholds from them
   the name of men. Bashan, we know, derived its name from fatness; it was
   a very rich mountain, and celebrated for its pastures: as the fertility
   of this mountain was well known among that people, the Prophet gave the
   name of the cows of Bashan to those fat and full men: and it was right
   that they should be thus roughly handled, because through fatness, as
   it is usually the case, they had contracted dullness; for when men
   abound in riches, when they become great in power, they forget
   themselves and despise God, for they think themselves beyond the reach
   of danger. As then this security makes the rich torpid and inattentive
   to any threatenings, and disobedient to God's word, so that they regard
   all counsels superfluous, the Prophet here rebukes them with greater
   asperity, and addresses them, by way of reproach, under the name of
   cows. And when he says that they were on the mountain of Samaria, this
   is still ironical; for they might have made this objection, that they
   dwelt in the royal city, and were watchful over the state of the whole
   nation, and that the kingdom stood through their counsels and
   vigilance: "I see how it is," he says; "Ye are not on mount Bashan, but
   on the mount of Samaria; what is the difference between Samaria and
   Bashan? For ye are there inebriated with your pleasures: as cows, when
   fattened, are burdened with their own weight, and can hardly draw along
   their own bodies; so it is with you, such is your slowness through your
   gluttony. Samaria then, though it may seem to be a watch-tower, is yet
   nothing different from mount Bashan: for ye are not there so very
   solicitous (as ye pretend) for the public safety; but, on the contrary,
   ye devour great riches; and as your cupidity is insatiable, the whole
   government is nothing else to you than fatness or a rich pasturage."

   But the Prophet chiefly reproves them, because they oppressed the poor
   and consumed the needy. Though the rich, no doubt, did other wrongs,
   yet as they especially exercised cruelty towards the miserable, and
   those who were destitute of every help, this is the reason why the
   Prophet here elates expressly that the poor and the needy were
   oppressed by the rich: and we also know, that God promises special aid
   to the miserable, when they find no help on earth; for it more excites
   the mercy of God, when all cruelly rage against the distressed, when no
   one extends to them a helping hand or deigns to aid them.

   He adds, in the last place, what they say to their masters. I wonder
   why interpreters render this in the second person, who say to your
   masters; for the Prophet speaks here in the third person: they seem
   therefore designedly to misrepresent the real meaning of the Prophet;
   and by masters they understand the king and his counselors, as though
   the Prophet here addressed his words to these chief men of the kingdom.
   Their rendering then is unsuitable. But the Prophet calls those masters
   who were exactors, to whom the poor were debtors. The meaning is, that
   the king's counselors and judges played into the hands of the rich, who
   plundered the poor; for when they brought a bribe, they immediately
   obtained from the judges what they required. They are indeed to be
   bought by a price who hunt for nothing else but a prey.

   They said then to their masters, Bring and we shall drink; that is,
   "Only satiate my cupidity, and I will adjudge to thee what thou
   wouldest demand: provided then thou bringest me a bribe, care not, I
   will sell all the poor to thee." We now comprehend the design of the
   Prophet: for he sets forth here what kind those oppressions were of
   which he had been complaining. "Ye then oppress the poor, -- and how?
   Even by selling them to their creditors, and by selling them for a
   price. Hence, when a reward is offered to you, this satisfies you: Ye
   inquire nothing about the goodness of the cause, but instantly condemn
   the miserable and the innocent, because they have not the means of
   redeeming themselves: and the masters to whom they are debtor; who
   through your injustice hold them bound to themselves, pay the price:
   there is thus a mutual collusion between you." It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:2

   2. The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall
   come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your
   posterity with fishhooks.

   2. Juravit Dominus Jehova per sanctuarium suum, quia ecce dies veniunt
   super vos, et tollet vos in clypeo (vertunt quidam; alii, in hamo,) et
   residuum vestrum in spina piscationis.


   Here Amos declares what sort of punishment awaited those fat cattle,
   who being well fed despised God, and were torpid in their fatness. He
   therefore says, that the days were nigh, when they should be taken away
   together with all that they had, and all their posterity, as by a hook
   of a fisher.

   But to give more effect to his combination, he says that God had sworn
   by his sanctuary. [24] The simple word of God ought indeed to have been
   sufficient: but as we do not easily embrace the promises of God, so
   also hypocrites and the reprobate are not easily terrified by his
   threatening; but they laugh to scorn, or at least regard as empty, what
   God's servants declare. It was then necessary that God should interpose
   this oath, that secure men might be more effectually aroused.

   "The Lord then has sworn by his sanctuary". It is singular that God
   should swear by his temple rather than by himself: and this seems
   strange; for the Lord is wont to swear by himself for this reason, --
   because there is none greater by whom he can swear, as the Apostle
   says, (Hebrews 6:13.) God then seems to transfer the honor due to
   himself to stones and wood; which appears by no means consistent. But
   the name of the temple amounts to the same thing as the name of God.
   God then says that he had sworn by the sanctuary, because he himself is
   invisible, and the temple was his ostensible image, by which he
   exhibited himself as visible: it was also a sign and symbol of
   religion, where the face of God shone forth. God did not then divest
   himself of his own glory, that he might adorn with it the temple; but
   he rather accommodated himself here to the rude state of men; for he
   could not in himself be known, but in a certain way appeared to them in
   the temple. Hence he swore by the temple.

   But the special reason, which interpreters have not pointed out, ought
   to be noticed, and that is, that God, by swearing by his sanctuary,
   repudiated all the fictitious forms of worship in which the Israelites
   gloried, as we have already seen. The meaning is this, -- "God, who is
   rightly worshipped on mount Zion, and who seeks to be invoked there
   only, swears by himself; and though holiness dwells in himself alone,
   he yet sets before you the symbol of his holiness, the sanctuary at
   Jerusalem: he therefore repudiates all your forms of worship, and
   regards your temples as stews or brothels." We hence see that there is
   included in this expression a contrast between the sanctuary, where the
   Jews rightly and legitimately worshipped God, and the spurious temples
   which Jeroboam built, and also the high places where the Israelites
   imagined that they worshipped him. We now then understand what is meant
   by the words, that God sware by his sanctuary

   And he sware by his sanctuary, that the days would come, yea, were
   nigh, in which they should be taken away with hooks, or with shields.
   tsnh, tsane, means in Hebrew to be cold: [25] but tsnvt, tsanut denotes
   shields in that language, and sometimes fishing-hooks. Some yet think
   that the instrument by which the flesh is pulled off is intended, as
   though the Prophet still alluded to his former comparison. But another
   thing, which is wholly different, seems to be meant here, and that is,
   that these fat cows would be drawn out as a little fish by a hook; for
   afterwards he mentions a thorn or a hook again. It is the same as
   though he had said, "Ye are indeed of great weight, and ye are very
   heavy through your fatness; but this your grossness will not prevent
   God from quickly taking you away, as when one draws out a fish by a
   hook." We see how well these two different similitudes harmonize: "Ye
   are now trusting in your own fatness, but God will draw you forth as if
   ye were of no weight at all: ye shall therefore be dragged away by your
   enemies, not as fat cows but as small fishes, and a hook will be
   sufficient, which will draw you away into remote lands." This change
   ought to have seriously affected the Israelites, when they understood
   that they would be stripped of their fatness and wealth, and then taken
   away as though they were small fishes, that a hook was enough, and that
   there would be no need of large wagons. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] This word is commonly rendered holiness,' though it is also used
   to denote the sanctuary.' Calvin has been blamed for taking it here in
   the latter sense. What induced him to do so is evident from his
   comment: and when we consider all the circumstances of the passage, we
   may perhaps be disposed to think him right. -- Ed.

   [25] It is once applied in Proverbs 25:13, to denote the piercing cold
   of snow; but its ideal meaning seems to be, pointed, piercing,
   penetrating: hence it means a thorn, a goad, and also a fishing-hook.
   -- Ed.

   Amos 4:3

   3. And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is
   before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.

   3. Et per rupturas exibitis unaquaeque coram se (coram facie sua,) et
   projicietis vos ab excelso (vel, ex palatio,) dicit Jehova.


   The Prophet expresses now, in different words, what would be the future
   calamity of that kingdom; but he still speaks of the rich and the chief
   men. For though he threatened also the common people and the multitude,
   it was not yet needful expressly to name them, inasmuch as when God
   fulminates against the chief men, terror ought surely to seize also the
   humbler classes. The Prophet then designedly directs his discourse
   still to the judges and the king's counselors, Ye shall go forth at the
   breaches, every one of you. We see that he continues as yet the same
   mode of speaking, for he counts not those pompous and haughty masters
   as men, but still represents them as cows, "Every one", that is, every
   cow, he says, shall go forth through the breaches over against it. We
   know how strictly the rich observe their own ranks and also how
   difficult it is to approach them. But the Prophet says here, that the
   case with them would be far different: "There will not be," he says, "a
   triple wall or a triple gate to keep away all annoyances, as when ye
   live in peace and quietness; but there will be breaches on every side,
   and every cow shall go forth through these breaches; yea, shall throw
   herself down from the very palace: neither the pleasures nor the
   indulgence, in which ye now live, shall exist among you any more; no,
   by no means, but ye will deem it enough to seek safety by flight. Each
   of you will therefore rush headlong, as when a cow, stung by the gadfly
   or pricked by goads runs madly away." And we know how impetuous is the
   flight of cows. So also it will happen to your says the Prophet. We now
   then perceive the import of the words.

   Some take hrmvnh, ermune, for Armenian because the Israelites were led
   away into that far country; and others, take it for the mount Amanus;
   but for this there is no reason. I do not take its as some do, as
   meaning, "In the palace," but, on the contrary, "From the palace," or,
   from the high place. [21]Ye shall then throw yourselves down from the
   palace; that is, "Ye shall no more care for your pomps and your
   pleasures, but will think it enough to escape the danger of death, even
   with an impetuosity like that of beasts, as when cows run on headlong
   without any thought about their course."

   It was not without reason that he repeated the name of God so often;
   for he intended to shake off from the Israelites their
   self-complacencies; inasmuch as the king's counselors and the judges,
   as we have already stated, were extremely secure and careless; for they
   were in a manner stupefied by their own fatness. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:4-6

   4. Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression;
   and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three
   years:

   4. Ita in Bethel et scelerate agite, in Gilgal adjicite scelerate
   agendum, et adducite mane sacrificia vestra, ad tres dies (hoc est,
   tertio anno) decimas vestras;

   5. And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and
   publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of
   Israel, saith the Lord God

   5. Et adolete e fermento laudem et adducite voluntarias oblationes,
   publicite; quia sic vobis libuit, filii Israel, dicit Adonai Jehova.

   6. And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and
   want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me,
   saith the LORD.

   6. Atque etiam ego dedi vobis mundiciem dentium (alii vertunt,
   obtusiones, sed male) in omnibus oppidis vestris, et penuriam panis in
   omnibus regionibus vestris; et non estis reversi usque ad me, dicit
   Jehova.


   The Prophet here again pours contempt on the perverse confidence, in
   which the Israelites were become hardened. They thought, indeed, that
   their worship was fully approved by God, when they offered Sacrifices
   in Bethel and Gilgal. But the Prophet here shows, that the more
   sedulously they labored in performing sacred things, the more
   grievously they offended God, and the heavier judgment they gained for
   themselves. "What do you obtain by wearying yourselves, when ye so
   strictly offer sacrifices, and omit nothing that is prescribed in the
   law of God? Only this -- that you provoke God's wrath more and more."
   But he condemns not the Israelites for thinking that they rendered a
   compensation, as hypocrites were wont to think, and were on this
   account often reproved by the Prophets; but he denounces their modes of
   worship as vicious and false, and abominable before God. The Prophets
   reprobated sacrifices for two reasons; -- first, because hypocrites
   brought them before God as a compensation, that they might escape the
   punishment they deserved, as though they paid God what they owed. Thus
   at Jerusalem, in the very temple, they profaned the name of God; they
   offered sacrifices according to what the law prescribed, but
   disregarded the true and legitimate end; for they thought that God was
   pacified by the blood of beasts, by incense, and other external rites:
   it was therefore a preposterous abuse. Hence the Prophets often
   reproved them, inasmuch as they obtruded their sacrifices on God as a
   compensation, as though they were real expiations for cleansing away
   sins: this, as the Prophets declared, was extremely puerile and
   foolish. But, secondly, Amos now goes much farther; for he blames not
   here the Israelites for thinking that they discharged their duty to God
   by external rites, but denounces all their worship as degenerate and
   perverted, for they called on God in places where he had not commanded:
   God designed one altar only for his people, and there he wished
   sacrifices to be offered to him; but the Israelites at their own will
   had built altars at Bethel and Gilgal. Hence the Prophet declares that
   all their profane modes of worship were nothing but abominations,
   however much the Israelites confided in them as their safety.

   This is the reason why he now says Go ye to Bethel. It is the language
   of indignation; God indeed speaks ironically, and at the same time
   manifests his high displeasure, as though he had said, that they were
   wholly intractable, and could not be restrained by any corrections, as
   we say in French, Fai du pis que to pouvras So also God speaks in
   Ezekiel 20:39, Go, sacrifice to your idols.' When he saw the people
   running headlong with so much pertinacity into idolatry and
   superstitions, he said, "Go;" as though he intended to inflame their
   minds. It is indeed certain, that God does not stimulate sinners; but
   he thus manifests his extreme indignation. After having tried to
   restrain men, and seeing their ungovernable madness, he then says,
   "Go;" as though he said, "Ye are wholly irreclaimable; I effect nothing
   by my good advice; hear, then, the devil, who will lead you where you
   are inclined to go: Go then to Bethel, and there transgress; go to
   Gilgal, and transgress there again; heap sins on sins."

   But how did they transgress at Bethel? Even by worshipping God. We here
   see how little the pretense of good intention avails with God, which
   hypocrites ever bring forward. They imagine that, provided their
   purpose is to worship God, what they do cannot be disapproved: thus
   they wanton in their own inventions, and think that God obtains his
   due, so that he cannot complain. But the Prophet declares all their
   worship to be nothing else than abomination and execrable wickedness,
   though the Israelites, trusting in it, thought themselves safe. "Add,
   then, to transgress in Gilgal; and offer your sacrifices in the
   morning; be thus diligent, that nothing may be objected to you, as to
   the outward form."

   After three years, [26] that is, in the third year, "bring also your
   tenths"; for thus it was commanded, as we read in Deuteronomy 14:28.
   Though, then, the Israelites worshipped God apparently in the strictest
   manner, yet Amos declares that the whole was vain and of no worth, yea,
   abominable before God, and that the more they wearied themselves, the
   more they kindled the wrath of God against themselves. And to the same
   purpose is the next verse.

   [22]And burn incense with the leaven of thank offering He speaks of
   peace-offerings; sacrifices of thanksgiving were wont to be offered
   with leaven; but with other sacrifices they presented cakes and
   unleavened bread. It was lawful in peace-offerings to offer leaven.
   However sedulous, then, the Israelites were in performing these rites,
   the Prophet intimates that they were in no way approved by God inasmuch
   as they had departed from the pure command of the law. Some take leaven
   in a bad sense, as meaning a vicious and impure sacrifice, which the
   law required to be free from leaven; but this view seems not suitable
   here; for nothing is here condemned in the Israelites, but that they
   had departed from what the law prescribed, that they had presumptuously
   changed the place of the temple, and also raised up a new priesthood.
   They were in other things careful and diligent enough; but this
   defection was the chief abomination. It could not then be, that God
   would approve of deprivations; for obedience, as it is said elsewhere,
   is of more account before him than all sacrifices, (1 Samuel 15:22)
   Proclaim, he says, ndvvt, nudabut, voluntary oblations. What he means
   is, "Though ye not only offer sacrifices morning and evenings as it has
   been commanded you, though ye not only present other sacrifices on
   festivals, but also add voluntary oblations to any extent, yet nothing
   pleases me."

   Bring forth then, and proclaim voluntary offerings; that is, "Appoint
   solemn assemblies with great pomp; yet this would be nothing else than
   to add sin to sin: ye are acting wickedly for this reason, -- because
   the very beginning is impious."

   But the last part of the verse must be noticed, For so it has pleased
   you, O children of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah. By saying that the
   Israelites loved to do these things, he reprobates their presumption in
   devising at their own will new modes of worship; as though he said, "I
   require no sacrifices from you except those offered at Jerusalem; but
   ye offer them to me in a profane place. Regard then your sacrifices as
   offered to yourselves, and not to me." We indeed know how hypocrites
   ever make God a debtor to themselves; when they undertake any labor in
   their frivolous ceremonies, they think that God is bound to them. But
   God denies that this work was done for him, for he had not enjoined it
   in his law. "It has thus pleased you," he says, "Vous faites cela pour
   votre plaisir et bien mettez le sur vos comptes". We then see what Amos
   meant here by saying, It has so pleased you, O children of Israel:' it
   is, as if he had said, "Ye ought to have consulted me, and simply to
   have obeyed my word, to have regarded what pleased me, what I have
   commanded; but ye have despised my word, neglected my law, and followed
   what pleased yourselves, and proceeded from your own fancies. Since,
   then, your own will is your law, seek a recompense from yourselves, for
   I allow none of these things. What I require is implicit submission, I
   look for nothing else but obedience to my law; as ye render not this
   but according to your own will, it is no worship of my name."

   Lecture Fifty-sixth

   But I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread
   in all your borders; and ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah. God here
   expostulates with the people on account of their incurable
   perverseness; for he had tried to restore them to the right way, not
   only by his word, but also by heavy punishments; but he effected
   nothing. This hardness doubled the guilt of that people, as they could
   not be subdued by God's chastisements.

   The Prophet now says, that the people had been chastised with famine, I
   gave them, he says, cleanness of teeth. It is a figurative expression,
   by which Amos means want, and he explains it himself by want of bread
   The whole country then labored under want and deficiency of provisions,
   though the land, as it is well known, was very fruitful. Now since the
   end of punishment is to turn men to God and his service, it is evident,
   when no fruit follows, that the mind is hardened in evil. Hence the
   Prophet shows here, that the Israelites were not only guilty, but had
   also pertinaciously resisted God, for their vices could be corrected by
   no punishment. We have just mentioned famine, another kind of
   punishment follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:7

   7. And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet
   three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and
   caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and
   the piece whereupon it rained not withered.

   7. Atque etiam ego prohibui a vobis pluviam, quum adhuc essent tres
   menses ad messem; et plui super urbem unam, et super alteram urbem non
   feci pluere; pars una compluebatur, et super quam non pluebat exaruit.


   I have said that another kind of punishment is here recorded by the
   Prophet; it is not, however, wholly different: for whence comes the
   want we have noticed, except through drought? For when God intends to
   deprive men of support, he shuts up heaven and makes it iron, so that
   it hears not the earth, according to what we have noticed elsewhere.
   Yet these words of the Prophet are not superfluous; for God would have
   the punishment he inflicts on men to be more attentively considered.
   When men are reduced to want, they will indeed acknowledge it to be the
   curse of God, except they be very stupid; but when a drought precedes,
   when the earth disappoints its cultivators, and then a want of food
   follows, more time is given to men to think of God's displeasure. This
   is the reason why the Prophet now distinctly speaks of rain being
   withheld, after having said that the people had been before visited
   with a deficiency of provisions; as though he said "Ye ought to have
   returned, at least after a long course of time, to a sound mind. If God
   had been offended with you only for one day, and had given tokens of
   his displeasure, the shortness of time might have been some excuse for
   you: but as the earth had become dry; as God had restrained rain, and
   as hence sterility followed, and afterwards there came want, how great
   was your stupidity not to attend to so many and so successive tokens of
   God's wrath?" We now perceive why the Prophet here connects drought
   with want of food, the cause with the effect: it was, that the
   stupidity of the people might hence be more evident.

   But he says that God had withheld rain from them, when three months
   still remained to the harvest. When it rains not for a whole month, the
   earth becomes dry, and men become anxious, for it is an ill omen: but
   when two months pass without rain, men begin to be filled with
   apprehension and even dread; but if continual dryness lasts to the end
   of the third month, it is a sign of some great evil. The Prophet, then,
   here shows that the Israelites had not been in an ordinary way
   chastised, and that they were very stupid, as they did not, during the
   whole three months, apply their minds to consider their sins, though
   God urged them, and though his wrath had been manifested for so long a
   time. We now then see that the hardness of the people is amplified by
   the consideration of time, inasmuch as they were not awakened by a sign
   so portentous, When there were yet three months, he says, to the
   harvests I withheld rain from you.

   Another circumstance follows, "God rained on one city, on another he
   did not rain; one part was watered, and no drop of rain fell on another
   This difference could not be ascribed to chance: except men resolved to
   be willfully mad, and to reject all reason, they must surely have been
   constrained to confess these to have been manifest signs of God's
   wrath. How came it, that one place was rained upon, and another
   remained dry? that two neighboring cities were treated so differently?
   Whence was this, except that God appeared angry from heaven? The
   Prophet then does here again condemn the obstinacy of the people: they
   did not see in this difference the wrath of God, which was yet so very
   conspicuous. The import of the whole is, that God shows that he had to
   do with a people past recovery; for they were refractory and obstinate
   in their wickedness, and could bear the application of no remedy. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:8

   8. So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but
   they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the
   LORD.

   8. Et venerunt duae tres urbes ad unam urbem, ut biberent aquas, et non
   satiatae sunt: et non reversi estis usque ad me, dicit Jehova.


   Marking the difference, the Prophet relates, that two or three cities
   had come to one, to seek drink, and that they were not satisfied,
   because the waters failed on account of so large a number: for though
   the fountains could have supplied the inhabitants, yet when such a
   multitude flowed from every quarter, the very fountains became
   exhausted. The Prophet thus aggravates the punishment brought by God on
   the Israelites; for so great was the thirst, that whole cities had
   recourse to fountains, where they heard that there was any water. It
   was indeed an unusual thing for inhabitants to leave their own city and
   to run to another to seek water, like wild beasts who, when satiated
   with prey, run far for water: but it is an unwonted thing for men to
   undertake a long journey for the sake of finding drink: for they dig
   wells for themselves, and seek water by their own industry, when rivers
   do not flow, or when fountains do not supply them with drink. When
   therefore men are forced to leave their own homes and to seek water at
   a distance, and when they exhaust the fountains, it is a portend which
   ought to be observed.

   But how was it that the Israelites took no notice of God's hand, which
   was then as it were visible? Hence then, as they repented not, their
   obstinate blindness became quite evident. They were no doubt terrified
   with fear and harassed by grief; but all this produced no effect, for
   they continued in their sins, took delight in their own superstitions,
   and pursued the same life as before. Since then they divested not
   themselves of their own character, nor ceased to provoke continually
   the wrath of God, their hopeless and incorrigible obstinacy is here
   manifestly proved. This was the Prophet's design. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 4:9

   9. I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and
   your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the
   palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the
   Lord

   9. Percussi vos Orientali vento et rubigine; magnos [27] hortos vestros
   et vites vestros et ficulneas vestras et oliveta vestra voravit bruchus
   (vel, eruca;) et non reversi estis usque ad me, dicit Jehova.


   Though one kind of punishment may not convince men, they are yet
   thereby proved with sufficient clearness to be guilty before God. But
   when in various ways he urges them, and after having tried in vain to
   correct them in one way, he has recourse to another, and still effects
   nothing, it hence more fully appears that they, who are thus ever
   unmoved, and remain stupid whatever means God may adopt to lead them to
   repentance, are altogether past recovery. This is the drift of what the
   Prophet now adds: he says that they had been smitten by the east wind
   He shows that want of food does not always proceed from one cause; for
   men become hardened when they feel only one evil: as the case is when a
   country labors under a drought, it will be thought to be as it were its
   fate. But when God chastises men in various ways, they ought then no
   doubt to be touched and really affected: when, on the contrary, they
   pass by all punishments with their eyes closed, it is certain, that
   they are wholly obstinate and so fascinated by the devil, that they
   feel nothing and discern nothing. This is the reason why the Prophet
   records the various punishments which had been already inflicted on the
   people.

   Hence he says now, that they had been smitten by the east wind, and by
   the mildew. What mischief the mildew does to the standing corn, we
   know; when the sun rises after a cold rain, it burns out its substance,
   so that the ears grow yellow, and rottenness follows. God then says,
   that the standing corn of the people had been destroyed by this
   blasting, after dryness had already prevailed though not through the
   whole land in an equal degree; for God rained on one part, while a
   neighboring region was parched through want of rain: the Prophet having
   stated this, now mentions also the mildew.

   He says further, that the fig-trees and vines had been consumed, that
   the gardens had been destroyed, and that the olive trees had been
   devoured by chafers or palmer worms. Since then the Israelites had been
   in so many ways warned, was it not a strange and monstrous blindness,
   that being affrighted they could bear these chastisements of God, and
   be not moved to return to the right way? If the first chastisement had
   no effect, if the second also had been without fruit, they ought surely
   at last to have repented; but as they proceeded in their usual course,
   and continued like themselves in that contumacy of which we have
   spoken, what any more remained for them, but to be wholly destroyed as
   those who had trifled with God? We now then understand what the Prophet
   means.

   Moreover, this passage teaches, as other similar passages do, that
   seasons vary not by chance; that now drought prevails, and then
   continual rains destroy the fruits of the earth, that now chafers are
   produced, and then that heaven is filled with various infections, --
   that these things happen not by chance, is what this passage clearly
   shows: but that they are so many tokens of God's wrath, set before our
   eyes. God indeed does not govern the world, according to what profane
   men think, as though he gave uncontrolled license both in heaven and
   earth; but he now withholds rain, then he pours it down in profusion;
   he now burns the corn with heat, then he temperates the air; he now
   shows himself kind to men, then he shows himself angry with them. Let
   us then learn to refer the whole order of nature to the special
   providence of God. I mention his special providence, lest we should
   dream only of some general operation, as ungodly men do: but let us
   know that God would have himself to be seen in daily events, so that
   the tokens of his love may make us to rejoice, and also that the tokens
   of his wrath may humble us, to the end that we may repent. Let this
   then be learnt from the present words of the Prophet.

   Amos further teaches us, that wind and rain, hail and droughts heat and
   cold, are arms or weapons by which God executes vengeance on account of
   our sins. Whenever God then intends to inflict punishment on us, he
   puts on his armor, that is, he sends either rain, or wind, or drought,
   or heat, or hail. Since it is so, let us not think that either rain or
   heat is fortuitous, or that they depend on the situation of the stars
   as ungodly men imagine. Let us therefore know, that all nature so obeys
   God's command, that when rain falls seasonably, it is a token of his
   love towards us, and that when it is unseasonable, it is a proof of his
   displeasure. It is meet to think the same of heat and of cold, and of
   all other things. Let us now go on with the words of the Prophet --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] The words are, hrvvt gnvtykm, "the abundance of your gardens," and
   not your great or large gardens. I would thus render the verse -- I
   smote you with blight and with mildew;
   The abundance of your gardens and of your vineyards,
   And your figs and your olives, the locust devoured;
   yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah. -- Ed.

   Amos 4:10

   10. I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt:
   your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your
   horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your
   nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.

   10. Misi in vos pestem secundum rationem Aegypti; percussi gladio
   robustos vestros, cum captivitate equorum vestrorump; ascendere feci
   foetorem castrorum vestrorum et ad nares vestras (vel, usque ad nares
   vestras, ut copula supervacua sit;) et non reversi estis usque ad me,
   dicit Jehova.


   God now expostulates with the people, because their perverseness had
   not been subdued even by additional punishments; for he had in vain
   exhorted and stimulated them to repentance. He says, that they had been
   smitten with pestilence. The Prophet has hitherto spoken only of the
   sterility of the land, and of the fruit being destroyed by infections;
   he has hitherto mentioned want only with its causes; this only has been
   stated: but now he adds that the people had been afflicted with
   pestilence, and also with war, and that they had still persevered in
   their wickedness. Whatever measures then God had adopted to correct the
   vices of the people, the Prophet now complains and deplores, that they
   all had been tried in vain. But so many upbraidings are mentioned, that
   God might show that there was no more any hope of pardon, inasmuch as
   they thus continued to be untractable and perverse.

   He then says that he had sent pestilence according to the manner of
   Egypt drk, darec, means a way, but is taken for mode or manners as the
   10^th chapter of Isaiah [28] I will smite him according to the manner
   of Egypt,' says God, speaking of Sennacherib, as though he said, "Ye
   know how formerly I checked the fury of Pharaoh; I will now put on the
   same armor, that I may drive far from you your energy Sennacherib." But
   the Prophet says here, that God had exercised towards the Israelites
   the same extreme rigor which he had used towards the Egyptians; as
   though he said, "I have been forced by your obstinacy to turn my power
   against you: ye know how Egypt was formerly smitten by me from kindness
   to your fathers; I then showed how dear to me was your preservation, by
   putting forth my strength to destroy the Egyptians: how is it that I
   now turn my weapons against you for your destruction? I have been
   indeed always ready to oppose your enemies, and kindly to cherish you
   in my paternal bosom. As then ye are become to me like the Egyptians,
   how is this and whence this change, except that ye have constrained me
   by your irreclaimable wickedness?"

   We now then see why the Prophet speaks here expressly of the Egyptians.
   He intimates that God could not show favor to the Israelites, which he
   would have continued to show, had they not closed the door against it;
   as though he said, "I had chosen you from other nations; but now I
   chastise you, not as I do the uncircumcised Gentiles, but I avowedly
   carry on war with you, as though ye were Egyptians." We see how much it
   serves for amplification, when Amos compares the Israelites to the
   Egyptians, as though he had said that they, by their perverse
   wickedness, had extinguished all God's favor, so that the memory of
   their gratuitous adoption was of no more avail to them. I have
   therefore sent among you pestilence after the manner of Egypt.

   And he adds, I slew with the sword your strong men. It was a different
   kind of punishment, that all the strong had been slain, that their
   horses had been led into captivity, and that, finally, the foetor of
   dead bodies had ascended to suffocate them. These were certainly
   unusual tokens of God's wrath. As the people had not repented, it
   became now again quite evident, that their diseases were not healable;
   for God had effected nothing by the application of so many remedies.
   These different kinds of punishments ought to be carefully noticed,
   because the Lord has collected them together, as so many arguments to
   prove the contumacy of the people.

   By saying that the foetor of camps had ascended to their nostrils, it
   was the same as if he had said, "There has been no need of external
   force; though no enemy had been hostile to you, ye have yet been
   suffocated by your own foetor; for this came up from your own camps
   into your nostrils, and deprived you of life. Since God then had raised
   up this intestine putridity, ought you not to have been at length
   seriously affected, and to have returned to a right mind? Inasmuch then
   as no fruit followed, who does not see, that you have been in vain
   chastised, and that what alone remains for you is utter destruction? As
   God has hitherto stimulated you in vain by punishments, were he to
   proceed, he would lose all his labor. Since then God has hitherto to no
   purpose visited you with his scourges, there is no reason why he should
   chastise you more moderately: you must now then be utterly destroyed."
   This is the meaning: and he further adds --

   Amos 4:11

   11. I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
   and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not
   returned unto me, saith the Lord

   11. Subverti vos secundum subversionem Dei contra (vel, in) Sodomam et
   Gomorrham; et fuistis quasi torris ereptus ab incendio: et non reversi
   estis ad me, dicit Jehova.


   Amos proceeds further, and says, that God had used a severity towards
   his chosen people similar to that which formerly he showed towards
   Sodom and Gomorrah. That, we know, was a memorable evidence of God's
   wrath, which ought to have filled all ages with dread, as it ought also
   at this day: and Scripture, whenever it graphically paints the wrath of
   God, sets Sodom and Gomorrah before our eyes. It was indeed a dreadful
   judgment, when God destroyed those cities with fire from heaven, when
   they were consumed, and when the earth, cleaving asunder, swallowed up
   the five cities. But he says that nearly the same ruin had taken place
   among the people of Israel, only that a few escaped, as when any one
   snatches a brand from the burning; for the second clause of the verse
   ought no doubt to be taken as a modification; for had Amos only said,
   that they had been overthrown as Sodom and Gomorrah, he would have said
   too much. The Prophet then corrects or modifies his expression by
   saying, that a few had remained, as when one snatches a brand from the
   burning. But in the meantime, they ought to have been at least moved by
   punishments so grievous and dreadful, since God had manifested his
   displeasure to them, as he did formerly to Sodom and Gomorrah.

   History seems, at the same time, to militate against this narrative of
   Amos; for he prophesied under Jeroboam the second, the son of Joash;
   and the state of the people was then prosperous, as sacred history
   records. How then could it be, that the Israelites had been destroyed
   like Sodom and Gomorrah? This difficulty may be easily solved, if we
   attend to what sacred history relates; for it says that God had pity on
   the Israelites, because all had been before consumed, the free man as
   well as the captive, (2 Kings 14:25, 26) When, therefore, there was so
   deplorable a devastation among the people, it was God's purpose to give
   them some relief for a time. Hence he made king Jeroboam successful, so
   that he recovered many cities; and the people flourished again: but it
   was a short prosperity. Now Amos reminds them of what they had
   suffered, and of the various means by which God had stimulated them to
   repentance though they proved wholly untamable.

   Then these two things are in no way inconsistent, -- that the
   Israelites had been consumed before God spared them under Jeroboam, --
   and that they had yet been for a time relieved from those calamities,
   which proved ruinous both to the captive and to the free, as it is
   expressly declared. We must, at the same time, remember, that there was
   some residue among the people; for it was God's design to show mercy on
   account of his covenant. The people were indeed worthy of complete
   destruction; but it was God's will that some remnant should continue,
   lest any one should think that he had forgotten his covenant. We hence
   see why God had preserved some; it was, that he might contend with the
   wickedness of the people, and show that his covenant was not wholly
   void. So the Lord observed a middle course, that he might not spare
   hypocrites, and that he might not abolish his covenant; for it was
   necessary for that to stand perpetually, however ungodly and perfidious
   the Israelites may have been. The Prophet then shows, that God had been
   faithful even in this case, and constantly kept his covenant, though
   all the Israelites had fallen away from him. He at length concludes --

   Amos 4:12-13

   12. Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do
   this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

   12. Propterea sic faciam tibi Israel; et quia hoc faciam tibi, praepara
   te in occursum Dei tui Israel.

   13. For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and
   declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning
   darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The
   God of hosts, is his name.

   13. Quia ecce formans montes, creans spiritum (aut, ventum,) annuntians
   homini quae sit cogitatio ejus, faciens auroram, tenebras (et tenebras,
   subaudienda est copula,) ambulans super excelsa loca terrae, Jehova,
   Deus exercituum, nomen ejus.


   Amos here declares, in the person of God, that the people in vain hoped
   for pardon, or for a modification, or an abatement, or an end to their
   punishment; for God had in vain made the attempt, by many scourges and
   chastisements, to subdue their extreme arrogance: therefore, he says,
   thus will I do to you. What does this particle kh, ke, thus, mean? Some
   think that God here denounces on the Israelites the punishments they
   had before experienced: but the Prophet, I doubt not, means something
   much more grievous. He now removes the exception which he lately
   mentioned as though be had said, that God would execute extreme
   punishment on this reprobate people without any mitigation. This will I
   do to thee, Israel: "Thou hast already perceived with how many things I
   armed myself to take vengeance on the despisers of my law; I will now
   deal more severely with thee, for thy obstinacy compels me. Since,
   then, I have hitherto produced no effect on you, I will now bring the
   last punishment: for remedies cannot be applied to men past recovery."
   Thus, then, he says, will I do to thee Israel. [29]

   And because I will do this to thee, etc kv, okob, means often a reward
   or an end: this place may then be thus rendered: I will at length
   surely do this to you;' but the sense the most suitable seems to be
   this, Because I will this do to you, prepare to meet thy God. The
   passage may be explained in two ways: either as an ironical sentence,
   or as a simple and serious exhortation to repentance. If we take it
   ironically, the sense will be of this kind, "Come, now, meet me with
   all your obstinacy, and with whatever may serve you; will you be able
   to escape my vengeance by setting up yourselves against me, as you have
   hitherto done?" And certainly the Prophet, in denouncing final ruin on
   the people, seems here as though he wished designedly to touch them to
   the quick, when he says, "Meet now thy God and prepare thyself:" that
   is, "Gather all thy strength, and thy forces, and thy auxiliaries; try
   what all this will avail thee." But as in the next chapter, the Prophet
   exhorts again the Israelites to repentance, and sets before them the
   hope of favor, this place may be taken in another sense, as though he
   said, "Since thou seest thyself guilty, and also as thou seest that
   thou art seeking subterfuges in vain, being not able by any means to
   elude the hand of thy judge, then see at last, that thou meet thy God,
   that thou mayest anticipate the final ruin which is impending." The
   Prophets, we indeed know, after having threatened destruction to the
   chosen people, ever moderate the asperity of their doctrine, as there
   were at all times some remnant seed, though hidden. And similar
   passages we have seen both in Joel and in Hosea. It is not, therefore,
   improper to explain the words of Amos in this sense, -- that though the
   people were almost past hope, he yet exhorted them to anticipate God's
   wrath. Prepare then thyself to meet thy God, as though he said,
   "However worthy thou art of being destroyed and though the Lord seems
   to have closed up the door of mercy, and despair meets thee on every
   side, thou can't yet mitigate God's wrath, provided thou prepares to
   meet him."

   But this preparation includes real renovation of the heart: it then
   takes place, when men are displeased with themselves, when with a
   changed mind they submit to God, and humbly pray for forgiveness. There
   is then an important meaning in the Prophet's words, Prepare thyself.
   With regard to meeting God, we know what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9:
   ,

   If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged by the Lord.'

   How comes it, then, that God deals severely with us, except that we
   spare ourselves? Hence this indulgence, with which we flatter
   ourselves, provokes God's wrath against us. We cannot then meet God,
   except we become our own judges, and condemn our sins and feel real
   sorrow. We now see what the Prophet means, if we regard the passage as
   not spoken ironically.

   But that he might rouse careless men more effectually, he then
   magnificently extols the power of God; and that he might produce more
   reverence and fear in men, especially the hardened and the refractory,
   he adorns his name with many commendations. As it was difficult to turn
   the headstrong, the Prophet accumulates many titles, to move the
   people, that they might entertain reverence for God. "God," he says,
   "has formed the mountains, and created the spirit," and further, "he
   knoweth hearts, and men themselves understand not what they think of,
   except as far as God sets before them their thoughts; God maketh the
   morning and the darkness, and walketh in the high places of the earth;
   and his name is, Jehovah, God of hosts." Why were all these encomiums
   added, but that the hearts of men might be touched, who were before
   void of thought and sunk in blind stupidity? We now understand the
   Prophet's object. But what remains to be said on the words will be
   added in tomorrow's lecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] There seems to be a reference in "thus" to the judgment denounced

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since by thy word thou kindly invites us to
   thyself, we may not turn deaf ears to thee, but anticipate thy rod and
   scourges; and that when, for the stupidity and thoughtlessness by which
   we have become inebriated, thou addest those punishments by which thou
   sharply urgest us to repent, -- O grant, that we may not continue
   wholly intractable, but at length turn our hearts to thy service and
   submit ourselves to the yoke of thy word, and that we may be so
   instructed by the punishments, which thou hast inflicted on us and
   still inflictest, that we may truly and from the heart turn to thee,
   and offer ourselves to thee as a sacrifice, that thou mayest govern us
   according to thy will, and so rule all our affections by thy Spirit,
   that we may through the whole of our life strive to glorify thy name in
   Christ Jesus, thy Son our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-seventh

   We have explained the last verse of the fourth chapter, except that
   there remains something to be said of the glorious representation given
   of God by the Prophet. He says first, that he had formed the mountains
   then that he had created the spirits, afterwards that he declares to
   man what is his thoughts, makes the morning and the darkness, and walks
   on the high places of the earth Such an accumulation of words might
   seem superfluous, only this main thing must be borne in mind, that it
   was necessary for men, whose minds were exceedingly torpid to be
   aroused that they might seriously consider what we have seen had been
   denounced on them. Hence the Prophet sought to shake off from the
   Israelites their thoughtlessness, by setting God before them in his
   greatness; for when his name only is announced, he is wholly neglected
   by the greatest part of men. It was therefore necessary that something
   should be added, that they who were asleep might be awakened, and
   understand how great and how fearful the power of God is. This is the
   design of all that we read here.

   The word rvch, ruch, is interpreted in two ways. Some refer it to the
   wind, and others to the soul of man. If we take it for the wind, it
   will join suitably with the creation of mountains, for the winds emerge
   from them on account of their cavity. If you understand it of man's
   soul, it will agree with the following clause. It appears to me more
   probable that the Prophet speaks of man's soul; though one may possibly
   choose to connect both, so that there is an allusion to wind, and that
   yet Amos, about to speak of thought, first mentions the spirit.

   But what the Prophet says, that God announces to men what their thought
   is -- this is done in various ways. We indeed know that the end of
   teaching is, that men may confess their guilt, who before flattered
   themselves; we know also that the word of God is like a two-edged
   sword, which penetrates into the bones and marrow, and distinguishes
   between thoughts and feelings, (Hebrews 4:12) God then thus draws men
   out of their recesses into the light; and he also convinces them
   without the word; for we know how powerful are the secret movements
   (instinctus -- influences) of the Spirit. But the Prophet meant only
   here, that the Israelites had to do with God, who is the searcher of
   hearts, and from whom nothing is hid, however concealed it may be. Each
   one is to himself the best witness of his own thoughts; but the Prophet
   ascribes to God a higher degree, for he understands whatever any one
   conceives in his mind, better than he who seems to have all his own
   thoughts well understood. [30] Since men therefore craftily hide
   themselves, the Prophet here reminds them that they cannot succeed, for
   God understands what they inwardly think better than they themselves.
   We now then perceive what he substantially means.

   Some explain the words, that God makes the morning darkness, as if Amos
   had said, that he converts light into darkness; but we ought rather to
   consider a copulative to be understood; for he here declares the power
   of God, not only as displayed in once creating the world, but also in
   preserving the order of nature, and in minutely regulating the changes
   of times and seasons. Let us now proceed to the fifth chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] This conjecture is fully borne out by the fact, that the
   copulative v, vau, is found in more than twenty MSS., as given by
   Kennicott: it is also found in the Septuagint. -- Ed.

   Chapter 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:1

   1. Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O
   house of Israel.

   1. Audite verbum hoc quod ego tollo super vos, lamentum domus Israel.


   Some render the verse thus, "Hear ye this word, because upon you, or
   for you, I raise a lamentation:" but we shall hereafter speak more at
   large as to the proper rendering. Let us see what the subject is. The
   Prophet here denounces on the Israelites the punishment they had
   deserved; and yet they did not think that it was nigh; and they
   ferociously despised, I have no doubt, the denunciation itself, because
   no chance had as yet taken place, which might have pointed out such a
   destruction. Hence the Prophet and his threatenings were both despised.

   He however threatens them here in severe terms with the judgment of
   God, which they feared not: and this is the reason why he says, Hear
   ye. It was not, indeed, without reason that he thus began and intimated
   that they greatly flattered themselves, nay, that they stopped their
   ears against wholesome counsels: the admonition would have been
   otherwise superfluous. The Prophet then indirectly reproves that supine
   indifference in which the Israelites indulged themselves.

   But with regard to the words, some, as I have before mentioned, refer
   this lamentation to Amos himself, as though he had said, that he
   lamented the state of the people, finding that they were so stupid, and
   did not perceive how dreadful the wrath of God is. Since, then, they
   thus flattered themselves in their sins, those interpreters think that
   the Prophet here assumes the character of a mourner for that
   irreclaimable people. Hear, he says, this word even because I lament
   over you. For the more refractory the people were, the more touched
   with grief the prophet no doubt was: for he saw how horrible the
   judgment of God was, which was nigh them, on account of their
   stubbornness. No wonder then that the Prophet says here, that he
   undertook or raised lamentation for the people; and this mode of
   speaking is common in Scripture.

   But yet I rather think that another sense is more suitable to this
   place, which becomes evident by putting in an exegetic particle, Hear
   ye then this word which I raise upon you, even a lamentation, etc. The
   word ms', mesha, rendered burden, is derived from the verb ns', nusha,
   which means to raise up: and there is a striking allusion to the
   subject treated of here. For the Prophet does not here simply teach the
   people, nor comfort them, nor does he only warn them, but he denounces
   on them the last punishment. We hence see the import of the expression,
   to raise up a word; it was the same as though he said, "I lay on you
   this prophecy:" for a burden is laid on the shoulders of men when God's
   wrath is denounced.

   It afterwards follows, Even a lamentation, O house of Israel; which
   means, "I raise upon you a word, which will constrain you to mourn and
   lament: though now ye are so refractory against God, that ye spurn all
   warnings, and reject all threatening; yet this word shall at last prove
   mournful to you." This seems to be the genuine sense of the Prophet: in
   the first place, he reproves the stupidity of the people of Israel, by
   demanding a hearing; then he reproves their contempt of God in
   despising all threatenings; and he shows also that this prophecy would
   prove mournful to them for having so long trifled with God, "The lament
   of the house of Israel shall be this word, which I now raise up upon
   you." it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:2

   2. The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
   forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

   2. Cecidit nec adjiciet ut resurgat virgo Israel: relicta est super
   terram suam; non est qui attollat.


   This was substantially the vengeance which was now nigh the Israelites,
   though they rested securely, and even scorned all the threatening of
   God. The virgin of Israel, he says, has fallen Expounders have too
   refinedly explained the word virgin; for they think that the people of
   Israel are here called a virgin, because God had espoused them to
   himself, and that though they ought to have observed spiritual chastity
   towards God, they yet abandoned themselves to all kinds of pollutions:
   but a virgin, we know, is a title given for the most part by the
   Prophets to this or that people on account of their delicacies; for
   Babylon, no less than Samaria or the people of Israel, is called a
   virgin. Certainly this refined interpretation cannot be applied to
   Babylon, to Egypt, to Tyre, and to other places. I have therefore no
   doubt but the Prophet here arraigns the Israelites, because they,
   relying on their strength, indulged themselves. They were quiet in
   their own retreats, and when all kinds of blessings abounded, they
   lived daintily and sumptuously. As then they were indulging themselves
   in such pleasures he calls them a virgin. The virgin of Israel then has
   fallen, and shall no more rise again.

   A condition may be here included, as an exhortation to repentance
   immediately follows: we may then fitly regard this as being understood,
   "except they timely repent:" otherwise the Israelites must have fallen
   without hope of restoration. But we may also refer this to the body of
   the people: fallen then had the virgin of Israel, not so however that
   they were all destroyed, as we shall hereafter see; for the Prophet
   says that the tenth part would remain: but this is rightly said of the
   people generally; for we know that the kingdom had so fallen, that it
   never afterwards did rise. A remnant of the tribe of Judah did indeed
   return to Jerusalem; but the Israelites are at this day dispersed
   though various parts of the world; yea, they are hid either in the
   mountains of Armenia, or in other regions of the East. Since then what
   the Prophet here denounces has been really fulfilled as to the whole
   kingdom, we may take the place without supposing any thing understood,
   "Fallen has the virgin of Israel." For as God showed mercy when the
   people as a body were destroyed, that some remained, is what does not
   militate with the prophecy, that the whole body had fallen. Fallen then
   has the virgin of Israel, nor will she any more rise again; that is,
   the kingdom shall not by way of recovery be restored; and this, we
   know, has never taken place.

   Forsaken is she, he says, on her own land, and there is none to raise
   her up; which means, that she will continue fallen: though she may
   remain in her own place, she will not yet recover what she had lost. We
   now understand the Prophet's meaning; and, at the same time, we see
   that that people had so fallen, as never to rise again, as it has been
   stated, into a kingdom. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:3

   3. For thus saith the Lord God; The city that went out by a thousand
   shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall
   leave ten, to the house of Israel.

   3. Quia sic dicit Dominus Jehova, Urbs e qua egrediebantur mille,
   manebunt in ea centum; et e qua egrediebantur centum, manebunt (ad
   verbum, restabunt) decem domui Israel.


   The Prophet now expresses more clearly what he had before said, -- that
   the kingdom would perish and yet so that the Lord would preserve some
   remnants. Then as to the body of the people, Israel had fallen; but as
   to a few remnants they were saved; but they were a small numbers such
   as the Prophet mentions. We hence see that some hope of mercy was given
   to God's chosen people, and that in the meantime destruction was
   denounced on the whole nation. We have already seen that their
   wickedness was past hope; it was therefore necessary to announce to
   them the sentence of final ruin; but it was so done, as not to drive to
   despair the faithful few, who remained hid among the multitude.

   The city then, from which a thousand went forth, shall have a hundred
   remaining; and the city from which went forth a hundred, shall have
   ten. Armies were wont formerly to be decimated, when any sedition had
   been made: but God threatens the Israelites here with a much heavier
   judgment, that only the tenth part would be saved from ruin. We now
   then perceive the design of the Prophet. Now this could not alleviate
   the grief of the people; but the hypocrites were more exasperated, on
   hearing that few would be saved, and that all hope of deliverance was
   cut off from them. When, therefore, they saw that God dealt with them
   with so much severity, envy increased their griefs and more embittered
   their minds; and this was what the Prophet designed; for it was of no
   use to apply any solace to the despisers of God: but as God knew that
   there were some seed remaining among the people, he intended to provide
   for the miserable, who would have been a hundred times swallowed up
   with grief, had no mitigation been offered them. The Prophet then
   directs his discourse to the few, when he says, "In the city from which
   a thousand had gone forth there will be a hundred; and in that from
   which a hundred went forth, ten will remain alive." It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:4-6

   4. For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye
   shall live:

   4. Quia sic dicit Jehova domui Israel, Querite me, et vivetis.

   5. But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
   Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall
   come to nought.

   5. Et ne quaeratis Bethel, et in Gilgal ne eatis, et ne transeatis in
   Berseba; quia Gilgal migrando migrabit, et Bethel erit in nih ilum
   (vel, in molestiam.)

   6. Seek the Lord, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the
   house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in
   Bethel.

   6. Quaerite Jehovam et vivetis; ne transeat (vel, scindat) quasi ignis
   domum Joseph, et absorbeat, et non sit extinguens in Bethel.


   Amos here again exhorts the Israelites to repentance; and it was an
   address common to all, though the greater part, as we have said, were
   altogether past recovery; but it was necessary, as long as they
   continued a chosen people, to call them to repentance; for they had not
   been as yet abdicated. We further know, that the Prophets preached in
   order to invite some to God, and to render others inexcusable. With
   regard to the end and design of public teaching, it is, that all should
   in common be called: but God's purpose is different; for he intends,
   according to his own secret counsel, to draw to himself the elect, and
   he designs to take away all excuse from the reprobate, that their
   obstinacy may be more and more apparent. We must further bear in mind,
   that while the people of Israel continued, the doctrine of repentance
   and faith was preserved among them; and the reason was that to which I
   have alluded, because they remained as yet in the fold of God. It is no
   wonder then that the Prophet gives again to the Israelites the hope of
   pardon, provided they repented.

   Thus saith Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek me, and ye shall live.
   This sentence has two clauses. In saying, Seek me, the Prophet exhorts
   the Israelites to return to a sane mind: and then he offers them the
   mercy of God, if only they sought from the heart to reconcile
   themselves to him. We have elsewhere said that men cannot be led to
   repentance, unless they believe that God will be propitious to them;
   for all who think him to be implacable, ever flee away from him, and
   dread the mention of his name. Hence, were any one through his whole
   life to proclaim repentance, he could effect nothing, except he were to
   connect with this the doctrine of faith, that is, except he were to
   show that God is ready to give pardon, if men only repent from the
   heart. These two parts, then, which ought not to be separated, the
   Prophet here connects together very wisely and for the best reason,
   when he says, Seek me, and ye shall live; intimating that the gate of
   mercy was still open, provided the Israelites did not persevere in
   their obstinacy. But, at the same time, he lays this to their charge,
   -- that they willfully perished through their own fault; for he shows
   that in themselves was the only hindrance, that they were not saved;
   for God was not only ready to receive them into favor, but also
   anticipated and exhorted them, and of his own free will sought
   reconciliation. How then was it, that the Israelites despised the
   salvation offered to them? This was the madness which he now charges
   them with; for they preferred ruin to salvation, inasmuch as they
   returned not to God when he so kindly invited them, Seek me, and ye
   shall live The same thing is stated in another place, where it is said,
   that God seeketh not the death of a sinner, (Ezekiel 18:32)

   But as we have already said, the Prophets spoke thus in common to all
   the people, but their doctrine was not to all efficacious; for the Lord
   inwardly attracted his elect, and others were rendered inexcusable. But
   still this is true, that the whole blame, that they perished, were in
   the children of Israel, for they refused the salvation offered to them.
   What indeed was the cause of their destruction, but their own
   obstinacy? And the root of the evil, was it not in their own hearts?
   Then none of them could evade the charge made against them by the
   Prophet, -- that they were the authors of their own ruin, for each of
   them must have been conscious of his own perverseness.

   But Amos afterwards defines the character of true repentance, when he
   says, Seek not Bethel, go not to Gilgal, pass not over to Beersheba
   Some think that the Prophet here repudiates all the disguises, which
   are usually pretended by hypocrites. We indeed know that when God calls
   such men to himself, that they seek indirect and tortuous courses; for
   none of them return sincerely and willingly to God. Men indeed see that
   they are justly reproved for having departed from God: but when they
   are called back to him they take a circuitous course, as I have said,
   and not the straight road. Thus, though they pretend to seek God, they
   seek subterfuges that they may not present themselves to him. All this
   is no doubt true; but the Prophet advances farther; for he shows here,
   that the Israelites by going to Bethel not only lost all their labor,
   but also grievously offended God; for superstition was in itself
   condemnable. If Amos had preached at Jerusalem, he might have said, "Go
   not into the temple, for in vain ye offer sacrifices;" as indeed he
   does say hereafter, "Come not with your flock." For he there shows,
   that God is not to be pacified by ceremonies; nay, in that very
   chapter, he rejects feast-days and sacrifices; but in this place he
   ascends higher, and says that these two things are wholly contrary --
   to seek God, and to seek Bethel; as though he said, "If ye from the
   heart return to me, renounce all the superstitions to which you have
   been hitherto attached."

   It is indeed a proof of true conversion, when the sinner is displeased
   with himself on account of his sins and hates the things which before
   pleased him and with a changed mind devotes himself wholly to God. It
   is of this that the Prophet now treats; as though he said, "If there is
   in you a purpose to return to God, cast away all your superstitions;
   for these two things -- true religion and idolatry, cannot be joined
   together. As long then as ye remain fixed in that false worship, to
   which you have accustomed yourselves, ye continue alienated from God.
   Then reconciliation with him demands that you bid adieu to all your
   corrupt forms of worship." The import of the whole then is this, --
   that the Israelites could not be reconciled to God, except they
   departed from their superstitions. Let them turn away, he says, from
   Bethel, and Gilgal, and Beersheba

   We indeed know that the calves were made at Bethel; and Gilgal, no
   doubt, became celebrated for the passing of the people over Jordan, and
   also, as it is well known, for the circumcising of the children of
   Abraham; and as to Beersheba, we know that Abraham dwelt there for a
   long time, and frequently offered sacrifices to God. Now, this vicious
   zeal (kakozelia -- evil zeal or affectation) ever prevails in the
   world; without reason or judgment it lays hold on something special,
   when it undertakes to set up the worship of God, as we see to be the
   case under the Papacy. But God has prescribed to us a certain rule
   according to which he is to be worshipped; it is not then his will that
   there should be a mixture of our inventions. When therefore the
   posterity of Abraham presumptuously availed themselves of his example,
   and when they extolled the memorable event of the circumcision, God
   repudiated all contrivances of this kind; for as it was well known, it
   was expressly his will to be worshipped at Jerusalem; and by appointing
   one tabernacle and one altar, he designed to cherish unity and concord
   among the people. We now then understand that it was the intention of
   Amos to show, that the conversion of the people would be fictitious,
   until they turned away from all the superstitions and vicious modes of
   worship, in which they had habituated themselves: hence, Seek not
   Bethel, come not is Gilgal, pass not over to Beersheba.

   The same thing may be said at this day to those who wish to blend the
   dregs of the Papacy with the pure and holy worship of God; for there
   are at this day many go-betweens, (mediatores) who, while they see that
   our doctrine cannot be disapproved of, yet wish to contrive some middle
   course; that is, they wish to reconcile Popery with the doctrine of the
   Gospel. But the Prophet shows that such a mixture cannot be endured by
   God. How so? Because light cannot agree with darkness. Hence,
   corruptions, except they be abolished, will always subvert the true
   worship of God. We now see, that the lesson conveyed by this doctrine
   is, that the pure worship of God cannot be restored while the
   corruptions of the world, which are contrary to his word, prevail.

   Come not then to Gilgal, for by migrating it shall migrate There is an
   alliteration in the words of the Prophet, "Gilgal by rolling shall be
   rolled;" for Gilgal means rolling. Were such a phraseology allowable,
   it would be this, "Gilgal by gilling shall be gilled;" that is, it
   shall be rolled with quick rolling. God intimates that this place,
   under the protection of which the Israelites thought themselves safe,
   would be destroyed, as it had been already destined for destruction.
   Gilgal then be migrating shall migrate; not that the place could
   remove, but that it would be wholly demolished, so that nothing should
   remain there but dreadful tokens of God's vengeance.

   He then adds, Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live This repetition is not
   superfluous: the Prophet confirms what I have already stated, that such
   was the opposition between the true and legitimate worship of God, and
   idolatry and superstition, that the people of Israel, as long as they
   retained their corruptions, proved that they had nothing to do with
   God, whatever they may have pretended with their mouths and by their
   ceremonies. Seek God, he says, and ye shall live; and this repetition
   was very useful for this end, that hypocrites might know that they were
   justly condemned, inasmuch as they did not consecrate themselves wholly
   to God; for they were ever ready to contend with God whenever they
   could. "Why does God deal so strictly with us? why does he not concede
   to us at least something? for we do not deny him every thing. But if we
   do what we think to be right, why does he not indulge us at least on
   this account?" But when God not only urges hypocrites by his doctrine,
   but visits them also with punishments then they become angry, and even
   raise a clamor. Hence the Prophet, the second time, calls them to this
   duty, Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; as though he said, "Ye will gain
   nothing by evasion; for if any one seeks God truly and from the heart,
   God will not disappoint him; he will receive him into favor and will
   bless him. That ye then pine away in your calamities, impute this to
   your own obstinacy and stubbornness: it is so, because ye do not truly
   seek God; for while ye retain your corruptions, as I have said before,
   ye do not seek him."

   But he adds Lest he pass on like a fire. tslch, tselach, means to pass
   on, to advance; it means also to break out, and sometimes to prosper;
   but, in this place, the Prophet no doubt meant what I have said. Then
   it is, Lest he advance like fire upon the house of Joseph and consume
   it, and there be none to extinguish it in Bethel. The kind of vengeance
   which God threatened is not here expressed, but it may be easily
   understood. There is, therefore, in the meaning no obscurity; for he
   declares, that if the Israelites hardened their hearts against God, a
   burning was nigh at hand, which would seize on them, devour, and
   consume them. There shall come then or shall advance, a fire upon the
   house of Joseph; some say, shall burst out, which amounts to the same
   thing. By the house of Joseph is meant Ephraim; for he was, we know,
   the second son of Joseph; and, by taking a part for the whole, the
   Prophets usually include the ten tribes, as it is well known, when they
   mention Ephraim; and the kingdom of Israel is sometimes called the
   house of Joseph. Lest then he ascend as fire into the house of Joseph,
   and consume it, and there be none to extinguish it: this was said,
   because the Israelites never thought that they should be thus consumed
   by a sudden burning. The fire then shall devour the house of Joseph,
   and there will be none to quench it.

   In the verse before I omitted one thing, to which I shall now advert.
   The Prophet said, that Bethel would be for a trouble, or be nothing.
   Bethel, we know, is called in another place Bethaven, the house of
   iniquity; and Aven means in Hebrew sometimes iniquity, sometimes grief
   or trouble, sometimes labor or difficulty, and sometimes nothing. It is
   not to be taken for iniquity in this place; this is certain: but Amos,
   on the contrary, speaks of punishment, which awaited that place, since
   it was abominable in the sight of God. As then he had said of Gilgal,
   that it would be rolled; so now he says of Bethel, that it would be for
   a trouble or grief, or be nothing. Either senses would be appropriate;
   -- that Bethel, from which the Israelites hoped for a remedy to all
   their evils, would be to them a trouble, that is, the cause of their
   ruin, or that it would be nothing; as though he had said, that their
   hopes would be fallacious and empty in expecting any relief from
   Bethel. It afterwards follows --

   Amos 5:7

   7. Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the
   earth.

   7. Qui convertunt in absynthium judicium, et justitiam in terra
   dimittunt.


   Here the Prophet, after having inveighed against superstitions, comes
   to the second table of the law. The Prophets are sometimes wont to
   shake off self-complacencies from hypocrites, when they spread before
   God their external veils, by saying that all their ceremonies are
   useless, except accompanied with integrity of heart: but in this place
   the Prophet expressly condemns in the Israelites two things; that is,
   that they had corrupted the true worship of God, departed from the
   doctrine of the law, and polluted themselves with ungodly
   superstitions; and he also reprehends them for their wicked and
   dishonest conduct towards men, -- for their disregard of what was right
   and equitable, -- for plunder, cruelty, and fraud. This second subject
   the Prophet handles, when he says, that they converted judgment into
   wormwood and allowed righteousness to fall on the ground. But the rest
   I must defer till tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest us to be so entangled, not only
   by depraved lusts, but also by the allurements of Satan, and by our own
   ignorance and blindness, -- O grant, that being roused by thy word we
   may at the same time learn to open our eyes to thy wholesome warnings
   by which thou callest us to thyself: and since we cannot do this
   without thy Spirit being our guide and leader, grant that he may
   enlighten our eyes, to the end that, being truly and from the heart
   tarried to thee, we may know that thou art propitious and ready to hear
   all who unfeignedly seek thee, and that, being reconciled to thee in
   Christ, we may also know that thou art to us a propitious Father, and
   that thou wilt bestow on us all kinds of blessings, until thou at
   length gatherest us to thy celestial kingdom, through Christ our Lord.
   Amen.

   Lecture fifty-eighth

   Ye who convert judgment into wormwood, and leave righteousness on the
   ground. We stated yesterday why the Prophet added this sentence: he
   wished in every way to prove the Israelites guilty. Having inveighed
   against their superstitions, he now adds, that they acted also falsely
   and iniquitously towards men. And he attacks the chiefs who ruled the
   people, not because they were alone culpable, but because they drew
   with them the whole community. We know that diseases descend from the
   head to the whole body: and this is the reason why the Prophet directs
   his address especially to the rulers. He says that they turned judgment
   to wormwood. This similitude often occurs. Nothing, we know, is sweeter
   than justice, when every one gains his own right; for this serves much
   to preserve peace. Hence nothing can be more gratifying to us, than
   when uprightness and equity prevail. This is the reason why the Prophet
   calls that iniquitous state of things bitterness, when no regard is had
   for justice and rectitude. He says also that righteousness was cast
   down on the ground, or thrown to the ground. Now the judges ought to
   have defended what was right among the people: for this, we know, is
   the duty enjoined them: and the Prophet now lays this to their charge
   that they left justice on the ground -- that they suffered it to lie
   prostrate. We now perceive the Prophet's design. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:8

   8. Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the
   shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night:
   that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the
   face of the earth: The LORD is his name:

   8. Qui facit Pleiades et Orionem, qui convertit in lucem matutinam
   tenebras, et diem in noctem obtenebrescere facit: qui vocat aquas maris
   et effundit super superficiem terrae: Jehova nomen ejus.


   Some interpreters connect this verse with the former, and think that
   what the Prophet had said before is here explained; but they are
   greatly mistaken, and misrepresent the meaning of the Prophet. We have
   indeed said, that the Prophet shows in that verse that the Israelites
   were not only perfidious and covenant-breakers with regard to God,
   having fallen away from his pure worship, but that they also acted
   iniquitously and dishonestly towards men: but these interpreters think
   that God is, by a metaphor, called righteousness and that religion is
   called judgment. This is in no way the mind of the Prophet; nay, it is,
   as I have already said, wholly different.

   What, then, does the Prophet mean? I take this verse by itself; but yet
   we must see why the Prophet proclaims to us, in such sublime terms, the
   power of God. We know how heedlessly hypocrites trifle with Gods as
   though they had to do with a child: for they imagine a god according to
   their own fancy; yea, they transform him whenever they please, and
   think him to be delighted with frivolous trifles. Hence it is, that the
   way of pacifying God is with them so easy. When in various ways they
   provoke God's wrath, there is in readiness some little expiation, and
   they think that it is a satisfaction to God. As then hypocrites imagine
   that God is similar to a dead idol, this is the reason why the Prophet,
   in order to banish these delusions, shows that the nature of God is far
   different. "What sort of being," he says, "do you think God to be? for
   ye bring your worthless and frivolous expiations as though God would be
   satisfied with these trifles, as though he were a child or some silly
   woman: but God is He who makes the Pleiades and Orion, who turns
   darkness into morning, who changes day into night, who pours forth on
   the earth the waters of the sea [31] Go to now, and set forth your
   play-things, as though access to God were open to you, when ye labor to
   pacify him with your trifles." We now perceive the Prophet's object: we
   see how this verse ought to be taken separately, and yet to be
   connected with the main discourse of the Prophet; for after having
   inveighed against the gross vices of the people, seeing he had to
   contend with the headstrong, yea, with the mockers of God, he grows
   angry and sharply exclaims, "What do ye think or feign God to be?" Then
   the Prophet sets forth the character of God as being far different from
   what hypocrites imagine him to be in their own fancies. "What are your
   notions of him?" he says. "You indeed make God to be like a child; but
   he made the Pleiades and Orion."

   Some translate kymh, kime, Arcturus. There is no need of laboring much
   about such names; for the Jews, ignorant of the liberal sciences,
   cannot at this day certainly determine what stars are meant; and they
   show also their complete ignorance as to herbs. They are indeed bold
   enough; they define what every word means; but yet they betray, as I
   have said, their own want of knowledge. And our Prophet was a shepherd,
   and had never learnt astronomy in his youth, or in his manhood. He
   therefore speaks of the stars according to the common notions of his
   age: but he, no doubt, selected two stars of an opposite influence. The
   Pleiades (which are also called the seven Stars) are, we know, mild;
   for when they rise, they moderate the rigor of the cold, and also bring
   with them the vernal rain. But Orion is a fiercer star, and ever
   excites grievous and turbulent commotions both at its rising and
   setting. [32] This being the case, the Prophet names here those stars
   most commonly known. He says "Since the Lord changes the seasons, so
   that the mildness of the spring follows the rigor of winter, and since
   days succeed nights, and darkness comes after the light, and since it
   is God who renders a serene heaven suddenly cloudy by raising vapors
   from the veins of the earth, or from the sea, since all these changes
   manifest to us the wonderful power of God, how is it that men so
   presumptuously trifle with him? Whence is this so great a stupidity,
   unless they wholly overlook the works of God, and leave him a name
   only, and see not what is before their eyes?" We hence see how
   beautifully and how strikingly the Prophet does here set forth the
   power of God, and how opportunely he speaks of it. He then maketh the
   Pleiades and Orion

   And he adds, He changeth darkness into the morning, he maketh the day
   to grow dark into night Here he brings before us the various changes of
   times. The night turns not into day by chance, nor does darkness come
   over the earth by chance when the sun has ceased to shine. Since then
   this variety ought to awaken even the unwilling, and to constrain them
   to adore God, how is it that his majesty is treated by men with such
   mockery, that they bring their frivolous expiations, and think him to
   be no more angry with them when they present to him what is worthless
   and childish, as when a nurse by a pleasing sound soothes an infant? I
   say again, whence is this so great a stupor, except that men willfully
   close their eyes to so bright a display, by which God shows himself to
   us, that he might constrain us all to adore his name? We now see why
   the Prophet describes the various changes which daily take place.

   He speaks also of the waters of the sea, Who calleth, he says, the
   waters of the sea, and poureth them on the surface of the earth Some
   explain this of fountains; for they think that all waters proceed from
   the sea, and that fountains are nothing else but as it were the eyes of
   the sea: but this passage ought rather to be viewed as referring to
   rains; for the power of God is not so conspicuous in the waters which
   come from the earth, as when he suddenly darkens the heavens with
   vapors. For whence is it, that the heavens, a while ago clear, is now
   cloudy? We see clouds rising, -- but at whose command? Philosophers
   indeed assign some natural causes; they say that vapors are drawn up
   both from the earth and the sea by the heat of the sun: but why is this
   done to-day rather than yesterday? Whence is this diversity, except
   that God shows that the element of water is under his control, and also
   the air itself, as veil as the vapors, which are formed as it were out
   of nothing? For what is vapor but gross air, or air condensed? and yet
   vapors arise from the hollow places of the earth as well as from the
   sea. Certainly the water could not of itself produce a new element: it
   is ponderous, and vapors rise up on high: how is it that water thus
   loses its own nature? But vapors are in a middle state between air and
   water, and yet they ascend above the air, and arise from the earth to
   the heavens. The Prophet therefore does not without reason say, that
   waters are called, that is, that these vapors are called, from the sea,
   and are afterwards poured on the surface of the earth. This may be
   understood of the clouds as well as of rain; for clouds extend over the
   earth and surround us; and rain is poured on the earth. This is
   doubtless the wonderful work of God.

   Hence the Prophet concludes, Jehovah is his name It is not the idol
   which you have devised for yourselves; for your expiations might indeed
   draw a smile from a child but they cannot satisfy the judgment of God.
   Then think that you have to do with God himself, and let these
   fallacious delusions deceive you no longer." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] The verse, as evidently understood by Calvin, is to be thus
   rendered -- "He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
   Who turns darkness into morning,
   And darkens the day to night,
   Who calls the waters of the sea,
   And pours them on the face of the earth, --
   Jehovah is his name." This is the rendering of the Septuagint. It is
   not consonant with the character of Hebrew to borrow a word, as it is
   done in our version, from a preceding verse. Newcome has prefixed the
   words, "That have forsaken;" on what authority it does not appear. The
   obvious construction of the passage given above. -- Ed.

   [32] Commentators are not agreed as to the meaning of the words
   rendered here, Pleiades and Orion, kymh, and ksyl. They are found only
   in two other places, Job 9:9, and Job 38:31; and in the first of these
   in conjunction with s, in our version, Arcturus, and also in the second
   with mzrvt, Mazzaroth. Most think that all these were names given by
   the Hebrews to certain stars or constellations. It is evident, that
   with the exception of the last, Mazzaroth, the words, Pleiades, etc.,
   are names borrowed from the Greek poets, and first introduced by the
   translators of the Septuagint: but they observe no consistency; for in
   Job 9:9, they render kymh, Arktouros, and in Job 38:31; pleias and in
   Amos the sentence is paraphrased and the word is left out. Again, ksyl
   is rendered hesperos, the evening star, in Job 9:9 and Orionos in Job
   38:31 while s is translated hesperos, and in Job 9:9, pleias. This
   confusion proves that the translators exercised no discrimination. The
   Vulgate exhibits a similar inconsistency. Parkhurst's view is the most
   satisfactory, and corresponds with the terms used in connection with
   the words in Job 38:31, and with the context here. The genial heat,
   according to him, is kymh, and the cold is ksyl. The passage in Job is,
   "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, kymh, or loose the
   bands of Orion? ksyl;" which influences mdnvt, the delights, the
   pleasures, the delicacies) of the genial heat, ,kymhor open
   contradictions of the cold? ksyl In the present passage what things God
   is continually doing are referred to, and not his past works, which
   would be the case where the constellations intended. Then the first
   line would run this: -- He who makes the genial heat and the cold. Thus
   the whole passage would agree well together, as relating the various
   acts of God as the supreme agent in the material world. -- Ed.

   Amos 5:9

   9. That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
   spoiled shall come against the fortress.

   9. Qui fortificat vastatorem super robustum, et vastator super
   munitiones ascendet. [33]


   The Prophet speaks not now of the ordinary works of God, in which his
   majesty, inspiring the highest reverence, as well as his dread power,
   shines forth; but he more closely urges the Israelites, who had become
   so hardened in their vices, that they were wholly inflexible. Here then
   the Prophet charges them with contumacy and says, "What, think you,
   will take place? Ye are strong; but God will stir up robbers against
   you, who will prevail, and beat down and chatter in pieces that
   obduracy, through which you now resist God." Thus after having filled
   them with dread by setting before them the course of nature, he now
   holds forth this threats that they would themselves have to feel the
   power of God: for however callous they were, and though in their
   ferocity they dared to rise up against God, he declares that it would
   avail them nothing; inasmuch as there was in God's hand a waster, who
   would prevail against their obduracy.

   And a waster, he says, shall ascend on the very fortresses, or shall
   enter the fortresses. The Prophet here, in an indirect way, laughs to
   scorn the vain confidence which filled the Israelites, on observing
   that they were inclosed in fortified cities and had defenses and a
   powerful army. All this, he says, will be wholly useless to them when
   God will raise up strong depredators, who will penetrate through well
   fortified gates, and leap over walls, and enter strongly defended
   cities. We now apprehend what the Prophet had in view in these words.

   It will now be easy to apply this doctrine to our own instruction:
   Whenever we are not suitably moved, either by the truth, or by
   warnings, or by threatenings, let this come to our minds which the
   Prophet teaches here, namely, that God cannot be mocked, and that
   hypocrites gain nothing by their delusive ceremonies, when they
   sacrifice and present their expiations, which by no means please God,
   -- how so? We may indeed easily learn the reason from the nature of God
   himself. Hence, that we may not transform God, let us learn to raise up
   our eyes to behold him, and also to look on all things around us; and
   this will constrain us to adore and fear his great power. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] This version differs widely from ours, but is no doubt nearer the
   meaning of the original. Newcome's translation is as follows -- Who
   scattereth desolation over the strong,
   And bringeth desolation over the fortress. What comes nearest the
   original is the rendering proposed by Parkhurst, and is striking and
   poetical: the first line is this -- Who causeth the waster to laugh at
   strength. The verb here used means primarily to laugh or to smile, and
   in a secondary sense, to be refreshed or made cheerful, or to be
   comforted. It is here in Hiphil, the causative mood. The whole verse
   may be thus rendered: -- Who causeth the waster to laugh at strength;
   And a waster on the fortress he will bring. -- Ed.

   Amos 5:10

   10. They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
   speaketh uprightly.

   10. Oderunt (odio habent) in porta corripientem, et loquentem rectum
   abominantur.


   It is probable that in this verse also, the judges are reproved by the
   Prophet, though what is here said may be extended to the whole people:
   but as nearly the whole discourse is leveled against the judges, I
   readily subscribe to the opinion, that the Prophet now accuses the
   judges on this account, -- because they could not bear to be reproved
   for the great license they allowed themselves, but, on the contrary,
   abhorred all those who reproved them. What then he says as to the
   reprover being hated in the gate, is to be thus explained: When judges
   sat in the gate and perverted justice and right, and when any one
   reminded them of their duty, they haughtily rejected all admonitions,
   and even hated them. In the gate then, that is, They who ought to rule
   others, and to correct whatever vice there may be among the people,
   cannot themselves bear any reprover, when their own vices require
   strong remedies.

   And well would it be, if this disease were healed at this day. We
   indeed see that kings, and those in authority, wish to be deemed
   sacred, and they will allow no reproof. Instantly the majesty of God is
   violated in their person; for they complain and cry out, whenever
   teachers and God's servants dare to denude their wicked conduct. This
   vice then, which the Prophet condemns, is not the vice of one time;
   for, even in the present day, those who occupy the seats of judgment
   wish to be exempt from all reproofs, and would claim for themselves a
   free liberty in sinning, inasmuch as they think not that they belong to
   the common class of men, and imagine themselves exempt from all
   reprehension; in short, they wish to rule without any equity, for power
   with them is nothing but unbridled licentiousness. We now understand
   the Prophet's meaning. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:11

   11. Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take
   from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye
   shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye
   shall not drink wine of them.

   11. Quia calcastis pauperem (vel, onus imposuistis,) et onus frumenti
   abstulistis ab eo, domos excisionis (hoc est, ex lapide quadrato)
   aedificabitis, et non habitabitis in illis; vineas desiderabiles
   plantabitis, et non bibetis vinum earum.


   The Prophet here declares, that though the judges enriched themselves
   by plunder, yet God would not allow them to enjoy their booty, but that
   he would deprive them of the great wealth they had accumulated. This is
   the import of the whole. We hence see that the Prophet contends not
   here with the common people, but professedly attacks the chief men,
   inasmuch as from them did proceed all the prevailing evil.

   The first thing is, they imposed burdens on the poor, and then, they
   took away corn from them He says first, "A burden have you laid", or,
   "ye have trodden on the poor;" for the verb may be taken in either
   sense, and it matters not which as to the import of the passage. It is
   not indeed often that we meet with a verb of four letters; [34] but
   interpreters explain this as meaning to tread under foot or to lay a
   burden. The Prophet, I doubt not, accuses here the judges of not
   sparing miserable men, but of burdening them with tributes and
   exactions; for this is to burden the poor. Then he adds, "Ye have taken
   a load of corn". The Prophet had doubtless fixed here on a species of
   cruelty in robbing others, the most detestable. When judges take money,
   or any other gift, it is less odious than when the poor are compelled
   to carry corn to them on their shoulders. It was the same as though
   they surrendered their very life to their plunderers; for when judges
   constrained loads of corn to be brought to them, it was as though they
   strangled the poor, or drew blood from their veins, inasmuch as they
   robbed them of their food and support. We now perceive what the Prophet
   meant: You have, he says, oppressed the poor, and taken from them a
   load of corn. Some render vr, ber, chosen, but improperly.

   Ye shall therefore build, etc. He declares here that they would not
   realize their hope, though they plundered on all sides to build
   palaces, and though they got great possessions to enrich themselves and
   their heirs: "This self-love," he says, "will deceive you; defraud,
   rob, plunder; but the Lord will at length strip you of all your
   robberies: for after having been venal, and prostituted not only your
   souls but your shame for gain, and after having spent much labor and
   expense in building, ye shall not dwell in your palaces; and when ye
   shall have planted vineyards with great expense and care, ye shall not
   drink their wine." Isaiah also speaks in the same strain,

   O plunderer, thou shalt be exposed to plunders'
   (Isaiah 33:1)

   Experience also teaches the same thing; for we see how the Lord
   transfers from one to another the possessions of this world: he who
   seems to provide riches after his death for his heirs for ever, passes
   his whole life, as we see, without enjoying his own property; for he is
   hungry in the midst of the greatest abundance, and even famishes
   himself. This is very frequently the case. And then when his abundance
   comes to his heirs, it falls into the hands of prodigals, who soon
   dissipate the whole. And sometimes the Lord allows not that such vast
   wealth should have heirs, and it is scattered here and there, and the
   very name is extinguished, though the name to such haughty and wealthy
   men is a great object, as they commonly wish it to be eminent in the
   world for some hundred ages after their death.

   This passage of the Prophet ought therefore to be especially noticed.
   He tells us that unjust gains were laid up by these robbers and wicked
   plunderers, in order to amass great riches; but he adds, "The Lord will
   spoil them, and will not suffer them to enjoy their abundance, however
   anxiously they had collected it from all quarters." Let us now proceed
   --

   [34] The verb is vvsskm, from vvsm but in ten MSS. Of Kennicott, and in
   five of D'Rossi, the v is left out: and then s is supposed to be put
   for s, as Amos in another place, Amos 7:14, puts s for s. The verb vs,
   and in its reduplicate form vss, occurs in other places, and means to
   tread or trample under foot. The expression here literally is, "your
   trampling;" but such a form may often be expressed in our language, "ye
   trample." The connection of the whole verse will be better seen by the
   following version: -- Therefore, as ye trample on the poor,
   And tribute of corn extort from him, --
   Houses of hewn stone you may build,
   But ye shall not dwell in them;
   Vineyards of delight ye may plant,
   But ye shall not drink their wine. -- Ed.

   Amos 5:12

   12. For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they
   afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in
   the gate from their right

   12. Quia cognosco magnas iniquitates vestras (vel, multas, rvym) et
   robusta scelera vestra; efflictores justi, sublatores redemptionis, et
   pauperes in porta declinare faciunt (hoc est, causa cadere faciunt.)


   The Prophet introduces God here as the speaker, that the threatening
   might be more authoritative: for we know, at it has been before stated,
   that the Prophets were despised by haughty men; but when God himself
   appeared as it were before them, it was strange if no fear laid hold on
   them; they had at least no excuse for their presumption, if God's name
   did not touch their hearts and humble them.

   I know, he says, your iniquities; as though he said, "Ye do not think
   yourselves bound to render an account to men, as probably no such
   account; will be rendered by you; but how will you be able, think you,
   to escape my tribunal? for I am your judge, and mine is the government:
   however ferociously ye now tread on the poor, and evasively contend
   with me, your crimes must necessarily be judged by me; I know your
   crimes. And as the rich by their splendor covered every wickedness,
   particularly the magistrates, who were adorned with a public character,
   God says that their turpitude was fully known to him: as though he said
   "Contend as much as you please, still your iniquities are sufficiently
   apparent to me; ye will gain nothing by your subtle evasions."
   Moreover, he reprehends them not merely for slight offenses, but says
   that they were wholly past being borne with. When something is done
   amiss by the highest power, indulgence is commonly granted; for nothing
   is more difficult than for one who sustains so great and heavy a
   burden, to retain so much integrity as to be free from every blame: but
   the Lord shows here that they were not lightly culpable, but that their
   crimes were so grievous and flagrant that they could not be endured. We
   now then understand what was the object of the Prophet.

   When therefore their own greatness dazzles the eyes of proud men, let
   us know that they cannot deprive God of his right; for though he may
   not judge them to-day, he will yet shortly ascend his tribunal: and he
   reminds them, that those pompous displays by which they cover their
   many crimes, are only shadows which will vanish. This is what the
   Prophet means.

   Then he calls them, The oppressors of the just He enumerates here some
   particulars, with regard to which, the iniquity of the judges whom he
   now addresses might be, as it were, felt to be gross and abominable. Ye
   oppress he says, the just; this was one thing: then follows another,
   They take kphr, capher, expiation, or, the price of redemption. The
   Prophet, I have no doubt, meant to point out here something different
   from the former crime. Though interpreters blend these two things, I
   yet think them to be wholly different; for these mercenary judges made
   an agreement with the wicked, whenever any homicide or other violence
   was perpetrated; in short, whenever any one implicated himself in any
   grievous sin, they saw that there was a prey taken, and anxiously gaped
   for it: they wished murders to be committed daily, that they might
   acquire gain. Since, then, these judges were thus intent on bribery,
   the Prophet accuses them as being takers of ransom. They ought to have
   punished crimes; this they did not; but they let go the wicked
   unpunished; they spared murderers, and adulterers, and robbers, and
   sorcerers not indeed without rewards, for they brought the price of
   redemption, and departed as if they were innocent.

   We now perceive what the Prophet means here; and well would it be were
   this crime not so common: but at this day, the cruelty of many judges
   appears especially in this -- that they hunt for crimes for the sake of
   gain, which seems to be as it were a ransom; for this is the proper
   meaning of the word kphr, capher. As then this evil commonly prevails
   it is no wonder that the Prophet, while reprehending the corruptions of
   his time, says, that judges took a ransom.

   Then he adds, The poor they turn aside from judgment in the gate This
   is the third crime: the Prophet complains, that they deprived miserable
   men of their right, because they could not bring so large a bribe as
   the rich; though relying on the goodness of their cause, they thought
   themselves sure of victory. The Prophet complains, that they were
   disappointed of their hope, and their right was denied them in the
   gate, that is, in the court of justice; for we know that it was an
   ancient custom for judges to sit in the gates, and there to administer
   justice; And hence Amos mentions here gate twice: and what he complains
   of was the more disgraceful, inasmuch as the judicial court was, as it
   were, a sacred asylum, to which injured men resorted, that they might
   have their wrongs redressed. When this became the den of robbers, what
   any more remained for them? We now then see that the Prophet speaks not
   here of the common people, but that he mainly levels his reproofs
   against the rulers. Let us go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:13

   13. Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an
   evil time.

   13. Propterea prudens in tempore hoc silebit, quia tempus hoc malum
   est. [35]


   Some interpreters think that a punishment is here denounced on the
   people of Israel, and that is, that the Lord would deprive them of
   Prophets and teachers. We indeed know that nothing is more to be
   dreaded, than that the Lord should extinguish the light of sound
   doctrine, and suffer us to go astray in darkness, yea, to stumble, and
   to rush headlong to ruin, as they do who are destitute of wholesome
   counsels. But I think that the meaning is quite different. Another
   exposition may be deemed probable, which is this, that the prudent
   dared not to speak on account of the prevailing tyranny; for Amos had
   said before that the judges, who then ruled, would not bear reproof.
   Hence, the prudent were forced to be silent at that time, for that time
   was evil; and every liberty of teaching was taken away. And this
   meaning opens still wider; for the silent would have to bear the wrongs
   done to them, and to devour inwardly their own groans, for they dared
   not to complain; nay, the very teachers did not oppose the torrent, for
   they saw that it was not the time to resist haughty and violent men.
   But this view may be also fitly applied to God's judgment, that the
   prudent would be silent, being put in fear: for silence is often
   connected with fear: and it is a dreadful judgment of God, when the
   prudent closes his mouth, or puts his hand, as it is said elsewhere, on
   his mouth.

   As to the first exposition, I have already rejected it, and it has
   certainly nothing in its favor: but the second may be accommodated to
   the general meaning of the Prophet, that is, the prudent shall be
   silent at that time, because all liberty shall be taken away. I am, at
   the same time, unwilling thus to restrict it, as they do; for it became
   not a wise man to pass by in silence sins so grievous: though tyrants
   threatened hundred deaths, yet those on whom was laid the necessity of
   teaching ought not to have been silent. But the Prophet here speaks not
   of what the prudent would do or omit to do; on the contrary, he
   intimates, that whenever they began to speak, the arrogance of the
   judges would be so great as to repel all reproofs. The prudent then
   shall be silent, not willingly; for that, as I have said, would have
   been unworthy of wise men. And the Prophet here, by way of honor, calls
   those prudent who rightly discern things, who are not led away by
   corruptions, but remain upright; who, though they see the whole order
   of things collapsing, and though they see heaven and earth, as it were,
   mingled together, yet retain a sound judgment. Since the Prophet speaks
   of such men, he certainly does not mean that they would be willingly
   silent; for it would have been a base indolence in them thus to betray
   the truth and a good cause. What then does he mean? Even this -- that
   the wickedness of tyrants would be so great, as not to allow one word
   to be declared by the prudent; when any one came forth to reprove their
   vices, he was not suffered.

   When therefore he says, that the time would be evil, he means, that
   such audacity would prevail, that all liberty would be denied to wise
   men. They would then be forced to be silent, for they could effect
   nothing by speaking, nay, they would have no freedom of speech allowed
   them: and though they attempted to discharge their office, yet
   tyrannical violence would instantly impose silence on them. Similar was
   the case with Lot, of whom it is said that he groaned and vexed his own
   heart, (Genesis 16:1) He was constrained, I have no doubt, to be silent
   after having often used free reproofs; nay, he doubtless exposed
   himself to many dangers by his attempts to reprove the Sodomites. Such
   seems to me to be the meaning of the Prophet, when he says, that the
   prudent would be silent, because these tyrants would impose silence on
   all teachers, -- now throwing them into prisons, then banishing them,
   -- now denouncing death on them, then visiting them with some
   punishment, or loading them with reproaches, or treating them with
   ridicule as persons worthy of contempt. We now understand the
   Prophet's, design. We may further observe, that men have then advanced
   to the extremity of evil, when reception is no more given to sound
   doctrine and salutary counsels, and when all liberty is sternly
   suppressed, so that prudent men dare not to reprove vices, however
   rampant they may be, which even children observe, and the blind feel.
   When licentiousness has arrived to this pitch, it is certain that the
   state of things is past recovery and that there is no hope of
   repentance or of a better condition: and this was the meaning of the
   Prophet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] This verse literally rendered from the Hebrew is as follows: --
   Therefore, the prudent at that time will be silent;
   For a time of evil will that be. It is a rule, which may be viewed as
   nearly if not wholly, universal, that the substantive verb, to be,
   whenever understood and not expressed in the original, is to be
   rendered in the same tense with the other verbs in the sentence. So
   here, "A time of evil will that be," and not, "is;" for the previous
   verb is in the future tense. There are many instances of the neglect of
   this rule in our version, as in Psalm 23:4, "I will fear no evil: for
   thou art with me;" it ought to be, "for thou wilt be with me." And then
   the line which follows ought be rendered in the same way, for the verb
   is in the future tense, -- "Thy rod and thy staff, they will comfort
   me." -- Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we cannot see with our eyes thy infinite
   and incomprehensible glory, which is hid from us, we may learn at least
   by thy works, what thy great power is, so as to be humbled under thy
   mighty hand, and never trifle with thee as hypocrites are wont to do;
   but to bring a heart really sincere, and also pure hands, that our
   whole life may testify that a true fear of thy name prevails, in our
   hearts: and grant, that whilst we devote ourselves wholly to thy
   service, we may courageously and with invincible hearts, fight against
   all these corruptions, by which we are on every side beset, until,
   having finished our warfare, we attain to that celestial rest, which
   has been prepared for us by Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Fifty-ninth
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:14

   14. Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God
   of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

   14. Quaerite bonum et non malum, ut vivatis; et erit hoc modo Jehova,
   Deus exercituum, vobiscum, quemadmodum dixistis.


   The Prophet again repeats, that it was only owing to the Israelites
   themselves that it was not well with them; for God was ready to grant
   them his blessing; but they designedly sought a curse for themselves.
   Inasmuch, then, the hypocrites are wont to put away from themselves the
   blame of every evil, and to complain of their miseries, as though the
   Lord afflicted them unjustly, the Prophet here shows, that no evil
   happened to the Israelites, but what they procured by their vices: and
   at the same time he exhorts them to repentance, and gives them the hope
   of pardon, provided they hardened not their hearts to the last. He
   therefore bids them to seek good; but by adding, seek not evil, his
   words are full of meaning, as though he had said, that they were so
   fixed in their own wickedness, that they could not be torn away from
   it. The import of the whole, then, is this -- that the Israelites could
   not complain of being too severely treated by God, because they
   suffered not themselves to be kindly dealt with. And the Prophet
   assigns this as the reason -- that they were not only alienated from
   what was good, but that they also with avidity and eager desire
   followed what was evil: in the meantime he exhorts them to repentance
   and adds a promise the more to encourage them.

   Seek then good, he says, that ye may live; And then he adds, And thus
   God will be with you, as ye have said. Here the wickedness of the
   people is reproved who sought to bind God to themselves; for hypocrites
   are wont to misapply the promises: when they presumptuously reject God
   himself, they still wish him to be under an obligation to them. Thus
   they gloried that they were the children of Abraham, an elect people;
   circumcision was to them like a royal diadem; they sought to be
   superior to all other nations: and thus they abused the name of God,
   and at the same time they petulantly scorned both the word of God and
   his Prophets. As, then, they ever boasted that God was dwelling in the
   midst of them, the Prophet says, "Then and thus will God be with you if
   ye seek what is good or the doing of good;" for to seek good is nothing
   else than to endeavor to do good; as though he said "Change your nature
   and your manners; for hitherto iniquity has prevailed among you; you
   have been violent, and rapacious, and fraudulent: begin now to do good,
   then God will be with you."

   There is therefore a great emphasis to be laid on the particle kn, can,
   thus will God be with you: for the Prophet reminds them of what so
   often occurs in the law, "Be ye holy, for I am holy," who dwell in the
   midst of you, (Leviticus 11:44) God shows, in these words, that it
   could not be that he would dwell with the Israelites except they
   sanctified themselves, that there might be a mutual agreement. But they
   had no regard for holiness, and yet wished God to be bound to them.
   This false confidence the Prophet derides, and says, that a certain
   condition is fixed in the law, according to which God would dwell in
   the midst of them. Thus then will God be in the midst of you; that is,
   when he sees that you strive after uprightness and the doing of good.

   I have already explained what this means, as ye have said; for he
   proves that foolish vaunting to be false which was heard among the
   Israelites: "Has not the Lord chosen and adopted us as his people? Is
   not the ark of the covenant a sure pledge of his presence? How then
   could he depart from us? God would deny himself, were he not to keep
   his pledged faith; for he covenanted with our fathers, that we should
   be his flock even to the end of the world." Since, then, they thus
   foolishly boasted, and were, at the same time, covenant breakers, the
   Prophet says, "Ye boast, indeed, by your mouth that God is in the midst
   of you, but see what he in his turn stipulates and requires from you.
   If, then, ye respond to his call, he will not surely be wanting to his
   pledged faith; but as ye willfully depart from him, he must necessarily
   become alienated from you." We now then perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet in these words. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:15

   15. Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the
   gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the
   remnant of Joseph.

   15. Odio habete malum et dilligite bonum; et statuite in porta
   judicium, si forte misereatur Jehova Deus exercituum reliquiarum
   Joseph.


   The Prophet inculcates the same truth; and he did this designedly; for
   he saw that nothing was more difficult than to bring this people to
   repentance, who, in the first place, were by nature refractory; and, in
   the second place, were hardened by long habit in their vices. For Satan
   gains dominion by degrees in the hearts of men, until he renders them
   wholly stupid so that they discern not between right and wrong. Such,
   then, was the blindness which prevailed among the people of Israel: it
   was therefore necessary often to goad them as Amos does here.

   Hence he bids them to hate evil and to love good. And this order ought
   to be preserved, when we desire really to turn to God and to repent.
   Amos here addresses perverse men, who were so immersed in their own
   wickedness, that they distinguished no longer between light and
   darkness: it was therefore not without reason that he begins with this
   sentence, that they should hate evil; as though he had said, that there
   had been hitherto a hostile disagreement between them and God, and that
   therefore a change was necessary, in order that they might return to
   him. For when any one has already wished to devote himself to God's
   service, this exhortation to hate evil is superfluous: but when one is
   sunk still in his own vices, he has need of such a stimulant. The
   Prophet therefore does here reprove them; and though they flattered
   themselves, he yet shows that they were greatly addicted to their
   vices.

   He afterwards adds, Love good. He intimates, that it would be a new
   thing for them to cultivate benevolence, and to apply themselves to
   what was right. The import of the whole is this, -- that the Israelites
   would have no peace with God, until they were wholly changed and became
   new men; for they were now strangers to goodness, and given to
   wickedness and depravity. But Amos mentions here only a part of
   repentance: for tvv, thub, no doubt means the doing of good, as
   iniquity is properly called r, ro [the doing of evil.] He speaks not
   here of faith, or of prayer to God, but describes repentance by its
   fruits; for our faith, as it has been stated in other places, is proved
   in this way; it manifests itself, when sincerity and uprightness
   towards one another flourish in us, when we spontaneously love one
   another and perform the duties of love. Thus then by stating a part for
   the whole, is repentance here described; that is, the whole, as they
   commonly say, is shown by a part.

   But now the Prophet adds, And set up judgment in the gate He here
   glances at the public state of things, of which we have largely spoken
   in our yesterday's lecture. A deluge of iniquity had so inundated the
   land, that in the very courts of justice, and in the passing of
   judgments, there was no longer any equity, any justice. Since then
   corruption had taken possession of the very gates, the Prophet exhorts
   them to set up judgment in the gate; it may be, he says, that God will
   show mercy to the remnants of Joseph. The Prophet shows here that it
   was hardly possible that the people should continue safe; nay, that
   this was altogether hopeless. But as the common degeneracy, like a
   violent tempest, carried away the good along with it, the Prophet here
   admonishes the faithful not to despond, though they were few in number,
   but to retake themselves to God, to suffer others to fall away and to
   run headlong to ruin, and at the same time to provide for their own
   safety, as those who flee away from the burning.

   We now then understand the object of the Prophet: for when the whole
   multitude, given up to destruction, had laid aside every care for their
   safety, a few remained, who yet suffered themselves to be borne along,
   as though a tempest, as it has been said, had carried them away. The
   Prophet then does here give comfort to such good men as were still
   alive, and shows that though the people were sinking, there was no
   reason for them to despair, for the Lord still promised to be
   propitious to them. What this doctrine teaches is this, -- that ten
   ought not to regard what a thousand may do; but they ought to hear God
   speaking, rather than to abandon themselves with the multitude; when
   they see men blindly and impetuously running headlong to their own
   ruin, they should not follow them, but rather listen to God, and not
   reject his offered salvation. However much then their small number may
   dishearten them, they ought not yet to suffer God's promises to be
   forced or snatched away from them, but fully to embrace them.

   The expression, it may be, is not one of doubt, as it has been stated
   in another place, (Joel 2:1) but the Prophet, on the contrary, intended
   sharply to stimulate the faithful, that he might, as it was needful,
   increase their alacrity. Whenever then phn, pen, lest perhaps or 'vly,
   auli, it may be, is set down, let us know, that they are not intended
   to leave men's minds in suspense or perplexity, that they may despond
   or come to God in doubt; but that a difficulty is thereby implied, in
   order to stir them up and to increase the ardor of their desire: and
   this is necessary in a mixed state of things, for we see how great is
   the indolence of our flesh. Even they who desire to return to God, do
   not hasten with that ardor which becomes them, but creep slowly, and
   hardly draw themselves along; and then when many obstacles meet them,
   they who would have been otherwise full of courage, almost despair at
   every step. It is therefore necessary to apply such goadings as these,
   "Take heed; for when any one is beset on every side by fire, he will
   not long delay, nor think with himself how he may escape without any
   hurt and without any inconvenience; but he will risk danger rather than
   that he should by delay or tardiness deprive himself of a way of
   escape. So also ye see, that iniquity surrounds you on every side; what
   then is to be done except that each of you must quickly flee away?"

   We now then perceive the design of the Prophet in saying, It may be
   that he will show mercy. The sum of the whole is this, -- That there
   was need of a great change, that they might become altogether new men,
   who had hitherto devoted themselves to wickedness, -- and then, that
   the few should not wait until the whole multitude joined them; for
   though the people resolved to go astray, yet God ought to have been
   attended to, when recalling the few to himself and bidding them to
   escape, as it were, from the burning, -- and, thirdly, that there is
   stated here a difficulty, that those still healable might not come
   tardily to God, but that they might strive against impediments and
   quickly run to him seeing that they could not without great effort
   extricate themselves; they were therefore to come to God, not slowly;
   but having overcome all difficulties, they were on the contrary, to
   flee to him. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:16

   16. Therefore the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing
   shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas!
   alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are
   skilful of lamentation to wailing.

   16. Quapropter dicit Jehova Deus exercituum, Dominus, In omnibus
   compitis lamentum, et in omnibus viis dicent, Vae, vae; et vocabunt
   agricolam ad luctum, et lamentum erit super omnes peritos luctus.


   The particle of inference, set down here, confirms what has been
   already said, -- that the Israelites vainly flattered themselves,
   though they were in the worst condition. And as the Prophet knew that
   there would be no end to their evasions, being, as they were, perverse
   hypocrites, he cuts off all their subterfuges by saying, that God had
   now announced his purpose concerning them, and that however they might
   object this or that, God's judgment could no longer be deferred by
   delay, for their iniquity was more than sufficiently proved.

   Therefore Jehovah, he says, God of hosts, the Lord, saith. He again
   repeats the attributes of God, in order to set forth his supreme power;
   as though he had said, that the Israelites gained nothing by acting the
   part of sophisters with God; for that he is the supreme judge, against
   whom there is no appeal, and whose sentence cannot be revoked. Hence we
   see that what is here checked is that waywardness which deceived the
   Israelites, while they continued to clamor against God. Thus then saith
   Jehovah; this was said, that they might understand that they were
   depraved in their disposition, corrupt in morals, wholly given to
   wickedness, and without a particle of goodness in them.

   Thus then saith God, In all the streets of concourse there shall be
   lamentation, and in all the highways they shall say, Woe! Woe! [36] The
   Prophet disputes not here with them, nor denounces their vices, but
   speaks only of punishment; as though he had said, that the litigation
   was decided, that there was no need of an accuser; for nothing now
   remained but that God should execute his vengeance on them, inasmuch as
   he had already contended more than enough with them. And this mode of
   teaching frequently occurs in the Prophets; and it ought to be
   observed, that we may not think that we can gain anything by our
   evasions, when the Lord regards us as guilty. Let us then dread the
   punishment, which is prepared for all the intractable and the
   obstinate. They shall say, he says, in all the highways, Woe! Woe! They
   now prattle and think to prevail by their loquacity: when they murmur
   against God, they think that a delay is thus attained, that he dares
   not to inflict punishment; but God nevertheless proceeds with his
   judgment; they shall cry, Woe! Woe! there will be no time then for
   devising shifts, but they will be wholly taken up with wailing.

   They shall call, he says, the husbandman to mourning Some think 'kr,
   acar, derived from nkr, nucar, which is to own, or, to make, one's self
   a stranger: and they are induced to regard it so only for this reason,
   because the Prophet immediately mentions those who were skillful in
   mourning. But, as all the Hebrews agree as to the meaning of this word,
   I am unwilling, without authority to make any change: and it also
   harmonizes well with what the Prophet says. At the same time, those
   Hebrew interpreters are wrong, who think that the order is inverted, as
   though it ought to have been thus, "The skillful in lamentation shall
   call husband men to mourning." But the Prophet, I doubt not, meant,
   that all were to be led together to mourning; for, though the manner
   was different, yet, in the first place, he appoints mourning to
   husbandmen, and then he shows that it would be common to all those who
   were wont to mourn.

   Let us then consider what the Prophet says, Lamentation to all the
   skillful in mourning. Eastern nations we know, exercised themselves in
   acting grief, and so they do at this day. We find, indeed, that they
   practiced all manner of gesticulations: a greater moderation at least
   is seen among us, however heavy the grief may be. And this custom in
   former times came also into Europe; for we know that there were women
   hired to mourn at Rome; and we know that there were everywhere those
   who lamented. They therefore mourned for wages. This vicious custom the
   Prophet notices: but it is not discussed here whether this was done
   rightly or foolishly: for the Prophet here only refers to a common
   custom; There will be lamentations' he says, to all the skillful in
   mourning;' that is, all who are wont to employ their labor in weeping
   will now be fully occupied. This is the first, though the last in
   order, at least it is the middle between two other clauses. Now, the
   two others follow, which are these, -- that the very husbandmen would
   be led to mourning, -- and then that there would be lamentation in all
   the highways. But why does the Prophet say, that all the skillful in
   mourning were to be occupied in lamentation? Because the common
   calamity would thus constrain them. He further adds, that this grief
   would not be feigned; but that as destruction would prevail through the
   cities and fields none would be exempt. However much the husbandmen
   were unaccustomed to such rites, they would yet wail and learn this new
   art, says the Prophet. We now then see what these words mean: but the
   next verse must be joined to them --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] Henderson gives a better rendering of these two lines, -- In all
   the broad places there shall be wailing,
   And in all the streets, they shall say, Oh! Oh! rchvvt, from rchv, to
   be dilated, and to be made broad or wide, mean broad places or broad
   streets: and chvtsvt, from chtsh, to divide, signify the common
   streets, by which the town is divided. The exclamations, hv, hv, are
   rendered by Calvin, Vae! Vae! Eheu, in Latin, and Woe, in our language
   come nearest to sound in the original. --Ed.

   Amos 5:17

   17. And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
   thee, saith the Lord

   17. Et in omnibus vineis lamentum, quia transibo in medio tui, inquit
   Jehova.


   A reason is now added, why the whole country would be taken up with
   lamentation and mourning; for the Lord would pass through the whole
   land. Surely nothing was more to be desired, than that God should visit
   his own land; but he here declares that he would pass through as an
   enemy. As then an enemy runs through a country and spreads devastation
   wherever he comes, such would be the passing through, which the Prophet
   now threatens. "God, then, of whom ye boast, as dwelling in the midst
   of you, will come forth, lay waste, and consume the whole land, as when
   an enemy spreads ruin far and wide."

   But the Prophet seems to allude to the passing of God, described by
   Moses in Exodus 11. The Lord then passed through the middle of Egypt;
   that is, his wrath pervaded the whole land; no corner was safe or
   tranquil, for God's vengeance penetrated through every part of it. So
   also now the Prophet intimates, that the land of Israel would be like
   that of Egypt; for the Lord, who then testified his love towards the
   children of Abraham, would now, on the contrary, show himself an enemy
   to them, while passing through the midst of them. And the Prophet again
   indirectly ridicules the vain confidence by which the Israelites were
   blinded, while they used God's name as a pretext, as it will more
   clearly appear from what follows, for he says --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:18

   18. Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is it for
   you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.

   18. Vae desiderantibus diem Jehovae! Ad quid hoc vobis? Dies Jehovae
   ipse tenebrae et non lux.


   The Prophet expresses here more fully what he briefly and obscurely
   touched upon as to the passing of God through the land; for he shows
   that the Israelites acted strangely in setting up the name of God as
   their shield, as though they were under his protection, and in still
   entertaining a hope, though oppressed with many evils, because God had
   promised that they should be the objects of his care: he says that this
   was an extremely vain pretense. He yet more sharply reproves their
   presumption by saying, "Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah!"
   This appears, even at the firstview, to be very severe; but we need not
   wonder that the Prophet burns with too much indignation towards
   hypocrites, from whom that security, through which they became
   ferocious against God, could hardly be shaken off. And we see that the
   holy Spirit treats hypocrites everywhere with much more severity than
   those who are openly impious and wicked: for the despisers of God, how
   stupid soever they may be, do not yet excuse their vices; but
   hypocrites seek ever to draw in God into the quarrel, and they have
   their veils to cover their turpitude: it was therefore necessary to
   treat them, as the Prophet does here, with sharpness and severity.

   Woe, he says, to those who desire the day of Jehovah! Some expound this
   day of Jehovah of the day of death, and pervert the meaning of the
   Prophet; for they think that the Prophet speaks here of desperate men,
   who seek self-destruction, or lay violent hands on themselves. Woe,
   then, to those who desire the day of Jehovah, that is, who have
   recourse to hanging or to poison, as no other remedy appears to them.
   But the Prophet, as I have already reminded you, does here on the
   contrary rouse hypocrites. Others think that the contempt which Amos
   has before noticed, is here reproved; and this in part is true; but
   they do not sufficiently follow up the Prophet's design; for they do
   not observe what is special in this place, -- that hypocrites flattered
   themselves, falsely assuming this as a truth, that they were the people
   of God, and that God was bound to them. Though, then, the Israelites
   had been a hundred times perfidious, they yet continued arrogantly to
   boast of their circumcision; and then the law and the sacrifices, and
   all their ceremonies, were to them as banners, -- "O! we are a holy
   nation, and God's heritage; we are the children of Abraham, and the
   redeemed of the Lord; we are a priestly kingdom." As then these things
   were ready in the mouth of all, the Prophet says, "Woe to those who
   desire the day of Jehovah!" And, indeed, when the Lord had begun to
   punish them for their sins, they still said, "The Lord, it may be,
   intends to try our constancy: but how can he destroy us? for he would
   then be false; his covenant cannot be made void: it is then certain
   that we shall be saved, and that he will be shortly reconciled to us."
   They did not indeed expect that God would be propitious to them; but as
   they were overwhelmed with many evils, they sought to allay their
   sorrows by such a drug.

   When therefore the Prophet saw, that the Israelites so waywardly
   flattered themselves, and so foolishly and wickedly laid claim to the
   name of God, he says, Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah! What
   will this be, he says, to you? The day of Jehovah will be darkness and
   not light; as though he said, "God is an enemy to you, and the nearer
   he comes to you, the more grievously you must be afflicted: he will
   bring nothing to you but devastation, for he will come armed to destroy
   you. There is therefore no reason for you to boast that you are a
   chosen people, that you are a priestly kingdom, for ye are fallen away
   from the favor of God; and this is to be imputed to your own
   misconduct. God then is armed for your destruction; and whenever he
   will appear, he will at the same time pursue you with cruelty and
   violence; and it will be for your destruction that God will come thus
   armed to you. Whenever then the Lord will come, your evils must
   necessarily be increased. The day then of Jehovah will be darkness and
   not light." He afterwards confirms this truth --

   Amos 5:19

   19. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into
   the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

   19. Quemadmodum si quis fugiat coram leone, et occurrat ei ursus; et
   veniat domum suam, et nitatur manu sua super parietem, et eum mordeat
   coluber.

   20. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? even very
   dark, and no brightness in it?

   20. Annon tenebrae dies Jehovae et non lux? et caligo et non splendor
   ei?


   Here is expressed more clearly what the Prophet had said before, --
   that hypocrites can have no hope, that the various changes, which may
   take place, will bring them any alleviation. Hypocrites, while straying
   in circuitous courses, do indeed promise better things to themselves,
   when the condition of the times is changed: and as Satan transforms
   himself into an angel of light, so hypocrites imitate the true servants
   of God. But it is a false imitation; for these are only fading flowers,
   no fruit follows; and besides, they proceed not from a living root.
   When the children of God are at any time pressed down by adverse
   events, they sustain and patiently nourish their faith with this
   consolation, -- that clouds soon pass away: so also when the Lord
   chastises them with temporal punishment, he will presently return into
   favor with them. Hypocrites present the same outward appearance; but
   they widely differ from the faithful: for when the faithful promise to
   themselves a prosperous issue, they are at the same time touched with a
   sense of their own evils, and study to reconcile themselves to God; but
   hypocrites continue immersed in their vices and boldly despise God; and
   at the same time they see here and there, and when any change happens
   they think that they have got rid of all evils. Inasmuch then as they
   deceived themselves with vain consolation, the Prophet now says, "You
   have no cause to think that it will be better with you, when one
   calamity shall pass away; for the same thing will happen to you, as
   when one flees away from a lion and meets with a bear, as when one
   escapes from a bear, and betakes himself to his own house, and there a
   serpent finds him: while he is leaning with his hand on the wall, a
   serpent bites him. Thus the Lord has in readiness various and many
   ways, by which he can punish you. When therefore ye shall have
   sustained one battle, when one enemy departs, the battle will be
   immediately renewed and that by another enemy: when a foreign power
   does not rage through the kingdom of Israel, the Lord will consume you
   either by famine, or by want, or by pestilence." We then see how well
   the context of the Prophet harmonizes together.

   "You have no reason," he says, "to hope for any light from the day of
   Jehovah." Why? "For Jehovah will not come, except when armed; for, as
   ye conduct yourselves in a hostile manner towards him, he must
   necessarily take vengeance. He will, therefore, bring with him no
   light, except it may be to fulminate against you: but his appearance
   will be dreadful, even darkness and thick darkness; and then, when he
   ceases to pursue you in one way, he will assail you in another; and,
   when foreign enemies spare you, God will find means by which he may
   destroy you in your own land without the agency of men; for ye have
   already found what the sterility of the land is, and what pestilence
   is: the Lord then has all such modes of vengeance in his own hand.
   Think not, therefore, that there will be any alleviation to you, were
   the world to change a hundred times, and were the condition of the
   country wholly different."

   But the Prophet did not intend here to drive all those indiscriminately
   into despair, who were guilty of grievous offenses, but his design was
   to shake off from hypocrites their self-flatteries, that by such proofs
   they might be led to know that God would be ever like himself. If,
   then, they wished to return into favor with him, he shows that a change
   was needful: when they put off their perverse conduct, God would be
   instantly ready to give them pardon; but, if they proceeded in their
   vices and obstinate wickedness, and always continued in that hardness,
   in which they had hitherto indulged, he declares, that the day of
   Jehovah would be ever to them dark and gloomy, and that, though the
   Lord does not always use the same kind of rod, he yet has means
   innumerable, by which he can destroy a perverse nation, such as the
   Israelites then were.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that seeing we are so sleepy, yea, so fascinated
   by our sins, that nothing is more difficult than to put off our own
   nature and to renounce that wickedness to which we have become
   habituated, -- O grant, that we, being really awakened by thy
   scourgings, may truly return to thee, and that, having wholly changed
   our disposition and renounced all wickedness, we may sincerely, and
   from the heart, submit ourselves to thee, and so look forward to the
   coming of thy Son, that we may cheerfully and joyfully wait for him, by
   ever striving after such a renovations of life as may strip us of our
   flesh and all corruptions, until, being at length renewed after thine
   image, we become partakers of that glory, which has been obtained for
   us by the blood of the same, thy only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Amos 5:21-23

   21. I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your
   solemn assemblies.

   21. Odi, reprobavi dies festos vestros, et non olfaciam in
   solennitatibus vestris (alii legunt, sacrificia vestra, et non olfaciam
   in congregationibus vestris; sed de vocibus postea dicam suo loco.)

   22. Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will
   not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat
   beasts.

   22. Certe si obtuleritis mihi holocausta et munera vestra, grata non
   habebo: et pacifica pinguium vestrorum non respiciam.

   23. Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear
   the melody of thy viols.

   23. Tolle a me multitudinem canticorum tuorum; et concertum lyrarum
   tuarum non audiam.


   Here the Prophet, anticipating an objection, shows that the Israelites
   deceived themselves, for they believed that God was pacified by their
   sacrifices: he declares all these to be useless; not only, as I think,
   because they themselves were impure; but because all their sacrifices
   were mere profanations. We have said elsewhere that sacrifices are
   often reprehended by the Prophets, when not accompanied by godliness
   and sincerity: for why did God command sacrifices to be offered to him
   under the law, except as religious exercises? It was hence necessary
   that they should be accompanied with penitence and faith. But
   hypocrites thought, as we have seen, that they thereby discharged their
   whole duty: it was then a profanation of divine worship. Though the
   Jews, as to the external form, had not departed from the rule of the
   law, yet their sacrifices were vicious, and repudiated by God: "I
   cannot bear them -- they are a weariness to me -- I repudiate them -- I
   loathe them," -- these are expressions we meet with every where in
   Isaiah. And yet hypocrites regarded their worship as conformable to the
   law; but impurity of heart vitiated all their works, and this was the
   reason that God rejected every thing which the Jews thought available
   for holiness. But different, as I think, was the design of our Prophet:
   for it was not only for this reason that he blamed the Israelites, --
   because they falsely pretended God's name in their sacrifices, but
   because they were apostates; for they had departed from the teaching of
   the law, and built for themselves a spurious temple.

   It is yet true that they were deluded with this false notion, that
   their sins were expiated by sacrifices: but God reproved the
   Israelites, not only for this gross error, with which the Jews were
   also infected but for having renounced his true and lawful worship.
   Hence the external form of their worship deserved to be condemned; for
   it was not right to offer sacrifices except on mount Zion: but they,
   without having the ark of the covenant, devised a worship else-where,
   and even there worshipped the calves. We now understand the design of
   the Prophet: and this ought to be carefully observed, for interpreters
   think that the Prophet had nothing else in view, but to condemn a false
   presumption in the Israelites, because they sought to satisfy God with
   external sacrifices, while they were yet continuing obstinately in
   their sins. But the other evil ought to be added, which was, that they
   had corrupted the true worship of God even in its outward form.

   Having now pointed out the prophet's object, I come to consider his
   words, I have hated, I have rejected, etc. The word chgg, chegig, means
   to leap and to dance: hence chg, cheg, signifies a sacrifice as well as
   a festal day. Some then render the words, "I have rejected your
   sacrifices," and those which follow, thus, "I will not smell at your
   solemnities." Others render the last word, "assemblies." tsr, otser,
   means to restrain, and sometimes to gather: hence tsrh, ostare, means
   an assembly or a congregation. But tsrt, osteret, means a festal day,
   because the people, as it is well known, were then restrained from
   work, and also, because they were detained in the sanctuary. But with
   respect to the subject itself, it makes but little difference, whether
   we read assembly or a festal day: we see that what the Prophet meant
   was this, -- that God rejected all the rites, by which the Israelites
   thought that he was pacified, as though they were the most effectual
   expiations. He does not simply declare that they were of no account
   before God; but he speaks much stronger and says, that God despised and
   abhorred them. I regard, he says, with hatred your festal days. He
   speaks also of burnt offerings,

   When ye offer me sacrifices and your gift, etc. mnchh, meneche,
   properly means a gift of flour, which was an addition to the sacrifice;
   but it is often taken generally for any kind of offering. It is indeed
   certain that the Prophet meant, that however much the Israelites
   accumulated their ritual observances, they did nothing towards
   appeasing God, inasmuch as they observed not the law that was given
   them; and they turned also to a wrong purpose their sacrifices; for
   they did not exercise themselves in piety and in the spiritual worship
   of God, but, on the contrary, spread veils before God, that by
   presenting a fictitious form of worship, they might cover all their
   sins; for they thought themselves to be hidden from God.

   This is the reason why the Prophet declares that these offerings would
   not be received by God, l' 'rtsh, la areste, I will not accept them.
   The Prophet no doubt alludes here to those promises, which are to be
   found everywhere in the law, as he did when he said in the last verse,
   l' 'rych, la arich, I will not smell rvchh, ruch, means to smell; and
   Moses often uses the expression, that God is delighted with the odour
   of sacrifices, or with the smell of incense. But when the Lord declares
   that odour is pleasant to him, he means that it is so, provided the
   people sacrificed rightly, that is, when they brought not sacrifices as
   false veils to cover their sins, but as true and real evidences of
   their faith and repentance; God promised in that case that sacrifices
   would be a sweet odour to him. Now, on the contrary, he declares that
   the perfume would not be acceptable to him, nor sacrifices appeasing.
   But sacrifices not only were acceptable to God, but also pacified him.
   Since then the Lord had so often said, that he would be propitious to
   his people, when sacrifices were offered, it was necessary expressly to
   cut off this confidence from the Israelites, when they dealt not
   faithfully with God. God never disappointed his true worshipers, but
   ever received them into favor, provided they approached him in
   sincerity. But as these hypocrites dealt falsely with him, they were
   necessarily disappointed of their hope, as the Prophet here declares.

   The peace-offerings of your fat things, he says, I will not regard God
   indeed promised in the law that he would regard their sacrifices
   provided they were lawful; but as the Israelites had in two ways
   departed from pure worship, God now justly says, I will not look on
   your sacrifices, nor on the peace-offerings of your fat things He calls
   them the peace-offerings of fat things, intimating, that though the
   beasts were the choicest, they would not yet be acceptable to him; for
   the Lord regards not fatness, as he needs neither meat nor drink. Then,
   in a word, the Prophet here sets this fatness in opposition to true
   godliness and obedience too. In both respects there was, as we have
   seen, a defect among the Israelites; for they obeyed not the law as to
   its outward requirements, and their hearts were impure and perverse:
   hence all their sacrifices were necessarily polluted and corrupt.

   It follows, Take away from me the multitude of thy songs By speaking of
   multitude, he aims at hypocrites, who toil much in their devices
   without measure or end, as we see done at this day by those under the
   Papacy; for they accumulate endless forms of worship, and greatly weary
   themselves, morning and evening; in short, they spend days and nights
   in performing their ceremonies, and every one devises some new thing,
   and all these they heap together. Inasmuch, then, as men, when they
   have begun to turn aside from the pure word of God, continually invent
   various kinds of trifles, the Prophet here touches indirectly on this
   foolish laboriousness (stultan sedulitatem -- foolish sedulity) when he
   says, Take away from me the multitude of thy songs. He might have
   simply said, "Thy songs please me not;" but he mentions their
   multitude, because hypocrites, as I have said, fix no limits to their
   outward ceremonies: and a vast heap especially follows, when once they
   take to themselves the liberty of devising this or that form of
   worship. Hence God testifies here, that they spend labor in vain, for
   he rejects what he does not command, and whatever is not rightly
   offered to him.

   And the harmony of lyres, or of musical instruments. But nvl, nabel,
   was an instrument, which, as to its kind, is unknown to us now. Take
   away, then, from me the harmony of lyres; for the verb, take away, may
   refer to both clauses; though some join them to the last the verb "lo
   l' 'sm, la ashimo, I will not hear. The difference really is very
   little: but their view is the most probable, who join together the two
   clauses, Take away from me the multitude of thy songs and the harmony
   of lyres;' with which thou thinkest me to be delighted. They afterwards
   take l' 'sm "I will not hear," by itself. But I contend not about such
   minute things: it is enough to know the design of the Prophet. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 5:24

   24. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty
   stream.

   24. Et decurret quasi aquae judicium, et justitia quasi torrens
   violentus.


   Interpreters variously expound this verse. To some it seems an
   exhortation, as though the Prophet said, "Ye thrust on me victims of
   beasts and various ceremonies; but I regard not these things; for the
   interior purity of heart alone pleases me: take away then all these
   things, which are of no moment with me, and bring what I especially
   require and demands even a pure and sincere heart."

   Some also think that newness of life is here described by its fruits or
   its evidences: for the Prophet mentions not purity, speaks not of faith
   and repentance, but by the fruits sets forth that renovation, which God
   always chiefly regards, and for the sake of which he had required
   sacrifices under the law. The meaning then is, that hypocrites are here
   recalled to true worship, because they vainly and absurdly tormented
   themselves with their own fictions: and by requiring from them
   righteousness and judgment, he required a holy and pure life, or, in a
   word, uprightness.

   Others think that the Prophet turns aside here to celebrate the grace
   of Christ, which was to be made known in the gospel: and the verb ygl,
   igel, is rendered by many "shall be revealed;" but others more
   correctly derive it from the root gl, igel, to roll. Let justice then
   as it were, roll. But I will return to the second exposition. Most
   think that there is here a prediction of that righteousness which God
   was to make known by the coming of Christ; and some retain also the
   proper meaning of the verb gl, gal, to roll. They then say that the
   gospel is here compared to an impetuous river and a violent stream,
   because the Lord would rush on and penetrate through all hindrances,
   how many soever Satan might attempt to throw in his way. But this
   meaning seems not to harmonize with the Prophet's words and is in my
   judgment, too refined.

   Some again regard the verse as a threatening, and think that God here
   reproves the Israelites, as though he had said, that since they were
   trifling with and mocking him, he would at length show what was true
   righteousness and what was true judgment: for hypocrites think that
   they come not short of a perfect state, when they are veiled by their
   ceremonies, inasmuch as they flee to these lurking holes, when they
   would cover all their flagitous deeds. Hence they think not that they
   are guilty, for they hide their sins under their ceremonies as under
   Ajax's shield. Seeing then that they thus trifle with God, some
   interpreters think that God here sharply reproves them and says, that
   they were greatly deceived, for he would himself at length make known
   what was true righteousness. Righteousness then shall run down or be
   rolled; and by this verb he expresses impetuosity; but he sets it forth
   afterwards more clearly by 'ytn, aitan, [23]"Judgment shall be a
   violent stream." But hypocrites amuse themselves as children do with
   their puppets. Inasmuch then as they do nothing seriously, and yet
   desire to pacify God as with baubles, the Prophet here shakes off such
   delusions, as though he said, "Do you think that God is like a child?
   Why do you set up these trifles? Do you think that righteousness is a
   fictitious thing, or that judgment is a vain figment? The Lord will
   certainly show to you how precious righteousness is. It shall therefore
   run down as violent waters, as an impetuous stream. "Judgment," he says
   "shall rush upon you and overwhelm you." This is the third meaning.

   But the verse may be again explained in a different way, as though God
   obviated an objection; for hypocrites, we know, always raise a clamor,
   and make no end of contending; "What! Have we then lost all our labor,
   while endeavoring to worship God? Is all this to go for nothing? And
   further, we have not only offered sacrifices, but sought also to
   testify that the glory of God is to us an object of concern. Since then
   we have had a care for religion, why should God now reject us?" The
   Prophet here shortly answers, -- that if only they brought forth true
   righteousness, their course would be free; as though he said, "God will
   not put a check to your righteousness and rectitude:" and this must be
   referred to the fruit or remuneration; as though the Prophet said,
   "Only worship God in sincerity, and he will not disappoint you; for a
   reward will be laid up for you; your righteousness shall run down as a
   river." As it is said in another place, Your righteousness shall shine
   as the dawn,' so it is also in this, Your righteousness shall run down
   as violent waters.' There was therefore no reason for hypocrites to
   expostulate and say that wrong was done them by God, or that their
   performances were lightly esteemed, since God openly testified, that he
   would provide for righteousness, that it might have a free course, like
   an impetuous river: and this seems to be the genuine meaning of the
   Prophet. While I do not wholly reject the other expositions, I do not
   yet follow them; but show what I mostly approve. [37]

   Then the Prophet, after having bidden them to throw aside all their
   fictitious and spurious forms of worship, does not now simply exhort
   the Israelites, as some think, to exhibit righteousness and rectitude,
   but expresses this in the form of a promise, "Run down shall your
   righteousness as impetuous waters, provided it be true, and not an
   empty name. Whenever God shall see in you sincere rectitude, there will
   certainly be prepared an ample reward for you." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] There appears here a great candor in our Author: but the first
   view of the passage seems the most natural and obvious, as presented in
   our version, with which that of Newcome and Henderson agrees. Having
   before exhorted them to "take away" what they thought much of, the
   Prophet now exhorts them to attend to judgment and justice. The two
   verses, 23 and 24, may be thus rendered: -- 23. Remove from me the
   multitude of thy songs,
   And the music of thy harps; I will not hear them. 24. And let judgment
   roll down like waters,
   And righteousness like a mighty stream. I prefer rendering hmvn,
   "multitude," with Calvin, rather than "noise," with our version and
   Newcome, or "sound" with Henderson. It forms a variety as to the next
   clause. In idiomatic English the expressions would be--"thy many songs
   and thy harmonious harps." The two verses ought to be read as
   connected; and the 24^th should begin with "And," v, and not "But." --

   Amos 5:25-26

   25. Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness
   forty years, O house of Israel?

   25. An victimas et munus (est mnchh) obtulistis mihi in deserto
   quadraginta annis, domus Israel?

   26. But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
   images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

   26. Et sustulistis Sicuth Regem vestrum, et Chion, imagines vestras,
   stellam deorum vestrorum (vel, deos vestros,) quae fecistis vobis.


   The Prophet shows in this place, that he not only reproved hypocrisy in
   the Israelites in obtruding on God only external display of ceremonies
   without any true religion in the heart; but that he also condemned them
   for having departed from the rule of the law. He also shows that this
   was not a new disease among the people of Israel; for immediately at
   the beginning their fathers mixed such a leaven as vitiated the worship
   of God. He therefore proves that the Israelites had ever been given to
   superstitions, and could not by any means be retained in the true and
   pure worship of God.

   Have ye then caused sacrifices, victims, or an oblation to come before
   me in the desert for forty years? He addresses them as though they had
   perverted God's worship in the desert, and yet they were born many ages
   after; what does he mean? Even this, -- the Prophet includes the whole
   body of the people from their first beginning, as though he said, "It
   is right to inclose you in the same bundle with your fathers; for you
   are the same with your fathers in your ways and dispositions." We hence
   see that the Israelites were regarded guilty, not only because they
   vitiated God's worship in one age by their superstitions, but also from
   the beginning. And he asks whether they offered victims to him: it is
   certain that such was their intention; for they at no time dared to
   deny God, by whom they had been not long before delivered; and we know
   that though they made for themselves many things condemned by the law,
   they ever adhered to this principle, "The God, who hath redeemed us, is
   to be worshipped by us:" yea, they always proudly boasted of their
   father Abraham. They had never then willingly alienated themselves from
   God, who had chosen Abraham their father and themselves to be his
   people: and indeed the Prophet shortly before had said, Take away from
   me,' etc.; and then, when ye offer to me sacrifices and a gift of
   flour, I will not count them acceptable.' There seems to be an
   inconsistency in this -- that God should deny that victims been offered
   to him -- and yet say that they were offered to him by the people of
   Israel, when, as we have stated, they had presumptuously built a
   profane and spurious altar. The solution is easy, and it is even this,
   -- that the people had ever offered sacrifices to God, if we regard
   what they pretended to do: for good intention, as it is commonly
   called, so blinds the superstitious, that with great presumption they
   trifle with God. Hence with respect to them we may say that they
   sacrificed to God; but as to God, he denies that what was not purely
   offered was offered to him. We now then see why God says now that
   sacrifices were not offered to him in the wilderness: he says so,
   because the people blended with his worship the leaven of idolatry: and
   God abhorred this depravation. This is the meaning.

   But another objection may be again proposed. This defection did not
   prevail long, and the whole people did not give their consent to
   idolatry; and still more, we know what the impostor Balaam said, that
   Jacob had no idol; and speaking in the twentieth chapter of Numbers,
   [38] by the prophetic spirit, he testifies that the only true God
   reigned in Jacob, and that there were among them no false gods. How
   then does the Prophet say now that idolatry prevailed among them? The
   answer is ready: The greater part went astray: hence the whole people
   are justly condemned; and though this sin was reproved, yet they
   relapsed continually, as it is well known, into superstitions; and
   still more, they worshipped strange gods to please strumpets. Since it
   was so, it is no wonder that they are accused here by the Prophet of
   not having offered victims to God, inasmuch as they were contaminated
   with impure superstitions: it could not then be, that they brought
   anything to God. At the same time God's worship, required by his law,
   was of such importance, that he declared that he was worshipped by
   Jacob, as also Christ says,

   "We know what we worship," (John 4:22;)

   and yet not one in a hundred among the Jews cherished the hope of
   eternal life in his heart. They were all Epicureans or profane; nay,
   the Sadducees prevailed openly among them: the whole of religion was
   fallen, or was at least so decayed, that there was no holiness and no
   integrity among them; and yet Christ says, "We know what we worship;"
   and this was true with regard to the law.

   Now then we see that the Prophets speak in various ways of Israel: when
   they regard the people, they say, that they were perfidious, that they
   were apostates, who had immediately from the beginning departed from
   the true and legitimate worship of God: but when they commend the grace
   of God, they say, that the true worship of God shone among them, that
   though the whole multitude had become perverted, yet the Lord approved
   of what he had commanded. So it is with Baptism; it is a sacred and
   immutable testimony of the grace of God, though it were administered by
   the devil, though all who may partake of it were ungodly and polluted
   as to their own persons. Baptism ever retains its own character, and is
   never contaminated by the vices of men. The same must be said of
   sacrifices.

   I shall now return to the words of the Prophet: [39] Have you offered
   to me victims for forty years in the desert? He enhances their sin by
   the circumstance of their condition; for they were there shut up in a
   narrow and hard confinement, and yet they turned aside after their
   superstitions. And it was certainly a monstrous thing: God fed them
   daily with manna; they were therefore under the necessity, however
   unwilling, of looking up to heaven every day; for God constrained their
   unwillingness with no common favor. They knew, too, that water flowed
   for them miraculously from a rock. Seeing then that God constrained
   them thus to look up to him, how was it that they yet became vain
   through their own deceptions? It was, as I have said, a prodigious
   blindness. Hence the Prophet speaks of the forty years and of the
   desert, that the atrocity of their sin might more fully appear; for the
   Lord could not, by so many bonds, keep the people from such a madness.

   It now follows, And ye have carried Sicuth your king. This place, we
   know, is quoted by Stephen in the seventh chapter of the Acts: but he
   followed the Greek version; and the Greek translator, whoever he was,
   was mistaken as to the word, Sicuth, and read, Sucoth, and thought the
   name an appellative of the plural number, and supposed it to be derived
   from svk suk, which means a tabernacle; for he translated it skenen as
   if it was said, "Ye bore the tabernacle of your king instead of the
   ark." But it was a manifest mistake; for the probability is, that
   Sicuth was the proper name of an idol. Ye bore then Sicuth your king.
   He called it their king by way of reproach; for they had violated that
   priestly kingdom, which God had instituted; for he, as a king,
   exercised dominion over them. Since then God would be deemed the king
   of Israel, as he had ascribed to himself that name, and since he
   promised to them a kingdom, as in due time he gave them, it was the
   basest ingratitude in them to seek an idol to be their king; it was
   indeed a denial of God which could not be borne, not to allow
   themselves to be governed by him. We hence see how sharply he upbraids
   them, for had refused to God his own kingdom, and created for
   themselves the fictitious Sleuth as their king.

   Then it follows, And Kiun, your images Some think that kyvn, Kiun,
   means a cake, and kvh, kue, is to burn, and from this they think the
   word is derived; but others more correctly regard it as a proper name;
   and the Prophet, I have no doubt, has named here some reigned god after
   Sleuth. Kiun then, your images; I read the words as being in
   apposition. Others say, "The cake of your images;" and some render the
   words literally, "Kiun your images;" but yet they do not sufficiently
   attend to the design of the Prophet; for he seems here to ridicule the
   madness of the people, because they dreamt that some deity was inclosed
   in statues and in such masks. "Ye carried," he says, "both Sicuth and
   Kiun, your images. I am now deprived of honor, for ye could not bear me
   to govern you. Ye now enjoy your King Sicuth; but, in the meantime, let
   us see what is the power of Sicuth and Kiun; they are nothing more than
   images. Seeing then that there is neither strength nor even life in
   them, what madness is it to worship such fictitious things?"

   But some think that Kiun was the image of Saturn. What the Hebrews
   indeed say, that this idolatry was derived from the Persians, is wholly
   groundless; for the Persians, we know, had no images nor statues, but
   worshipped only the sacred fire. As, then, the Persians had no images.
   the Jews fabled, in their usual way, when they said that Kiun was an
   image of Saturn. But all the Jews, I have no doubt, imagined that all
   the stars were gods, as they made images for them; for it immediately
   follows, A constellation, or a star, your gods These, he says, are your
   gods; even stars and images; and there is here a sarcasm (sarkasmos;)
   used; for the Prophet derides the folly of the people of Israel, who,
   being not content with the Maker of heaven and earth, sought for
   themselves dead gods, or rather vain devices. "Your gods then," he
   says, "are images and stars."

   But it must be observed, that he calls them images: he does not, as in
   other places, call them idols; and this, I say, ought to be observed,
   for here is refuted the foolish and refinement of the Papists, who at
   this day excuse all their superstitions, because they have no idols;
   for they deny that their devices are idols. What then? They are images.
   Thus they hide their own baseness under the name of images. But the
   Prophet does not say that they were idols; he does not use that hateful
   word which is derived from grief or sorrow; but he says that they were
   images. The name then in itself has nothing base or ominous; but, at
   the same time, as the Lord would not have himself represented by any
   visible figure, the Prophet here expressly and distinctly condemns
   Sicuth and Kiun. The Greek translator whom Stephen followed, put down
   the word, types or figures, that is, images. Now, when any one says to
   the Papists that their figures or images are sinful before God, they
   boldly deny this; but we see that their evasion avails nothing.

   He adds in the last place, Which ye have made for yourselves I prefer
   rendering the relative 'sr, asher, in the neuter gender, as including
   all their fictitious gods, and also their images, which things then ye
   have made for yourselves. To make these things is at all times vicious
   in sacred things; for we ought not to bring any thing of our own when
   we worship God, but we ought to depend always on the word of his mouth,
   and to obey what he has commanded. All our actions then in the worship
   of God ought to be, so to speak, passive; for they ought to be referred
   to his command, lest we attempt any thing but what he approves. Hence,
   when men dare to do this or that without God's command, it is nothing
   else but abomination before him. And the Greeks call superstitions
   ethelothreskeias; and this word means voluntary acts of worship, such
   as are undertaken by men of their own accord. We now understand the
   whole design of the Prophet. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] Calvin is perhaps referring to Numbers 23:21, wherein the Douay
   version is: -- 21. There is no idol in Jacob,
   neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel. etc. -- fj.

   [39] No commentator has given us a satisfactory rendering of these two
   verses. Perhaps that of Calvin, as a whole, comes nearest to the
   original. The question, Have ye, etc., is considered by many as not
   implying a negation but a concession, as though it had been said, "I
   grant this; ye did offer," etc.; and then, what is said in verse 26 was
   what they did besides. It was this mixture of two worships, the worship
   of God and the worship of idols, that is here brought against the
   Israelites. I venture to present the following translation: -- Did you
   bring me sacrifices and oblation in the wilderness
   For forty years, O house of Israel?
   You did also bear Sacut, your king,
   And Kiun, which were your images;
   A star was your god,
   Which ye formed for yourselves. That the hosts of heaven were the
   objects of their worship, is evident from Stephen's Sermon in Acts
   7:42, "Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven."
   Stephen then refers to, and quotes this passage, not from the Hebrew,
   but almost literally from the Septuagint. Instead of, "their figures
   which ye have made for yourselves," he has, "figures which ye made to
   worship them." He gives the meaning, but not the words. Between the
   words of Amos, in Hebrew, and those of Stephen, there is a material,
   though not verbal agreement. Two objects of idolatrous worship are
   mentioned, and also their images, but their names are different. The
   probability is, that those used by Amos were not current at the time
   the Greek version was made, and that the names by which those deities
   were then known were used. Moloch, indeed, means a king, but applied,
   like Baal, to several heathen gods; and Kiun is said to be Arabic, and
   Remphan is an Egyptic term, designating the same star or planet, which
   critics suppose to have been Saturn. Moloch, as Grotius suggests, had
   the figure of a king, and Kiun that of a star.

   Amos 5:27

   27. Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
   saith the Lord, whose name is the God of hosts.

   27. Et migrare faciam vos ultra Damascum, dicit Jehova, Deus exercituum
   nomen ejus.


   Here the Prophet at last denounces exile on the Israelites as though he
   had said that God would not suffer them any longer to contaminate the
   Holy Land, which had been given them as an heritage, on the condition
   that they acknowledged him as the only true God. God had now, for a
   long time, borne with the Israelites though they had never ceased to
   pollute his land with superstitions. He comes now to cleanse it. I will
   cause you, he says, to migrate beyond Damascus; for they thought that
   enemies were driven, by means of that fortress, from the whole country,
   and they took shelter there as in a quiet nest. The expression would
   have otherwise no meaning, and this is what interpreters have not
   noticed. They say, "I will cause you to migrate beyond Damascus" [40]
   that is, to a far country; but why did the Prophet mention Damascus?
   This reason ought to be observed. It was because the Israelites thought
   that all the attacks of enemies would be prevented by having the city
   Damascus as their defense, which they supposed was impregnable. "That
   fortress," the Lord says, "will not prevent me from taking you away,
   and removing you as far as the Assyrians." We now see what the Prophet
   means, and why he expressly added the name of Damascus.

   It follows, The God of hosts is his name [41] Here the Prophet confirms
   his threatening, lest hypocrites should think that he did not speak in
   earnest: for we know how readily they flattered themselves; and when
   the Lord fulminated, they remained secure. Hence the Prophet, that he
   might strike terror, says, that the speaker is the God of hosts, as
   though he said, "Ye cannot hope to escape the vengeance which God now
   denounces on you; for his power is infinite, he is the Lord of hosts.
   See then that he is prepared to destroy you except ye timely repent."
   This is the meaning. I will not now proceed farther.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] Here is another instance in which the meaning and not the words,
   is given by Stephen in Acts 7:43. In this instance, the Septuagint is
   the same with the Hebrew text, "beyond Damascus;" but Stephen says,
   "beyond Babylon." The same quarter is meant, though the name of the
   place is different. -- Ed.

   [41] There seems to be a peculiar propriety in introducing this
   sentence. The Israelites became the worshippers of the hosts of heaven;
   then the Prophet says, that Jehovah is the God of Hosts. What folly,
   then, it was to worship the hosts of heaven, and to forsake the God of
   them! -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest us to be so prone to corrupt
   superstitions, and that we are with so much difficulty restrained by
   thy word, -- O grant, that we being confirmed by thy Spirit, may never
   turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, but be ever
   attentive to thee alone, and not worship thee presumptuously, nor
   pollute thy worship with our outward pomps, but call on thee with a
   sincere heart, and, recumbing on thy aid, flee to thee in all our
   necessities, and never abuse thy holy name, which thou hast designed to
   be engraven on us, but be conformed to the image of thy Son, that thou
   mayest be to us truly a Father, and that we may be thy children, in the
   name of the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Amos 6:1

   1. Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of
   Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of
   Israel came!

   1. Vae securis in Sion et confidentibus in monte Samaria, qui celebres
   fuerunt principio gentium, et ingressi sunt ad illos domus Israel.


   The Prophet now directs his discourse not only to the Israelites, to
   whom he was especially given as an instructor and teacher, but includes
   the Jews also: and yet he addresses not all indiscriminately, but only
   [24]the chief men, who were intent on their pleasures, as though they
   were exempt from the common miseries: for he does not, as many suppose,
   reprove here luxury and pride only; but we must remember a fact
   connected with their case, -- that they were not awakened by God's
   judgments; when God severely punished the sins of the people, the chief
   men remained ever heedlessly in their own dregs. This security is now
   condemned by our Prophet.

   And this is a very common evil, as we may see, in the present day. For
   when the Lord afflicts a country with war or with famine, the rich make
   great gain of such evils. They abuse the scourges of God; for we see
   merchants getting rich in the midst of wars, inasmuch as they scrape
   together a booty from every quarter. For they who carry on war are
   forced to borrow money, and also the peasants and mechanics, that they
   may pay taxes; and then, that they may live, they are obliged to make
   unjust conditions: thus the rich increase in wealth. They also who are
   in authority, and in favor at the court of princes, make more gain in
   wars, in famine, and in other calamities, than during times of peace
   and prosperity: for when peace nourishes, the state of things is then
   more equable; but when the poor are burdened, the rest grow fat. And
   this is the evil now noticed by the Prophet.

   Hence he pronounces here a curse on the secure and those at ease; not
   that it is an evil thing, or in itself displeasing to God, when any one
   quietly enjoys his leisure; but, not to be moved, when the Lord openly
   shows himself to be displeased and angry, when his scourges are
   manifestly inflicted, but to indulge ourselves more in pleasures, --
   this is to provoke him, as it were, designedly. The secure, then, and
   the presumptuous the Prophet here condemns, for it became them to
   humble themselves when they saw that God was incensed against them.
   They were not indeed more just than the multitude; and when God treated
   the common people with such severity, ought not the chiefs to have
   looked to themselves, and have examined their own life? As they did not
   do this, but made themselves drunk with pleasures, and put far off
   every fear and thought that the scourges of God were nothing to them,
   -- this was a contempt deservedly condemned by the Prophet. We see that
   God was in the same manner greatly displeased, as it is recorded in
   Isaiah: when he called them to mourning, they sang with the harp, and,
   according to their custom, feasted sumptuously and joyfully, (Isaiah
   23:12) As then they thus persevered in their indulgences, the Lord
   became extremely angry; for it was, as though they avowedly despised
   him and scorned all his threatening.

   We now observe the design of the Prophet, which interpreters have not
   sufficiently noticed. It behaves us indeed ever to keep in view these
   scourges of God, by which he began to visit the sins of the people. God
   can by no means endure, as I have said, such a contumacy as this, --
   that men should go on in the indulgence of their sins and never regard
   their judge and feel no guilt. Hence the Prophet says, Woe to you who
   are secure in Zion, who are confident, that is, who are without any
   fear, on the mount of Samaria [42] He names here the mount of Zion and
   the mount of Samaria; for these were the chief cities of the two
   kingdoms, as we all know. The whole country had been laid waste with
   various calamities; the citizens of Jerusalem and of Samaria were, at
   the same time, wealthy; and then trusting in their strongholds, they
   despised God and all his judgments. This then was the security, full of
   contumacy, which is condemned by the Prophet.

   He then mentions their ingratitude: he says that these mountains had
   been celebrated from the beginning of the nations, and that the
   Israelites entered into them. God here upbraids both the Jews and
   Israelites with having come to a foreign possession: for they had got
   those cities, not by their own valour, but the Lord drove out before
   them the ancient inhabitants. Seeing then that they perceived not that
   a safe dwelling was given them there by the Lord, that they might
   purely worship him and submit to his government, their ingratitude was
   inexcusable. The Prophet then, after having inveighed against the gross
   and heedless security, with which the chiefs of both kingdoms were
   inebriated, now mentions their ingratitude: "Ye are not natives, but ye
   have come in, for God did go before you, for it was his will to give
   you this land as your possession: why then are you now so inflated with
   pride against him? For before your time these cities were certainly
   well known and celebrated; and yet this was of no avail to the natives
   themselves. Why then do ye not now fear the Lord's judgment and repent,
   when he threatens you? Yea, when he shows his scourges to you?" We now
   perceive the Prophet's meaning in this verse. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion,
   And to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria."
   --Dr. Henderson. From not considering the main drift of what follows in
   this chapter, critics have proposed emendations in this verse. The
   careless and the secure, both at Jerusalem and Samaria, are evidently
   meant. Newcome renders the last line nearly the same with Henderson --
   "And that rest secure in the mountain of Samaria." So that the word
   "trust" in our version is not correct. The word used means often to be
   confident or secure, as well as to trust; but the law of parallelism
   requires it to be in the former sense here; as they were at ease in
   Zion, so they were confident or secure on the mount of Samaria. -- Ed.

   Amos 6:2

   2. Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the
   great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than
   these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?

   2. Transite Chalneh et aspicite; ite illinc in Chamath magnam, et
   descendite in Gath Philistinorum; an meliores sint regnis istis? An
   terminus illorum major termino vestro?


   By this representation Amos shows that there was no excuse for the Jews
   or the Israelites for sleeping in their sins, inasmuch as they could
   see, as it were in a mirror, the judgments which God brought on heathen
   nations. It is a singular favor, when God teaches us at the expense of
   others: for he could justly punish us as soon as we transgress; but
   this he does not, on the contrary he spares us; and at the same time he
   sets others before us as examples. This is, as we have said a singular
   favor: and this is the mode of teaching which our Prophet now adopts.
   He says, that Calneh and Hamath, and Gath, were remarkable evidences of
   God's wrath, by which the Israelites might learn, that they had no
   reason to rest on their wealth, to rely on their fortresses, and to
   think themselves free from all dangers; for as God had destroyed these
   cities, which seemed impregnable, so he could also cut off Jerusalem
   and Samaria, whenever he pleased. This is the real meaning of the
   Prophet.

   Some read the sentence negatively "Are not these places better than
   your kingdoms?" But this is not consistent with the Prophet's words.
   Others attend not to the object of the Prophet; for they think that the
   blessings of God are here compared, as though he said, "God deals more
   liberally with you than with the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, and the
   neighboring nations." For Calneh was situated in the plain of Babylon,
   as it is evident from Genesis 10:10; and Hamath was also a celebrated
   city, mentioned in that chapter, and in many other places; and Gath was
   a renowned city of the Philistines. In this opinion therefore
   interpreters mostly agree; that is, that there is set forth here God's
   bounty to the Jews and Israelites, seeing that he had favored them with
   a rich and fertile country, and preferred them to other nations. But
   this view seems not to me to be the correct one; for when a comparison
   is made between Calneh and Jerusalem, Babylon was no doubt the more
   fruitful and the more pleasant country, as we learn from all histories.
   The Prophet then does not speak here of the ancient condition of these
   places, but shows, as I have already said, that it availed these cities
   nothing, that they were wealthy, that they were fortified by all kinds
   of defenses; for God, at last, executed vengeance on them. Hence the
   Prophet declares that the same was now nigh the Jews and the
   Israelites.

   "What will hinder the hand of God," he says, "from delivering you to
   destruction? For if men could have arrested God's wrath by any
   fortresses, certainly Calneh and Hamath, and Gath, would have resisted
   by their forces; but the Lord has yet executed his vengeance on these
   cities, though fortified; your confidence then is nothing but
   infatuation, which deceives you." Jeremiah uses a similar language,
   when he says, Go to Shiloh,' (Jeremiah 7:12) He certainly does not
   remind the Jews, that the Lord had more splendidly adorned them than
   Shiloh; but he had quite a different thing in view. Shiloh had indeed
   been eminent, for it had long afforded a dwelling to the ark of the
   covenant; the sanctuary of God had been there. But at that time the
   place was deserted; and Jeremiah sets before the eyes of the people its
   sad desolation, that they might know that they ought to dread the same
   event, except they repented; for if they hardened their necks, nothing
   could prevent God from dealing with them as he did before with the
   inhabitants of Shiloh.

   We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet, when he says, Go and
   pass into Calneh, and see In bidding them to see, he no doubt refers to
   the dreadful change which had taken place there. For Calneh had been a
   strongly fortified city, and possessed supreme power; and the
   neighboring country was also no less pleasant than fruitful: but it was
   now a solitary place; for Babylon, as it is well known, had swallowed
   up Calneh. Since then the place afforded such a spectacle, the Prophet
   rightly says, Pass over into Calneh, and see; that is consider, as in a
   mirror, what men can gain by their pride and haughtiness, when they
   harden themselves against God: for this was the cause of destruction to
   that celebrated city.

   From thence, he says, go to Hamath, rvh, rebe, the great; which was a
   well-known city of Assyria; and see there, "How has it happened that a
   city so famous was entirely overthrown, except that the Lord could not
   endure so great a perverseness? As they had abused his patience, he at
   length executed his vengeance. The same thing also happened to your
   neighbors." For the Jews and the Israelites were not far distant from
   Gath. Now then since there were so many evidences of God's wrath before
   their eyes, justly does the Prophet here inveigh against their want of
   thought, inasmuch as they feared not God's judgment, which was nigh at
   hand.

   Are they then better? that is, is the condition of these cities better
   than that of the two kingdoms, Judah and Israel? and then, Is their
   border larger than your border? They have indeed been reduced to such
   straits, that they even pay tribute for their houses, whereas formerly
   they occupied a wide extent of country, and ruled, as it were, with
   extended wings, far and wide: but God has taken away those territories:
   for all these cities are become tributaries. See, he says, Is their
   border larger than your border? It now follows --

   Amos 6:3

   3. Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to
   come near;

   3. Qui procul rejicitis diem malum, et appropinquatis solium
   violentiae.


   The Prophet here reproves the Jews and Israelites for another crime, --
   that they had often provoked God's wrath, and ceased not by their sins
   to call forth new punishments, and in the meantime rejected, through
   their haughtiness and obstinacy, all his threatening, as if they were
   vain, and would never be executed on them. We must ever remember what I
   have said before, -- that the Prophet speaks not here of the whole
   people, but of the chiefs; for the expression, that they drew nigh the
   throne of iniquity, could not have been applied to the common people.
   This discourse then was addressed particularly to the judges and
   counselors, and those who were in power in both kingdoms, in Judah as
   well as in Israel.

   But it is a remarkable saying, that they drove far off the evil day,
   while they drew nigh the throne of iniquity, or of violence; as though
   he said, "Ye seek for yourselves a fever by your intemperance, and yet
   ye drive it far off, as drunken men are wont to do, who swallow down
   wine without any moderation; and when a physician comes or one more
   moderate, and warns them not to indulge in excess, they ridicule all
   their forebodings: What! will a fever seize on me? I am wholly free
   from fever; I am indeed accustomed to drink wine.'" Such are ungodly
   men, when they provoke God's wrath as it were designedly, and at the
   same time scorn all threatening, as though they were safe through some
   special privilege. We now then see what the Prophet had in view by
   saying, that they drove far the evil day, and yet drew nigh the throne
   of iniquity He means, that they drew nigh the throne of iniquity, when
   the judges strengthened themselves in their tyranny, and took the
   liberty to steal, to rob, to plunder, to oppress. When therefore they
   thus hardened themselves in all kinds of licentiousness, they then drew
   nigh the throne of iniquity. And they put away the evil day, because
   they were touched by no alarm; for when the Prophets denounced God's
   vengeance, they regarded it as a fable.

   In short, Amos charges here the principal men of the two kingdoms with
   two crimes, -- that they ceased not to provoke continually the wrath of
   God by subverting and casting under foot all equity, and by ruling the
   people in a tyrannical and haughty manner -- and that, in the mean
   time, they heedlessly despised all threatening, prolonged time, and
   promised impunity to themselves: even when God seriously and sharply
   addressed them, they still thought that the evil day was not nigh.
   Passages of this kind meet us everywhere in the Prophets, in which they
   show their indignation at this kind of heedlessness, when hypocrites
   putting off every feeling of grief, as though they had fascinated
   themselves, laughed to scorn all the Prophets, because they thought
   that the hand of God was far removed from them. Thus they are spoken of
   by Isaiah, as saying,

   Let us eat and drink, since we must die,'
   (Isaiah 22:13)

   They indeed thought that the Prophets did not seriously threaten them;
   but they regarded the mention of a near destruction as an empty
   bugbear. We now then understand what the Prophet meant. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 6:4

   4. That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
   couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the
   midst of the stall;

   4. Qui decumbunt (vel, dormiunt) in lectis eburneis et se extendunt
   super strata sua (alii vertunt, et superflua; alii, induti sunt tiaris;
   sed utrumque mihi videtur coactum,) qui comedunt agnos e grege (hoc
   est, selectos) et vitulos e medio saginarii (vel, opimi pascui; nam
   mrvq quidam ita vertunt.)


   Amos still pursues the reproof we have noticed at the beginning of the
   chapter, -- that the chief men, of whom he speaks, cast away from them
   all cares and anxieties, and indulged in pleasures, while the whole
   country was miserably distressed. We must ever bear in mind what I have
   already said, -- that luxury is not simply reprehended by the Prophet,
   as some incorrectly think, without sufficiently considering what is
   said, for it is not what the Prophet treats of; but he upbraids the
   Israelites for setting up an iron neck against God's judgments, yea,
   for shamelessly trifling with God, while he was endeavoring to lead
   them by degrees to repentance. The Prophet complains that nothing
   availed with them.

   He then says, first, that they slept on ivory beds. To use ivory beds
   was not in itself bad, except that excess is ever to be condemned; for,
   when we give up ourselves to pomps and pleasures, we certainly are not
   then free from sin: indeed, every desire for present things, which
   exceeds moderation, is ever justly reprehensible. And when men greedily
   seek splendor and display, or become ambitious and proud, or are given
   to delicacies, they are guilty of vices ever condemned by God. But it
   might be, that one used an ivory bed, who was yet willing to lie on the
   ground: for we know that there was then a great abundance of ivory, and
   that it was commonly used in Asia. Italy formerly knew not what it was
   to use a bed of ivory, that is, before the victory of Lucius Scipio:
   but after the king Antiochus was conquered, then Italy freely used
   ivory beds and fineries; and thus luxury broke down their courage and
   effeminated them.

   I will come now to our Prophet: it might have been that ivory was not
   then so valuable in Judea: they might then have used ivory beds without
   blame. But Amos ever regards the miseries of those times. The rich then
   ought to have given up all their luxuries, and to have betaken
   themselves to dust and ashes, when they saw that God was incensed with
   them, when they saw that the fire of his vengeance was kindled. We now
   then perceive why Amos was so indignant against those who slept on
   ivory beds.

   He adds, And who extend themselves on their beds: for srch, sarech, is
   properly to extend; it means also to become fetid; and further, it
   means to be superfluous; and therefore some render the words, "upon
   ivory beds and superfluities;" but this is strained, and agrees not
   with what follows, upon their couches. The Prophet then, I have no
   doubt, points out here the manners of those who so heedlessly indulged
   themselves: "Ye extend," he says, "your legs and your arms on your
   couches, as idle men, accustomed to indulgences, are wont to do. But
   the Lord will awaken you in a new way; his scourges ought to have
   roused you, but ye remain asleep. Hence, since God could not terrify
   you by his rods, nothing more remains but to draw you forth against
   your will to be punished." This was the reason why the Prophet said
   that they extended themselves on their couches.

   Ye eat also the lambs from the flock, and the calves from the midst of
   the rich pasture, or of the stall. I prefer taking mrvq, merebek, for
   folds. Since then they loved fat meat, the Prophet reproves this
   luxury: he had indeed in view, as it has been already said, the then
   calamitous time; for if the rich had in their usual way feasted, and
   had even taken fat meat, they would not have deserved so severe a
   punishment: but when the Lord called them to mourning, and when the
   signals of his wrath spread horror all around, it was a stupidity not
   to be endured, for them to continue their indulgences, which they
   ought, on the contrary, to have renounced. Indeed, this passage agrees
   with that of Isaiah, to which I have already referred. It now follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 6:5

   5. That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
   instruments of musick, like David;

   5. Concinentes super ore cithera, sicut David excogitarunt sibi
   instrumenta cantici.


   The word phrt, pereth, means to divide; so some explain it, and derive
   it from the clusters which remain after the vintage, because there are
   not then thick grapes, but a cluster here and there, and a great
   distance between: hence they think that the participle hphvrtym,
   epurethim, is to be taken here metaphorically as meaning to divide by
   marks, as music has its various notes; for except there be a distinct
   variety in singing, the sound would be confused, and would produce no
   pleasing effect. Who sing then with the harps and have invented for
   themselves, after the example of David, musical instruments.

   The Prophet still continues his discourse, and shows that these men
   lived sumptuously; as though they did not belong to the common class,
   they delighted themselves, against God's will, not only in the common
   mode of living, but even sought new pleasures, as if they were
   continually at marriage feasts, or celebrating birthdays. As then they
   had no season for mourning, they pursued their own indulgences; and
   this is what the Prophet now reprehends. If then any one thinks that
   music is in these words condemned, he is much deceived, as it appears
   from the context. Indeed, the Prophet never dealt so rigidly with that
   people, but he ever kept to this point -- that they were extremely
   torpid, nay, destitute of common sense, who perceived not that God
   showed himself angry with them, in order that they might flee
   immediately to the standard of repentance and humbly deprecate, with
   mourning, the wrath of God, as they ought to have done. It was
   therefore meet ever to set before them Gods wrath, which ought to have
   humbled the Jews and the Israelites, inasmuch as they ever obstinately
   set up against God their own indifference.

   In saying that after the example of David they invented for themselves
   musical instruments, he no doubt greatly aggravated their sin by this
   comparison: for it is not likely that they had abused this pretext, as
   hypocrites do, who are wont to boast of the examples of the saints,
   when they seek to disguise their own vices, -- "What!" some will say,
   "Did not David use musical instruments?" Others will say, "Had not
   Solomon very splendid palaces?" And some will add, "Had not Abraham a
   company of servants in his house?" So every one lays hold on what may
   avail for an excuse: and thus the examples of the saints are absurdly
   referred to by many. But it seems not probable that this was done by
   those whom Amos now addresses: but, on the contrary, he appears sharply
   to reprove them for provoking God's wrath by self indulgence, and for
   manifesting their perverseness, while David employed musical
   instruments in the exercises of religion, to raise up his mind to God.
   No doubt, David, when in a peaceful state, after having been delivered
   from all dangers, could also amuse himself: but he applied musical
   instruments to another purpose -- to sound forth the praises of God in
   the temple, that thereby he and other godly persons might together
   elevate their thoughts to a religious devotion. While David then, even
   in a state of peace and prosperity, did not allow his mind to become
   sunk in vain self-indulgences, these men, when God appeared angry, when
   he spread terror by so many tokens of his vengeance, yet dared
   contumaciously to follow their own ways, so that they left off nothing
   of their usual pomp and of their accustomed pleasures.

   We now see the design of the comparison which the Prophet makes: He
   aggravates, I have no doubt, their sin, because they regarded not the
   example of David, but transferred musical instruments to serve the
   purpose of gross and beastly indulgences, and thus they did when God
   was opposed to them, when he had begun to terrify them by his
   vengeance. Let us proceed --

   Amos 6:6-7

   6. That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
   ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

   6. Qui bibunt in phialis vinum, et primitiis oleorum sese ungunt, et
   non condolescunt super contritionem Joseph.

   7. Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive,
   and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.

   7. Propterea nunc transferentur (voluentur) in capite migrantium, et
   veniet luctus extensorum (est deductum ab eodem verbo jrs; diximus
   plura significare sed accipio pro extendere; et aliquid rursus dicendum
   erit in fine.)


   Amos now reproaches the chiefs of both kingdoms for drinking wine in
   bowls, that is, in vessels either elegantly formed or precious. Some
   think "silver" to be understood "in vessels of silver:" but there is no
   need of regarding any thing as understood in the Prophet's words. The
   meaning is, that those men were sufficiently convicted of brutish
   stupidity, inasmuch as they did not forsake their indulgences, when God
   manifested his terrible vengeance. Since God then did thus what tended
   to humble them, their madness and blindness were conspicuous enough;
   for they indulged themselves, they drank wine according to their usual
   custom, when they ought to have betaken themselves, as we have said, to
   fasting, lamentation, and mourning, to sackcloth and ashes.

   They drank wine in bowls, and further, they anointed themselves with
   the chief ointments Christ, we know, was anointed at least twice, (Luke
   7:38 Matthew 26:7) and this practice was not blamed in David, nor in
   king Hezekiah, nor in others. Since then anointing was not in itself
   sinful, we see that the Prophet must have something particular in view.
   He meant to show, that when God manifested tokens of his wrath, nothing
   then remained for those who were conscious of having done evil, but
   humbly to abstain, like guilty persons, from all indulgences, that they
   might, by fasting and mourning, excite the mercy of God: as the
   Israelites had not done this, the Prophet expostulated with them. There
   is no need of seeking, any other interpretation of this place.

   For he immediately subjoins, that they grieved not for the bruising of
   Joseph These words are to be read in connection with the former, and
   ought to be applied to the whole discourse. The Prophet then does not
   specifically blame the Jews and Israelites because they drank wine in
   bowls, because they anointed themselves with the best and most precious
   ointment, because they reposed on ivory beds, because they extended
   themselves on their couches, because they ate the best meat; but
   because they securely indulged in such delights, and grieved not for
   the distress of their brethren, for God had miserably afflicted the
   whole kingdom before their eyes. How much had four tribes already
   suffered? and how much the whole land and those who lived in the
   country? Ought God to have spared any longer these chiefs? It is indeed
   certain, that those who were still free from these calamities were
   especially culpable. Since then they did not consider the wrath of God,
   which was evident enough before their eyes, it was a proof of stupidity
   wholly insane, and showed them who still indulged themselves to have
   been utterly besides themselves.

   We now then understand the full meaning of the Prophet; and hence he
   says, They shall emigrate at the head of the emigrants, that is, "when
   there shall be an emigration, they shall be the first in order of time.
   I have hitherto indulgently spared you; but as I see that you have
   abused my forbearance, ye shall certainly be the forerunners of others;
   for ye shall go first into captivity. And my rigor shall begin with
   you, because I see that I have hitherto lost all my labor in
   attempting, kindly and paternally to call you to repentance. Ye shall
   now then migrate at the head of the emigrants

   And come shall the mourning of those who extend themselves, srvchym,
   saruchim [43] ; that is, "Ye indeed lie down, (as he had said before,)
   ye extend yourselves on your couches; but mourning shall come to you.
   Ye think that you can escape punishment, when ye repose quietly on your
   beds; but though your chambers be closed, though ye move not a finger,
   yet mourning shall come to you." We now see the connection between the
   words, mourning and resting in idleness and indulgence. The word srch,
   sarech, means indeed properly to recumb; and hence some render the
   passage, "Mourning shall rest on you:" but the more received meaning
   is, Mourning shall come on you while recumbing. Though then they
   stretched out themselves on their beds, that they might pleasantly and
   softly recumb and rest themselves, yet mourning would come to them,
   that is, would enter into their chambers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] The words are vsr mrzh srvchym, usar merezach saruchim, -- an
   instance of striking alliteration. But Calvin's rendering, though
   amounting in its general import to the same thing, is certainly not the
   correct one. sr never means to come, but the reverse, to depart. To
   decline, to turn aside or away, or to depart, is its common
   signification. Then mrzh is properly shouting, either for grief or for
   joy; here evidently for the latter; and it may be rendered here mirth;
   so the clause may be thus translated -- And depart shall the mirth of
   the recumbents,
   or, of those who stretch themselves. Dr. Henderson's version is the
   following: -- And the shouting company of those that recline shall
   depart. The translation of Symmachus is, "Taken away shall be the
   company of the voluptuous, hetaireia trupheton" The idea of "banquet"
   for the word here used, is what the Rabbins have given to it. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou showest thyself at this day to be
   justly offended with us, and our own consciences reprove us, inasmuch
   as dreadful tokens appear, by which we may learn how much and in how
   many ways we have provoked thy wrath, -- O grant, that we may be really
   touched with the consciousness of our evils, and being afflicted in our
   hearts, may be so humbled, that without any outward affliction, we may
   wholly submit ourselves to be reproved by thee, and at the same time
   flee to that mercy which is laid up for us, and which thou daily
   offerest to us in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

   Amos 6:8

   8. The Lord God hath sworn by himself, saith the Lord the God of hosts,
   I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I
   deliver up the city with all that is therein.

   8. Juravit Dominus Jehova per animam suam, dicit Jehova, Deus
   exercituum, Detestor ego excellentiam Jacob, palatia ejus odio habeo,
   et tradam urbem et plenitudinem ejus.


   God here declares that he would not desist, because he had hitherto
   loaded his people with many benefits: for he had now changed his
   purpose, so that he would no longer continue his favors. And this was
   designedly added by the Prophet; for hypocrites, we know, grow
   hardened, when they consider what dignity had been conferred on them;
   for they think their possessions to be firm and perpetual: hence they
   become haughty towards God. Since then hypocrites act thus foolishly,
   the Prophet justly says that it would avail them nothing, that they had
   hitherto excelled in many endowments for God no longer regarded their
   excellency.

   The word g'vn, gaun, means in Hebrew pride and also excellency; but it
   is to be taken here in a good sense, as it is in many other places. In
   Isaiah 2:10, it cannot be taken otherwise than for glory, for it is
   applied to God. So also in Psalm 47:4, The glory of Jacob, whom I
   loved; he had fixed the inheritance of God.' The gifts of God ever
   deserve praise: hence the Prophet in this place inveighs not against
   pride; but, on the contrary, he shows that the Israelites were
   deceived; for they set up their excellency and nobility in opposition
   to God, as though they were to be thus exempt from all punishment. God
   then says that he had now rejected this excellency, which yet was his
   gift; but as the Israelites had abused his benefits, they were
   therefore to be esteemed of no account. The meaning then is, -- that
   there is no acceptance of persons before God, that the dignity which
   had been conferred on the people of Israel was now of no moment; for it
   was a mere mask: they were unworthy of adoption, they were unworthy of
   the priesthood and kingdom. It was then the same as if the Prophet had
   said, "I will judge you as the common people and heathens; for your
   dignity, of which ye are stripped, is now of no account with me." They
   had indeed long before departed from God; they were therefore wholly
   unworthy of being owned by God as his inheritance.

   I detest then the excellency of Jacob, and his palaces; that is, all
   the wealth with which they have been hitherto adorned. But the Prophet
   does not take either palaces or excellency in a bad sense; on the
   contrary, he shows that God's blessings are no safeguards to the
   wicked, so as to avoid the judgment which they deserve.

   He afterwards adds, I will deliver up the city and its fullness; that
   is, "Though ye are now full of wealth, I will empty you of all your
   abundance". Hence, I will deliver up the city together with its
   fullness, that is, its opulence.

   But that this threatening might not be slighted, the Prophet confirms
   it by interposing an oath. Hence he says, that God had sworn. And as we
   know that God's name is precious to him, it is certain that it was not
   in vain adduced here, but on account of the hardness and contumacy of
   those who were wont to set at nought all the prophecies, and were wont
   in particular to regard as nothing all threatenings. This was the
   reason why the Prophet wished thus to ratify what he had said: it was,
   that hypocrites might understand that they could not escape the
   vengeance which he had denounced. The form of swearing, as it is, may
   seem apparently improper; but God in this place puts on the character
   of man, as he does often in other places. He swears by his soul, that
   is, by his life, as though he were one of mankind. But we ought to
   accustom ourselves to such forms, in which God familiarly accommodates
   himself to our capacities: for what Hilary philosophizes about the
   soul, as though God the Father swore by his own wisdom, is frivolous:
   that good man certainly exposed his own doctrine to ridicule, while he
   was attempting to refute the Arians. "God the Father, he says, swears
   by his own wisdom. Now he who is wont to swear by himself, could not
   swear by an inferior; but wisdom is the only begotten Son of God: hence
   it follows, that the Son is equal to the Father." These things at first
   sight seem plausible; but they are puerile trifles.

   Let it then be observed, that God borrows from men this mode of
   swearing; as though he said, "If men be believed when swearing by their
   life, which yet is evanescent, of how much greater weight must that
   oath be, by which I pledge my own life?" Since God thus speaks, surely
   the whole world ought to tremble. We now apprehend the Prophet's
   design. Let us go on --

   Amos 6:9

   9. And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house,
   that they shall die.

   9. Et erit, si restabunt decem homines in domo una, morientur.


   The Prophet here amplifies the calamity, which was nigh the people; as
   though he had said, that God would not now take moderate vengeance on
   that reprobate people, for he did nothing by dealing moderately with
   them: there was therefore nigh at hand the heaviest vengeance, which
   would reduce the people to nothing. This is the import of the Prophet's
   words when he says, that ten, if remaining in the same house, would die
   But in naming ten survivors, he intimates that a slaughter had
   preceded, which had taken away either the half or at least some part of
   the family, since ten remained. At the same time this number shows how
   severe and dreadful a judgment of God awaited that people, that ten
   would be taken away together. But it rarely happens, even when a
   direful pestilence prevails, that so numerous a family entirely
   perishes; when three out of four, or six or five out of eight, are
   taken away, it is a diminution which usually greatly terrifies men: but
   when ten are taken away together, and no one is left, it is an evidence
   of an awful vengeance.

   We see then that the Prophet here denounces on the people utter ruin,
   for they could not be reformed by milder punishments: when God tried to
   recall them to a sane mind, he effected nothing. There was therefore no
   remedy for their desperate diseases: it was hence necessary entirely to
   take away those who were thus incurable. Perish then shall the ten, who
   shall remain in one house It follows --

   10. Et tollet eum patruus ejus et avunculus ejus (vel, comburet eum) ad
   tollendum ossa e domo, et dicet ad eum qui erit in lateribus domus, An
   adhuc quispiam tecum? et dicet, Finis est (ad verbum, nihil;) et dicet,
   Tace; quia non licet recordari nominis Jehovae.


   In the beginning of the verse the Prophet expresses more clearly what
   he had just said, -- that the pestilence would be so severe as to
   consume the whole family: for when he speaks of an uncle coming to bury
   the dead, he shows, that unless neighbors performed their duty, bodies
   would remain without the honor of a burial: but this never happened,
   except during extreme devastation; for though the pestilence destroyed
   many in the same city, there were yet always some who buried the dead.
   When therefore it was necessary for uncles to perform this office, it
   was evident how great the calamity would be. This the Prophet meant to
   express in these words, His uncle shall take him away; that is, his
   uncle shall take away each of the dead. But this office, being servile,
   as I have said, was wont to be committed to mercenaries; and when a
   father or an uncle was constrained to do this, it was a proof of great
   confusion.

   An uncle then shall come and take him away srph, shireph, means to
   burn; it is written here with s, but the change of s into s is well
   known. Hence, many render the words, and shall burn him in order to
   take away his bones; and this interpretation seems to suit the place.
   Then it is, "he will burn him, that he may carry his bones out of the
   house". Dead bodies, as it is well known, were usually carried forth
   and burnt publicly. But as one man could not carry out a dead body
   especially an old man, and Amos mentions an uncle, he says, that
   another plan would be necessary, that the uncle would burn his nephews
   at home, that he might have the bones only to carry out, as he could
   not carry forth their dead bodies. This seems to me to be the real
   meaning of the Prophet. For they who explain this of a maternal uncle,
   have no reason on their side: it was enough to mention one only when
   men were so few. If indeed a maternal uncle be added to the paternal
   one, a great number of men would seem to have been still remaining. But
   when mention is made only of one uncle, this circumstance agrees best
   with what I have stated. An uncle shall come, he shall take him; and
   then, he will burn him that he may carry forth his bones. The bones
   could be easier carried out when the body was burnt, for the burden was
   not so heavy. We now then perceive the meaning of the words.

   It follows, And he will say to him who shall be at the sides of the
   house. By the sides of the house, understand the next dwellings. He
   will then inquire, Is there yet any one with thee? that is, Is any one
   of thy neighbors alive? We cannot indeed explain the sides of the house
   as meaning the inner parts of the house, except one understands a
   reference to be made to strangers or lodgers, as though the Prophet
   said, "If there will be any lodger, he will seek retreat in some corner
   of the house." Then the uncle, when the whole house had become
   desolate, should he by chance meet a guest, says, "Is there any one
   with thee? And he shall say, There is an end", or a decay. Though there
   be some ambiguity in the words, we yet see what the Prophet meant, and
   what he had in view. He indeed confirms what he had previously declared
   in the person of God, which was, -- that though ten remained alive in
   one house, yet all of them would die together, so that there would not
   be, no not one survivor; for the uncle, on inquiring respecting his
   nephews, whether any remained, would hear, that there was an end, that
   all had perished together. Now, the design of these words was to strike
   men with terror; for we know how great their stupidity is, as long as
   God spares them: but when they feel his hand, they then dread, though
   they are not moved by any threatenings. This, then, is the reason why
   the Prophet denounces here at large on the Israelites the dreadful
   judgment, which they would not dread, being, as we have seen, extremely
   secure and thoughtless.

   It follows, And he will say; Be silent; for it is not meet to mention
   the name of Jehovah This place is differently explained. Some think
   that their extreme wickedness is here noticed, that those who died,
   even in their last moments, would not mention the name of God. They
   thus then expound the words, -- "Be silent," as though it were the
   expression of one indignant or of one who denied God. Be silent, then;
   for they remembered not the name of God, that is, those whom God would
   have humbled, repented not of their perverseness; even death itself
   could not bring them to the right way. Others give this exposition: Be
   silent, for it is not meet to mention the name of God; that is, "What
   can God's name do to us? for we abhor it as a bad and an unhappy omen;
   for God brings us no joy". The wicked dread the name of God, and wish
   it to be wholly obliterated. But it seems to me that the Prophet's
   design is another, which interpreters have not sufficiently weighed. We
   first find that the hypocrites, whom he reproves, boasted of God's
   name; for they said in adversity that it was the day of the Lord, as
   though they expected a change for the better. The Prophet now says,
   that the time would come when this boasting would cease, for they would
   perceive that God was offended with them, and they would no longer
   falsely pretend his name, as they had been wont to do. There is then a
   contrast to be understood between what is here said, and what is said
   in a former verse. The Prophet had previously inveighed against their
   rash vaunting, when they pretended the name of God without any shame,
   "O! we are God's people, we are a holy nation, we are God's heritage".
   As, then, they were become thus arrogant, and yet had cast away God far
   from them, the Prophet now says, "These delusions shall then cease, by
   which ye now deceive yourselves; God will not suffer you wickedly to
   abuse his name, as we have ever hitherto done; and ye still go on in
   this iniquity. Ye shall at that time," he says, "be silent respecting
   God's name; yea, it will be a dread to you."

   We now apprehend the Prophet's object: he means that such would be the
   grievousness of this last calamity, that the Israelites would really
   find that God was an enemy incensed against them, so that they would
   cast aside the false glorying which filled them with pride; yea, that
   they would dread the very name of God, for they would know that nothing
   would be better for them than to be hid from his presence. As it is
   said of the reprobate,

   They will say to the mountains, Cover us;
   and to the hills, Bury us,'
   (Revelation 6:16)

   so also in this place, the Prophet says, that when hypocrites shall be
   struck and seriously frightened by God's judgments, their false
   vauntings will continue no longer; for they would find that to be near
   God is to be near destruction. Be silent, then, for there is no reason
   for us to remember the name of Jehovah. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 6:11

   11. For, behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house
   with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

   11. Quia ecce Jehova praecipiens et percutiet domum magnum mixtionibus
   (vel, contritionibus,) et domum parvam rimis (vel, rupturis, aut,
   scissionibus, ut vertunt, vel, scissuris.)


   This verse is added only to confirm the former sentence. The Prophet
   indeed intimates, that the common people, as well as the chiefs, in
   vain trusted in their quiet state; for the Lord would destroy them all
   together, from the highest to the lowest. Behold, Jehovah, he says,
   commands etc.; by using the word commands, he means, that God had many
   reasons why he should take away and destroy them all. But he goes
   farther than this, and intimates that their destruction was dependent
   on the sole will of God; as though he said, "Though the Lord may not
   send for ministers of vengeance, though he may not prepare great
   forces, yet his word only, whenever it shall go forth, will consume you
   all." We now then perceive what the Prophet means by the word
   "commands."

   He afterwards adds, He will smite the great house with confusions, or,
   according to some, with breaking rss, resas, means properly to mingle.
   The Prophet therefore, I doubt not, refers here to those dreadful falls
   which commonly happen to great and splendid palaces. When a cottage is
   overturned so great a ruin is not occasioned by its weight; nay, when
   its ruin begins to appear, fragments fall down one after another, so
   that the whole work falls without any violence. This, I say, is the
   case with small and common houses; but when there is a great building,
   its downfall is tremendous. I am therefore inclined to render the word
   "confusion," and the difference between small and great houses will
   then be more evident. Great houses then shall be smitten with
   confusions, (mixtionibus, with minglings) but small houses shall be
   smitten with fissures or clefts. But yet, as I have already reminded
   you, the Prophet means that there would be a ruin, both to the
   principal men and to the common people, so that they would all perish,
   from the least to the greatest. We hence learn how great was the
   corruption of that people; for God punishes none but the wicked. It
   then follows that equity was everywhere subverted and that all orders
   of men were become vicious and corrupt. It follows --

   Amos 6:12

   12. Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for
   ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into
   hemlock:

   12. An current in rupe equi? An arabitur bobus (est, an arabit quispiam
   in bobus; sed quia est verbum indefinitum, ideo verto impersonaliter,
   an ergo aratio fiet bobus, nempe in rupe?) quia vertistis in fel
   judicium et fructum justitiae in absynthium.


   This verse interpreters misrepresent; for some think that the Prophet,
   by these figurative expressions, means, that the people were wholly
   unprofitable as to any thing good; as some one says, "The slothful ox
   wishes for the saddle, the horse wishes to plough." They therefore
   suppose that this is the meaning of the words, "Ye are no more fitted
   to lead a good life than a horse is to run on a rock, or an ox to
   plough on a rock." Others think that the Prophet complains that the
   order of things was subverted as though he said, "Ye have alike
   confounded all equity government, and justice. In short, ye have
   subverted all right; as when one tries to ride swiftly over a high
   rock, or attempts to plough there, which is contrary to the nature of
   things: ye are therefore become monsters." Others, again, understand
   that the Prophet here complains that he had lost all his labor; for he
   had been singing, according to the common proverb, to the deaf. "What
   do I effect as to this iron generation? It is the same as if one tried
   to ride on the rock, to mount a rock on a swift horse; or as if one
   attempted to plough there; both which are impossible. So now, when I
   address stupid men, there is no fruit to my labor, and no advantage is
   gained." [44]

   But let us see whether a fitter and a more suitable meaning can be
   elicited. We have already observed how secure the Israelites were; for
   they thought that God was, in a manner, bound to them, for he had
   pledged his faith to be a father to them. This adoption of God puffed
   up their hearts. The Prophet now reproves this presumptuous security;
   and, in a fitting manner, "Can a horse," he says, "run on a rock? and
   can an ox plough in a stony place? So there is not among you a free
   course to God's blessings. Ye ought indeed to have been the vineyard
   and the field of the Lord; justice and judgment ought to have reigned
   among, you but ye have turned judgment into gall (r's, rash, which is
   variously taken, but as to the sense it matters but little,) ye have
   then turned judgment into gall, and righteousness into hemlock Since
   then ye are so perverse, a way for God's blessings is doubtless closed
   up. It cannot be that the Lord will act towards you in a manner like
   himself; for he must necessarily be refractory towards the refractory,
   as he is gentle towards the gentle". The Prophet seems to me to mean
   this and if any one impartially considers the whole verse, he will
   easily find out the truth of what I have stated, namely, that the
   Prophet here reproves the supreme haughtiness of the Israelitic people,
   who thought God bound to them though, at the same time, they, as it
   were, designedly provoked his wrath. "Ye think", he says, "that God
   will be always propitious to you; whence is this confidence? Is it
   because he has adopted you, because he made a covenant with your
   fathers? True he has done so; but what sort of covenant was it? What
   was engaged on your part? Was it not that ye would be perfect before
   him? But ye have turned judgment into gall, and righteousness into
   hemlock [45] Since then ye are thus covenant-breakers, what can God now
   do? Do you wish him to proceed in the same course, and to bestow on you
   his blessings? Ye do not allow them to be bestowed. For ye are become
   like craggy rocks. How can God proceed in his course? how can he
   continue his benefits to you? He can certainly no more do so than a
   horse, however nimble he may be, can run swiftly on a rock or an ox
   plough on a rock." We now understand what the Prophet means in this
   place. A confirmation of this view now follows, and from this
   connection the truth of what I have stated will become more evident.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] This is the view taken by Matthew Henry, and seems not unsuitable.
   "The methods used for their reformation," he says, "have been all
   fruitless and ineffectual. Shall horses run, etc. No; for there will be
   no profit to countervail the pains. God has sent them his prophets to
   break up their fallow ground; but they found them as hard and
   inflexible as the rock, rough and rugged, and they could do no good
   with them, nor work upon them, and therefore they shall not attempt it
   any more." -- Ed.

   Amos 6:13

   13. Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken
   to us horns by our own strength?

   13. Gaudetis in non re (hoc est, in nihilo,) dicitis, Annon in
   fortitudine nostra sustulimus nobis coronua?


   This verse will seem better connected with the last, if we bear in mind
   the view to which I have referred: for the Prophet inveighs again
   against the careless contempt with which the Israelites were filled. Ye
   rejoice, he says, in a thing of nought A thing of nought he calls those
   fallacies, by which they were wont to deceive, not only others, but
   also their own selves. For hypocrites not only falsely pretend the name
   of God, but also deceive themselves by self flatteries, when they
   arrogate to themselves the name of Church, and the empty title of
   adoption and other things. We see this to be the case at this day with
   the Papists, who are puffed up with nothing; who not only with
   sacrilegious audacity twist the Word of God against us, that they may
   appear to be the true Church, but also harden themselves: and though
   they are ill at ease with themselves, they yet lull themselves asleep
   by such deceptions as these, "God could not have suffered his Church to
   err; we have indeed succeeded the apostles: and though there are among
   us many vices and corruptions, yet God abides with us; and all who
   think not with us are schismatic; nay, though we may be supported by no
   reasons, yet their defection is not to be borne with. Let us then
   continue in our own state, for the Lord approves of our hierarchy."
   Thus the Papists not only deal in trifles to deceive the ignorant, but
   also harden themselves against God. Such was the blindness of the
   people of Israel. Hence the Prophet here reproves them, because they
   rejoiced in nothing; In no word,' he says, for so it is; but it means
   that they rejoiced in nothing; for they involved themselves in mere
   fallacies, and thus set up their empty delusions in opposition to God
   and his judgments.

   Who say, have we not in our own strength raised up for ourselves horns?
   Horns, we know are taken in Hebrew for eminence, for strength, for
   elevation, or for any sort of defense. Hence the expression means the
   same as though they had said, "Are we not more than sufficiently
   fortified by our own strength?" It is however certain that they did not
   say this openly; but as the Prophet possessed the discernment of the
   Holy Spirit, he penetrated into their hearts and brought out what was
   hid within. We indeed know this to be the power of the word, as the
   apostle teaches in the fourth chapter to the Hebrews: for the word
   partakes of the nature of God himself, from whom it has proceeded; and
   as God is a searcher of hearts, so also the word penetrates to the
   marrow, to the inmost thoughts of men, and distinguishes between the
   feelings and the imaginations. This spiritual jurisdiction [46] ought
   therefore to be noticed, when the Prophets allege against the ungodly
   such gross blasphemies; for it is certain that they had not actually
   pronounced the words used by the Prophet; but yet their pride had no
   other meaning, than that they had raised horns to themselves by their
   own strength. They were indeed separated from the Lord; in the meantime
   they wished to abide safe through their own power. What did they mean?
   They had become alienated from God, and yet they sought to be in a
   state of safety, and thought themselves to be beyond any danger. Whence
   came this privilege? For they certainly ought to have sheltered
   themselves under God's shadow, if they wished to be safe. But as they
   renounced God, and despised all his instructions, nay, as they were
   manifestly his enemies, whence was this safety to come, which they
   promised to themselves, except they sought to derive their strength
   from themselves?

   We now perceive the Prophet's design: He reproves the Israelites for
   being content with a false and empty title and for heedlessly despising
   God, and for only pretending a form of religion instead of its reality;
   it was this so gross a vice that he condemned in them: and he shows at
   the same time, that they put on horns by which they assailed God; for
   while they were separated from him, they promised to themselves a
   secure and happy state. It at length follows --

   Amos 6:14

   14. But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
   Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you
   from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

   14. Certe, ecce tollo contra vos, domus Israel, dicit Jehova, Deus
   exercituum, gentem; et coarctabunt vos ab introitu Hemath usque ad
   torrentem campestrem.


   At last follows a denunciation, and this is the close of the chapter.
   God then after having seriously exposed the vices which prevailed among
   the people of Israel, again declares that vengeance of which he had
   shortly before reminded then; but with this difference only -- that God
   now points out the kind of punishment which he would inflict on the
   Israelites. He had said before, Behold God commands;' and then he had
   spoken of calamity, but expressed not whence that calamity would come:
   but he now points it out in a special manner, Behold he says I am
   raising up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, who will straiten
   you from the entrance into Hemath to the river, etc. The Prophet no
   doubt speaks here of the Assyrians, and expresses in strong terms how
   dreadful the war with the Assyrians would be, which was now nigh at
   hand; for though large was their land and country, (and being large and
   spacious it had many outlets,) yet the Prophet shows that there would
   be everywhere straits, when the Lord would raise up on high that nation
   I am then stirring up a nation against you.

   He again calls the Lord, the God of hosts, for the same reason as
   before, -- that they might understand that all the Assyrians were at
   God's disposal, and that they would stir up war whenever he gave them a
   signal. The Lord then will raise up a nation, who will straiten you In
   what place? He speaks not here of strait places, but of a spacious
   country, which, as it has been stated, had many outlets. But after the
   Lord had armed against them the Assyrians, all the most spacious places
   were made strait to them, "Ye shall be everywhere confined, so that
   there will be open no escape from death."

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we are extremely deaf to those so many
   holy warnings by which thou continuest to recall us to thyself, and
   since we ever harden ourselves against those threatenings, by which
   thou terrifiest us, that thou mayest break or at least correct our
   hardness, -- O grant, that we may, though late, yet in time, before
   final vengeance comes, attend to thy word and submit ourselves to thee,
   and in a teachable spirit undertake thy yoke, that thou mightest
   receive us into favor, and vouchsafe to us thy paternal kindness, and
   being at length reconciled to us, thou might grant us thy blessings,
   which thou hast promised to all thy children, who are the members of
   thy only begotten Son our Lord. Amen.

   Amos 7:1-3

   1. Thus hath the Lord God shewed [47] unto me; and, behold, he formed
   grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
   and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.

   1. Sic ostendit mihi Dominus, et ecce formans locustas principio
   ascensionis herbae (hoc est, quum incipit herba ascendere: lqs, proprie
   significat secundam herbam, quam vocamus, Regian) et ecce herba post
   sectiones (vel, tonsuras, ut alii vertunt) Regis.

   2. And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
   grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: by
   whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

   2. Et factum est dum perficeret ad comendendum (hoc est, quum jam fere
   in totum absumpsisset herbam terrae,) tunc dixi, Adonai Jehova, parce,
   obsecro: quis stabit (vel, quis restituet) Jacob, quia parvus est?

   3. The Lord repented for this: It shall not be, saith the Lord.

   3. Poenituit Jehovam super hoc; Non erit, dixit Jehova.


   Amos shows in this chapter that God had already often deferred the
   punishments which he had yet determined to inflict on the people; and
   thus he reminds the Israelites of their perverseness, inasmuch as they
   had abused the forbearance of God, and repented not after a long lapse
   of time: for God had suspended his judgments for this end -- that they
   might willingly return to the right way, as he commonly allures men by
   his kindness, provided they be teachable. Since then this forbearance
   of God had been without fruit, Amos reproves the Israelites, though he
   had also another object in view: for ungodly men, we know, when God
   spares them and does not immediately indict the punishments they
   deserve, laugh at them, and harden themselves for the future, so that
   they fear nothing; and when the Lord threatens, and does not instantly
   execute his vengeance, they then especially think that all threatening
   are mere bugbears; and therefore they harden their minds in security
   and think that they can with impunity trifle with God. Inasmuch then as
   this obstinacy prevailed among the Israelites, the Prophet here shows
   in various ways, that in vain they gloried, and thus securely despised
   the judgment of God; for though the Lord for a time had spared them,
   yet the final vengeance was not far distant. This is the sum of the
   whole: but such expression must be considered in its order.

   A vision, he says, had been shown to him by the Lord; and the vision
   was, that God himself had formed locusts. Yet some think yvtsr, iutsar,
   to be a noun, and render it, creation; others, a swarm or a troop. But
   these are forced expositions. The Lord then, I doubt not, formed
   locusts in the Prophet's presence, which devoured all the grass. He
   therefore says, when the grass began to grow, that is, after the
   cuttings of the king Here also expounders vary: some think that the
   shearings of the king are referred to, when the king had sheared his
   sheep. Others regard it as the mowing of hay; and they say, that the
   best grass was then cut for the use of the king, that he might feed his
   horses and his cattle. But these conjectures have nothing well-founded
   in them. I therefore doubt not, but the Prophet here calls that a royal
   cutting, when by a public order they began to cut their meadows. It is
   indeed credible that there was then some rule: as with us, no one
   begins the vintage at his own will, but a certain regular time is
   observed; so those cuttings, which were publicly done, were called
   royal; as the king's highway is called that which is public. But yet
   the Prophet, I think, refers under this figurative expression to the
   previous calamities, by which the people had been already reduced as to
   their number.

   But we must supply this prophecy or vision to its proper time. I doubt
   not, and I think that I can gather this from certain considerations,
   that the Prophet here compares the time which had preceded the reign of
   Jeroboam, the son of Joash, with the prosperous time which followed.
   For when Jeroboam the Second began to reign, the kingdom was laid
   waste, partly by hostile incursions, and partly by drought and heat, by
   inclement weather, or by pestilence. Since then the condition of the
   people, as sacred history relates, was most miserable, hence the
   Prophet says, that locusts had been shown to him, which devoured all
   the grass and standing corn: for he not only says, that locusts were
   formed, but also that they devoured the grass, so that nothing
   remained, When they had finished, he says, to eat the grass of the
   earth, then I said, Lord Jehovah, etc. Thus then the Prophet shows that
   sure tokens of God's wrath had then already appeared, and that the
   people had in part been already afflicted, but yet that God had
   afterwards given them time for repentance.

   Now by locusts I understand a moderate kind of punishment. We have seen
   elsewhere (Joel 1:4) that the country had been then nearly consumed by
   the locusts and the cankerworms, and the like pests. But in this place
   the Prophet metaphorically designates hostile invasions, which had not
   immediately laid waste the whole country but in some measure desolated
   it. This was indeed manifest to all, but few viewed it as the judgment
   of God, as also the Lord complains, that the perverse regard not the
   hand of the smiter, (Isaiah 10:3,4) Though then the Israelites saw
   their land consumed, they did not think that God was displeased with
   them; for ungodly men do not willingly examine themselves nor raise
   their eyes to heaven, when the Lord chastises them: for they would
   grow, as it were, stupid in their calamities rather than set before
   themselves the judgment of God, that they may be seriously led to
   repentance: this they naturally shun almost all. Hence the Prophet says
   that this was especially shown to him. The calamity then was known to
   all, and evident before the eyes of the people; but the Prophet alone,
   by a vision, understood that God in this manner punished the sins of
   the people: at the same time, the special object of the vision was, --
   to make the Israelites to know that the hand of God was withheld, as it
   were, in the middle of its work. They had seen the enemies coming, they
   had felt many evils; but they thought that the enemies retreated either
   through good fortune or some other means. They did not consider that
   God had spared them, which was the main thing. It was therefore shown
   to the prophet in a vision, that God spared his people, though he had
   resolved to destroy the whole land.

   And the Prophet expressly declares, that God had been pacified through
   his intercession and prayer: hence appears very clearly what I have
   already referred to, that is, that the Prophet condemns the unbelieving
   for having perversely trifled with God; for they regarded the
   threatening which they had heard from the mouth of Amos and of others
   as jests. Whence was this? Because God had spared them. The Prophet
   shows how this took place; "The Lord," he says, "had at first resolved
   to destroy you, but yet he waits for you, and therefore suspends his
   extreme vengeance, that by his kindness he may allure you to himself;
   and this has been done through my prayers: for though ye think me to be
   adverse to you, as I am constrained daily to threaten you, and as a
   heavenly herald to denounce war on you; I yet feel compassion for you,
   and wish you to be saved. There is, therefore, no reason for you to
   think that I am influenced by hatred or by cruelty, when I address you
   with so much severity: this I do necessarily on account of my office;
   but I am still concerned and solicitous for your safety; and of this
   the Lord is a witness, and the vision I now declare to you." We now see
   that God's servants had so ruled and moderated their feelings, that
   pity did not prevent them from being severe whenever their calling so
   required; and also, that this severity did not obliterate from their
   minds the feelings of compassion. Amos, as we have already seen,
   severely inveighed against the people, sharply reproved their vices,
   and daily summoned irreclaimable men to the tribune it of God: as he
   was so vehemently indignant on account at their vices, and as he so
   sharply threatened them, he might have appeared to have forgotten all
   compassion; but this place shows that he had not yet divested himself
   of pity, though he faithfully discharged his office, and was not
   diverted from his purpose, when he saw that he had to do with wicked
   and obstinate men. He was therefore severe, because God so commanded
   him; it was what his calling required; but at the same time he pitied
   the people.

   Let then all teachers in the Church learn to put on these two feelings
   -- to be vehemently indignant whenever they see the worship of God
   profaned, to burn with zeal for God, and to show that severity which
   appeared in all the Prophets, whenever due order decays, -- and at the
   same time to sympathize with miserable men, whom they see rushing
   headlong into destruction, and to bewail their madness, and to
   interpose with God as much as is in them; in such a way, however that
   their compassion render them not slothful or indifferent, so as to be
   indulgent to the sins of men. Indeed, the temper of mind which I have
   mentioned ought to be possessed, so that they may go forth as
   suppliants before God, and implore pardon for miserable and wretched
   men: but when they come to the people, in their new character, that
   they may be severe and rigid, let them remember by whom they are sent
   and with what commands, let them know that they are the ministers of
   God, who is the judge of the world, and ought not therefore to spare
   the people: this then is to be attended to by us.

   Now as to the word repent, as applied to God, let us know, as it has
   been elsewhere stated, that God changes not his purpose so as to
   retract what he has once determined. He indeed knew what he would do
   before he showed the vision to his Prophet Amos: but he accommodates
   himself to the measure of men's understanding, when he mentions such
   changes. It was then the eternal purpose of God, to threaten the
   people, to show tokens of his displeasure, and yet to suspend for a
   time his vengeance, that their perverseness might be the more
   inexcusable. But in the meantime, as this was without advantage, he
   sets forth another thing -- that he was already armed to execute his
   vengeance. God then does not relate what he had decreed, but what the
   Israelites deserved, and what punishment or reward was due to them.
   When, therefore, God begins to inflict punishment on sinners, it is as
   though he intended to execute fully his vengeance; he however forms a
   purpose in himself, but that is hid from us. As soon then as he lifts
   up his finger, we ought to regard it as owing to his mercy, that we are
   not instantly reduced to nothing; when it so happens, it is as though
   he changed his purpose, or as though he withheld his hand. This then
   ought to be borne in mind, when the prophet says, that God created
   locusts to devour all the grass, but that he suppliantly entreated God
   to put an end to this calamity. He then adds, that it repented God, not
   that there was any change of mind in God, but because God suddenly and
   beyond hope suspended the vengeance which was near at hand. It shall
   not then be

   With regard to the clause, Be propitious, I pray; how will Jacob rise
   up, or who will raise up Jacob? it appears that the Prophet saw no
   other remedy, except the Lord, according to his infinite goodness,
   forgave the people, and hence he prays for pardon. In the meantime, he
   shows that he prayed for the Church, "Lord," he says, "thy hand does
   not now pursue strangers, but an elect people, thy peculiar
   possession:" for by the name, Jacob, the Prophet extols the covenant
   which God made with Abraham and the Patriarchs; as though he said, "O
   God, wilt thou be inexorable towards the people whom thou hast chosen
   and adopted, of whom thou art the Father? Remember that they are
   neither Babylonians, nor Egyptians, nor Assyrians, but a royal
   priesthood, and thy holy and peculiar people." And there is nothing
   that inclines God more to mercy than the recollection of his gratuitous
   covenant, as we have elsewhere seen.

   He then says, that Jacob was small. He does not allege the worthiness
   of Jacob, or adduce any proof of excellency, but says that he was
   small; as though he said, "O Lord, thou drawest forth now thy power
   against miserable creatures, who are already enfeebled enough" for he
   calls him small, because he had been worn out by many calamities: and
   hence I said, that reference is here made to that miserable time, of
   which Scripture records, when it declares that the free as well as the
   captive were reduced to extreme distress, before Jeroboam the second
   began to reign. Then indeed God restored his people; but short was that
   favor; for immediately after the death of king Jeroboam, a sedition
   arose, which proved ruinous to the whole kingdom: his son Zachariah, as
   it is well known, was slain by Shallum, (2 Kings 15:8-10)

   How then will Jacob rise up? Some take the verb yqvm, ikum, [48] in a
   transitive sense, "Who will raise him up?" but others think it to be a
   neuter verb, "How will Jacob rise up?" that is, by what means will
   Jacob rise up? as my, mi, may be taken to mean, how, or by what means:
   How then will Jacob rise up? But this difference has little to do with
   the main point It is then enough to say, that the Prophet here speaks
   of the weakness of the people, that on this account God might be more
   ready to forgive them. It now follows --

   Amos 7:4-6

   4. Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord God
   called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat
   up a part.

   4. Sic ostendit mihi Dominus Jehova: et ecce vocans ad disceptandum in
   igne Dominus Jehova, et consumpsit (aut, voravit) abyssum magnam (et
   consumpta fuit possessio) (alii chlq vertunt partem agri; sed malo
   accipere pro tota possessione.

   5. Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob
   arise? for he is small.

   5. Et dixi, Adonai Jehova, cessa, obsecro; quis (hoc est, quomodo)
   consurget Jacob? (vel, quis attollet, ut prius dictum est;) quia parvus
   est.

   6. The Lord repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord
   God.

   6. Poenituit Jehova super hoc; Etiam hoc non erit, dicit Dominus
   Jehova.


   The Prophet shows that God had not once only spared the people, but
   that when he was again prepared for vengeance, he still willingly
   deferred it, that, if possible, the people might willingly recover
   themselves: but as all were unhealable, this forbearance of God
   produced no fruit. Now as to the words of the Prophet, we see that a
   heavier punishment is designated by the similitude of fire, than by
   what he said before when he spoke of locusts. We stated that by locusts
   is to be understood ordinarily a moderate punishment, one not so
   dreadful at first sight. For though the want and famine introduced by
   locusts, when they consume all kinds of fruit, are most grievous evils;
   yet fire sometimes strikes people with much greater dread. Hence the
   Prophet shows by mentioning fire, that God had become very indignant,
   having seen that the people had hardened themselves and could not be
   reformed by common and usual remedies. The Lord's usual mode of
   proceeding, as he declares everywhere in Scriptures is this: At first
   he tries to find whether men are capable of being healed, and applies
   not the most grievous punishment, but such as may be endured; but when
   he perceives in sinners hardness and obstinacy, he doubles and trebles
   the punishment, yea, as he says by Moses, he increases his judgments
   sevenfold (Deuteronomy 28:25.) Such then was the manner which Amos now
   records; for God at first created the locusts, and then he kindled a
   fire, which consumed the great deep, and devoured their possession.

   The point, denoting a participial form in the word here used, shows
   that they are mistaken who render yvtsr, iutsar, creation, of which we
   have spoken before; for the point here corresponds with that in yvtsr,
   iutsar, [49] . In both places the Lord shows himself to be the author
   of punishment, which is wont to be ascribed to chance; for men imagine
   that evils proceed from something else rather than from God. Hence it
   was necessary for this to be distinctly expressed, as the Prophet does
   also, when he says that locusts had been created by God, and that fire
   had been kindled by him.

   God then called to contend by fire. It was not without a design that
   the Prophet uses the verb rvv, rub, which yet expositors have not duly
   weighed. For he indirectly condemns the hardness of the people,
   inasmuch as the Lord had already not only chastised the vices of the
   people, but had also contended with men depraved and obstinate: as when
   no justice can be obtained, a litigation becomes necessary; so the
   Prophet says here, that God was coming prepared with fire, to contend
   with the stubbornness of the people. The great deep, he says, was
   consumed by this fire. Hence what I have already said becomes more
   evident, -- that a more dreadful punishment is here described than in
   the first vision. The locusts devoured the grass only but the fire
   penetrates into the utmost deep; it consumes and destroys not only the
   surface of the earth, but burns up the very roots, yea, it descends to
   the center and consumes the whole earth. They who render chlq, chelak,
   a part, do not sufficiently attend to the design of the Prophet, for he
   concludes that the surface of the earth had been laid waste, because
   the very gulfs had not escaped the burning. And when the fire reaches
   to the very bowels of the earth, how could their possession stand,
   which was also exposed to the heat of the sun? We see how the earth is
   burnt up by heat, when the sun is scorching at Midsummer. We now
   perceive the Prophet's design.

   He adds, that God was again pacified. We must ever bear in mind the
   object he had in view; for ungodly men thought the Prophets to be
   liars, whenever God did not immediately execute the vengeance he had
   denounced: but Amos here reminds them, that when God defers punishment,
   he does not in vain threaten, but waits for men to repent; and that if
   they still go on in abusing his patience, they will have at last to
   feel how dreadful is the vengeance which awaits all those who thus
   pervert the goodness of God, who hear not God inviting them so kindly
   to himself. This is the meaning. It follows --

   Amos 7:7-9

   7. Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a
   plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

   7. Sic ostendit mihi: et ecce Dominus stabat (stans) super murum
   perpendiculi, et in manu ejus perpendiculum.

   8. And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A
   plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the
   midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

   8. Et dixit Jehova mihi, Quid tu vides Amos? Et dixi, Perpendiculum.
   Tunc dixit Dominus, Ecce ego pono perpendiculum in medio populi mei
   Israel: non adjiciam amplius ut transeam ipsum:

   9. And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries
   of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of
   Jeroboam with the sword.

   9. Et destruentur excelsa Isaac, et evertentur (excidentur) sanctuaria
   Israel; et surgam super domum Jeroboam in gladio.


   This vision opens more clearly to us what the Prophet meant before, and
   what was the object of his doctrine: his intention was to show the
   people that what they had gained by their obstinacy was only to render
   God implacable, and to cause him not to spare them any longer, as he
   had hitherto done. The meaning is, -- "God has hitherto borne with you
   according to his own goodness, promise not to yourselves that he will
   ever deal in the same manner with you; for your contumacy and
   waywardness has provoked him. As he sees you to be beyond measure
   obstinate, he must now necessarily execute on you final vengeance.
   There is therefore now no forgiveness provided for you; but as ye are
   incurable, so the Lord on his part will remain unchangeable in the
   rigor of his judgment, and will by no means turn to mercy."

   Interpreters explain this vision in various ways, and refinedly
   philosophize on the word, plumbline; and yet frigid are almost all
   their refinements. Were I disposed plausibly to handle this passage, I
   would say, that the plumbline is the law of God; for it prescribed to
   his people a regular order of things, which might serve as a plumbline;
   inasmuch as all things were directed according to the best rule. I
   might speak thus; but I am not disposed to refine in this manner; for I
   doubt not but that God meant only that this would be the last
   measuring; for he would punish his people without any remission and
   without any delay. We now apprehend the Prophet's meaning: but all this
   will become more evident from the words of the passage.

   Thus he showed to me; and, behold, the Lord stood on a wall of a
   plumbline. The wall of a plumbline he calls that which had been formed
   by rule, as though he had said that it was a wall by a plumbline. God
   then stood on a plumbline-wall, and a plumbline, he says, was in his
   hand False then is what some interpreters say, that a plumbline was
   cast away by God, because he would no more perform the office of a
   mason in ruling his people. This is frivolous; for the Prophet
   testifies here expressly that a plumbline was in the hand of God.

   But that which follows has an important meaning: God asks his Prophet,
   What sees thou, Amos? It is probable that the Prophet was astonished at
   a thing so mysterious. When locusts were formed, and when there was a
   contention by fire, he might have easily gathered what God meant; for
   these visions were by no means ambiguous: but when God stood on a wall
   with a plumbline, this was somewhat more hard to be understood; and the
   probability is, that the Prophet was made to feel much astonishment,
   that the people might be more attentive to hear his vision, as we
   commonly apply our thoughts more to hidden things; for we coldly attend
   to what we think to be easily understood; but mysteriousness, or
   something difficult to be known, sharpens our minds and attention. I do
   not then doubt but that God made the Prophet for a time to feel amazed,
   with the view of increasing the attention of the people. What then dost
   thou see, Amos? A plumbline, he says: but, at the same time, he knew
   not what was the meaning of this plumbline, or what was its design.
   Then God answers, Behold, I set a plumbline in the midst of my people;
   that is, I fix this to be the last rule, or the final measure, and I
   will not add any more to pass by them As God had twice leaped over the
   bounds of his judgment by sparing them, he says, now that the last end
   was come, "I will proceed no farther," he says, "in forgiving them: as
   when a wall is formed to the plumbline, that no part may, in the least,
   exceed another, but that there may be regularity throughout so also
   this shall be the last order; this measuring shall be true and just. I
   will pass by them no more." This, I have no doubt, is the real meaning
   of the Prophet. We now also perceive the design of the other two
   visions to have been to prevent the Israelites from deceiving
   themselves by false self-flatteries, because God was kind and favorable
   to them. He shows that he dealt so with them, not because they were
   just; for God had already begun to execute his judgments on them; and
   the punishments with which they had been visited were strong evidences
   of their crimes: for God is not without reasons angry with men,
   especially with his chosen people. Since then they had been already
   smitten once and again, the Prophet proves that they were worthy of
   heavier punishments; and that punishments had been mild and moderated,
   was to be ascribed, he says, to the indulgence of God, because he was
   willing to forgive his people; but that the time had now come when he
   would no longer pardon them; for he saw that he had to do with
   irreclaimable obstinacy. This is the meaning.

   It now follows, And destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, and
   overthrown shall be the sanctuaries (some render palaces) of Israel;
   and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. The
   Prophet here distinctly declares, that the people in vain trusted in
   their temples and superstitions, for by these they kindled the more
   against themselves the wrath of God. He would not indeed have expressly
   threatened the high places and the temples, unless the Israelites had
   provoked in this way, as I have already said, the vengeance of God
   against themselves, inasmuch as they had corrupted the true and lawful
   worship of God.

   Destroyed then shall be the high places of Isaac It may be asked, Why
   does he mention here the name of Isaac, which is rarely done by the
   Prophets? And there is also a change of one letter; for the word Isaac
   is commonly written with ts, tsade, but here it is written with s,
   shin; but it is well known that s, shin and ts, tsade, are
   interchangeably used. It is, however, beyond dispute, that the Prophet
   speaks here of the holy man Isaac; and the reason seems to be plainly
   this, -- because the Israelites absurdly pretended to imitate their
   father in their superstitions; for temples, we know, had been erected
   where Isaac had worshipped God, and also their father Abraham and
   Jacob. Inasmuch then as the Israelites boasted of the examples of holy
   fathers, the Prophet here condemns this vain and false boasting. They
   who understand by the word Isaac, that the Prophet threatens the
   Idumeans as well as the Israelites, have no reason for their opinion;
   but the reason which I have already mentioned is quite sufficient.

   We indeed know, that the Israelites had ever in their mouths the
   examples of the fathers, like the woman of Samaria, who said to Christ,
   Our fathers worshipped in this mountain,' (John 4:20) So also the
   Israelites were wont formerly to allege, that the holy patriarchs
   worshipped God in those places, -- that God appeared in Bethel to holy
   Jacob, and also that in other places altars were built. Being armed
   with the examples of the fathers, they thought them to be their shield.
   The case is the same with the Papists in our day; when they hear of
   anything as having been done by the fathers, they instantly lay hold on
   it; but these are vain excuses. Like them were also the Israelites;
   hence the Prophet says, "Behold, ye gain nothing by this fallacious
   pretense; for destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, even those
   which are now covered by an honorable name: and at the same time the
   temples or palaces of Israel shall be overthrown.

   And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword We learn
   from this last clause that things were then, as we have stated
   elsewhere, in a prosperous state in the kingdom of Israel, though God
   had in various ways wasted it before Jeroboam: but they had been ever
   obstinate. He afterwards restored them to a better condition; for the
   state of the people greatly improved under Jeroboam: he recovered many
   cities enlarged the borders of his kingdoms and then the people, in
   their affluence began to grow wanton against God. As then the Prophet
   thus saw that they abused God's goodness, he denounced destruction on
   Jeroboam; hence he says, Against the house of Jeroboam I will rise up
   with the sword; that is, "I will begin to execute my judgment on the
   offspring of the king himself; though I may spare him, yet his
   posterity shall not escape my hand."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Almighty God, since thou so suspendest thy hand in chastising us, that
   except we be wholly blind and stupid, we must acknowledge that we are
   spared in order that we may willingly return to thee, and that being
   allured by the gentleness of thy forbearance, we may submit ourselves
   to thee in willing obedience, -- O grant, that we may not harden our
   hearts, nor be slow, nor slothful, nor even backward to repent, when
   thou deferrest extreme punishment, but strive to anticipate thy final
   vengeance, and so submit ourselves to thee, that we may be pardoned
   while it is time, and so hasten to offer our hearts whole and sincere
   to thee, and so repent, while urged by extreme danger, that there may
   not remain any hidden hypocrisy in our hearts, but that we may in such
   a way search every faculty of our soul, that thou mayest become to us a
   real and faithful witness of that integrity which thou requires of all
   who return to thee to obtain pardon through Jesus Christ our Lord.
   Amen.

   Amos 7:10-13

   10. Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
   saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of
   Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

   10. Et misit Amazias sacerdos Bethel ad Jeroboam regem Israel, dicendo,
   Conspiravit contra te Amos in medio domus Israel: non poterit terra
   sustinere omnes ejus sermones.

   11. For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel
   shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

   11. Quia sic dicit Amos, Gladio morientur Jeroboam; et Israel migrando
   migrabit e terra sua.

   12. Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into
   the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

   12. Et dixit Amazias ad Amos, Videns, vade, fuge (tibi, est
   supervacuum) in terram Jehudah; et comede illic panem et illic
   propheta:

   13. But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's
   chapel, and it is the king's court.

   13. Et in Bethel ne adjicias amplius prophetare, quia sanctuarium regis
   est, et domus regni est.


   The Prophet here relates the device by which Satan attempted to depress
   his mind, that he might not go on in the discharge of his prophetic
   office. He says, that Amaziah had sent to the king to induce him to
   adopt some severe measure; for he pretended that as Amos scattered
   words full of sedition, and made turbulent speeches, the affairs of the
   king could not be carried on, except the king in due time prevented
   him: and besides, the same Amaziah said, that nothing could be better
   for the Prophet than to flee into the land of Judah, as he might live
   in safety there; for he had incurred great danger in having dared to
   prophesy against the king. It hence appears that Amaziah was a
   perfidious and cunning man, but not so bloody as to attempt openly
   anything serious against the Prophet's life; unless perhaps he thought
   that this could not be done, and gave this advice, not so much through
   his kindness, as that the thing was impracticable: and this second
   supposition is probable from the words of the passage.

   For, in the first place the Prophet says, that Amaziah had sent to the
   king He then tried whether he could excite the king's mind to persecute
   Amos. It may be that his design did succeed: hence he undertook what in
   the second place is related, that is, he called the Prophet to himself,
   and tried to frighten him, and drive him by fear from the land of
   Israel, that he might no longer be troublesome to them. But we must, in
   the first place, notice the motive by which this Amaziah was
   influenced, when he endeavored so much, by any means possible, to
   banish the Prophet from the kingdom of Israel. It is certainly not
   credible that he was influenced by what he pretended to the king, that
   there was a danger of sedition; but it was a pretense cunningly made.
   Amaziah then had a care for his own advantage, as we see to be the case
   in our day with cardinals and milted bishops who frequent the courts of
   princes, and do not honestly profess what their designs are; for they
   see that their tyranny cannot stand unless the gospel be abolished;
   they see that our doctrine threatens to become a cold and even an ice
   to their kitchens; and then they see that they can be of no account in
   the world, except they crush us. And what do they at the same time
   pretend? that our doctrine cannot be received without producing a
   change in the whole world, without ruin to the whole civil order,
   without depriving kings of their power and dignity. It is then by these
   malicious artifices that they gain favor to themselves. Such was the
   device of Amaziah, and such was his manoeuvre in opposing the Prophet
   Amos.

   Behold, he says to the king, he has conspired against thee qsr, kosher,
   is to bind, but, by a metaphor, it signifies to conspire: Conspired
   then has Amos against thee. But who speaks? Amaziah; and the Prophet
   omits not the title of Amaziah; for he says that he was the priest of
   Bethel He might have only said, "Amaziah sent to king Jeroboam", but by
   mentioning that he was a priest, the Prophet shows that Amaziah did not
   strive for the peace of the public, as he pretended; and that this was
   therefore a fallacious pretense, for he fought for his own Helen, that
   is, he fought for his own kitchen, in short, for his living: for he
   would have been deprived, with disgrace, of his priesthood, and then
   reduced to penury and want, except he had driven away the Prophet Amos.
   Since then he saw that such and so great an evil was nigh him except
   Amos was banished, he had this object in view, and pretended another
   thing, and sent to the king and said, Amos has conspired; and he
   enhances the crime, In the midst of the house of Israel. "This is not
   done," he says "in a corners or in some obscure place; but his doctrine
   is heard on all the public roads, whole cities are filled with it; in
   short, it burns like fire in the very bosom, in the very midst of the
   kingdom; and thou wilt soon find thy own house to be all in a flame,
   unless thou applies a remedy, yea, except thou extinguishest it." We
   hence see how Amaziah acted, and the reason why he so earnestly
   persuaded the king to give liberty no longer to the Prophet Amos.

   With regard to what follows, -- that the land could no longer bear his
   words, the sentence admits of two probable meanings. The first is, that
   he said, that the people, being offended with his turbulent doctrine,
   did now of themselves hate and detest the Prophet Amos, as a seditious
   man. Kings are in our day stirred on in like manner, -- "Why do you
   delay? Your subjects desire nothing so much as to extinguish this evil,
   and all of them will eagerly assist you: ye are in the meantime idle,
   and your people complain of your tardiness. They think the princes in
   power are unworthy of their station, since they thus suffer the ancient
   rites and ordinances of holy Mother Church to fall into decay." So they
   speak: and we may imagine the words of Amaziah to have been in the same
   strain, -- that he stimulated the king by this artifice -- that the
   people were prepared to do their part. The other meaning is this, The
   land cannot bear his words; that is, "If he goes on here with full
   liberty to raise tumults, as he has begun, the whole kingdom will be on
   the verge of ruin, for many will follow him; and when an open sedition
   will arise, it cannot be checked without great difficulty. We must
   therefore make every haste, lest Amos should get the upper hand; for
   there is already the greatest danger." As the Pharisees held a
   consultation, and said,

   Lest the Romans come and take away our place and nation,'
   (John 11:48)

   so also Amaziah might have excited the king by causing him to fear,
   that the land, the country, or its inhabitants, had been disturbed by
   the words of Amos, and that therefore it was time to put a stop to him.
   Such was the message of Amaziah to the king.

   Now our Prophet is wholly silent as to the answer of the king: it is
   therefore probable, either that the king was not much excited, -- or
   that he dared not openly to take away the life of Amos; for he had
   probably obtained some authority among the people; and though he was
   hated, yet his name as a Prophet and his office were had in reverence,
   -- or that the matter was by agreement arranged between the two enemies
   of sound doctrine, as flatterers often gratify kings by putting
   themselves in their place, and by bearing all the ill will. However
   this might have been, it is certainly a probable conjecture, that the
   king did not interfere, because he was so persuaded by the priest
   Amaziah, or because he feared the people, or because religion
   restrained him, as even the ungodly are sometimes wont to contain
   themselves within the bounds of moderation; not that they are touched
   by real fear towards God, or that they desire to embrace his true
   worship: they wish God to be thrust down from heaven, they wish all
   knowledge of religion to be obliterated; but yet they dare not pour
   forth their fury. Such fear then might have seized the mind of
   Jeroboam, that he did not tyrannically rage against the Prophet Amos.
   But if we regard the tendency of the words of Amaziah, he certainly
   wished the Prophet Amos to be immediately visited with capital
   punishment; for conspiracy is a crime worthy of death; and then, fear
   might have impelled the king to put the holy Prophet immediately to
   death. Amaziah therefore expected more than what he attained: and then
   appeared his vulpine wiliness, for he sent for the Prophet and advised
   him to withdraw to the land of Judah. Hence, as I said at the
   beginning, it is very probable that Jeroboam was not excited according
   to the expectation of the ungodly priest of Bethel, who at first was a
   cruel wild beast; but when he could not proceed openly to destroy Amos,
   he put on a new character; he became a fox, because he could do nothing
   as a raging lion. Hence follows his second attempt, And Amaziah said to
   Amos, etc.

   I have passed over one clause in the last verse: Amos says, By the
   sword shall Jeroboam die, and Israel, by migrating, shall migrate from
   their own land. These, in short, are two heads of accusation. Some
   interpreters think that Amaziah had slanderously perverted the words of
   the Prophet Amos; for he did not denounce death on king Jeroboam, but
   only on his people and posterity: but I do not insist on this. It might
   then be, that Amaziah did not designedly pervert the words of Amos, but
   only wished to excite the ill will of the king. Die then shall Jeroboam
   or his posterity with the sword, and Israel also, by migrating, shall
   migrate from their own land. We hence learn, that Amaziah was not
   impelled only by the last address of the Prophet Amos, but that he then
   discovered the hatred which he had long harbored. Amaziah therefore had
   been, no doubt, on his watch, and had heard what Amos daily taught, and
   when he thought the matter ripe, he sent to the king. Having tried this
   way, and found that it did not answer, he came to his second attempt,
   which we are now to consider.

   Amaziah then said to Amos, -- that is, after his first proceeding
   disappointed him; for he did not obtain from king Jeroboam what he
   expected, -- then Amaziah said to Amos, Seer, go, flee to the land of
   Judah! By saying Go, he intimates that he was at liberty to depart, as
   though he said, "Why wouldest thou willfully perish among us?" At the
   same time, the two clauses ought to be joined together. He says first,
   Go, and then, flee When he says Go, he reminds him, as I have already
   said, that if he wished, he might go away, as no one prevented his
   departure: "Go, then, for the way is open to you." But when he says,
   flee, he means that he could not long remain safe there: "Except thou
   provident for thy life, it is all over with you: flee then quickly away
   from us, else thou art lost." We hence see how cunningly Amaziah
   assailed God's Prophet. He proposed to him an easy way of saving his
   life; at the same time he urged him with the fear of danger, and
   declared that he could not remain safe, except he immediately fled.
   These then were the two reasons which he used as mighty engines to
   depress the heart of the holy Prophet.

   He afterwards subjoins, And eat there thy bread This is the third
   argument. He might be allowed to live in his own country, and be
   supplied there with sustenance; for Amos was, as we have said, one of
   the shepherds of Tekoa. He must then have arisen from the tribe of
   Judah, and he had his habitation and his relations in that kingdom.
   Besides, Azariah was not an ungodly king: though not one of the most
   perfect, he yet respected and honored the servants of God. Hence, by
   saying, Eat there thy bread, Amaziah means that there was a safe
   residence for the Prophets in the kingdom of Judah, and that they were
   there esteemed both by the king and by the people, and that they might
   live there. This is the third argument.

   Now follows the fourth: "If thou dost object to me, and say that thou
   art a Prophet, and that it is neither lawful nor right in thee to be
   silent, be a prophet there. Thou knowest that prophets are attended to
   in the kingdom of Judah; thou mayest then perform thine office there,
   and live at liberty, and without fear." We hence see four of the
   reasons by which Amaziah attempted to persuade the Prophet Amos to
   leave the people of Israel, and to go to his own kindred.

   But there follows a fifth reason: But in Bethel prophesy no more; for
   the sanctuary of the king it is, and his court. Here Amaziah annoys the
   Prophet by another pretense, or he tries, at least, to shake his
   courage, by intimating that it was unbecoming to raise commotions in
   the kingdom of Israel, and also that, by so doing, he offended God,
   because Jeroboam was a divinely appointed king, and endued with the
   chief authority. Since then the king could, by his own right, institute
   new modes of worship, Amaziah here argues that it is not in the power
   of any one who pleased to pull down those rites which had been
   universally received, and then confirmed by a royal edict, but that
   they ought to be received without any dispute. We then perceive now the
   import of the whole.

   But it must be noticed in this place, that we must be watchful, not
   only against the open violence and cruelty of enemies, but also against
   their intrigues; for as Satan is a murderer, and has been so from the
   beginning, so he is also the father of lies. Whosoever then wishes
   strenuously and constantly to spend his labors for the Church and for
   God, must prepare himself for a contest with both: he must resist all
   fears and all intrigues. We see some not so fearful, though a hundred
   deaths were denounced upon them, who are yet not sufficiently cautious
   when enemies craftily insinuate themselves. I have not, therefore, said
   without reason, that God's servants have need of being fortified
   against both; that they ought to be prepared against the fear of death,
   and remain intrepid, though they must die, and that they ought to lay
   down their necks, if needs be, while performing their office, and to
   seal their doctrine with their own blood; -- and that, on the other
   hand, their ought to be prudent; for oftentimes the enemies of the
   truth assail them by flatteries; and the experience of our own times
   sufficiently proves this. More danger, I know, has ever been from this
   quarter; that is, when enemies attempt to terrify by such objections as
   these, "What is your purpose? See, the whole world must necessarily at
   length be consumed by calamities. What else do you seek, but that
   religion should everywhere flourish, that sound learning should be
   valued, that peace should prevail everywhere? But we see that the
   fiercest war is at hand: if once it should arise, all places would be
   full of calamities, savage barbarity, and cruelty, would follow, and
   religion would perish: all this ye will effect by your pertinacity."
   These things have often been said to us. When therefore we read this
   passage, we ought to notice the arts by which Satan has been trying to
   undermine the efforts of the godly, and the constancy of God's
   servants.

   As to the first argument, there is no need much of dwelling longer upon
   it; for every one can of himself perceive the design of all this crafty
   proceeding. He says first, Seer, go. Amaziah addresses Amos in a
   respectful way: he does not reproachfully call him, either an exile, or
   a seditious man, or one unlearned, or a cowherd, or a person unworthy
   of his office. He does not use any such language, but calls him a seer;
   he concedes to him the honorable title of a Prophet; for by the word
   chzh, chese, he means this "I confess thee to be God's Prophet: I grant
   that thou art a Prophet, but not our Prophet; Seer, then, go." We hence
   see that he left to him untouched the honor of being a Prophet, that he
   might more easily creep into his favor, lest by raising a dispute at
   first, there should be between them a violent contest: he therefore
   avoided all occasions of contention.

   It might however have been asked him, Why he was blind? For the office
   of a priest was to watch; and the Prophets were in such a manner joined
   to the priests, that when God substituted Prophets in their place, he
   indirectly charged them with idleness and indifference. For why were
   the priests appointed? That they might be the messengers of the Lord of
   hosts, as it is said by Malachi,

   The people shall seek from the mouth of the priest my law, for he is
   the messenger of the Lord of hosts,' (Malachai 2:7)

   Amaziah then ought especially to have performed himself the Prophet's
   office, for he was a priest. He was indeed, I allow, a spurious priest;
   but having claimed so honorable a name, he ought to have discharged its
   duties: this he did note and conceded that title to the Prophet. So now
   our milted bishops are very liberal in conceding titles, "O, Mr.
   Teacher, ye can indeed see and understand many things: but yet ye
   ought, at the same time, to consult the peace of the community." They
   call those teachers who have been invested with no public office, but
   are yet under the necessity of undertaking the duties of others, for
   they see that these milted bishops are dumb dogs. In a like manner,
   also, did Amaziah act towards the Prophet Amos; for he was content with
   his own splendor and great pomp, and with his own riches; he lived
   sumptuously, and enjoyed a rich booty, and superstitions well warmed
   his kitchen. He therefore easily surrendered to others the title of a
   Prophet: in the meantime, he prided himself on his priesthood.

   But as to the second argument, there was a sharper sting in it, Flee,
   he says. By flight he intimates, that it was necessary for the Prophet
   to depart, though he wished to remain. So this second reason was
   borrowed from necessity; for the Prophet could no longer be borne with,
   if he proceeded in the free discharge of his office. Flee then to the
   land of Judah, and there eat bread

   With regard to this third reason, he seems to imply that the Prophet
   Amos would be too pertinacious and too much wedded to his own opinion,
   if he preferred not to live safely and quietly in his own country,
   rather than to endanger his life in another land. Go then. Where would
   he send him? To his own country. Why? "Thou art here a foreigner, and
   sees thyself to be hated; why then dost thou not rather return to thine
   own country, where thy religion prevails?" Amaziah did not indeed
   address the Prophet Amos, as man of profane men do at this day, who are
   less like Epicureans than they are to swine and filthy dogs; for they
   object and say, "Thou mayest return to thine own country; why hast thou
   come to us?" They send us away to our own country, when they know that
   there is there no safe place for us. But at that time pure religion
   flourished in the land of Judah: hence Amaziah says, "Why dost thou not
   live with thy own countrymen? for there are many there who will supply
   thee with sustenance; the king himself will be thy friend, and the
   whole people will also help thee."

   As to the fourth argument, we see what a crafty sophist is the devil,
   Be a Prophet there Who speaks? Amaziah, who perfectly hated the temple
   at Jerusalem, who would have gladly with his own hands set it on fire,
   who would have gladly put to death all the pious priests; and yet he
   allows to holy Amos a free liberty to prophesy, and he allows this,
   because he could not immediately in an open manner stop the holy
   Prophet in his course: he therefore sends him away to a distance. We
   hence see that Satan, by various arts and means, tempts the servants of
   God, and has wonderful turnings and windings, and sometimes transforms
   himself into an angel of light, as it is said by Paul, (2 Corinthians
   11:14) and in this place we have a remarkable instance of this. Is not
   Amaziah an angel of light, when he advises the Prophet Amos to serve
   God freely in his own country, and to prophesy there, and to open his
   mouth in defense of God's worship and of pure religion? provided he did
   not do all this in the land of Israel. We have then in this chapter, as
   I have said, a remarkable instance of the wiliness of Satan.

   Now as to the fifth argument, it is especially needful to dwell on it.
   In Bethel, he says, add no more to prophesy, for it is the king's
   sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom Here only Amaziah shows
   what he wished, even to retain possession of his priesthood; which he
   could not have done without banishing the Prophet: for he could not
   contend with him in arguments. He consulted then his own advantage by
   getting rid of the Prophet. Whatever various characters therefore he
   assumed in the last verse, and notwithstanding the many coverings by
   which he concealed himself, the ape now, as they say, appears as the
   ape. Amaziah then shows what he had in views even that he might remain
   quiet in the possession of his own tyrannical powers and that Amos
   should no more molest him, and pull up by the roots the prevailing
   superstitions: for Amaziah was a priest, and Amos could not perform his
   office without crying out daily against the temple of Bethel; for it
   was a brothel, inasmuch as God was there robbed of his own honor; and
   we also know that superstitions are everywhere compared to fornication.
   Amaziah then now betrays his wicked intention, In Bethel prophesy not;
   he would retain his quiet state, and wished not the word of God to be
   heard there. His desire was, as we have already said, to extinguish
   everywhere the light of heavenly truth; but as he could not do this, he
   wished to continue at least in his own station without any disputes, as
   we see the case to be in our time with the Pope and his milted bishops.
   They became quite mad when they heard that many cities and some princes
   made commotions in Germany, and departed from their submission to them;
   but as they could not subdue them by force, they said, "Let us leave to
   themselves these barbarians; why, more evil than good has hitherto
   proceeded from them; it is a barren and dry country: provided we have
   Spain, France, and Italy, secured to us, we have enough; for we have
   probably lost more than what we have gained by Germany. Let them then
   have their liberty, or rather licentiousness; they will again some time
   return, and come under our authority: let us not in the meantime be
   over-anxious about them. But let not this contagion penetrate into
   France, for one of our arms has been already cut off; nor let Spain nor
   Italy be touched by it; for this would be to aim at our life." Such
   also was this Amaziah, as it evidently appears, -- Prophesy not then in
   Bethel.

   And he spoke cunningly when he said, Add no more to prophecy; for it
   was the same as though he pardoned him. "See, though thou hast hitherto
   been offending the king and the common feeling of the people, I will
   not yet treat you with strict justice, I will forgive thee all, let
   what thou hast done amiss remain buried, provided thou addest no more'
   in future." We hence see that there is emphasis in the expression, when
   he says, Proceed not, or, add not; as though he had said, that he would
   not inquire into the past, nor would accuse Amos of having been
   seditious: provided he abstained for the future, Amaziah was satisfied,
   as we may gather from his words, Add then no more to prophesy.

   And why? Because it is the king's sanctuary This was one thing. Amaziah
   wished here to prove by the king's authority that the received worship
   at Bethel was legitimate. How so? "The king has established it; it is
   not then lawful for any one to say a word to the contrary; the king
   could do this by his own right; for his majesty is sacred." We see the
   object in view. And how many are there at this day under the Papacy,
   who accumulate on kings all the authority and power they can, in order
   that no dispute may be made about religion; but power is to be vested
   in one king to determine according to his own will whatever he pleases,
   and this is to remain fixed without any dispute. They who at first
   extolled Henry, King of England, were certainly inconsiderate men; they
   gave him the supreme power in all things: and this always vexed me
   grievously; for they were guilty of blasphemy (erant blasphemi) when
   they called him the chief Head of the Church under Christ. This was
   certainly too much: but it ought however to remain buried, as they
   sinned through inconsiderate zeal. But when that impostor, who
   afterwards became the chancellor of that Proserpina, [50] who, at this
   day, surpasses all devils in that kingdom -- when he was at Ratisbon,
   he contended not by using any reasons, (I speak of the last chancellor,
   who was the Bishop of Winchester, [51] ) and as I have just said, he
   cared not much about the testimonies of Scripture, but said that it was
   in the power of the king to abrogate statutes and to institute new
   rites, -- that as to fasting, the king could forbid or command the
   people to eat flesh on this or that days that it was lawful for the
   king to prohibit priests from marrying, that it was lawful for the king
   to interdict to the people the use of the cup in the Supper, that it
   was lawful for the king to appoint this or that thing in his own
   kingdom. How so? because supreme power is vested in the king. The same
   was the gloss of this Amaziah of whom the Prophet now speaks: It is the
   sanctuary of the king.

   But he adds afterwards a second thing, It is the house of the kingdom
   [52] These words of Amaziah ought to be well considered. He says first,
   It is the king's sanctuary, and then, It is the house of the kingdom.
   Hence he ascribes to the king a twofold office, -- that it was in his
   power to change religion in any way he pleased, -- and then, that Amos
   disturbed the peace of the community, and thus did wrong to the king by
   derogating from his authority. With regard to the first clause, it is
   indeed certain that kings, when they rightly discharge their duty,
   become patrons of religion and supporters (nutricios -- nursers) of the
   Church, as Isaiah calls them, (Isaiah 49:23) What then is chiefly
   required of kings, is this -- to use the swords with which they are
   invested, to render free (asserendum) the worship of God. But still
   they are inconsiderate men, who give them too much power in spiritual
   things; (qui faciunt illos nimis spirituales--who make them too
   spiritual) and this evil is everywhere dominant in Germany; and in
   these regions it prevails too much. And we now find what fruit is
   produced by this root, which is this, -- that princes, and those who
   are in power, think themselves so spiritual, that there is no longer
   any church discipline; and this sacrilege greatly prevails among us;
   for they limit not their office by fixed and legitimate boundaries, but
   think that they cannot rule, except they abolish every authority in the
   Church and become chief judges as well in doctrine as in all spiritual
   government. The devil then suggested at that time this sentiment to
   Amaziah, -- that the king appointed the temple: hence, since it was the
   king's sanctuary, it was not lawful for a private man, it was not even
   lawful for any one, to deny that religion to be of authority, which had
   been once approved of, and pleased the king. And princes listen to a
   sweet song, when impostors lead them astray; and they desire nothing
   more than that all things without any difference or distinction should
   be referred to themselves. They then gladly interfere, and at first
   show some zeal, but mere ambition impels them, as they so carefully
   appropriate every thing to themselves. Moderation ought then to be
   observed; for this evil has ever been dominant in princes -- to wish to
   change religion according to their will and fancy, and at the same time
   for their own advantage; for they regard what is of advantage to
   themselves, as they are not for the most part guided by the Spirit of
   God, but impelled by their own ambition. Since then we see that Satan
   by these hidden arts formerly contended against God's prophets, we
   ought to bewail and lament our own courses. But whosoever desires to
   conduct himself as it behaves him, let him watch against this evil.

   It now follows, And it is the house of the kingdom Amaziah contends
   here no more for the royal prerogative, with regard to spiritual power.
   "Be it, that the king ought not to have appointed new worship, thou
   hast yet offended against the peace of the community." The greater part
   of the princes [53] at this day seek nothing so much as that they might
   enjoy their own quietness. They ever declare that they would he
   courageous enough even to death in the defense of their first
   confession; but yet what are the teachers they seek for themselves?
   Even those who avoid the cross and who, to gratify the Papists, or to
   render them at least somewhat milder, change according to their wishes:
   for we see at this day that the minds of princes are inflamed by these
   fanners, not to spare the sacramentarians, nor allow to be called into
   question what is asserted, not less grossly than foolishly and falsely,
   respecting the presence of Christ's body, or his body being included
   under the bread. "When we show that we contend against them, and that
   we are separated from them, nay, that we will be their mortal enemies,
   we in this agree with the Papists; there will then be some access to
   them, at least their great fury will cease, the Papists will become
   gentle: they will no more be so incensed against us; we shall hereafter
   obtain some middle course." So things are at this day carried on in the
   world; and nothing is more useful than to compare the state of our time
   with this example of the Prophet, so that we may go on in our works
   employing the same weapons with which he contended and not be moved by
   these diabolical arts; for we have no enemies more hostile and open
   than these domestic traitors.

   It is then the house of the kingdom He now speaks of the secular arm,
   as they say, and shows that though religion were to perish a hundred
   times, yet care was to be taken, lest Amos should pull up by the roots
   the kingdom of Jeroboam, and the customs of the people. It now follows
   --

   Amos 7:14-15

   14. Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither
   was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore
   fruit:

   14. Et respondit Amos, et dixit ad Amaziam, Non sum Propheta ego, neque
   ego sum filius Prophetae; quia pecuarius sum ego et colligens (vel,
   quaerens) sicomoros:

   15. And the Lord took me as I followed the flock, and the Lord said
   unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

   15. Et sustulit me Jehova a tergo ovium (quum sequerer oves meas; de
   post oves, ad verbum,) et dixit mihi Jehova, Vade, propheta ad populum
   meam Israel.


   The Prophet Amos first pleads for himself, that he was not at liberty
   to obey the counsel of Amaziah, because he could not renounce a calling
   to which he was appointed. As then he had been sent by God, he proves
   that he was bound by necessity to prophesy in the land of Israel. In
   the first place, he indeed modestly says, that he was not a prophet,
   nor the son of a prophet: why did he say this? To render himself
   contemptible? By no means, though the words apparently have this
   tendency; but it was to gain for himself more authority; for his
   extraordinary call gave him greater weight than if he had been brought
   up from his childhood in the schools of the prophets. He then shows
   that he became a prophet by a miraculous interposition, and that the
   office was not committed to him by human authority, and in the usual
   way; but that he had been led to it as it were by force, so that he
   could not cast aside the office of teaching, without openly shaking off
   the yoke laid upon him by God.

   This account then which Amos gives of himself ought to be noticed, I
   was not a Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet Had he said simply that he
   was not a Prophet, he might have been accused of presumption: how so?
   No one takes to himself this honor in the Church of God; a call is
   necessary; Were an angel to descend from heaven, he ought not to
   subvert public order; (Galatians 1:8) for all things, as Paul reminds
   us, ought to be done decently and in lawful order in the Church; for
   the God of peace presides over us. Had Amos then positively denied that
   he was a Prophet, he might on this account have been thrust away from
   his office of teaching, for he wanted a call. But he means that he was
   not a Prophet who had been from his childhood instructed in God's law,
   to be an interpreter of Scripture: and for the same reason he says that
   he was not the son of a Prophet; for there were then, we know, colleges
   for Prophets; and this is sufficiently evident from sacred history. As
   then these colleges were instituted for this end -- that there might be
   always seminaries for the Church of God, so that it might not be
   destitute of good and faithful teachers, Amos says that he was not of
   that class. He indeed honestly confesses that he was an illiterate man:
   but by this as I have already said, he gained to himself more authority
   inasmuch as the Lord had seized on him as it were by force, and set him
   over the people to teach them: "See, thou shalt be my Prophet, and
   though thou hast not been taught from thy youth for this office, I will
   yet in an instant make thee a Prophet." It was a greater miracle, that
   Christ chose rude and ignorant men as his apostles, than if he had at
   first chosen Paul or men like him who were skillful in the law. If then
   Christ had at the beginning selected such disciples, their authority
   would have appeared less: but as he had prepared by his Spirit those
   who were before unlearned, it appeared more evident that they were sent
   from above. And to this refers the expression the Prophet uses, when he
   says, Jehovah took me away: for it intimates that his calls as we have
   said, was extraordinary. The rest we shall defer till to-morrow.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou permittest reins so loose to
   Satan, that he attempts, in all manner of ways, to subvert thy
   servants, -- O grant, that they who have been sent and moved by thee,
   and at the same time furnished with the invincible strength of thy
   Spirit, may go on perseveringly to the last in the discharge of their
   office: and whether their adversaries assails them by crafts, or oppose
   them by open violence, may they not desist from their course, but
   devote themselves wholly to thee, with prudence as well as with
   courage, that they may thus persevere in continual obedience: and do
   thou also dissipate all the mists and all the crafts which Satan
   spreads to deceive the inexperienced, until at length the truth emerge,
   which is the conqueror of the devil and of the whole world, and until
   thy Son, the Sun of Righteousness, appear, that he may gather the whole
   world, that in thy rest we may enjoy the victory, which is to be daily
   obtained by us in our constant struggles with the enemies of the same,
   thine only Son. Amen.

   Amos 7:16

   16. Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest Prophesy
   not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.

   16. Et nunc audi verbum Jehova tu, qui dicis, Ne prophetes super
   Israel, et ne stilles (vel, loquaris) super domum Isaac.

   17. Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall be an harlot in the
   city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy
   land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land:
   and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

   17. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Uxor tua in urbe prostituetur, et filii
   tui et filiae tuae gladio cadent, et terra tua funiculo devidetur, et
   tu in terra polluta morieris: et Israel migrando migrabit e terra sua
   (ad verbum est, de super terram suam.)


   Amos having shown that he must obey God, who had committed to him the
   office of teaching, now turns his discourse to Amaziah, and points out
   what he would gain by his insolence in daring to forbid a Prophet, an
   ambassador of the God of heaven, to proclaim what he had in command.
   As, then, Amaziah had proceeded into such a degree of rashness or
   rather of madness Amos now assails him and says, Hear then now the word
   of Jehovah He sets here the word or the decree of God in opposition to
   the prohibition of Amaziah: for the ungodly priest had forbidden God's
   servant to proclaim his words any more in the land of Israel: "Who art
   thou? Thou indeed thus speakest; but God will also speak in his turn."
   He shows, at the same time, the difference between the speech of
   Amaziah and the word of God: the impostor had indeed attempted to
   terrify the holy man so as to makehim to desist from his office, though
   the attempt was vain; but Amos shows that God's word would not be
   without effect: "Whether I hold my peace or speak," he seems to say,
   "this vengeance is suspended over thee." But he, at the same time,
   connects God's vengeance with his doctrine; for this was also
   necessary, that the ungodly priest might know that he gained nothing
   else, by attempting to do everything, than that he had doubly increased
   the vengeance of God.

   There is, therefore, great emphasis in these words, Now hear the word
   of Jehovah thou who sayest, Prophesy not. Amaziah was indeed worthy of
   being destroyed by God a hundred times, together with all his
   offspring: but Amos intimates that God's wrath was especially kindled
   by this madness, -- that Amaziah dared to put a restraint on God, and
   to forbid his Spirit freely to reprove the sins of the whole people.
   Since, then, he proceeded so far, Amos shows that he would have justly
   to suffer the punishment due to his presumption, yea, to his furious
   and sacrilegious audacity, inasmuch as he set himself up against God,
   and sought to take from him his supreme authority, for nothing belongs
   more peculiarly to God than the office of judging the world; and this
   he does by his word and his Prophets. As, then, Amaziah had attempted
   to rob God of his own right and authority, the Prophet shows that
   vengeance had been thereby increased: Thou then, who sayest, Prophesy
   not against Israel, and speak not, hear the word of Jehovah

   Remarkable is this passage, and from it we learn that nothing is better
   for us, when God rebukes us, than to descend into our own consciences,
   and to submit to the sentence which proceeds from his mouth, and humbly
   to entreat pardon as soon as he condemns us: for if we be refractory,
   God will not cease to speak, though we a hundred times forbid him; he
   will therefore go on notwithstanding our unwillingness. Further, we may
   vomit forth many blasphemies; but what can our clamorous words do? The
   Lord will, at the same time, speak with effect; he will not scatter his
   threatening in the air, but will really fulfill what proceeds from his
   mouth; and for this reason Paul compares heavenly truth to a sword, for
   vengeance is prepared for despisers. We ought therefore to take notice
   of this in the Prophet's words, -- that when profane men attempt to
   repel every tenth and all threatening, they gain nothing by their
   perverseness; for the lord will exercise his own right; and he will
   also join to his word, as they say, its execution. Thou then who
   sayest, Prophesy not, hear the word of Jehovah; though thou mayest
   growl, yet God will not be hindered by these thy commands; but he will
   ever continue complete in his own authority." And he mentions word, as
   we have already said, to show that the truth, with which the ungodly
   contend, is connected with the power of God. God might indeed destroy
   all the unbelieving in silence, without uttering his voice; but he will
   have his Word honored, that the ungodly may know that they contend in
   vain, while they vomit forth their rage against his word, for they will
   at length find that in his word is included their condemnation.

   Now, when he says, Prophecy not against Israel, and speak not against
   the house of Isaac, we may learn again from these words, that the word
   Isaac is used by the Prophet by way of concession; for the people of
   Israel were then wont to adduce the example of this holy patriarch.
   Thus superstitious men, neglecting the law of God, the common rule,
   ever turn aside to the examples of the saints; and they do this without
   any discrimination; nay, as their minds are perverted, when anything
   has been wrongfully done by the fathers, they instantly lay hold on it:
   and then, when there is anything peculiar, which God had approved in
   the fathers but wished not to be drawn, as they commonly say, into a
   precedent, the superstitious think that they have the best reason in
   their favor, when they can set up such a shield against God. As, then,
   the Israelites had at that time the name of their father Isaac in their
   mouths while they were foolishly worshipping God in Bethel and in other
   places, contrary to what the law prescribed, the Prophet Amos
   designedly repeats here again the name of Isaac, expressing it probably
   in imitation of what had been said by Amaziah.

   Now follows a denunciation, Therefore thus saith Jehovah This lkn,
   lacen, therefore, shows that Amaziah suffered punishment, not only
   because he had corrupted God's worship, because he had deceived the
   people by his impostures and because he had made gain by the disguise
   of religion; but because he had insolently dared to oppose the
   authority of God, and to turn aside the Prophet from his office, both
   by hidden crafts and by open violence. Inasmuch then as he had
   attempted to do this, Amos now declares that punishment awaited him. We
   hence see that destruction is doubly increased, when we set up a hard
   and iron neck against God, who would have us to be pliant, and when he
   reproves us, requires from us at least this modesty -- that we confess
   that we have sinned. But when we evade, or when we proceed still
   outward, this issue will at last follow -- that God will execute double
   vengeance on account of our obstinacy. Therefore then Jehovah saith:
   and O! that this were deeply engraven on the hearts of men; there would
   not then be so much rebellion at this day prevailing in the world. But
   we see how daring men are; for as soon as the Lord severely reproves
   them, they murmur; and then, if they have any authority they stretch
   every nerve to take away from God his own rights, and from his servants
   their liberty. At the same time, when we observe the ungodly to be so
   blind, that they perceive not the vengeance, such as the Prophet here
   denounces, to be nigh them, and dread it not, it behooves us duly to
   weigh what the Prophet here declares and that is, that perverse men, as
   I have already said, do gain this only by their obstinacy -- that they
   more and more inflame God's displeasure.

   With respect to the kind of punishment he was to suffer, it is said,
   Thy wife in the city shall be wanton: it is so literally; but the
   Prophet speaks not here of voluntary wantonness. He then intimates that
   Amaziah could not escape punishment, but that his wife would be made a
   prostitute, when the enemies occupied the land of Israel. We indeed
   know that it was a common thing for conquerors to abuse women: and well
   would it be, were the practice abolished at this day. Besides, it was
   deemed lawful in that age for the conqueror to take to himself not only
   the daughter but also the wife of another. This then is the reason why
   the Prophet says, Thy wife shall be a prostitute. But he says, in the
   city; which was far more grievous, than if the wife of Amaziah had been
   led to a distance, and suffered that reproach in an unknown country: it
   would have less wounded the mind of Amaziah, if the enemies had taken
   away his wife, and this disgrace had continued unknown to him, it being
   done in a distant land. But when his wife was publicly and before the
   eyes of all constrained to submit to this baseness and turpitude, it
   was much more hard to be endured, and occasioned much greater grief. We
   hence see that the punishment was much increased by this circumstance,
   which the Prophet states when he says, Thy wife shall in the city be a
   prostitute.

   Then it follows, Thy sons and thy daughters shall by the sword fall It
   is a second punishment, when he declares, that the sons and also the
   daughters of the ungodly priest would be slain by the enemies. It was
   indeed probable, that some also of the common people had suffered the
   same evils; but God no doubt punished the willfulness and madness of
   Amaziah for having dared to resist admonitions as well as threatening.

   But he also adds, Thy land shall be divided by a line He means by this
   statement, that there should be none to succeed Amaziah; but that
   whatever land he possessed should become a prey to the enemies. Thy
   land then shall be divided by a line. It may at the same time be, that
   Amos speaks here generally of the land of Israel; and this seems to me
   probable. I indeed allow that neither by Amaziah nor by the other
   priests was the law of God kept; but we yet know that there was some
   affinity between the lawful priesthood, and the spurious priesthood
   which the first Jeroboam had introduced. Hence I conjecture that
   Amaziah had no possessions, it being lawful for priests to have only
   gardens and pastures for their cattle; but they cultivated no lands. I
   am therefore disposed to extend to the whole people what is said of the
   land of one man; and this opinion is confirmed by what immediately
   follows.

   But thou shalt die in a polluted land. He called that the land of
   Amaziah in which he and the rest of the people dwelt; but he calls the
   land into which he, with all the rest, were to be driven, a polluted
   land. If any one objects and says that this punishment did not apply to
   one man, the ready answer is this, -- that God meant that an especial
   mark should be imprinted on his common judgment, that Amaziah might
   know, that he had as it were accelerated God's vengeance, which yet he
   intended to turn aside, when he sent away, as we have seen, the Prophet
   Amos into the land of Judah.

   It follows at last, Israel by migrating shall migrate from his own land
   We here see that the Prophet proclaimed no private threatening, either
   to Amaziah himself or to his wife or to his children, but extended his
   discourse to the whole people: the fact at the same time remains
   unchanged that God intended to punish the perverseness of that ungodly
   man, while executing his vengeance on the whole people. Now follows --

   Amos 8:1-2

   1. Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer
   fruit.

   1. Sic ostendit mihi Dominus Jehova; et ecce corbis fructus aestivi
   (vel, canistrum.) Et dixit, Quid tu vides, Amos?

   2. And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer
   fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The end is come upon my people of
   Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

   2. Et dixit, Corbem (vel, canistrum) fructus aestivi: et dixit Jehova
   mihi, Venit finis super populum meum Israel; non adjiciam amplius
   transire in eo.


   By these words or by this vision the Prophet confirms what we have
   already observed -- that paternal chastisements would no longer be
   exercised towards the people of Israel. God indeed, as it is well
   known, had so treated that people, that he ever spared them even in
   their greatest calamities. It was with a suspended hand that God ever
   struck that people, until after many trials they at length seemed so
   refractory, as not to be benefited by such remedies. This subject then
   Amos now pursues: but a vision was shown to him to confirm more fully
   God's judgment, or at least to produce a greater impression on the
   minds of the people.

   God showed to him a Basket full of summer-fruit. By summer-fruit, I
   doubt not, he means a ripe punishment, as though he said, that the
   vices of the people had ripened, that vengeance could no longer be
   deferred: for an exposition of the vision immediately follows, when he
   says, that the end of the people had come, etc.; and this we have
   already explained in the third vision. But there is a similarity in the
   Hebrew words, which cannot be expressed either in Greek or Latin. qyts,
   kits means a summer-fruit, qts, kots, signifies an end: one letter only
   is inserted in the word, summer-fruit, which God showed in a basket;
   and then he adds that qts, kots, the end had come. But as to the main
   point, we see that there is nothing ambiguous. We will now return to
   the first thing.

   Thus God showed to me. There is no need of repeating what I have
   already discussed. The Prophet here prefaces, that he adduced nothing
   without authority, but only faithfully related what had been commanded
   him from above. And this ought to be carefully observed; for God ever
   so employed his Prophets, that he yet reserved for himself entire the
   right of teaching, and never transferred his own office to men, that
   is, as to the authority. Then he says, The Lord Jehovah showed to me,
   and, lo, a basket of summer-fruit. We may understand cherries by
   summer-fruit, and those fruits which have no solid vigor to continue
   long; but this is too refined. I take the simple meaning, that
   punishment had now become ripe; for the people had not repented, though
   they had been so often warned; it was then as it were summer. He showed
   to me a basket of summer-fruit. But as to God asking his Prophet what
   he saw, we have already explained the reason why it was done: it
   behaved the Prophet to be at first filled with astonishment, that the
   people might be made more attentive; for when we hear of a conference
   between God and the Prophet, our minds are awakened; inasmuch as it
   must immediately occur to us, that there is something worthy of being
   remembered. God then rouses in this manner the minds of his people. So
   we see there is nothing superfluous in this repetition.

   Now follows the exposition of the vision, Jehovah said to me, Come has
   the end on my people Israel We perceive, then, the meaning of the
   Prophet to be, -- that the people had hitherto been warned by moderate
   punishments; but that as they had become hardened, extreme vengeance
   was nigh at hand, when God would no longer perform the part of a father
   or of a physician, but would utterly destroy those whom he had long
   borne with. We indeed know that most grievous calamities had happened
   to the people of Israel, even before this time; but whenever God showed
   forbearance, he ever allured them to true penitence. Lest, then, they
   should promise such a treatment to themselves hereafter, and by self
   flatteries protract time, as hypocrites are wont to do, the Prophet
   declares here expressly, that the end had come; as though he said,
   "Your iniquity is ripe: now then gather the fruit; for ye cannot
   proceed farther, no, not even for one day. Fruit will indeed come to
   you of itself." The end then is come, and I will no more add to pass by
   them. To pass by, as we have already explained, is to be referred to
   punishment. For why does God chastise his people, except that he is
   solicitous for their salvation? He says, then, that he would make an
   end, that he would not spend labor hereafter in correcting the people,
   for he saw that nothing availed. Hence, I will not pass by them, that
   is, I will execute my extreme vengeance: Il n'y faudra plus retourner,
   as we commonly say. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:3-4

   3. And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the
   Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall
   cast them forth with silence.

   3. Et ululabunt cantica templi die illo, dicit Dominus Jehova: multum
   cadaver (hoc est, multa cadavera) in omni loco prosternentur cum
   silentio.

   4. Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of
   the land to fail,

   4. Audite hoc qui absorbetis pauperem et exterminatis inopes terrae.


   The Prophet touches the Israelites here, in an indirect way, for taking
   such delight in their superstitions as to sing in their prosperity, as
   though God was favorable to them; for the unbelieving are wont to
   misconstrue both the hatred and the favor of God by the present
   appearance of things. When the Turks enjoy prosperity, they boast that
   God is on their side: we see also that the Papists draw the same
   conclusion. It is the disposition of men not to look so much on
   themselves as on external circumstances. When, therefore, God indulges
   them for a time, though they be more than usually wicked, they yet
   doubt not but that God is favorable to them. So the Sodomites, to the
   very time in which they were overwhelmed by sudden destruction, thought
   that they had peace with heaven, (Genesis 19:14): this also is the
   reason why Isaiah says, that the ungodly had made, as it were, a
   covenant with hell and death, (Isaiah 28:15) and we know what Christ
   says of the time of Noah, that they then heedlessly feasted and built
   sumptuous houses, (Matthew 24:38) Such carnal security has prevailed
   almost in all ages. But a special vice is here noticed by the Prophet,
   namely, that the people of Israel sang songs in their temples, as
   though they meant designedly to mock God: for the voices of the
   Prophets resounded daily, and uttered grievous and terrible
   threatening; but the people in the meantime sang in their temples. In
   the same way the Papists act in the present day; while they bellow and
   chant, they think that God is twice or three times pacified; and they
   also congratulate themselves in their temples, when they have
   everything prosperous. This abuse, then, is what the Prophet refers to
   when he says, Howlings shall be the songs of the temple For melody he
   mentions howling, as though he said, "God will turn your songs to
   lamentations, though they be now full of joy."

   He afterwards adds, For many a carcass shall be cast down in every
   place: but I prefer to render the word passively, "Cast down everywhere
   with silence shall be many carcases" [54] . By these words he intimates
   that there would be such a slaughter as would prevent them from burying
   the dead bodies. We have said in another place that the right of burial
   is commonly observed even by enemies; for it is more than hostility to
   rage against the dead: and all who wish not to be deemed wholly
   barbarous either bury their dead enemies, or permit them to be buried;
   and there is a sort of an understanding on this point among enemies,
   and the right of burial has been usually observed in all ages, and held
   sacred among all nations. When therefore dead bodies are thrown down in
   silence, it is an evidence of a most grievous calamity. We hence see
   why the Prophet distinctly expresses here, that many a dead body would
   be cast down in every place in silence, that is, that there would be no
   burying of the dead. But as we see men, though a hundred times proved
   guilty, yet quarreling with God, when he executes rather a grievous
   punishment, the Prophet now contends with the Israelites, and again
   repeats what we have before noticed, -- that God did not deal cruelly
   with them, and that though he should consume and obliterate the whole
   people, it would yet be for just reasons, inasmuch as they had reached
   the very extremities of wickedness.

   And he assails by name the princes of the people, Hear this, he says,
   ye who tread upon or swallow up the poor The Prophets, as we have
   already stated, did not without reason direct their discourses to the
   chief men, though the common people were nearly as much involved in the
   same guilt. It is certain that the state of the people of Israel was
   then so corrupt, that all, from the highest to the lowest, were become
   degenerated and none were free from blame. But as more guilt belongs
   always to leaders, this is the reason why the Prophets treated them
   with more sharpness and severity: for many of the common people go
   astray through thoughtlessness or ignorances or are led on by others,
   but they who govern, pervert what is just and right, and then become
   the originators of all kinds of licentiousness. It is no wonder then
   that the Lord by his Prophets inveighed so sharply against them; and
   this is now the object of the Prophet in saying, Hear this: for there
   is an emphasis in the expression, when he bids them to hear; it was
   either because they did not sufficiently observe their sins, and were
   wholly deaf, or because they in vain contended with God; for hypocrites
   think that by evasion they can escape judgment. Hear, he says, ye who
   devour the miserable, and destroy the poor of the land. We see here
   some difference marked, and that the Prophet does not generally and
   indiscriminately summon the common people and the princes to God's
   tribunal; but turns his discourse to the princes only. It now follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] The literal rendering of the verse seems to be this -- And they
   shall howl the songs of the temple:
   Many a dead body shall be in every place; --
   "Cast it away, be silent." The expressions are abrupt, but very
   striking. What would be commonly said is mentioned, "Cast it away,"
   etc. Newcome translates as follows: -- "There shall be many dead bodies
   in every place:
   And men shall say, Cast forth, be silent." Very tame is this, compared
   with the original literally rendered. To introduce, And men shall say,
   lessens the force of the sentence. -- Ed.

   Amos 8:5

   5. Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and
   the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and
   the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?

   5. Dicendo, Quando transibit mensis, ut vendamus frumentum? et
   sabbathum, ut aperiamus (hoc est, depromamus) triticum, et attenuemus
   ephah? (hoc est, mensuram minuemus; scimus enim ephah fuisse communem
   mensuram: quando ergo minuemus mensuram,) et augemus sql, siclum, et
   pervertamus stateras dolosas?


   The Prophet goes on here with the same subject; for this could not
   apply to the whole people, but only to the plunderers who were able to
   oppress the miserable and the poor among the common people, and who had
   a great abundance of corn: the same we see at this day, -- a few men in
   time of want have provisions hoarded up, so that they as it were put to
   death miserable men by reducing them to want. Since then the few rich
   held the whole people in a state of famine, the Prophet says here, "Do
   you think that God deals too rigidly or too cruelly with your inasmuch
   as ye have hitherto been killing men with misery and want?" Were any
   one to object, and say, that the slaughter which the Prophet has
   already threatened was to be common to the whole people, and that
   therefore it is now improperly stated, that the wrongs done to the
   people were brought on them by a few men: to this I answer, that there
   were other vices among the people which required to be corrected, and
   this we have already seen, and shall see again in other parts; but it
   was necessary to make a beginning with the proud men, who, relying on
   their own dignity, thought themselves exempt and free from the common
   lot. Hence it was necessary to close their mouths: and further, the
   Prophet did not spare others in their turn. But we see to what extent
   of mad folly haughty men, and such as possess worldly riches and powers
   would run, were not the Lord to restrain and check them. This is the
   reason why the Prophet now especially addresses them.

   Ye therefore say, When will pass the month, that we may sell corn? Some
   take chds, chedash, month, for the new-moon; and it is sometimes so
   taken and this interpretation is probable; for immediately follows the
   word, Sabbath. When then will pass the month, and when will pass
   Sabbath, that we may be able to sell our corn? As it was not lawful to
   carry on business either on the Sabbath or on the new-moon, whenever
   they rested but one day, they thought that so much time was lost to
   them; for we see that the avaricious grow weary, as their cupidity ever
   excites them, for they are like an oven: and since they are thus hot,
   if an hour is lost they think that a whole year has passed away; they
   calculate the very moments of time. "How is it," they say, "there is no
   merchant coming? I have now rested one day, and I have not gained a
   farthing." As then the avaricious are so extremely careful, it is
   probable that the Prophet here refers to this disease of the mind, as
   though he said, "You have no rest, no relaxation. God has commanded his
   people to rest on every new-moon; and his will also is, that you should
   abstain from every work on the seventh day: ye think it is time as
   lost, for ye get no gain." But another exposition is equally probable,
   which is this, -- that they expected corn to be every month dearer; as
   those robbers in our day gape for gain, who from every quarter heap
   together corn, and thus reduce us to want; they look forward, month
   after month, and think that some calamity may happen to increase the
   price of corn; frost or rain may come, some disaster may take place;
   when the spring passes away, there may come some hail or mildew; in
   short, they are, as it were, laying in wait for some evil. This meaning
   does not ill suit this place; at the same time they refer it to the
   intercalary month, which being an addition, prolongs time, so that the
   year becomes longer: and what follows, respecting the Sabbath
   corresponds well with this view; as the word is to be taken in another
   sense than of the seventh day, for we know that on every seventh year
   there was no sloughing, no cultivation of the land, among the Jews; and
   the corn was then dearer, when there was no crop. Thus then there was a
   prey as it were provided for the avaricious and the extortioners.

   When then will pass the Sabbath, that we may open our storehouses? They
   closed their storehouses, until the whole year, without cultivation or
   produce or harvest, had passed away; and then they opened their
   storehouses, or at least it was the time when they in a great measure
   opened them. Since then they so cruelly dealt with the people, the
   Prophet justly reproves them, and shows that God did not too rigidly
   treat theme but recompensed them with such a reward as they merited.
   Other matters we shall defer to the next Lecture.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty, that as thou ceases not daily to warn us in time to
   repent and anticipate thy judgment, -- O grant, that we may not be so
   deaf and slow, as to delay until our vices be ripened, lest no remedy
   should remain for us; but, on the contrary, that being tamed and
   subdued by thy threatening, we may flee to thy mercy, and so consider
   thy judgments while at a distance, that we may not provoke thy wrath by
   our perverseness, but rather dispose thee to pardon by striving to be
   reconciled to thee in the name of Christ thy Son, and by doing this not
   only with the mouth and tongue, or by any other outward means, but also
   with a real feeling of heart and a life corresponding thereto, so that
   we may present ourselves in uprightness and sincerity, as thy children,
   that thou mayest also show thyself as a Father to us in the same
   Christ, thy Son, our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Sixty-sixth

   In my last Lecture I was under the necessity of breaking off the
   subject: the sixth verse, with the two preceding ones, must be
   connected together. The Prophet says
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:6

   6. That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of
   shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

   6. Ut emamus argento pauperes et inopem pro calceamentis, et
   quisquilias frumenti vendamus.


   Here still he speaks of the avarice of the rich, who in time of
   scarcity held the poor subject to themselves and reduced them to
   slavery. He had spoken before of the Sabbaths, and he had spoken of
   deceitful balances; he now adds another kind of fraud, -- that by
   selling the refuse of wheat, they bought for themselves the poor. We
   indeed know what is the influence of poverty and pressing want, when
   men are oppressed with famine; they would rather a hundred times sell
   their life, than not to rescue themselves even by an invaluable price:
   for what else is food but the support of life? Men therefore will ever
   value their life more than all other things. Hence the Prophet condemns
   this iniquity -- that the rich gaped for such an opportunity. They saw
   that corn was high in price; "Now is the time for the poor to come into
   our possession, for we hold them as though they were ensnared; so then
   we can buy them for a pair of shoes." But the other circumstance
   increases this iniquity, -- that they sold the refuse of the wheat; and
   when they reduced to bondage the poor, they did not feed them; they
   mingled filth and offscourings with the wheat, as it is wont to be
   done; for we know that such robbers usually do this, when want presses
   upon the common people; they sell barley for wheat, and for barley they
   sell chaff and refuse. This kind of wrong is not new or unusual, as we
   learn from this passage. Now follows a denunciation of punishment --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:7

   7. The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never
   forget any of their works.

   7. Juravit Jehova per excellentiam Jacob, Si obliviscar unquam omnia
   opera eorum.


   God, having made known the vices of the rich, now shows that he would
   be their judge and avenger: for were they only reproved, they would not
   have cared much, like the usurer mentioned by Horace, who said, "The
   people may hiss me, but I felicitate myself." So also these robbers
   were wont to do, when they were filled: though the whole people
   exclaimed against them, though God thundered from heaven, they laughed
   everything to scorn; for they were utterly destitute of every shame;
   and they were also become hardened; and insatiable cupidity had so
   blinded and demented them, that they had cast aside every care for what
   was right and becoming. Since it was so, God now declares that they
   could not escape punishment; and that this threatening might more
   effectually penetrate into their hearts, the Prophet makes use of an
   oath in the name of God, Jehovah, he says, hath sworn by the excellency
   of Jacob

   An old interpreter has rendered the words, "He has sworn against the
   pride of Jacob:" but he did not sufficiently consider the design of the
   Prophet; for he speaks not here of vice, but of that dignity which the
   Lord had conferred on the posterity of Abraham; for we have before seen
   this expression, I abhor the excellency of Jacob.' Some give this
   rendering, "I abhor the pride of Jacob," as though God were speaking
   there of perverse haughtiness. But he, on the contrary, means, that the
   Israelites were deceived, for they thought themselves safe and secure,
   because they were introduced into great favor by a singular privilege.
   "This," the Lord says, "will profit them nothing: I have hitherto been
   kind and bountiful to the children of Abraham; but I now abhor this
   whole dignity." So also he says now in this place, Jehovah hath sworn
   by the excellency of Jacob. They were proud of their dignity which yet
   was the free gift of God, hence God interposes a form of oath, the
   fittest to reprove their presumption. Some at the same time give this
   translation, "By myself, (at least they give this explanation,) by
   myself have I sworn:" for God was the glory of Jacob. Others think that
   by this word, g'vn, gaun, is designated the sanctuary; for this was the
   excellency of Jacob, because God had chosen it as a habitation for
   himself in the midst of his people: hence, also, He is often said to
   dwell between the cherubim; not that he was inclosed in the sanctuary,
   but because the people perceived there his presence, his favor, and his
   power. But I rather understand by the term, excellency, in this place,
   the adoption, by which God had separated for himself that people from
   the rest of the world. Sworn then hath Jehovah. How? By the excellency
   of Jacob: and thus he glances in a severe manner at the ingratitude of
   the people, as they did not own themselves to be in every respect bound
   to God; for they had been peculiarly chosen, when yet other nations in
   many things excelled them. It was doubtless an invaluable favor for
   that ignoble people to have been chosen to be God's peculiar possession
   and heritage. Hence the Prophet now rightly introduces God as being
   angry; and the form of the oath is suited to set forth the people's
   ingratitude: "What! do ye now rise up against me, and elevate your
   horns? By what right? Under what pretext? Who are ye? I chose you, and
   ye truly repay me with this reward, -- that though ye owe me all
   things, ye seek to defraud me of my right. I therefore swear by the
   excellency of Jacob, -- I swear by the benefits which I conferred on
   you, -- that I will not allow that which is justly precious in my sight
   to be disgracefully profaned. Whatever then I have hitherto bestowed on
   you, I will return on your own heads, and, as ye deserve, ye shall
   miserably perish." This is the meaning.

   We hence see that the oath which the Prophet uses, ought to be applied
   to the present case. He says, I shall never forget all your works, that
   is, none of your works shall be passed by unpunished. For though
   conscience sometimes disturbs hypocrites yet they think that many
   things may be concealed; and if the hundredth part, or at farthest the
   tenth, must be accounted for, they think this to be quite enough: "Why!
   God may perhaps observe this or that, but many faults will escape him."
   Since then hypocrites thus heedlessly deceive themselves, the Prophet
   says, "Nothing can ever be hid from my sight; nay, as I now know all
   their works, I will show that all their sins are recorded in my books,
   in my memory, so that all things shall at last be called to an
   account." It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:8

   8. Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
   dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall
   be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

   8. Annon super hoc tumultuabitur terra, et lugebit quicunque habitat in
   ea? Et ascendet quasi flumen tota (vel, elevabitur,) et profligabitur
   et submergetur quasi a fluvio AEgypti.


   He confirms what the last verse contains in other words: and the
   question is emphatical, for it is a double affirmation. A question, we
   know, is usually put, when there is no measure of doubt on the subject.
   God then asks here as of a thing certain, how they could remain in
   safety, who had so perverted every thing right and just, who had
   violated all equity, who were influenced by no feelings of humanity, --
   how could such continue safe? It was impossible. We hence see why the
   Prophet here uses a question; it was, that he might more fully confirm
   what he declares.

   Shall not the land, he says, make a tumult? [55] when these disturb all
   order, when they mingle, as the proverb is, heaven and earth together,
   can the earth remain quiet under such a violent confusion? when all
   reason and equity is confounded, how, he says, can the land do
   otherwise than make a tumult? And though the Prophet ascribes not here
   either clamor or speech to the land; it is yet a sort of
   personification, when he says that the earth must necessarily make a
   tumult, while it sustains such inhabitants; for between them there was
   no agreement. Since then their way of living was extremely turbulent,
   the land itself must necessarily be agitated.

   He afterwards adds, And mourn shall every one who dwells in it He now
   shows that the inhabitants of the earth shall feel that commotion of
   which he predicts: for the earth, ceasing to fulfill its offices,
   constrains its inhabitants to lament and mourn. And then there is
   another metaphor which sets forth the moving of the earth, that it will
   rise as a river to destroy men with a deluge. Many render what follows,
   "It shall be driven away and closed up like the river of Egypt." But
   after the Prophet has spoken of inundation of the earth, he turns his
   discourse to the men whom this inundation would drown and swallow up.
   Hence, the real sense is, that their habitations would be destroyed, as
   by a deep gulf, in a way similar to the Nile, which, by overflowing the
   whole country, seems to make a sea of what had been inhabited. As the
   Prophet's words lead us as by the hand, I wonder how those skillful in
   the Hebrew language could have blended things so different, for they
   give this explanation, "The land shall be raised up, as a river, and
   then it shall be destroyed and driven away;" and they refer this to the
   land; and then, "it shall be sunk down:" this also they apply to the
   land; except that some give this rendering, "It shall discharge itself
   like the river of Egypt." But I translate otherwise, "It shall heave up
   whole as a river, and shall be driven away, and shall be immersed as by
   the river of Egypt." It shall heave up, he says, that is, the land as a
   river; so that there will be no habitation for men: "I have given this
   land to my people that they might live in it; but the land itself shall
   heave up as a river; there shall be an inundation of the whole land."
   And then when he says, It shall be driven away and sunk, this ought not
   to be referred to the land itself, but to the inhabitants or to the
   people. [56]

   He had said before, k'r, kar, as a river; but now he says, ky'vr,
   kiaur, which I explain as meaning, as by the river of Egypt. The Nile,
   we know, overflows annually and covers the whole plain of Egypt. The
   Prophet therefore borrowed a similitude from the Nile; and he says,
   that such would be God's vengeance, that the land would be like a
   river, and its dwellings would be immersed and carried away, or
   annihilated: for when there is no surface of land, it seems to have
   been cleared away. So then he says now, It shall be driven away, It
   shall be sunk. This is the simple explanation; and , oin, is to be
   understood; for sq, shiko, is to sink or to cover. Here, h, he is only
   put, but , oin, is to be understood, and there is also a double reading
   pointed out. [57] We now then perceive the Prophet's meaning. But it
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [55] Shake or move is the most current meaning of the word, and the
   most suitable to this place. Newcome renders it, "be shaken;"
   Henderson, "tremble;" and Grotius, "be moved." -- Ed.

   [56] A different view is given by Newcome and also by Henderson.
   Newcome translates thus, -- And shall not all of it rise up as the
   river,
   And be driven out of its place and sunk down as the river of Egypt?
   Henderson renders the lines in the same sense, though in different
   words, -- Shall not all of it rise like the river?
   Shall it not be driven and subside
   Like the river of Egypt? The question is unnecessarily retained,
   borrowed from the first line of the verse. It is seldom, if ever, that
   this is the case in Hebrew; it is not consistent with the simplicity of
   the language. It is evidently the earthquake that is here compared to
   the rising and subsiding of a river. I would therefore render the whole
   verse thus, -- Shall not for this the land shake,
   And every inhabitant in it mourn?
   For heave up as a river shall the whole of it,
   And it shall be agitated and subside like the river of Egypt. Here is
   the heaving, the agitation, and the subsidence of the earth in an
   earthquake. -- Ed.

   [57] He means evidently the Keri, the marginal reading. -- Ed.

   Amos 8:9

   9. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I
   will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in
   the clear day:

   9. Et accidet die illa, inquit Dominus Jehova, ut occumbere faciam
   (vel, descendere faciam) solem in meridie, et obtenebrescere faciam
   terram in die lucido.


   The Prophet speaks here metaphorically of the punishments which were
   then to the people nigh at hand: and as prosperity and success deceived
   the Israelites, the Prophet makes use of this significative mode of
   speaking: "Ye congratulate yourselves on account of your wealth and
   other things which delight you, as though God could not turn light into
   darkness; and as God spares you, ye think that it will ever be the same
   with you; but God can, he says, turn light into darkness: a dark night
   therefore will overtake you even at mid-day." We now understand why the
   Prophet employed this figurative expression, -- that God would obscure
   the sun, or cause it to go down, and would on a clear day send darkness
   to obscure the earth. It was not, it is certain, the eclipse of the
   sun; and the Prophet did not mean this. But these figurative
   expressions must be first noticed, and then we must see what they
   import.

   Were any one disposed to lay-hold on what is literal and to cleave to
   it, his notions would be gross and insipid, not only with regard to the
   writings of the Prophets, but also with regard to all other writings;
   for there is no language which has not its figurative expressions.
   There is then in this passage a remarkably significative mode of
   speaking, -- that God would make the sun to go down or to become cloudy
   at mid-day. But we must especially notice the design of the Prophet,
   which was to show, that the Israelites trusting in their prosperity,
   thought themselves to be beyond the reach of danger; hence their
   security and hence their torpor, and at length their perverseness and
   their contempt of God: since then the Prophet saw that they abused the
   benefits of God, he says, "What! the Lord indeed has caused your sun to
   rise; but cannot he make it to set, yea, even at mid-day? Ye now exult
   in its light; but God will suddenly and unexpectedly send darkness to
   cover your heads." There is then no reason for hypocrites to flatter
   themselves, when God smiles on them and treats them indulgently; for in
   this manner he invites them to repentance by the sweetness of his
   goodness, as Paul says in the second chapter to the Romans. But when he
   sees them stubbornly wanton, then he turns his benefits into
   punishments. This then is what the Prophet means: "God," he says, "will
   make the sun to set at mid-day, and will darken the clear day." Let us
   go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:10

   10. And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
   lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness
   upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and
   the end thereof as a bitter day.

   10. Et convertam dies festos vestros in luctum, et omnia cantica vestra
   in lamentum; et ascendere faciam super omnia dorsa (vel, super omnes
   lumbos) saccum, et super omne caput calvitium; et ponam eam quasi
   luctum (vel potius, quasi in luctu) unigeniti, et posteritatem ejus
   quasi in die amaritudinis.


   The Prophet pursues the same subject; but he omits the figurative mode
   which he had before adopted. He therefore denounces vengeance more
   openly, -- that God would turn their festal-days into mourning, and
   their songs into lamentation. This was designedly mentioned; for the
   Israelites, we know, flattered themselves on account of their
   ceremonies by which at the same time they more and more provoked God's
   displeasure: for the worship of God, which they pretended to perform,
   was mere superstition, and was therefore a profanation of true
   religion. Though then they thus brought on themselves God's judgment by
   their wicked ceremonies, they yet thought that they were sufficiently
   disguised; for as Jeremiah says, ceremonies are to hypocrites the dens
   of robbers, (Jeremiah 7:10,11.) So here the Prophet speaks expressly of
   festal-days and of songs, -- "Think ye that I am pacified on your
   feast-days, when ye offer sacrifices to me, or rather to idols under my
   name; and think ye that I am delighted with your songs? these things
   are so regarded by me, that they the more excite my wrath. Your
   festal-days then will I turn to mourning, and your songs to
   lamentation. At the same time, the Prophet threatens generally what we
   have before noticed, -- that there would be mourning among the whole
   people for having too long abused the forbearance of God; I will then
   turn your joy into mourning. This is the sum of the whole. We have
   already shown why he names feast-days and songs, and that is, because
   they thought them to be expiations to turn aside God's vengeance, when
   yet they were fans by which they kindled more and more the fire of his
   displeasure.

   He afterwards adds, I will make to come up on all backs the sackcloth,
   and on every head baldness. These are various modes of speaking, which
   refer to the same thing: for they were wont to put on sackcloth and
   they were wont to shave their heads when in grief and mourning. The
   Prophet then means, that there would be extreme sorrow among the
   people, that having cast away all delights, they would be constrained
   to give up themselves entirely to weeping, lamentation, and grief. I
   will then make to come up on all loins the sackcloth, that is, I will
   make each one to put off all valuable and soft clothing and to put on
   sackcloth; and also to shave their heads, and even to tear off their
   hair, as they were wont to do. We indeed know that the orientals were
   more disposed to adopt external tokens of sorrow than we are. It was in
   truth the levity of that country that accounts for their playing the
   part of actors in mourning; and from this practice of mourning our
   Prophet borrowed his mode of speaking.

   He afterwards subjoins, I will set her (he speaks of the Israelites
   under the name of land) in mourning as for an only begotten This
   similitude occurs also in another place, They shall mourn as for an
   only-begotten,' says Zechariah 12; so also in other places; so that
   there is no need of a long explanation. For when one has many children
   and one dies, he patiently bears his death; but when any one is
   bereaved of an only-begotten, there is no end nor moderation to his
   grief; for there is no comfort remaining. This is the reason why the
   Prophet says, that there would be grief, such as that which is felt for
   an only-begotten.

   And he shows that these calamities would not be for a short time only,
   Her posterity, he says, shall be as in the day of bitterness [58] For
   hypocrites drive away, or at least moderate, their fear of punishment
   by imagining that God will not be so severe and rigid but for a short
   time, -- "O! it cannot be God will for long punish our sins; but it
   will be like mist which soon passes away." Thus hypocrites felicitate
   themselves. Then the Prophet does not without reason subjoin this
   second clause, that their posterity shall be as in the day of
   bitterness. Hence when they shall think themselves freed from all
   evils, then new ones shall succeed, so that their posterity shall even
   doubly grieve; for they shall feel more bitterness than their fathers.
   It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] Both this and the former line are rendered differently by Newcome,
   more consistently with the words of the original -- And I will make it
   as a mourning for an only son,
   And the end thereof as a day of bitterness. The pronoun "it," and also
   "thereof," is the feminine h: Newcome refers it to hdvrh, this matter,
   or this event, understood: or in case 'rph, land, be the antecedent, he
   thinks that k'vl, "as a mourning," should be rendered participially, as
   "one who mourns." Either of these constructions may suit the original;
   but another seems preferable. The antecedent to "it appears to be 'vl,
   "mourning," in the first line of the verse. Our own version is no doubt
   the correct one, and not that which Calvin adopts; only the last line
   may be better rendered thus, as Junius and Tremelius do -- "And the end
   of it as that of the bitterest day." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 8:11-12

   11. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a
   famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but
   of hearing the words of the Lord:

   11. Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, quibus mittam famem in terram, non
   famem panis, neque sitim aquarum, sed audiendi verba Jehovae:

   12. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to
   the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and
   shall not find it

   12. Et errabunt a mari usque ad mare, et a septentrione usque ad
   orientem discurrent ad quaerendum verbum Jehova, et non invenient.


   Here now the Prophet fulminates, for he denounces not temporal
   punishments, but final destruction, and what proves to be an evidence
   of reprobation, and that is, that God would deprive the Israelites of
   every light of truth, so that they would wander as the blind in the
   dark. It is indeed certain, that they had been before this time
   bereaved of sound doctrine; for falsehoods and superstitions prevailed
   among them; and we have seen that in the land of Israel the true and
   faithful servants of God suffered cruel tyranny. But yet God restrained
   the people, as it were, against their will; when they fled away from
   him, and withdrew themselves from under his government, he still goaded
   them, and tried as by force to restore them to the way of safety. God
   thus contended with the wickedness of the people for many years, to the
   time of our Prophet, yea, until the ten tribes were banished; for
   these, we know, were led to exile first, and at length the kingdom of
   Israel was abolished; but the Lord ceased not to stretch forth his
   hand. Now when he saw that the labor of his servants was vain and
   useless, when he saw that no fruit proceeded from his word, when he saw
   that his name was profaned and his kindness trodden under foot, he
   denounced final vengeance, as though he said, "I am now broken down
   with weariness, I have hitherto borne with your cries, and though by
   many kinds of punishment I have endeavored to restore you, I have yet
   observed a moderate course, that there might not be wanting some remedy
   for you. It has not, therefore, been my fault that your diseases have
   not been healed; for I have often sent Prophets to draw you to
   repentance, but without any success. I will now then take away my word
   from you." But as celestial doctrine is the spiritual food of the soul,
   the Prophet rightly adopts this metaphor, that the Lord would send a
   famine. This figure, then is borrowed from the efficacy and nature of
   God's word: for to what purpose does God send to us Prophets and
   teachers, but to feed us with spiritual food? As he sustains our bodies
   by bread and water, or wine, and other aliments, so also he nourishes
   our souls and sustains our spiritual life by his word. Since, then,
   spiritual doctrine is our spiritual aliment, the Prophet very properly
   says, that there would come a famine.

   I will then send a famine, not of bread or of water, but of hearing the
   word of God. The antithesis amplifies or exaggerates the severity of
   the punishment, as though he had said, that it would be endurable to
   wander in hunger and thirst, and to seek roots on mountains, and to
   seek water in distant rivers: but a bodily famine, he says, is not what
   shall be grievous to them, -- what then? They shall be in hunger and
   thirst, and shall seek the word of God, and nowhere find it. But that
   we may better understand the meaning of the Prophet, we must notice
   what Paul says, -- that we are fed by the Lord as by the head of a
   family, when the word is offered to us, (Titus 1:3) for teachers go not
   forth of themselves, but when they are sent from above. As then the
   head of a family provides meat and sustenance for his children and
   servants, so also the Lord supplies us daily with spiritual food by
   true and faithful teachers, for they are as it were his hands. Whenever
   then pure doctrine is offered to us, let us know that the teachers who
   speak and instruct us by their ministrations are, as it were, the hand
   of God, who sets food before us, as the head of a family is wont to do
   to his children: this is one thing. And certainly since the Lord cares
   for our bodies, we must also know that our souls are not neglected by
   him: and further, since the earth produces not corn and other things of
   itself, but God's blessing is the source of all fruitfulness and
   abundance, is not his word a much more precious food? Shall we then say
   that it comes to us by chance? It is hence no wonder that the Prophet
   sets here the deprivation of sound doctrine among God's judgments; as
   though he said, "Whenever men are faithfully taught, it is a proof of
   God's singular kindness, and a testimony of his paternal care. As God
   then has hitherto discharged towards you the office of the kindest
   father of a family, so now he will deprive you of meat and drink, that
   is, those which are spiritual." Now, in the second place, we must
   observe, that when we abuse God's bounty, our ingratitude deserves this
   recompense, that want should teach us that God ought not to have been
   despised in his benefits. This is generally true: for when we
   intemperately indulge in luxury when God gives us abundance of bread
   and wine, we fully deserve that this intemperance and excess should be
   cured by famine and want. But bread and wine are of no great value, and
   soon pass away: when therefore we abuse celestial doctrine, which is
   far more precious than all earthly things, what punishment does not
   such willfulness deserve? It is therefore no wonder that God should
   take away his word from all ungrateful and profane men, when he sees it
   treated with mockery or disdain: and this truth ought to be carefully
   considered by us at this day; for we see with how little reverence the
   greater part of men receive the celestial doctrine, which at this time
   is so bountifully offered to us. God has indeed in our age opened the
   wonderful treasures of his paternal bounty in restoring to us the light
   of truth. What fear there is now? What religion? Some scoff, some
   disdain, some indeed profess to receive what is said, but they pass it
   by negligently, being occupied with the cares and concerns of this
   world, and some furiously oppose, as the Papists do. Since then the
   perverseness or the wickedness, or the carelessness of the world, is so
   great, what can we expect, but that the Lord will send a much thicker
   darkness than that in which we have been before immersed, and suffer us
   to go astray and wander here and there in hunger and thirst? If then we
   fear God, this punishment, or rather the denunciation of this
   punishment, ought ever to be before our eyes. And the antithesis also,
   as it is very important should be carefully considered; for the Prophet
   by the comparison increases the punishment: it shall not, he says, be
   the want of meat and drink, for such a divine visitation would be more
   tolerable; but it shall be a spiritual famine. Inasmuch then as we are
   too much entangled by our flesh, these words ought to arouse us, that
   we may more attentively reflect on this dreadful punishment, and learn
   to fear the famine or want of the soul more than that of our bodies.
   When the sterility of the land threatens us with famine, we are all
   anxiety, and no day passes, in which this anxious question does not ten
   times occur to us, -- "What will become of us? We now suffer from
   famine and want, and we are, as yet, distant from the harvest three or
   four months." All feel anxious, and in the meantime we are not touched
   by any concern when the Lord threatens us with spiritual want. Since
   then we are so disposed to be overanxious for this frail life, it is
   the more necessary for us to take notice at the comparison mentioned by
   our Prophet.

   But it may be here asked, Why does he say that they should be so
   famished as to run here and there, and wander from sea to sea, from the
   south even to the east, since this ought to be counted as one of God's
   favors; for what more grievous thing can happen to us, than that the
   Lord should render us stupid and unconcerned? But when we are touched
   with some desire for sound doctrine, it evidently appears that there is
   some religion in us; we are not destitute of the Spirit of God, though
   destitute of the outward medium: and then comes what Christ says,

   Knock, and it shall be opened to you; seek, and ye shall find,'
   (Matthew 7:7)

   Therefore this denunciation of the Prophet seems not, it is said, so
   severe and dreadful. But we must observe, that the Prophet does not
   speak here strictly of famine, as though he said, that the Israelites
   would feel the want of God's word, that they would really look for it,
   that they would sincerely seek it, but that they would perceive by the
   punishment itself, that nothing is more to be dreaded than to be
   deprived of the spiritual food of the soul. An example of this is found
   in Esau: when he saw that he had lost his birth-right, he cried and
   howled. He did not do this either from a right feeling, or because he
   had returned to a sound mind; but he was urged on by despair only: and
   then he sent forth lamentations and howlings, as though he were a wild
   beast. An anxiety like this is what the Prophet describes here. We
   hence learn, that the reprobate, when they see themselves deprived of
   God's favors, are not really moved, so that they repent, but only feel
   strong agonies, so that they torment themselves without any benefit,
   and do not turn themselves to God.

   What then is this to seek? We must notice what he said before -- that
   they shall wander from sea to sea, and then, that they shall run here
   and there. When the faithful perceive any token of God's wrath, they
   immediately conclude and clearly see, that there is no remedy but to
   retake themselves directly to God: but the ungodly, what do they do?
   They disquiet themselves, and make a great noise. It is then this empty
   and false feeling of which the Prophet speaks. Now then the question is
   answered. But we must at the same time observe, what the best way is to
   recover the favor of God, when we are deprived of it; and it is this,
   -- to consider our state, and to return to him under a due
   consciousness of God's judgment, and to seek to be reconciled to him.
   Thus will he restore what he has taken away. But if our obstinacy be
   like that of the Israelites, God will deprive us of his benefits, and
   not only those which are necessary to support our present life, but
   also of the spiritual food of the soul: then in vain will our howlings
   rend the air, for he will not give us an upright spirit to return to
   him; but we shall in vain bite the bridle, we shall in vain torment
   ourselves: for he will not suffer us to come where we ought, that is,
   he will not lead us to true repentance nor to a genuine calling on him,
   but we shall pine away in our evils without any remedy.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou continues to recall us to thyself,
   and though thou sees us to be alienated from thee, thou yet dost extend
   thy hand to us, and often exhort and stimulate us by holy admonitions,
   and even frighten us by punishments, that we may not run headlong to
   our own ruin, -- O grant, that we may not be deaf to admonitions so
   holy and gracious, nor be hardened against thy threatening, but that we
   may become instantly submissive, and also return to the right way and
   constantly proceed in it, and follow one vocation through our whole
   life, as long as thou continues it to us, until we at length reach the
   mark which is set before us, even until we be gathered into thy
   celestial kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Amos 8:13-14

   13. In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

   13. In die illa deficient virgines decorae et adolescentes prae siti.

   14. They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,
   liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and
   never rise up again.

   14. Jurantes in peccato Samariae, et qui dicunt, Vivet via Barsaba; et
   cadent et non resurgent amplius.


   The Prophet, having threatened spiritual famine, now adds, that the
   people would in every respect be barren and destitute of every good:
   for I take not thirst here in the same sense as before; but that they
   should be dried up through the want of all things. It is indeed the
   worst deprivation when men are parched up with thirst; and this is what
   the Prophet threatens here. A country may suffer from want of
   provision, while there is water enough to drink; but when not even this
   remains, it is an evidence of a heavier and of almost the extreme curse
   of God. We now perceive what the Prophet meant, which was this, -- that
   when God should take away his word, by which the souls of men are
   nourished up to eternal life, the Israelites would be then in want also
   of all blessings, so that they would not only be without bread, but
   also without water; and he mentions a circumstance which would greatly
   aggravate the evil, Faint, he says, shall the fair virgins and the
   youth in their vigor It seems unnatural, that those who are vigorous,
   and can run to get supply for their wants, should faint: but the
   Prophet, as I have said, wished to show that there would be no escape,
   but that God would distress the strongest, when he sent such a famine,
   and with it the want also of drink.

   He afterwards mentions the reason why the Lord would inflict such
   punishments on his people; it was, because they had prostituted
   themselves to wicked superstitions; They swear, he says, by the sin of
   Samaria; they say, Live does thy God, Dan; Live does the way of
   Beersheba Some understand "sin" here metaphorically, (as it is taken
   also in many other places,) as meaning sin-offerings, which are called
   by the Hebrews 'smvt, ashimut, and by the Latins piacula -- expiations:
   but this exposition is too refined. The Prophet then speaks only of the
   idols of Israelites: and they are called wickedness or sin, because
   superstitious men, we know, delight in their own devices. He therefore
   calls an idol sin by way of reproach, though they gave it the honorable
   name of a god. They swear, he says, in or by the sin of Samaria He
   calls it the sin of Samaria, for thence arose all their corruptions, it
   being the royal residence and the chief city of the whole country.
   Since then superstition proceeded from thence, the Prophet does not
   without reason say that all the idolatry, throughout the whole land,
   was the sin of Samaria; for he regarded the source where impiety
   originated.

   And he afterwards explains himself by saying, Live does thy God, Dan;
   and, Live does the way of Beersheba: for we know that temples were
   raised both in Dan and in Beersheba. He then subjoins two forms of an
   oath, but for this end, -- to show the character of the sin of Samaria,
   which he mentions. They swear then by the gods of Samaria, who were
   really detestable; for there is no greater atrocity in the sight of God
   than idolatry: but he afterwards adds, that they were gods who were
   worshipped at Dan and at Beersheba. What some say of the word drk,
   darek, that it means pilgrimage or the way that leads there, is
   frivolous and puerile; for the Prophet, no doubt, used a common
   expression. He therefore calls custom "the way of Beersheba", such as
   then was by common consent receded and approved. They then who swear by
   these fictitious forms of worship shall be parched, or pine away, with
   thirst

   He then adds, They shall fall, and rise again no more; that is, their
   stroke shall be incurable, for God has hitherto employed moderate
   punishments, which could not heal them, as they had been obdurate in
   their evils. The Prophet then declares now that there would be no more
   any prospect of a remedy for them, and that the wound which God would
   inflict would be fatal, without any hope of being healed. This is the
   meaning. Let us now proceed --

   Chapter 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:1

   1. I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the
   lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head,
   all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that
   fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall
   not be delivered.

   1. Vidi Dominum stantem super altare, et dixit, Percute superliminare
   et coommovebunter postes, et affliget (vel, afflige, in modo
   imperativo) in capite omnes, et novissimum ipsorum (vel, posteritatem)
   gladio occidam; non effuget ex ipsis fugiens, neque evadet ex ipsis qui
   evadit.


   The Prophet confirms the threatening which we have already explained;
   for he says that the people would be soon removed, as there was now no
   hope of repentance. But it must first be observed, that he speaks not
   here of the profane temples which Jeroboam the first had built in Dan
   and in Bethel, but of the true and lawful temple; for it would not have
   been befitting that this vision should have been made to the Prophet in
   one of those profane temples, from which, we know, God was far away.
   Had God appeared in Dan or Bethel, it would have been an indirect
   approbation of superstition. They are then mistaken who think that the
   vision was given to the Prophet in any other place than on mount Zion,
   as we have shown in other places. For the Prophets say not, that God
   had spoken either in Dan or in Bethel, nor had there been any oracle
   announced from these places; for God designed in every way to show that
   he had nothing to do with those profane rites and abominations. It is
   then certain that God appeared to his Prophet on mount Zion, and on the
   lawful altar. [59]

   Let us now see the design of the vision. The greater part of
   interpreters think that the destruction of the kingdom and of the
   priesthood is predicted here, at the time when Zedekiah was taken and
   led ignominiously into exile, and when his children were killed, and
   when afterwards the temple was erased and the city demolished. But this
   prediction, I doubt not, ought to be extended much farther, even to the
   many calamities which immediately followed, by which at length the
   whole people were destroyed. I therefore do not confine what is here
   said to the demolition of the city and of the temple. But the meaning
   of the Prophet is the same as though he had said, that the Israelites
   as well as the Jews in vain boasted of their descent and of other
   privileges with which they had been honored: for the Lord had resolved
   to destroy them, and also the temple, which they employed as a cloak to
   cover their iniquities. We now then understand the intention of the
   Prophet. But this also must be noticed, -- that if the Lord spared not
   his own temple, which he had commanded to be built, and in which he had
   chosen a habitation for himself, those profane temples, which he had
   ever despised, could not possibly escape destruction. We now see the
   design of this prophecy, which is the last, with the exception of the
   promise that is given, of which we shall speak in its proper place.

   He says then that he saw God standing on the altar. The Prophet might
   have heard what follows without a vision; but God then, we know, was
   wont to sanction his predictions by visions, as we find in the twelfth
   chapter of Numbers. God then not only intended to commit to his Prophet
   what he was to proclaim, but also to add authority to his doctrine; and
   the vision was as it were the seal, which the Israelites as well as the
   Jews knew to be a proof, that what the Prophet declared by his mouth
   proceeded from heaven.

   It now follows, Smite the lintel kphtvr, caphtur, is, I think, called
   the cover which is on the top of the posts of the temple; for the
   Hebrews call kphtvrym, caphturim, apples. As then they painted there
   pomegranates and flowers, the Hebrew doctors think that the part which
   is above the two posts of the temple is called kphtvr, caphtur. But
   that part of the entrance might have taken its name from its round
   form. However this may be, they called the highest part of the porch of
   the temple kphtvd, caphtur. Now the posts sustained that which they
   commonly called the lintel. God then says, Strike the lintel, and let
   the posts be moved, or let them shake, let the whole gate of the temple
   shake. Then he adds, And strike and break all on the head, or on the
   head of all. This verb is differently read by interpreters. Correctly,
   according to the rule of grammar, it ought to be read in the third
   person, and it will dash to the ground But some however, render it
   thus, "and dash to the ground", or break, because he had said before,
   Smite. As to the meaning, it matters not much for an explanation
   immediately follows. Now as to what he says, "on the head", and as to
   the word 'chrytm, achritam, which follows, some by the head understand
   the priests and the rulers of the people, which view I am inclined to
   embrace; but when they explain 'chryt, achrit, to mean posterity or
   children, it does not seem to suit this place; for it ought rather as I
   think, to he referred to the common people. As then the Prophet had
   spoken of the head, he now adds the people in general. The Hebrews call
   whatever follows or comes after by 'chryt, achrit. They indeed
   understand posterity by it, but it is a word that has variety of
   meaning: for it is taken for end, for a footstep, in short, for
   anything that comes after. [60]

   It is easy now to gather the meaning of the Prophet: A vision was
   exhibited to him which showed that it was decreed by God himself to
   smite both the chiefs and the common people: and since God begins with
   his temple, how can profane men hope for pardon, who had deserted the
   true and pure worship of God? They were all apostates: how then could
   they have hoped that God would be placable to them, inasmuch as he had
   broken down his own temple?

   He now adds, I will slay with the sword, etc. We see then that this
   vision is to be referred to the stroke which was shortly after to be
   inflicted. I will slay then with the sword whatever follows, that is,
   the common people.

   He afterwards says, Flee away from them shall not he who fleeth, nor
   shall he escape from them who escapeth; that is though they may think
   that flight is possible, their expectation will deceive them, for I
   shall catch them. Had the Prophet said that there would be to them no
   means of fleeing away, he would not have spoken with so much severity;
   but when he says, that when they fled, he would catch them, that when
   they thought that they had escaped, there would be no safety to them,
   he says what is much more grievous. In short, he cuts off all hope from
   the Israelites, that they might understand that they were certain to
   perish, because God had hitherto tried in vain to restore them to the
   right way. Inasmuch then as they had been wholly incurable, they now
   hear that no hope remained for them.

   And since the Prophet denounces such and so dreadful a destruction of
   an elect people, and since the vision was exhibited to him in the
   temples there is no reason for us to trust in our outward profession,
   and to wait till God's judgments come, as we see many are doing in our
   day, who are wholly careless, because they think that no evil can
   happen to them, inasmuch as they bear the name of God. But the Prophet
   here shows, that God sits in his temple, not only to protect those whom
   he has adopted as his people and peculiar possession, but also to
   vindicate his own honor, because the Israelites had corrupted his
   worship; and the Jews also had departed from true religion. Since then
   impiety everywhere prevailed, he now shows that God sits there as the
   punisher of sins, that his people may know that they are not to
   tolerate those evils, which for a time he does not punish, as though he
   had forgotten his office, or that he designs his favor to be the cover
   of their iniquity; but because he designs by degrees to draw to
   repentance those, who are healable, and at the same time to take away
   every excuse frown the reprobate. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] Calvin is not without many expounders, who agree with him in this
   view; yet the reasons assigned do not apply. "Though the true God," as
   Dr. Henderson justly observes, "was seen beside the idolatrous altar,
   it was not for the purpose of receiving homage, but of commanding that
   the whole of the erection and worship at Bethel should be destroyed."
   -- Ed.

   [60] These two lines are variously explained. The words can hardly
   admit the meaning here given to them. The scene was in the temple, and
   worshippers were present. The command was to strike the lintel; the
   fall of the pillars or posts was the consequence: many were destroyed,
   and those who remained were to be killed by the sword, and not one was
   to escape. There seems to be here an allusion to two previous events --
   the shaking and pulling down of the pillars of the house of Dagon by
   Sampson, -- and the slaughter of the priests of Baal by Jehu. I render
   the verse thus: --
   I saw the Lord standing on the altar, and he said, -- "Strike the
   lintel, that the pillars may shake,
   And break them down on the head of them all;
   And the remainder of them with the sword will I slay;
   Flee away from them shall not he who fleeth,
   And escape from them shall not he who escapeth." Junius and Tremelius,
   as well as Dathius, render the third and fourth lines, where the
   difficulty alone exists, according to the version given above; and
   Henderson renders the third line materially the same, -- And break them
   in pieces on the heads of them all. But he retains "posterity" in the
   fourth line, which seems not consistent with the tenor of the passage.
   The version of Junius and Tremelius is this, -- Et divide ipsos in
   capite ipsorum omnium,
   Quod autem post ipsos est gladio interrficam. Dathius is more
   paraphrastic, and gives the same sense, -- Eosque diffinde ut ruant in
   caput omnium qui adsunt,
   Reliquos vero gladio interficam Newcome, who is too fond of
   emendations, folllows Houbigant, who, for no reason that appears, turns
   the verb into the first person; and he gives this rendering of the
   third line, -- For I will wound them in the head, even all of them: But
   this evidently does not comport with the context. -- Ed.

   Amos 9:2-4

   2. Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though
   they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

   2. Si foderint ad sepulchrum (vel, ad infernum,) inde manus mea educet
   vos; et si ascenderint in coelos, inde detraham eos;

   3. And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search
   and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the
   bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite
   them:

   3. Et si occultaverint se in fastigio (vel, culmine) Carmeli, inde
   scrutabor et extraham eos; et si absconditi fuerint ab oculis meis (ad
   verbum, e regione oculorum meorum) in profundo (vel, pavimento, in
   fundo ipso) maris, inde mandabo serpenti ut mordeat eos:

   4. And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will
   I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes
   upon them for evil, and not for good.

   4. Et si profecti fuerint in captivitatem coram inimicis suis, inde
   mandabo gladio ut occidat eos; et ponam oculum meum super eos in malum
   et non in bonum.


   Here the Prophet denounces horrible punishments; but not without
   reason, for there was astonishing torpidity in that people, as there is
   usually in all hypocrites when they have any shadow of excuse. They
   were then the only elect people in the whole world. When, therefore,
   they thought that they excelled others and that they were endued with
   singular privileges beyond all other nations, this glory inebriated
   them, and they imagined that God was in a manner bound to them, as we
   have seen in other places. This, then, was the reason why the Prophet
   in so many ways enlarged on the judgment of God on hypocrites; it was,
   that they might be terrified by the vehemence and severity of his
   words.

   Hence he says, If they dig for themselves passages to hell, that is, to
   the center of the earth, for s'vl, shaul, is here put for the center;
   thence shall my hand draw them forth; and then, If they ascend to
   heaven, thence I will draw them down, saith the Lord; If they hide
   themselves in deserts, if they flee to the top of Carmel, I will trace
   them out: in short, they shall find no corner either in heaven, or on
   the earth, or in the sea, where they can be hid from my sight. There is
   no need here to understand by heavens high citadels, as the Chaldean
   paraphraser explains it: it is a frigid paraphrase. But the Prophet
   speaks in an hyperbolical language of the center of the earth, of the
   heavens, and of the deep of the sea; as though he had said, "Should all
   the elements open themselves for hiding-places, yet the Israelites
   shall in vain try to escape, for I will follow them when sunk in the
   depth of the sea, I will draw them down from heaven itself; there
   shall, in a word, be no hiding-place for them either above or below."

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning; and an useful warning may be
   hence gathered, -- that when God threatens us, we in vain seek
   subterfuges, as his hand extends itself to the lowest deep as well as
   to heaven; as it is said in Psalm 139:7-9,

   Where shall I flee from thy presence, O Lord?
   If I ascend into heaven, thou art there;
   if I descend to the grave, thou art present;
   if I take the wings of the dawn, (or, of the morning star,)
   and dwell in the extremities of the sea,
   there also shall thy hand lead me.'

   The Prophet speaks not in that psalm, as some have very absurdly
   philosophized, of the unlimited essence of God; but he rather shows,
   that we are always in his sight. So then we ought to feel assured that
   we cannot escape, whenever God designs to make a scrutiny as to our
   sins, and to summon us to his tribunal.

   But we must at the same time remember, that the Prophet has not
   employed a superfluous heap of words; there is not here one syllable
   which is not important though at the first view it seems to be
   otherwise. But the Holy Spirit, as I have already reminded you, knowing
   our heedlessness, does here shake off all our self-flatteries. There is
   in us, we know, an innate torpor by nature, so that we despise all
   threatenings, or at least we are not duly moved by them. As the Lord
   sees us to be so careless, he rouses us by his goads. Whenever then
   Scripture denounces punishment on us, let us at the same time learn to
   join with it what the Prophet here relates; "Thou hast to do with God,
   what can't thou effect now by evasions? though thou climbest to heaven,
   the Lord can draw thee down; though thou descendent to the abyss, God's
   hand will thence draw thee forth; if thou seekest a hiding-place in the
   lowest depths, he will thence also bring thee forth to the light; and
   if thou hidest thyself in the deep sea, he will there find thee out; in
   a word, wherever thou betakest thyself, thou canst not withdraw thyself
   from the presence and from the hand of God." We hence see the design of
   all these expressions, and that is, that we may not think of God as of
   ourselves, but that we may know that his power extends to all
   hiding-places. But these words ought to be subjects at meditations
   though it be sufficient for our purpose to include in few words what
   the Prophet had in view. But as we are so entangled in our vain
   confidences, the Prophet, as I have said, has not in vain used so many
   words.

   Now as to what he says, I will command the serpent to bite them, some
   understand by nchs, nuchesh, not a serpent on hand, but the whale, or
   some other marine animal, as the leviathan, which is mentioned in
   Scripture; and we may learn from other parts of Scripture that
   "nachash" means not only a serpent, but also a whale or some animal
   living in the sea. In a word, God intimates, that he would be armed
   everywhere, whenever he should resolve to punish his adversaries, and
   that in all elements are means in readiness, by which he can destroy
   the wicked, who seek to escape from his hand.

   Now when he says, If they go into captivity among their enemies, I will
   there command the sword to slay them, some interpreters confine this
   part to that foolish flight, when a certain number of the people sought
   to provide for their safety by going down into Egypt. Johanan followed
   them, and a few escaped, (Jeremiah 43:2) but according to what Jeremiah
   had foretold, when he said, Bend your necks to the king of Babylon, and
   the Lord will bless you; whosoever will flee to Egypt shall perish;' so
   it happened: they found this to be really true, though they had ever
   refused to believe the prediction. Jeremiah was drawn there contrary to
   the wish of his own mind: he had, however, pronounced a curse on all
   who thought that it would be an asylum to them. But the Lord permitted
   him to be drawn there, that he might to his last breath pronounce the
   Woe, which they had before heard from his mouth. But I hardly dare thus
   to restrict these expressions of the Prophet: I therefore explain them
   generally, as meaning, that exile, which is commonly said to be a civil
   death, would not be the end of evils to the Israelites and to the Jews;
   for even when they surrendered themselves to their enemies, and
   suffered themselves to be led and drawn away wherever their enemies
   pleased, they could not yet even in this way preserve their life,
   because the Lord would command the sword to pursue them even when
   exiles. This, in my view, is the real meaning of the Prophet.

   He at last subjoins, I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for
   good. There is a contrast to be understood in this clause: for the Lord
   had promised to be a guardian to his people, according to what is said
   in Psalm 121:4,

   Behold, he who guards Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers.'

   As hypocrites ever lay hold on the promises of God without repentance
   and faith, without any religious feeling, and afterwards turn them to
   support their vain boasting, the Prophet therefore says here, that the
   eye of God would be upon them, not indeed in his wonted manner to
   protect them, as he had done from the beginning, but, on the contrary,
   to accumulate punishment on punishment: it was the same thing as though
   he said, "As I have hitherto watched over the safety of this people,
   whom I have chosen for myself, so I will hereafter most sedulously
   watch, that I may omit no kind of punishment, until they be utterly
   destroyed."

   And this sentence deserves to be specially noticed; for we are
   reminded, that though the Lord does not indeed spare unbelievers, he
   yet more closely observes us, and that he will punish us more severely,
   if he sees us to be obstinate and incurable to the last. Why so?
   Because we have come nearer to him, and he looks on us as his family,
   placed under his eyes; not that anything is hid or concealed from him,
   but the Scripture speaks after the manner of men. While God then favors
   his people with a gracious look, he yet cannot endure hypocrites; for
   he minutely observes their vices, that he may the more severely punish
   them. This then is the substance of the whole. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:5

   5. And the Lord God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall
   melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up
   wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

   5. Et Dominus Jehova exercituum percutiet terram, et contremiscet; et
   lugebunt omnes habitantes in ea, et ascendet sicut fluvius tota, et
   submergetur sicut a fluvio Egypti.


   The Prophet repeats here nearly the same words with those we explained
   yesterday: he used then the similitude of a flood, which he again
   mentions here. But as the first clause is capable of various
   explanations, I will refer to what others think, and then to what I
   deem the most correct view. This sentence, that the earth trembles,
   when it is smitten by God, is usually regarded as a general
   declaration; and the Prophets do often exalt the power of God in order
   to fill us with fear, and of this we shall see an instance in the next
   verse. Yet I doubt not but that this is a special threatening. The Lord
   Jehovah, then, he says, will smite the land, and it will tremble.

   Then follows the similitude of which we spoke yesterday, Mourn shall
   all who dwell in it; and then, It will altogether ascend as a river
   Here he intimates that there would be a deluge, so that the face of the
   earth would not appear. Ascend then shall the land as a river. The
   ascent of the earth would be nothing else but inundation, which would
   cover its surface. He afterwards adds, "and it shall be sunk"; that is,
   every convenience for dwelling: this is not to be understood strictly,
   as I have said, of the land, but is rather to be referred to men, or to
   the use which men make of the earth. Sunk then shall it be as by the
   river of Egypt We have said that Egypt loses yearly its surface, when
   the Nile inundates it. But as the inundation of the river is given to
   the Egyptians for fertilizing the land and of rendering its produce
   more abundant, so the Prophet here declares that the land would be like
   the sea, so that there would no longer be any habitation. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:6

   6. It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded
   his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
   poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.

   6. AEdificans in coelis ascensiones suas, et coagmentationem suam super
   terram fundans (qui fundat,) qui vocat aquas maris et effundit eas
   super faciem terrae, Jehova nomen ejus. [61]


   The Prophet describes now in general terms the power of God, that he
   might the more impress his hearers, and that they might not heedlessly
   reject what he had previously threatened respecting their approaching
   ruin; for he had said, Lo, God will smite the land, and it shall
   tremble.' This was special. Now as men received with deaf ears those
   threatening, and thought that God in a manner trifled with them, the
   Prophet added, by way of confirmation, a striking description of the
   power of God; as though he said, "Ye do hear what God denounces: now,
   as he has clothed me with his own authority, and commanded me to
   terrify you by setting before you your punishment, know ye that you
   have to do with God himself, whose majesty ought to make you all, and
   all that you are, to tremble: for what sort of Being is this God, whose
   word is regarded by you with contempt? God is he who builds for himself
   chambers [62] in the heavens, who founds his jointings [63] (some
   render it bundles) in the earth, who calls the waters of the sea, and
   pours them on the face of the earth"; in a word, He is Jehovah, whose
   being is in himself alone: and ye exist only through his powers and
   whenever he pleases, he can with-draw his Spirits and then vanish must
   this whole world, of which ye are but the smallest particles. Since
   then He alone is God, and there is in you but a momentary strength, and
   since this great power of God, the evidences of which he affords you
   through the whole order of nature, is so conspicuous to you, how is it
   that ye are so heedless?" We now perceive why the Prophet exalts in so
   striking a manner the power of God.

   First, in saying that God builds for himself his ascendings
   (ascensiones) in the heavens, he alludes no doubt, to the very
   structure of the heavens; for the element of air, we know, rises
   upwards, on account of its being light; and then the element of fire
   comes nearer to what heaven is; then follow the spheres as then the
   whole world above the earth is much more favorable to motion, this is
   the reason why the Prophet says that God has his ascents in the
   heavens. God indeed stands in no need of the heavens or of the air as
   an habitation, for he is contained in no place, being one who cannot be
   contained: but it is said, for the sake of men, that God is above all
   heavens: he is then located in his own elevated throne. But he says
   that he founds for himself his jointing on the earth, for this part of
   the world is more solid, the element of earth being grosser and denser,
   and therefore more firm. So also the waters, though lighter than the
   earth, approach it nearest. God then builds in the heavens. It is a
   mechanism which is in itself wonderful: when one raises to heaven his
   eyes, and then looks on the earth, is he not constrained to stand
   amazed? The Prophet then exhibits here before our eyes the
   inconceivable power of God, that we may be impressed by his words, and
   know with whom we have to do, when he denounces punishment.

   He further says, Who calls the waters of the sea, and pours them on the
   face of the earth This change is in itself astonishing; God in a short
   time covers the whole heaven: there is a clear brightness, in a moment
   clouds supervene, which darken the whole heaven, and thick waters are
   suspended over our heads. Who could say that the whole sky could be so
   suddenly changed? God by his own command and bidding does all this
   alone. He calls then the waters of the sea, and pours them down Though
   rains, we know, are formed in great measure by vapors from the earth,
   yet we also know that these vapors arise from the sea, and that the sea
   chiefly supplies the dense abundance of moisture. The Prophet then, by
   taking a part for the whole, includes here all the vapors, by which
   rain is formed. He calls them the waters of the sea; God by his own
   power alone creates the rain, by raising vapors from the waters; and
   then he causes them to descend on the whole face of the earth. Since
   then the Lord works so wonderfully through the whole order of nature,
   what do we think will take place, when he puts forth the infinite power
   of his hand to destroy men, having resolved to execute the extreme
   judgment which he has decreed?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] This verse and the preceding are connected together, and form but
   one period, as it evidently appears from the construction of the words
   in Hebrew. The following may be considered a literal version: -- 5. And
   the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, --
   Who touches the earth and it melts,
   And mourn do all who dwell on it,
   And it heaves up as a river, the whole of it,
   And sinks down as the river of Egypt, -- 6. Who builds in the heavens
   his ascents,
   And fixes on the earth his station,
   Who calls the waters of the sea,
   And pours them forth on the face of the earth, --
   Jehovah is his name. -- Ed.

   [62] Caenacula, in other places, ascensiones, and more correctly; for
   mlvt is properly ascents, steps to ascend, stairs; and hence, the
   places ascended to, chambers.

   [63] Coagmentationes suas -- his joinings, cementings; but 'ndtv is in
   the singular number. It is difficult to ascertain its meaning. It
   occurs not as a verb, but from its application, its ideal meaning seems
   to be, to join or bind together, so as to form a compact body. It is
   applied in 2 Samuel 2:25, to designate a troop, a compact body of men.
   It signifies in Exodus 12:22, a bundle of hyssop. Newcome renders it a
   storehouse, deriving its meaning from the Chaldee; and Henderson
   renders it vault, tracing it from the Arabic, and says that it
   signifies the vault or arch of heaven, the hemispheric expanse, which
   apparently to the eye is founded on the earth; but a band or troop has
   been its most common acceptation. It must be borne in mind, that it
   must be something on earth that corresponds or forms a contrast with
   ascents in the heavens. God has his ascendings, or as it were, his
   steps or stairs in the heavens, along which, speaking after the manner
   of men, he ascends: then what has he on earth? It seems to me that
   something firm, solid, compacted, is intended; and the earth is said to
   be his footstool. Hence a firm footing, standing, or station, appears
   to be the meaning of the word.
   The French translation is -- Qui fonde son batiment sur la terre --
   "Who founds his building on the earth." -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast showed to us by evidences so
   remarkable that all things are under thy command, and that we, who live
   in this world through thy favor, are as nothing, for thou couldest
   reduce us to nothing in a moment, -- O grant, that being conscious of
   thy power, we may reverently fear thy hand, and be wholly devoted to
   thy glory; and as thou kindly offerest thyself to us as a Father, may
   we be drawn by this kindness, and surrender ourselves wholly to thee by
   a willing obedience, and never labor for any thing through life but to
   glorify thy name, as thou hast redeemed us through thy only begotten
   Son, that so we may also enjoy through him that eternal inheritance
   which is laid up for us in heaven. Amen.

   Amos 9:7

   7. Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of
   Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of
   Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

   7. Annon sicut filii AEthiopum vos mihi, filii Israel, dicet Jehova?
   Annon Israel ascendere feci e terra AEgypti? Et Philistim ex
   Cappadocia? Et Syrios e Kir?


   The Prophet shows here to the Israelites that their dignity would be no
   defense to them, as they expected. We have indeed seen in many places
   how foolish was the boasting of that people. Though they were more
   bound to God than other nations, they yet heedlessly boasted that they
   were a holy nation, as if indeed they had something of their own, but
   as Paul says, they were nothing. God had conferred on them singular
   benefits; but they were adorned with the plumes of another. Foolish
   then and absurd was their glorying, when they thought themselves to be
   of more worth in the sight of God than other nations. But as this
   foolish conceit had blinded them, the Prophet says now, "Whom do you
   think yourselves to be? Ye are to me as the children of the Ethiopians
   I indeed once delivered you, not that I should be bound to you, but
   rather that I should have you bound to me, for ye have been redeemed
   through my kindness." Some think that the Israelites are compared to
   the Ethiopians, as they had not changed their skin, that is, their
   disposition; but this view I reject as strained. For the Prophet speaks
   here more simply, namely, that their condition differed nothing from
   that of the common class of men: "Ye do excel, but ye have nothing
   apart from me; if I take away from you what is mine, what will you have
   then remaining?" The emphasis is on the word, to me, What are ye to me?
   For certainly they excelled among men; but before God they could bring
   nothing, since they had nothing of their own: nay, the more splendidly
   God adorned them, the more modestly and humbly they ought to have
   conducted themselves, seeing that they were bound to him for so many of
   his favors. But as they had forgotten their own condition, despised all
   the Prophets and felicitated themselves in their vices, he says, Are ye
   not to me as the children of the Ethiopians, as foreign and the most
   alien nations? for what that is worthy of praise can I find in you? If
   then I look on you, what are ye? I certainly see no reason to prefer
   you even to the most obscure nations."

   He afterwards adds, Have I not made to ascend, or brought, Israel from
   the land of Egypt? Here the Prophet reminds them of their origin.
   Though they had indeed proceeded from Abraham, who had been chosen by
   God four hundred years before their redemption; yet, if we consider how
   cruelly they were treated in Egypt, that tyrannical servitude must
   certainly appear to have been like the grave. They then began to be a
   people, and to attain some name, when the Lord delivered them from
   Egypt. The Prophet's language is the same as though he had said, "Look
   whence the Lord has brought you out; for ye were as a dead carcass, and
   of no account: for the Egyptians treated your fathers as the vilest
   slaves: God brought you thence; then you have no nobility or excellency
   of your own, but the beginning of your dignity has proceeded from the
   gratuitous kindness of God. Yet ye think now that ye excel others,
   because ye have been redeemed: God has also redeemed the Philistines,
   when they were the servants of the Cappadocians; and besides, he
   redeemed the Syrians when they were servants to other nations."

   Some take qyr, kir, to mean Cyrene; but as this is uncertain, I pass it
   by as doubtful. Whatever it was, there is no ground of dispute about
   the subject itself; for it is certain that the Israelites are here
   compared with the Philistines as well as with the Syrians, inasmuch as
   all had been alike redeemed by the Lord, and this favor was common to
   all of whom he speaks. As God then pitied in former ages other nations,
   it was certainly not peculiar to the race of Abraham, that they had
   been freed by God, and by means of extraordinary miracles: "Even the
   Philistine will say the same, and the Syrians will say the same; but
   yet ye say that they are profane nations. Since it is so, ye are now
   divested of all excellency, that is, there is nothing of your own in
   you, that ye should exalt yourselves above other nations." This is the
   meaning. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:8-9

   8. Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I
   will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not
   utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord

   8. Ecce oculi Domini Jehovae ad reguum sceleratum, et delebo illud a
   superficie terrae, praeterquam quod non delendo delebo domum Jacob,
   dicit Jehova.

   9. For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among
   all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least
   grain fall upon the earth.

   9. Quia ecce ego praecipiam, et agitabo inter cunctas gentes domum
   Israel, quemadmodum agitatur (subaudiendum est nomen tritici, agitatur
   triticum) in cribo, et non cadet lapis (id est, granum) in terram.


   Here the Prophet concludes that God would take vengeance on the
   Israelites as on other nations, without any difference; for they could
   not set up anything to prevent his judgment. It was indeed an
   extraordinary blindness in the Israelites, who were doubly guilty of
   ingratitude, to set up as their shield the benefits with which they had
   been favored. Though then the name of God had been wickedly and
   shamefully profaned by them, they yet thought that they were safe,
   because they had been once adopted. This presumption Amos now beats
   down. Behold, he says, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon all the
   wicked Some restrict this to the kingdom of Israel, but, in my opinion,
   such a view militates against the design of the Prophet. He speaks
   indefinitely of all kingdoms as though he had said, that God would be
   the judge of the whole world, that he would spare no kingdoms or
   countries. God then will show himself everywhere to be the punisher of
   vices, and will summon all kingdoms before his tribunal, By destroying
   I will destroy from the face of the earth all the ungodly and the
   wicked.

   Now the second clause I understand otherwise than most do: for they
   think it contains a mitigation of punishment, as the Prophets are wont
   to blend promises of favor with threatening, and as our Prophet does in
   this chapter. But it seems not to me that anything is promised to the
   Israelites: nay, if I am not much mistaken, it is an ironical mode of
   speaking; for Amos obliquely glances here at that infatuated
   presumption, of which we have spoken, that the Israelites thought that
   they were safe through some peculiar privilege, and that they were to
   be exempt from all punishment: "I will not spare unbelievers," he says,
   "who excuse themselves by comparing themselves with you. Shall I
   tolerate your sins and not dare to touch you, seeing that you know
   yourselves to be doubly wicked?" We must indeed notice in what other
   nations differed from the Israelites; for the more the children of
   Abraham had been raised, the more they increased their guilt when they
   despised God, the author of so many blessings, and became basely wanton
   by shaking off, as it were, the yoke. Since then they so ungratefully
   abused God's blessings, God might then have spared other nations: it
   was therefore necessary to bring them to punishment, for they were
   wholly inexcusable. As then they exceeded all other nations in impiety,
   the Prophet very properly reasons here from the greater to the less: "I
   take an account," he says, "of all the sins which are in the world, and
   no nations shall escape my hand: how then can the Israelites escape?
   For other nations can plead some ignorance, as they have never been
   taught; and that they go astray in darkness is no matter of wonder. But
   ye, to whom I have given light, and whom I have daily exhorted to
   repent, -- shall ye be unpunished? How could this be? I should not then
   be the judge of the world." We now then perceive the real meaning of
   the Prophet: "Lo," he says "the eyes of Jehovah are upon every sinful
   kingdom; I will destroy all the nations who have sinned from the face
   of the earth, though they have the pretense of ignorance for their
   sins; shall I not now, forsooth, destroy the house of Israel?" Here
   then the Prophet speaks ironically, Except that I shall not destroy by
   destroying the house of Israel; that is, "Do you wish me to be
   subservient to you, as though my hands were tied, that I could not take
   vengeance on you? what right have you to do this? and what can hinder
   me from punishing ingratitude so great and so shameful?"

   He afterwards adds, For, lo, I will command, etc. The Prophet here
   confirms the former sentence; and hence I conclude that the second part
   of the preceding verse is ironically expressed; for if he had promised
   pardon to the Israelites, he would have gone on with the same subject;
   but, on the contrary, he proceeds in another direction, and says, that
   God would justly punish the Israelites; for the event would at length
   make it known, that among them not even a grain would be found, but
   that all would be like chaff or refuse: Lo, he says, I will shake among
   the nations the Israelites as corn is shaken in a sieve: a grain, he
   says, shall not fall on the earth; as though he said, "Though I shall
   scatter the Israelites through various places that they may be
   dispersed here and there, yet this exile shall ever be like a sieve:
   they now contend with me, when any grain has fallen. The event then
   shall show, that there is in them nothing but chaff and filth; for I
   will by sieving cleanse my whole floor, and nothing shall be found to
   remain on it." If one objects and says, that there were some godly
   persons in that nation, though very small in number. This I admit to be
   true: but the Prophet speaks here, as in many other places, of the
   whole nation; he refers not to individuals. It was then true, with
   regard to the body of the people of Israel, that there was not one
   among them who could be compared to grain, for all had become empty
   through their iniquities; and hence they necessarily disappeared in the
   sieve, and were like chaff or refuse.

   But it must be observed, that God here cuts off the handle for evasion,
   for hypocrites ever contend with him; and although they cannot wholly
   clear themselves, they yet extenuate their sins, and accuse God of too
   much severity. The Prophet then anticipates such objections, "I will
   command," he says, "and will shake the house of Israel as corn is
   shaken." It was a very hard lot, when the people were thus driven into
   different parts of the world; it was indeed a dreadful tearing. The
   Israelites might have complained that they were too severely treated;
   but God by this similitude obviates this calumny, "They are indeed
   scattered in their exile, yet they remain in a sieve; I will shake
   them, he says, among the nations: but not otherwise than corn when
   shaken in a sieve: and it is allowed by the consent of all that corn
   ought to be cleansed. Though the greater part disappears when the corn,
   threshed on the floor, is afterwards subjected to the fan; yet there is
   no one but sees that this is necessary and reasonable: no one complains
   that the chaff thus perishes. Why so? Because it is useless. God then
   shows that he is not cruel, nor exceeds moderation, though he may
   scatter his people through the remote regions of the earth, for he ever
   keeps them in a sieve.

   He afterwards adds, And fall shall not a grain on the earth They
   translate tsrvr, tsarur, a stone, but tsrr, tsarer is to tie, and hence
   this word means what is collected or, binding, as when the children of
   Jacob had their money tied in their sacks, they said, Behold my
   binding;' so also now it is taken for the solid grain. God then
   intimates that he would not be so rigid as not to moderate his
   punishment, so as to spare the innocent. I have already said that
   though there would be still a remnant among the people, yet what the
   Prophet says is true as to the whole body; for it had nothing either
   sound or pure. But this objection might be made: It is certain that
   many faithful worshipers of God were taken away into exile with the
   wicked; they then fell on the earth as useless chaff or refuse; but God
   denies that this would be the case. To this I answer, that though the
   Lord involves his servants with the ungodly when he executes temporal
   punishment, he is yet ever propitious to them; and it is certain, that
   however hardly they may be dealt with, they yet do not expostulate;
   they groan, indeed, but at the same time they acknowledge that they are
   mercifully treated by the Lord.

   But another thing must also be remembered, -- that though the Lord
   would not have dealt so severely with his people, had they been like
   the few who were good, yet not one of them was without some fault.
   Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, were
   indeed like angels among men; and it was indeed a miracle, that they
   stood upright in the midst of so much impiety; they were yet led into
   captivity. When they approached God, they could not object, that they
   were punished beyond what they deserved. Worthy, indeed, was Jeremiah
   of heavier punishment; and so was Daniel, though an example of the
   highest and even of angelic integrity. God then could have cast them
   away as refuse: it is nevertheless certain that they were wheat; and
   the Lord shook them in the sieve like the chaff, yet so as ever to keep
   them gathered under his protection; but at the same time in a hidden
   manner: as, for instance, the wheat on the floor is beaten together
   with the chaff, this is common to both; no difference can be observed
   in the threshing. True is this, and the case is the same when the wheat
   is being winnowed. When therefore the wheat is gathered, it is,
   together with the chaff, to be sifted by the fan, without any
   difference; but the wheat remains. So also it happened to the pious
   worshipers of God; the Lord kept them collected in the sieve. But here
   he speaks of the people in general; and he says that the whole people
   were like refuse and filth, and that they vanished, because there was
   no solidity in them, no use to be made of them, so that no one remained
   in the sieve. That God then preserved his servants, was an instance of
   his wonderful working. But the denunciation of punishment, here spoken
   of, belonged to the outward dealings of God. As then the people were
   like refuse or chaff shaken and driven to various places, this happened
   to them justly, because nothing solid was found in them. It now follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:10

   10. All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The
   evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

   10. Gladio morientur omnes scelerati populi mei, qui dicunt, Non
   accedet et non antevertet proper nos malum.


   Amos goes on with the same subject, -- that God without any measure of
   cruelty would execute extreme vengeance on a reprobate people: Die, he
   says, by the sword all the wicked of my people. In naming the wicked of
   the people, he meant no doubt to include the whole people; though if
   any one thinks that the elect are by implication excepted, who were
   mixed with the ungodly, I do not object: this is probable; but yet the
   Prophet speaks here of the people generally. He says that the wicked of
   the people would perish by the sword: for it was not the sin of a few
   that Amos here refers to, but the sin which prevailed among the whole
   nation. Then all the wicked of my people shall die by the sword. He
   points out what sort of people they were, or at least he mentions the
   chief mark by which their impiety might be discovered, -- they
   obstinately despised all the judgments of God, They say, It will not
   draw near; nor lay hold on our account, the evil.

   Security then, which of itself ever generates a contempt of God, is
   here mentioned as the principal mark of impiety. And doubtless the
   vices of men reach a point that is past hope, when they are touched
   neither by fear nor shame, but expect God's judgments without any
   concern or anxiety. Since then they thus drove far away from themselves
   all threatening, while at the same time they were ill at ease with
   themselves, and as it were burying themselves in deep caverns, and
   seeking false peace to their consciences, they were in a torpor, or
   rather stupor, incapable of any remedy. It is, therefore, no wonder
   that the Prophet lays down here this mark of security, when he is
   showing that there was no remnant of a sound mind in this people. Die
   then shall all the wicked by the sword, even those who say, It will not
   draw near; nor anticipate us, on our account, the evil: for we can not
   explain the word hqdym, ekodim, in any other way than by referring it
   to the threatening. For the Prophets, we know, commonly declared that
   the day of the Lord was at hand, that his hand was already armed, that
   it had already seized the sword. As then the Prophets, in order to
   smite despisers with fear, were wont to threaten a near punishment; so
   the Prophet does here; wishing to expose the impious stupor of the
   people, he says, "You think that there will not be such haste as is
   foretold to you by the Prophets; but this sheer perverseness will be
   the cause of your ruin."

   As to the expression, It will not come on our account, from a regard to
   us, it deserves to be noticed. Though hypocrites confess in general,
   that they cannot escape the hand of God, yet they still separate
   themselves from the common class, as if they are secured by some
   peculiar privilege. They therefore set up something in opposition to
   God, that they may not be blended with others. This folly the Prophet
   indirectly condemns by saying, that hypocrites are in a quiet and
   tranquil state, because they think that there will be to them no evil
   in common with the rest, as also they say in Isaiah 28:15, The scourge,
   if it passes, will not yet reach us.' We now then see what the Prophet
   has hitherto taught, and the meaning of these four verses which we have
   just explained. Now follows the promise --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:11

   11. In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen,
   and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I
   will build it as in the days of old:

   11. In die illa erigam tabernaculum David, quod cecidit, et sepiam
   rupturas ejus, et subversiones ejus erigam, et aedificabo illud, sicuti
   diebus antiquis (seculi, ad verbum.)


   Here now the Prophet begins to set forth the consolation, which alone
   could support the minds of the godly under afflictions so severe.
   Threatening alone might have cast the strongest into despair; but the
   event itself must have overwhelmed whatever hope there might have been.
   Hence the Prophet now applies comfort by saying, that God would punish
   the sins of the people of Israel in such a way as to remember still his
   own promise. We know, that whenever the Prophets designed to give some
   hope to a distressed people, they set forth the Messiah, for in him all
   the promises of God, as Paul says, are Yea and Amen, (2 Corinthians
   1:20) and there was no other remedy for the dispersion than for God to
   gather all the scattered members under one head. Hence, when the head
   is taken away, the Church has no head; especially when it is scattered
   and torn, as was the case after the time of Amos. It is no wonder then
   that the Prophets, after having prophesied of the destruction of the
   people, such as happened after the two kingdoms were abolished, should
   recall the minds of the faithful to the Messiah; for except God had
   gathered the Church under one head, there would have been no hope. This
   is, therefore, the order which Amos now observes.

   In that day, he says, will I raise up the tabernacle of David: as
   though he had said, that the only hope would be, when the redeemers who
   had been promised would appear. This is the import of the whole. After
   having shown then that the people had no hope from themselves, for God
   had tried all means, but in vain and after having denounced their final
   ruin, he now subjoins, "The Lord will yet have mercy on his people, for
   he will remember his covenant." How will this be? "The Redeemer shall
   come." We now then understand the design of the Prophet and the meaning
   of the verse.

   But when he speaks of the tabernacle of David, he refers, I doubt not,
   to the decayed state of things; for a tabernacle does notcomport with
   royal dignity. It is the same as though Amos had said, "Though the
   house of David is destitute of all excellency, and is like a mean
   cottage, yet the Lord will perform what he has promised; he will raise
   up again his kingdom, and restore to him all the power which has been
   lost." The Prophet then had regard to that intervening time, when the
   house of David was deprived of all splendor and entirely thrown down. I
   will then raise up the tabernacle of David: he might have said the
   tabernacle of Jesse; but he seems to have designedly mentioned the name
   of David, that he might the more fully strengthen the minds of the
   godly in their dreadful desolation, so that they might with more
   alacrity flee to the promise: for the name of Jesse was more remote. As
   then the name of David was in repute, and as this oracle,

   Of the fruit of thy loins I will set on thy throne,'
   (Psalm 132:11)

   was commonly known, the Prophet brings forward here the house of David,
   in order that the faithful might remember that God had not in vain made
   a covenant with David: The tabernacle then of David will I then raise
   up, and will fence in its breaches, and its ruins will I raise up; and
   I will build it as in the days of old Thus the Prophet intimates that
   not only the throne of David would be overthrown but also that nothing
   would remain entire in his mean booth, for it would decay into ruins
   and all things would be subverted. In short, he intimates that mournful
   devastation would happen to the whole family of David. He speaks, as it
   is well understood, metaphorically of the tabernacle: but the sense is
   clear, and that is, that God would restore the royal dignity, as in
   former times, to the throne of David.

   This is a remarkable prediction, and deserves to be carefully weighed
   by us. It is certain that the Prophet here refers to the advent of
   Christ; and of this there is no dispute, for even the Jews are of this
   opinion, at least the more moderate of them. There are indeed those of
   a shameless front, who pervert all Scripture without any distinction:
   these and their barking we may pass by. It is however agreed that this
   passage of the Prophet cannot be otherwise explained than of the
   Messiah: for the restitution of David's family was not to be expected
   before his time; and this may easily be learnt from the testimonies of
   other Prophets. As then the Prophet here declares, that a Redeemer
   would come, who would renew the whole state of the kingdom, we see that
   the faith of the Fathers was ever fixed on Christ; for in the whole
   world it is he alone who has reconciled us to God: so also, the fallen
   Church could not have been restored otherwise than under one head, as
   we have already often stated. If then at this day we desire to raise up
   our minds to God, Christ must immediately become a Mediator between us;
   for when he is taken away, despair will ever overwhelm us, nor can we
   attain any sure hope. We may indeed be raised up by some wind or
   another; but our empty confidence will shortly come to nothing, except
   we have a confidence founded on Christ alone. This is one thing. We
   must secondly observe, that the interruption, when God overthrew the
   kingdom, I mean, the kingdom of Judah, is not inconsistent with the
   prediction of Jacob and other similar predictions. Jacob indeed had
   said,

   Taken away shall not be the scepter from Judah,
   nor a lawgiver from his bosom, or from his feet,
   until he shall come, the Shiloh,'
   (Genesis 49:10)

   Afterwards followed this memorable promise,

   Sit of thy progeny on thy throne shall he,
   who shall call me his Father,
   and in return I will call him my Son,
   and his throne shall perpetually remain,'
   (Psalm 132:11,12)

   Here is promised the eternity of the kingdom; and yet we see that this
   kingdom was diminished under Rehoboam, we see that it was distressed
   with many evils through its whole progress, and at length it was
   miserably destroyed, and almost extinguished; nay, it had hardly the
   name of a kingdom, it had no splendor, no throne, no dignity, no
   scepter, no crown. It then follows, that there seems to be an
   inconsistency between these events and the promises of God. But the
   Prophets easily reconcile these apparent contrarieties; for they say,
   that for a time there would be no kingdom, or at least that it would be
   disturbed by many calamities, so that there would appear no outward
   form of a kingdom, and no visible glory. As then they say this, and at
   the same time add, that there would come a restoration, that God would
   establish this kingdom by the power of his Christ, -- as then the
   Prophets say this, they show that its perpetuity would really appear
   and be exhibited in Christ. Though then the kingdom had for some time
   fallen, this does not militate against the other predictions. This then
   is the right view of the subject: for Christ at length appeared, on
   whose head rests the true diadem or crown, and who has been elected by
   Gods and is the legitimate king, and who, having risen from the dead,
   reigns and now sits at the Father's right hand, and his throne shall
   not fail to the end of the world; nay, the world shall be renovated,
   and Christ's kingdom shall continue, though in another form, after the
   resurrection, as Paul shows to us; and yet Christ shall be really a
   king for ever.

   And the Prophet, by saying, as in ancient days, confirms this truth,
   that the dignity of the kingdom would not continue uniform, but that
   the restoration would yet be such as to make it clearly evident that
   God had not in vain promised an eternal kingdom to David. Flourish then
   shall the kingdom of David for ever. But this has not been the case;
   for when the people returned from exile, Zerobabel, it is true, and
   also many others, obtained kingly power; yet what was it but
   precarious? They became even tributaries to the kings of the Persian
   and of the Medes. It then follows, that the kingdom of Israel never
   flourished, nor had there existed among the people anything but a
   limited power; we must, therefore, necessarily come to Christ and his
   kingdom. We hence see that the words of the Prophet cannot be otherwise
   understood than of Christ. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:12

   12. That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen,
   which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doeth this. [64]

   12. Ut possideant reliquias Edom et omnes gentes, super quas (alii
   vertunt, super quos) invocatum est nomen meum, dicit Jehova hoc
   faciens.


   By these words the Prophet shows that the kingdom under Christ would be
   more renowned and larger than it had ever been under David. Since then
   the kingdom had been greatest in dignity, and wealth, and power, in the
   age of David, the Prophet here says, that its borders would be
   enlarged; for then he says, [25]Possess shall the Israelites the
   remnant of Edom He speaks here in common of the Israelites and of the
   Jews, as before, at the beginning of the last chapter, he threatened
   both. But we now apprehend what he means, -- that Edom shall come under
   the yoke.

   And it is sufficiently evident why he mentions here especially the
   Idumeans, and that is because they had been most inveterate enemies;
   and vicinity gave them greater opportunity for doing harm. As then the
   Idumeans harassed the miserable Jews, and gave them no respite, this is
   the reason why the Prophet says that they would come under the power of
   his elect people. He afterwards adds, that all nations would come also
   to the Jews. He speaks first of the Idumeans, but he also adds all
   other nations. I cannot finish today.

   [64] sh z't, "who will do these things." It appears that z't is a

   peth hyn--y pethan hyn When it is put by itself, hyn it conveys the
   idea of one particular thing, or of several things, according to the
   context. The relative pronoun, 'sr, who, whom, is of the same
   character; it is both singular and plural, as whom also is in the
   English language, and sawl in Welsh. sh is considered a participle, and
   the participle in Hebrew may often be rendered as a personal noun, and

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we see everywhere so many evident tokens
   of thy displeasure, and more grievous ones are impeding, if we indeed
   duly consider how grievously we have provoked thy wrath, and how
   wickedly also the whole world at this day rages against thee and at the
   same time abuses thy many and excellent benefits, -- O grant, that we
   may ever remember thy covenant and entertain a perpetual confidence in
   thy only-begotten Son, that whenever it may please thee to sift us,
   thou mayest keep us in safety, until we come, not into any earthly
   storehouse but into thy celestial kingdom, where we may become
   partakers of that glory which thy Son has obtained for us, who has once
   for all redeemed us that we may ever remain under his guardianship and
   protection. Amen.

   Lecture Sixty-ninth

   In yesterday's Lecture, we could not finish the verse in which Amos
   says, that the Idumeans and other nations would come under the power of
   the people of God. As to the first clause there is no ambiguity, but
   the latter admits of two meanings. Some take its sense to be this,
   "Other nations on whom my name is called:" and others refer this to the
   children of Abraham in this way, "That possess the remnants of Edom and
   all nations they may, upon whom," etc.; that is, that they on whom my
   name is called, even the descendants of Abraham, may possess the
   Idumeans and all other nations. If we choose the reference to be made
   to the chosen people, the order of the words seems to be somewhat
   broken; and yet this sense is very suitable, -- that possess their
   enemies the faithful may, on whom my name is called; for the reason
   appears to be here expressed by the Prophet, why he promised a large
   kingdom to the Israelites, and that is, because they were enrolled in
   God's name, the Lord owned them as his people, inasmuch as he had
   chosen and adopted them in the person of their father Abraham. But if
   the other view be more approved, then the particle 'sr, asher, is not,
   as I think, a pronoun relative, but an adverb expressing a cause, "That
   they may possess the remnants of Edom and all nations, for my name
   shall have been, or shall be, called on them:" [65] for who can have
   possession of this right or title but those who, having been aliens,
   shall pass over into the family of Abraham? Israel is indeed said to
   possess whatever comes from another quarter, and is incorporated into
   the body of the Church.

   But on this point I will not contend; for this main thing is evident to
   us, -- that the extension of the kingdom under Christ is here promised
   as though he had said that the Jews were included within narrow bounds,
   even when the kingdom of David especially flourished, but that God
   would under Christ extend their borders, and cause them to rule far and
   wide. What it is to call God's name on a people, we have elsewhere
   stated. Let us now go on with the context.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] This sentence is an instance, common in Hebrew, of the use of two
   pronouns, --a relative and a personal pronoun; to the latter of which
   is prefixed the preposition. It has already been noticed, that in Welsh
   the same idiom exists; in that language this line is rendered word for
   word like the Hebrew: and the true rendering is no doubt that which is
   mentioned last by Calvin. The Hebrew literally is this, -- Whom shall
   be called my name upon them. The same line in Welsh, without any change
   even in the order of the words, -- Y rhai y gelwir vy enw arnyt.
   Another peculiarity is, that the preposition is prefixed and joined to
   the personal pronoun in Welsh as well as in Hebrew; and a third is,
   that the relative y rhai (the whom) in Welsh, like 'sr in Hebrew,
   admits of no case. It is the same when a nominative to a verb, or when
   an accusative governed by it. -- Ed.

   Amos 9:13

   13. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
   overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;
   and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.

   13. Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et occurret arator messori, et
   calcator uvarum efferenti semen; et stillabunt montes dulcem liquorem,
   et omnes colles liquefient (nempe ut lacte diffluant.)


   Here the Prophet describes the felicity which shall be under the reign
   of Christ: and we know that whenever the Prophets set forth promises of
   a happy and prosperous state to God's people, they adopt metaphorical
   expressions, and say, that abundance of all good things shall flow,
   that there shall be the most fruitful produce, that provisions shall be
   bountifully supplied; for they accommodated their mode of speaking to
   the notions of that ancient people; it is therefore no wonders if they
   sometimes speak to them as to children. At the same time, the Spirit
   under these figurative expressions declares, that the kingdom of Christ
   shall in every way be happy and blessed, or that the Church of God,
   which means the same thing, shall be blessed, when Christ shall begin
   to reign.

   Hence he says, Coming are the days, saith Jehovah, and the plowman
   shall draw nigh, or meet, the reaper The Prophet no doubt refers to the
   blessing mentioned by Moses in Leviticus 26:5 for the Prophets borrowed
   thence their mode of speaking, to add more credit and authority to what
   they taught. And Moses uses nearly the same words, -- that the vintage
   shall meet the harvest, and also that sowing shall meet the plowing:
   and this is the case, when God supplies abundance of corn and wine, and
   when the season is pleasant and favorable. We then see what the Prophet
   means, that is, that God would so bless his people, that he would
   suffer no lack of good things.

   The plowman then shall come nigh the reaper; and the treader of grapes,
   the bearer of seed. When they shall finish the harvest, they shall
   begin to plow, for the season will be most favorable; and then when
   they shall complete their vintage, they shall sow. Thus the
   fruitfulness, as I have said, of all produce is mentioned.

   The Prophet now speaks in a hyperbolical language, and says, Mountains
   shall drop sweetness, and all the hills shall melt, that is, milk shall
   flow down. We indeed know that this has never happened; but this manner
   of speaking is common and often occurs in Scripture. The sum of the
   whole is, that there will be no common or ordinary abundance of
   blessings, but what will exceed belief, and even the course of nature,
   as the very mountains shall as it were flow down. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:14

   14. And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and
   they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall
   plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make
   gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

   14. Et reducam captivitatem populi mei Israel; et aedificabunt urbes
   dirutas, et habitabunt illic; plantabunt vites, et bibunt vinum earum;
   facient hortos, et comedent fructus ipsorum.


   As the prophecy we have noticed was one difficult to be believed,
   especially when the people were led away into exile, the Prophet comes
   to the help of this lack of faith, and shows that this would be no
   hindrance to God to lead his people to the felicity of which he speaks.
   These things seem indeed to be quite contrary, the one to the other, --
   that the people, spoiled of all dignity, should be driven to a far
   country to live in miserable exile, and that they should also be
   scattered into various parts and oppressed by base tyranny; -- and that
   at the same time a most flourishing condition should be promised them,
   and that such an extension of their kingdom should be promised them, as
   had never been previously witnessed. Lest then their present calamities
   should fill their minds with fear and bind them fast in despair; he
   says that the Israelites shall return from exile, not indeed all; but
   as we have already seen, this promise is addressed to the elect alone:
   at the same time he speaks here simply of the people. But, this
   prophecy is connected with other prophecies: it ought not therefore to
   be extended except to that remnant seed, of whom we have before taken
   notice.

   Restore then will I the captivity of my people Israel; and then, They
   shall build nested cities and dwell there; they shall plant vineyards,
   and their wine shall they drink; they shall make gardens, and shall eat
   their fruit. He reminds the people here of the blessings mentioned in
   the Law. They must indeed have known that the hand of the Lord was
   opposed to them in their exile. Hence the Prophet now shows, that as
   soon as the Lord would again begin to be propitious to them, there
   would be a new state of things; for when God shows his smiling
   countenance, prosperity follows and a blessed success in all things.
   This then is what the Prophet now intends to show, that the miserable
   exiles might not faint in despair, when the Lord chastised them. It
   follows at last --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Amos 9:15

   15. And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be
   pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy
   God.

   15. Et plantabo eos super terram suam, (in terra sua,) et non
   evellentur amplius a terra sua, quam dedi illis, inquit Jehova Deus
   tuus.


   The Prophet further mentions here a quiet dwellings in the land, for it
   was not enough for the people to be restored to their country, except
   they lived there in safety and quietness; for they might soon
   afterwards have been removed again. It would have been better for them
   to pine away in exile, than to be restored for the sake, as it were, of
   sporting with them, and in a short time to be again conquered by their
   enemies, and to be led away into another country. Therefore the Prophet
   says, that the people, when restored, would be in a state of
   tranquillity.

   And he uses a most suitable comparison, when he says, I will plant them
   in their own land, nor shall they be pulled up any more: for how can we
   have a settled place to dwell in, except the Lord locates us somewhere?
   We are indeed as it were flitting beings on the earth, and we may at
   any moment be tossed here and there as the chaff. We have therefore no
   settled dwelling, except as far as we are planted by the hand of God,
   or as far as God assigns to us a certain habitation, and is pleased to
   make us rest in quietness. This is what the Prophet means by saying, I
   will plant them in their own land, nor shall they any more be pulled up
   How so? "Because, he says, I have given to them the land". He had
   indeed given it to them before, but he suffered them to be pulled up
   when they had polluted the land. But now God declares that his grace
   would outweigh the sins of the people; as though he said, "However
   unworthy the people are, who dwell in this land, my gift will yet be
   effectual: for I will not regard what they deserve at my hands, but as
   I have given them this land, they shall obtain it." We now apprehend
   the meaning of the Prophet.

   Now, if we look on what afterwards happened, it may appear that this
   prophecy has never been fulfilled. The Jews indeed returned to their
   own country, but it was only a small number: and besides, it was so far
   from being the case, that they ruled over neighboring nations, that
   they became on the contrary tributaries to them: and further still, the
   limits of their rule were ever narrow, even when they were able to
   shake off the yoke. In what sense then has God promised what we have
   just explained? We see this when we come to Christ; for it will then be
   evident that nothing has been in vain foretold: though the Jews have
   not ruled as to the outward appearance, yet the kingdom of God was then
   propagated among all nations, from the rising to the setting of the
   sun; and then, as we have said in other places, the Jews reigned.

   Further, what is here said of the abundance of corn and wine, must be
   explained with reference to the nature of Christ's kingdom. As then the
   kingdom of Christ is spiritual, it is enough for us, that it abounds in
   spiritual blessings: and the Jews, whom God reserved for himself as a
   remnant, were satisfied with this spiritual abundance.

   If any one objects and says, that the Prophet does not speak here
   allegorically; the answer is ready at hand, even this, -- that it is a
   manner of speaking everywhere found in Scripture, that a happy state is
   painted as it were before our eyes, by setting before us the
   conveniences of the present life and earthly blessings: this may
   especially be observed in the Prophets, for they accommodated their
   style, as we have already stated, to the capacities of a rude and weak
   people. But as this subject has been discussed elsewhere more at large,
   I only touch on it now as in passing and lightly. Now follows the
   Prophecy of Obadiah, who is commonly called Abdiah. [66]

   Calvin's Preface

   To

   Obadiah

   This Prophecy does not consist of many oracles, nor of many sermons, as
   other prophecies; but it only denounces on the Idumeans a near
   destruction, and then promises a restoration to the chosen people of
   God. But it threatens the Idumeans for the sake of administering
   consolation to the chosen people; for it was a grievous and hard trial
   for the children of Jacob, an elect people, to see the posterity of
   Esau, who had been rejected by God, flourishing both in wealth and
   power.

   As then the children of Israel were miserable in comparison with their
   own kindred, the adoption of God might have appeared worthless; and
   this was in great measure the reason why the Israelites preferred the
   lot of other is observed by us, our sorrow is enhanced and our
   weariness is increased. When therefore the Israelites saw the Idumeans
   living at ease and beyond the reach of danger, and when they also saw
   them in the enjoyment of every abundance, while they themselves were
   exposed as a prey to their enemies, and were continually expecting new
   calamities, it could not have been, but that their faith must have
   utterly failed, or at least become much weakened. For this reason the
   Prophet here shows, that though the Idumeans now lived happily, yet in
   a short time they would be destroyed, for they were hated by God; and
   he shows that this would be the case, as we shall see from the contents
   of this Book, for the sake of the chosen people.

   We now then perceive the design of the Prophet: as adversity might have
   weakened the Israelites, and even utterly broken them down, the Prophet
   here applies comfort and props up their dejected minds, for the Lord
   would shortly look on them and take due vengeance on their enemies.

   And the reason why this prophecy is levelled against the Idumeans only
   is this, -- that they, as we know, raged more cruelly than any others
   against the Israelites: for it is not said without a cause in Psalm
   137:7,

   Remember the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, who said, Make
   bare, make bare even to the very foundations.'

   Now at what time Obadiah prophesied, it does not appear [67] except
   that it is probable that this prophecy was announced, when the Idumeans
   rose up against the Israelites and distressed them by many annoyances:
   for they seem to be mistaken who think that Obadiah lived before the
   time of Isaiah. It appears that Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:7-22) and this
   Prophet made use of the same thoughts and nearly of the same words, as
   we shall hereafter see. The Holy Spirit could, no doubt, have expressed
   the same things in different words; but he was pleased to join together
   these two testimonies, that they might obtain more credit. [68] I know
   not whether Obadiah and Jeremiah were contemporaries, and on this
   subject we need not bestow much labor. It is sufficient for us to know,
   that this prophecy was added to other prophecies, that the Israelites
   might feel assured, that though their kindred the Idumeans might
   prosper for a time, yet they could not escape the hand of God, but
   would shortly be constrained to give an account of their cruelty,
   inasmuch as they had without cause been all in a flame against the
   distressed and afflicted people of God.

   Now our Prophet shows at the end that God would become the avenger of
   this cruelty, which the Idumeans had exercised; for though he chastised
   his own people, he did not yet forget his gratuitous covenant. Let us
   now come to the words.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] Newcome supposes that he prophesied between the taking of
   Jerusalem in 587 before Christ and the destruction of Idumea, a few
   years later, by Nebuchadnezzar. Usher, as quoted by Newcome, places the
   destruction of Jerusalem in 588 b.c.; and the siege of Tyre by the
   Babylonians three years later, that is, in 585; and it was during this
   siege, which lasted thirteen years, that the Idumeans, as well as the
   Sidonians, the Moabites, and the Ammonites, were subdued by the
   Babylonian power: so that the threatenings contained in this prophecy
   were soon executed. -- Ed.

   [68] Expositors are divided in their opinions as to the priority of the
   two Prophets, and consequently as to whom of the two was the copyist.
   As the time cannot be ascertained, our only mode of ascertaining this,
   are the passages themselves as given by each. It is said that Jeremiah
   has not presented them in so perfect a form as Obadiah, and that in the
   latter they appear as the naturally connected parts of his subject, and
   accordant in style and character with the rest of the prophecy. But the
   matter is of no great importance, and to discuss it can bring no
   benefit. -- Ed.

   Commentaries on

   the Prophet Obadiah
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 1:1

   1. The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; [69]
   We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among
   the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.

   1. Visio Obadiae. Sic Dominus Jehova contra Edom, Rumorem audivimus a
   Jehova, et legatus ad gentes missus est, Surgite et surgamus contra eam
   ad proelium.


   Obadiah's preface is, that he brought nothing human, but only declared
   the vision presented to him from above. We indeed know that it was God
   alone that was ever to be heard in the Church, as even now he demands
   to be heard: but yet he sent his prophets, as afterwards the apostles;
   yea, as he sent his only begotten Son, whom he has set over us to be
   our only and sovereign Teacher. Obadiah then by saying that it was a
   vision, said the same, as though he declared, that he did not
   presumptuously bring forward his own dreams, or what he conjectured, or
   discovered by human reason, but that he adduced only a celestial
   oracle: for chzvn, chezun, as we have observed in other places, was a
   vision, by which God revealed himself to his Prophets.

   He then adds, Thus saith Jehovah. Here is a fuller expression of the
   same declaration. We thus see that the Prophet, in order that the
   doctrine he brought forward might not be suspected, made God the
   author; for what faith can be put in men, whom we know to be vain and
   false, except as far as they are ruled by the Spirit of God and sent by
   Him? Seeing then that the Prophet so carefully teaches us, that what he
   declared was delivered to him by God, we may hence learn what I have
   lately referred to, -- that the Prophets formerly so spoke, that God
   alone might be heard among the people.

   He says afterwards, A rumor have we heard. Some render it, a word, or a
   doctrine. smvh, shimuoe, is properly a hearing, and is derived from the
   verb the Prophet subjoins. A hearing then have we heard; so it is
   translated literally. But some think that what was taught is pointed
   out, as though he said, "The Lord has revealed this to me and to other
   Prophets;" according to what Isaiah says, Isaiah 53:1, Who has believed
   our hearing?' It is the same word, and he speaks of God's word or
   doctrine. But it is probable that he refers here to those tumultuous
   rumors, which commonly precede wars and calamities. We have then heard
   a rumor The verb in Jeremiah is not in the plural number, smnv shimonu,
   but smvh smtv shimoti shimunoe, I have heard,' says Jeremiah, a
   hearing.' But our Prophet uses the plural number, We have heard a
   hearing.' The sense however is the same; for Jeremiah says that he had
   heard rumors; and the Prophet here adds others to himself, as though he
   said, "This rumor is spread abroad, but it is from the Lord: it is
   certain that this rumor has been heard even by the profane and the
   despisers of God." But the Prophet shows that wars are not stirred up
   at random, but by the secret influence of God; as though he said, "When
   a tumult arises, let us not think that its beginning is from the earth,
   but God himself is the mover." We now then apprehend the design of the
   Prophet: though he speaks of the rumor of wars, he yet shows that
   chance or accident does not rule in such commotions, but the hidden
   influence of God.

   We have heard, he says from Jehovah, and a messenger, or, an
   ambassador, to the nations has been sent [70] , Arise ye, and we will
   arise against her to battle. In Jeremiah, it is, Assemble ye, come and
   arise against her to battle.' The Prophet here shows, I have no doubt,
   whence the rumor came, which he had just mentioned; for they were now
   indeed stirring up one another to destroy that land. If any one had
   formed a judgment according to human wisdom, he would have said that
   the Assyrians were the cause why war was brought on the Idumeans,
   because they had found them either inconstant or even perfidious, or
   because they had feigned a pretense when there was no just reason for
   making war. But the Prophet here raises his mind upwards and
   acknowledges God to be the mover of this war, because he intended to
   punish the cruelty of that people, which they had exercised toward
   their own kindred, the Israelites; and at the same time he encourages
   others also, that they might understand that it was altogether directed
   by the hidden counsel of God, that the Assyrians, from being friends,
   became of a sudden enemies, that a war was all in a flame against the
   Idumeans at a time when they were at ease, without any fear, without
   any apprehension of danger. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] The Septuagint renders the words, "to Edom" -- Tade legei kurios
   ho Theos te Idoumaia --"Thus saith the Lord God to Idumea;" which is an
   exact rendering of the original, for it is, l'dvm--"to Edom." It was a
   message from God to that people. May we not hence conclude that this
   prophecy was sent to them by Obadiah? They are often personally
   addressed: and this seems to favor such a supposition. It is indeed
   true that l prefixed to a word after the verb, to say or to speak, is
   often rendered, of, or, concerning; but it is also rendered by, to,
   meaning that the address is made to the person. -- Ed.

   [70] Or the two lines may thus be rendered,-- A rumor have we heard
   from Jehovah,
   And a messenger to the nations hath he sent. The verb, to send, is here
   active; and so it is rendered in the Septuagint. It is indeed passive
   in the corresponding passage in Jeremiah; but there are several other
   instances of variety in the expressions used by the two Prophets,
   though there be in sense a material agreement. -- Ed.

   Obadiah 2-4

   2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly
   despised.

   2 Ecce parvum posui te inter gentes, contemptus tu valde.

   3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in
   the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his
   heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

   3 Superbia cordis tui decepit te, qui habitas in scissuras petrae (vel,
   rupis;) excelsa habitatio ejus, dicens in corde suo, Quis detrahet me
   in terram?

   4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest
   among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.

   4 Si exaltaveris quasi aquila, etsi inter nubes posueris nidum suum,
   inde ego detraham te, dicit Jehova.


   Jeremiah uses nearly the same words; but the sense of the expression is
   ambiguous, when he says, Lo, little have I set thee.' To me it appears
   probable, that the Prophet reproves the Idumeans, because they became
   arrogant, as it were, against the will of God, and in opposition to it,
   when, at the same time, they were confined to the narrow passes of
   mountains. It is said elsewhere, (Malachi 1:2,) Jacob and Esau, were
   they not brethren?' "But I have given to you the inheritance promised
   to your father Abraham; I have transferred the Idumeans to mount Seir."
   Now it is less bearable, if any one be elated with pride, when his
   condition is not so honorable. I therefore think that the Idumeans are
   here condemned because they vaunted so much, and arrogated to
   themselves more than what was right, when they yet were contemptible,
   when their condition was mean and obscure, for they dwelt on mount
   Seir. But others think that the punishment, which was impending over
   them, is here denounced, Lo, little have I made thee among the nations,
   and Jeremiah says, and contemptible among men'; he omits the two words,
   thou and exceedingly; he says only, and contemptible among men'. But as
   to the substance, there is hardly any difference. If then we understand
   that that nation was proud without reason, the sense is evident, that
   is, that they, like the giants, carried on war against God, that they
   vaunted themselves, though confined to the narrow passes of mountains.
   Though I leave to others their own free opinion, I am yet inclined to
   the former view, while the latter has been adopted nearly by the
   consent of all; and that is, that God was resolved forcibly to
   constrain to order those ferocious men, who, for no reason, and even in
   opposition to nature, are become insolent. But if a different
   interpretation be more approved, we may say, that the Prophet begins
   with a threatening, and then subjoins a reason why God determined to
   diminish and even to destroy them: for though they dwelt on mountains,
   it was yet a fertile region; and further, they had gathered in course
   of long time much wealth, when they attained security, when no enemy
   disturbed them. This then is the reasoning, Lo, I have made thee small
   and contemptible in the mountain, -- and why? because the pride of thy
   heart has deceived thee; and Jeremiah adds, terror, [71] although some
   render tphltstk taphlatastae, image; but this seems not appropriate.
   Jeremiah then, I doubt not, mentions terror in the first place; for it
   almost ever happens, that the proud strike others with fear: such then
   were the Idumeans.

   Now if we follow the first meaning I explained, the two verses may be
   read as connected, Lo, I have made thee small and contemptible among
   the nations; [72] but the pride of thy heart has deceived thee; some
   render it, has raised thee up, deriving it from ns' nusha: but they
   read s shin, pointed on the left side; for if ns' nusha has the point
   in the branch of the shin, on the right hand, it means to deceive, but
   if on the left, it signifies to raise up. Then they give this
   translations "The pride of thine heart has raised thee up:" but we
   clearly learn from Jeremiah, that it ought, as almost all interpreters
   agree, to be rendered thus, "The pride of thine heart has deceived
   thee:" for he says not hsy'k eshiac but hsy' 'vtk eshia autea, that is,
   it was to thee the cause of error and of madness. Of the sense then of
   this verb there can be no doubt.

   The Prophet now laughs to scorn the Idumeans, because they relied on
   their own fortresses, and thought themselves, according to the common
   saying, to be beyond the reach of darts; and hence they petulantly
   insulted the Israelites and despised God himself. The Prophet therefore
   says, that the Idumeans in vain felicitated themselves, for he shows
   that all they promised to themselves were mere delusions. The import of
   what is said then is, "Whence is this your security, that ye think that
   enemies can do you no harm? Yea, ye despise God as well as men; whence
   is this haughtiness? whence also is the great confidence with which ye
   are puffed up? Verily, it comes only from mere delusions. The pride of
   thine heart has deceived thee."

   And yet there was not wanting a reason why the Idumeans were thus
   insolent, as the Prophet also states: but he at the same time shows
   that they had deceived themselves; for God cared not for their
   fortresses; nay, he counted them as nothing. Thou dwellest, he says,
   (this is to be regarded as a concession,) in the clefts of the stone;
   some read, "between the windings of the rock;" [73] though others think
   sl Salo to be the name of a city. But though I should allow that the
   Prophet alludes to the name of a city, I yet do not see how can that
   stand which they hold; for clefts comfort not with a city situated on a
   plain, though within the ranges of mountains. I do not then doubt but
   that sl Salo here means mount Seir. As then the Idumeans had fortresses
   amidst rocks, they thought that all enemies could easily be kept out.

   And hence it follows, The height is his habitation, that is, he dwells
   in lofty places; and hence he says in his heart, Who shall draw me down
   to the ground? He afterwards subjoins what I have already stated, --
   that though their region was exceedingly well fortified, yet the
   Idumeans were greatly deceived, and indulged themselves in vain
   delusions, "If thou shouldest raise up thy seat, he says, like the
   eagle", -- literally, If thou shouldest rise as the eagle,' -- "and if
   thou shouldest among the clouds [74] set and nest, I will thence draw
   thee down, saith Jehovah". We now see that the Prophet did not without
   reason deride the confidence with which the Idumeans were inflated, by
   setting up their fortresses in opposition to God: for it is the
   greatest madness for men to rely on their own power and to despise God
   himself. At the same time he could, as it were, easily dissipate by one
   blast every idea of defense or of power that is in us; but this subject
   will be more fully handled by us tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [71] Blayney, for very satisfactory reasons, transfers this word to the
   preceding verse, and then the passage will be almost literally the same
   with this of Obadiah. The 15^th, and the beginning of the 16^th in
   Jeremiah 49 may be thus rendered, -- 15. For, behold, small have I made
   thee among the nations,
   Contemptible among the men of thy terror,
   (that is, such as thou didst fear.) 16. Deceived thee has the pride of
   thy heart; etc. -- Ed.

   [72] It is evidently of the past, and not of the future, that this
   verse speaks. The corresponding passage in Jeremiah is, in our version,
   rendered in the future tense, but Blayney renders it, as it is, in the
   past tense. Our version here adopts the past tense in the first line,
   "I have made," etc., and the present in the second, "Thou art," etc.,
   contrary to the rule, that when the auxiliary verb is not expressed in
   the original, the tense of the verbs expressed is to be observed. The
   two lines should therefore be thus translated, -- Behold, small have I
   made thee among the nations;
   Despised wert thou exceedingly. The reference is, no doubt, as Calvin
   says, to the poor inheritance assigned to the Edomites, and to the low
   station they occupied among other nations; and hence their pride and
   insolence appeared more evident and unreasonable. -- Ed.

   [73] Blayney renders the same words in Jeremiah 49:16, "the encirclings
   of the rock:" but Parkhurst renders them "the cracks, or fissures of
   the rock." -- Ed.

   [74] Literally it is, "among the stars," vyn kvkvym. -- Ed.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest us to be on every side at this
   day beset by so many enemies, even by those who constantly devise means
   to destroy us, while we are so very weak and feeble, -- O grant, that
   we may learn to look up to thee, and that our trust may so recumb on
   thee, that however exposed we may be to all kinds of danger according
   to what appears to the flesh, we may not yet doubt but that thou art
   ever armed with sufficient power to terrify our enemies, so that we may
   quietly live even amidst all dangers, and never cease to call on thy
   name, as thou hast promised to be the sure and faithful defender of our
   safety in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Seventieth

   We observed in our yesterday's Lecture, that it nothing avails the
   ungodly, when they set up their fortresses against the judgment of God,
   as though they could escape safe from his hand; for as God has heaven
   and earth under his control, he can, whenever it pleases him, draw down
   all who now despise his power, and, therefore, deride his Prophets, or
   regard as nothing their threatening. This passage then ought to be
   carefully noticed; for God declares that it is in his power to draw
   down from the very clouds those who so raise themselves up, as to think
   themselves to be elevated above all dangers. The Prophet now says --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 5

   5. If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut
   off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
   grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?

   5. An fures venerunt ad te? An praedones nocturni? Quomodo in silentium
   redactus es? (vel, quomodo consumptus es?) annon furati essent
   sufficientiam suam? An vindemiatores ad te venerunt? Annon reliquissent
   racemos?


   The Prophet shows in this verse that the calamity with which God was
   resolved to afflict the Idumeans would not be slight, for nothing would
   be left among them; and he amplifies what he says by a comparison. When
   one is plundered of his property by thieves, he grieves, that what he
   had acquired by much labor through life, has been in one moment taken
   from him: and when any one has spent labor and expense in cultivating
   his vineyard, and another takes away its fruit, he complains of his
   great misfortune, that he had lost his property and big labor in the
   cultivation of his vineyard, while another devours its fruit. But the
   Prophet intimates that God would not be content with such kind of
   punishment as to the Idumeans.

   Hence he says, Have night thieves or robbers come to thee? They must
   doubtless have stolen, and have taken away what they thought sufficient
   for them; but now nothing shall be left to thee. In short, the Prophet
   intimates that the Assyrians would not be like thieves or night
   robbers, who stealthily and privately take away what comes to their
   hands; but he means, that the Idumeans would be so plundered, that
   their houses would be left wholly empty, and he declares that the
   Assyrians would thus spoil them like night thieves or robbers, who are
   wont to proceed with unbridled liberty; for none dares to resist them,
   or even to say a word against them. This plundering then will not be,
   says the Prophet, of an ordinary kind; but the enemies will make thee
   entirely empty.

   The same is the object in view when he says, Have vintagers come to
   thee? To be sure, they commonly leave some clusters; but the Assyrians
   will leave, no, not one: they shall depart so laden with plunders, that
   thou shalt be left empty.

   But all this, as we have reminded you, was said in order to alleviate
   or to mitigate the grief of the faithful, who then deemed themselves
   very miserable, as they were alone plundered by enemies; for they saw
   that their neighbors were dwelling in safety, and even becoming
   partakers of the spoil. Their condition therefore was very miserable
   and degraded. Hence the Prophet, that he might moderate this bitter
   grief, says, that the Idumeans would in no common way be plundered, for
   not a hair could be left them. This is the import of the passage.

   But some regard the verb ndmyth nudamite as signifying, "Thou art
   reduced to silence;" for the verb dvm dum or dmh dame means to be
   silent: and they give this exposition, "How dost thou not endeavor at
   least to meet thine enemies?" for they take "to be silent" in the sense
   of being still, as dmh dame is often so taken in Scripture, "How then
   have they been silent?" but he speaks of the future in the past tense,
   as though God had already inflicted punishment on the Idumeans, that
   faith in the prediction might be made more certain: thou hast been
   reduced to silence, that is, how couldest thou remain quiet on seeing
   thine enemies plundering with so much violence -- how then hast thou
   been reduced to silence? Others say, How hast thou been consumed? for
   dmh dame often means to destroy. But to this point belongs no great
   importance; for the Prophet means, that it could not be ascribed to
   chance, that enemies would destroy the whole land of Edom, for the
   cruel assault would by no means be of an ordinary kind: and then as the
   Idumeans thought that an entrance to their enemies was on every side
   closed up, as they inhabited the summits of mountains, according to
   what I have already said, and that they were most safe in their
   recesses and lofty rocks, the Prophet here sets it forth as a wonderful
   thing that God's judgment would yet reach them. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 6

   6. How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things
   sought up!

   6. Quomodo quaesita sunt Esau, pervestigata abscondita ejus?


   He confirms the former sentence, -- that the Idumeans in vain trusted
   that their riches would be safe, because they had hidden and deep
   recesses. Even when a country is plundered by enemies, the conquerors
   dare not to come to places of danger; when there are narrow passes,
   they avoid them, for they think that there is there some evil design.
   Hence conquerors, fearing hidden places, plunder only those which are
   open, and always consider well whether their advance is safe: but
   Idumea, as we have said, had hidden recesses, for its rocks were almost
   inaccessible, and there were many conveniences there for hiding and
   concealing its riches. But the Prophet says, that all this would be
   useless: and that he might more effectually rouse them, he speaks with
   astonishment, as of something incredible. How have been sought the
   things of Esau, and thoroughly searched his hidden places! Who could
   have thought this? for they might have concealed their treasures in
   rocks and caverns, and thence repelled their enemies. But in vain would
   be all their attempts: how could this possibly be? Here then he awakens
   the minds of men, that they might acknowledge the judgment of God; and
   at the same time he laughs to scorn the vain confidence with which the
   Idumeans were inflated; and besides, he strengthens the minds of the
   godly, that they might not doubt but that God would perform what he
   declares, for he can indeed penetrate even to the lowest deep.

   In short, the Prophet intimates that the faithful did not act wisely,
   if they measured God's vengeance, which was impending on the Idumeans,
   by their own understanding or by what usually happens; for the Lord
   would make a thorough search, so that no hiding-places would escape his
   sight; and then all their treasures would be exposed as a prey to their
   enemies. We hence learn, that as men in vain seek hiding places for
   themselves that they may be safe from dangers; so in vain they conceal
   their riches; for the hand of God can penetrate beyond the sea, land,
   heaven, and the lowest deep. Nothing then remains for us but ever to
   offer ourselves and all our things to God. If he protects us under his
   wings, we shall be safe in the midst of innumerable dangers; but if we
   think that subterfuges will be of any avail to us, we deceive
   ourselves. The Prophet now adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 7-8

   7. All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border:
   the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed
   against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee:
   there is none understanding in him.

   7. Usque ad terminum expulerunt te omnes viri foederis tui; deceperunt
   te, praevaluerunt tibi, viri pacifici tui (viri pacis tuae;) viri panis
   tui posuerunt vulnus sub te: nulla est intelligentia in eo.

   8. Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men
   out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

   8. Annon in die illa, dicit Jehova, perdam sapientes ex Edom? Et
   intelligentiam e monte Esau? (hoc est, e monte Seir.)


   Here the Prophet expresses the manner in which God would punish the
   Idumeans: trusting in their confederacies, they despised God, as we
   have already had to observe. The Prophet now shows that it is in the
   power of God to change the minds of men, so that they who were their
   friends being suddenly inflamed with rage, would go forth to destroy
   the Idumeans. Seeing then that they regarded the Assyrians not only as
   a shield to them, but also as a defense against God himself, the
   Prophet here declares that when it would be God's purpose to punish
   them, there would be no need to send to a distance for agents or
   instruments to execute his vengeance; for he would arm the Assyrians
   themselves and the Chaldeans, inasmuch as he could turn the hearts of
   men as he pleased. We now see the Prophet's meaning; for he here takes
   away and shakes off the vain confidence of the Idumeans, that they
   might not harden themselves for being fortified by confederacies and
   for having powerful friends, for the Lord would turn friends into
   enemies. To thy border, he says, have they driven thee slch shilach is
   properly to send forth or to throw away; some render it, they have
   followed; as though the Prophet here spoke of the neighboring nations,
   and according to their view the meaning is, "However much thy neighbors
   may love thee, yet nothing will they show of this love, except that
   they will follow thee with feigned tears, when thine enemies shall lead
   thee away captive." But this is a strained exposition, and corresponds
   not with the context. The Prophet then describes here, I doubt not, the
   change, such as would take place, that the Idumeans might know, that
   they trusted in vain in their power and defenses. The men of thy
   covenant, he says, have driven thee away; as though he said, "See what
   thou gainest in anxiously seeking the friendship of those who will yet
   be thy enemies; hadst thou remained quiet in thy clefts, it would have
   been much better for thee: but now thou runnest to Assyria and Chaldea,
   and this will be the cause of thy ruin. Hence the men of thy covenant
   shall banish thee to the border: but if thou hadst had no friendship
   nor commerce with them, thou mightest have lived safely in thy
   recesses, no one would have driven thee out: just, then, has been the
   reward of thy ambition, for having thus resorted to the Assyrians and
   Chaldeans."

   Continuing the same subject, the Prophet says, Deceived thee have the
   men of thy peace -- friends and confederates; for the Hebrews call
   those men of peace, who are connected together by any kind of alliance.
   The men then of thy peace, that is those whom thou thoughtest thou
   mightest trust, and on whom thou midst rely; -- these have deceived
   thee, even these have prevailed against thee, and oppressed thee
   through craft and treachery. The men of thy bread have placed under
   thee a wound: the men of bread were those who were guests or friends.
   Some give this rendering, "Who eat thy bread;" and it is an admissible
   interpretation, for the Assyrians and Chaldeans, as they were
   insatiable, had taken booty from the Idumeans; for whosoever then
   hunted for their friendship, must have brought them some gifts. Since
   then they thus sold their friendship, the Prophet rightly calls them
   the men of bread with regard to those whose substance and wealth they
   devoured. If then we take the men of bread in this sense, there is a
   probability in the meaning. But we may give another interpretation, as
   though he had said that they were guests and friends: these then have
   fixed under thee a wound, that is, they have been thy destruction, and
   that through guile and hidden artifices. When one attacks another
   openly, he who is attacked can avoid the stroke; but the Prophet says,
   that the Assyrians and Chaldeans would be perfidious to the Idumeans,
   so as to conquer them through treachery. Fix then shall they a wound
   under thee, as when one hides a dagger between the bed and the sheet,
   when a person intends to go to sleep. So also he says that a wound is
   placed underneath, when a feigned friend hides himself, that he may
   more easily hurt him whom he assails deceitfully and craftily.

   He at length thus concludes, There is no intelligence in him. Here the
   Prophet no doubt derides in an indirect way the foolish confidence with
   which the Idumeans were blinded; for they thought themselves to be in a
   superlative degree wary, so that they had no reason to fear, as they
   could see afar off, and arrange their concerns with the utmost
   prudence. Since then they thought that they excelled in wisdom, and
   could not be surprised by any craft, the Prophet says here, that there
   would be in them no understanding.

   But he immediately subjoins the reason, "Shall I not in that day, saith
   Jehovah, destroy, or extinguish, the wise from Edom?" While the
   Idumeans were prosperous, because they acted wisely, it was incredible
   that they could thus in a moment be overthrown: but the Prophet says,
   that even this was in the hand and power of God; "Can I not," he says,
   "put an end to whatever there is of wisdom in the Idumeans? Cannot I
   destroy all their prudent men? This will I do." We now then perceive
   the import of the words.

   But this place deserves notice: the Prophet upbraids the Idumeans, and
   says, that their confederates and friends would prove their ruin,
   because they had conspired among themselves beyond what was just and
   right. When men thus mutually join together, there are none of them who
   do not greedily seek their own advantage; in the meantime, both sides
   are deceived; for God disconcerts their counsels, and blasts the issue,
   because they regard not the right end. And when the wicked seek
   friendships, they ever blend something that is wrong; they either try
   to injure the innocent, or they seek some advantage. All the compacts
   then which the ungodly and the despisers of God make with one another,
   have always something vicious intermixed; it is therefore no wonder
   that the Lord disappoints them of their hope, and curses their
   counsels. This is then the reason why the Prophet declares to the
   Idumeans, that those, whom they thought to be their best and most
   faithful friends, would be their ruin.

   But here it may be objected and said, that the same thing happens to
   the children of God. For David, though he acted towards all with the
   utmost faithfulness and the greatest sincerity, yet complains, that the
   man of his peace and a friend had contrived against him many frauds,

   Raised up his heel against me,' he says,
   has the man of my peace;
   eat bread together did I with him, and he with me,'
   (Psalm 41:9)

   It was necessary also that this should have been the case with Christ
   himself. Now, if the children of God must be conformed to the image of
   Christ, what the Prophet says is no more than what applies to the whole
   Church, and to every member of it. This may appear strange at the first
   view; but a solution may be easily given: for while we strive to
   maintain peace with all men, though they may perfidiously, through
   treachery, oppress us, yet the Lord himself will succor us; and in the
   meantime, however hard may this trial be, we yet know that our patience
   is tried by God, that he may at last deliver us, so that we may
   confidently flee to him and testify our sincerity. But while the
   ungodly mutually cheat one another, while with wicked and sideway
   artifices they oppress and circumvent each other, while they cast forth
   their hidden virulence, while they turn peace into war, they know that
   their recompense is just and merited: they cannot flee to God, for
   their conscience restrains them. They indeed understand that they have
   deserved what the Lord has justly repaid them. It is then no wonder
   that the conspiracy in which the Idumeans trusted, when they made the
   Chaldeans their friends, should have been accursed; for the Lord turned
   to their ruin whatever they thought useful to themselves.

   This then is the import of the whole, -- that if we wish not to be
   deceived, we must not attempt anything without an upright heart.
   Provided then we exceed not the limits of our calling, let us cultivate
   peace with all men, let us endeavor to do good to all men, that the
   Lord may bless us; but if it be his purpose to try our patience, he
   will be still present with us, though false friends try us by their
   treacheries, though we be led into danger by their malice, and be for a
   time trodden under their feet; if, on the contrary, we act with bad
   faith, and think that we have fortunate alliances, which have been
   obtained by wicked and nefarious artifices, the Lord will turn for our
   destruction whatever we think to be for our safety.

   We must now notice what the Prophet says, Shall I not in that day
   destroy the wise from Edom? Though men be in many respects blind, whom
   God guides not by his Spirit, and on whom he shines not with his word,
   yet the worst blindness is, when men become inebriated with the false
   conceit of wisdom. When therefore any one thinks himself endued with
   understanding, so that he can perceive whatever is needful, and that he
   cannot be circumvented, his wisdom is insanity and extreme madness: it
   would indeed be better for us to be idiots and fools than to be thus
   inebriated. Since then the wise of this world are insane, the Lord
   declares that they will have no wisdom when the time of trial comes.
   God indeed permits the ungodly for a long time to felicitate themselves
   on account of their own acumen and counsels, as he suffered the
   Idumeans to go on prosperously. And there are also many at this day who
   felicitate themselves on their successes, and almost adore their own
   cunning. Who indeed can persuade the Venetians that there is anywhere
   consummate wisdom but among themselves, by which, forsooth, they
   surpass all others in deception? For no other reason do they, amidst
   many agitations, retain their own position, except that they seem to
   see farther into what is for their own advantages; nay, that kings in
   general stand, and continue safe amidst so many shakings, this they
   ascribe to their own wisdom: "Except I had looked well in this respect
   to my own affairs, except I had anticipated danger, and except I had
   foreseen it, it would have been all over as to my condition." Thus they
   think within themselves: but the Lord at length infatuates them, that
   it may be evident, that this was not formerly said in vain to the
   Idumeans, Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, etc. and it was
   emphatically added, in that day: for the Prophet means, that it was no
   wonder that the Idumeans had been hitherto wary and adopted the best
   counsel; for it was not the Lord's purpose to deprive them of wisdom;
   but when the suitable time of vengeance came, he instantly took away
   whatever prudence there was in them; for it is indeed in God's hand to
   take away whatever there is either of understanding or of acuteness in
   men.

   But we are warned by these words, that if we excel in understanding, we
   are not to abuse this singular gift of God, as we see the case to be
   with the ungodly, who turn to cunning whatever wisdom the Lord has
   bestowed on them. There is hardly one in a hundred to be found, who
   does not seek to be crafty and deceitful, if he excels in
   understanding. This is a very wretched thing. What a great treasure is
   wisdom? Yet we see that the world perverts this excellent gift of God;
   the more reason there is for us to labor, that our wisdom should be
   founded in true simplicity. This is one thing. Then we must also beware
   of trusting in our own understanding, and of despising our enemies, and
   of thinking that we can ward off any evil that may impend over us; but
   let us ever seek from the Lord, that we may be favored at all times
   with the spirit of wisdom, that it may guide us to the end of life: for
   he can at any moment take from us whatever he has given us, and thus
   expose us to shame and reproach.

   When he says, from mount Esau, he means mount Seir, as I have already
   reminded you. But he meant to point out their whole country; for they
   were almost surrounded by mountains, and dwelt, as it is well known, in
   that Arabia which is called Patraea. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 9

   9 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every
   one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

   9 Et deficient (vel, frangentur) fortes tui, Theman, ut excidatur vir e
   monte Esau prae occisione (vel, quia excidetur; lmn enim postest duobis
   modis exponi.)


   The Prophet, after having spoken of one kind of God's vengeance, adds
   another, -- that he would break whatever there was of strength in
   Idumea: and thus he shows that the courage and strength of men, no less
   than their understanding, are in the hand of God. As then God
   dissipates and destroys, whenever it pleases him, whatever wisdom there
   may be in men, so also he enervates and breaks down their hearts: in a
   word, he deprives them of all strength, so that they fail and come to
   nothing of themselves. Were they who are proud of their strength and
   counsels rightly to consider this, they would at length learn to submit
   themselves in true humility to God. But this truth is what the world
   cannot be made to believe: yet God shows to us here, as in a picture,
   that however men may flourish for a time, they would immediately
   vanish, were not he to sustain them, and to support his gifts in them,
   and keep them entire; and, especially, that empty smoke is everything,
   that seems to be understanding and strength in men; for the Lord can
   easily take away both, whensoever it may please him.

   We ought therefore carefully to observe what he says here, Broken down
   shall be thy brave men, O Teman. Some think that a particular country
   is here pointed out; for Teman is the south, that is, with regard to
   Judea. But as Teman, we know, was one of the grandsons of Esau,
   (Genesis 36:15,) and as a part of Arabia was called by this name, it is
   the more probable, that the Prophet turns here his discourse to Idumea.
   But as to the word Teman, it is, a part taken for the whole.

   For cut off, he says, shall be man: by saying, cut off shall man, he
   means, that all to a man would be destroyed. How? "by slaughter" [75] .
   But qtl kothel means a slaughter in which no one remains alive. We
   hence see what the Prophet means, -- that all the Idumeans would be so
   broken down, that all would fall, for there would be no heart nor
   strength to resist. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   next verse, but as it appears for no sufficient reasons, while indeed
   there is nothing in the context that requires such a change. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 10-11

   10. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,
   and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

   10. Propter oppressionem fratris tui Jacob, operiet te opprobrium, et
   excideris in perpetuum.

   11. In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that
   the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered
   into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of
   them.

   11. Die quo stabas ex opposito, die quo alieni auferebant substantiam
   ejus, et extranei ingressi sunt portas ejus, et super Jerusalem
   miserunt sortem, etiam tu quasi unus ex illis.


   The Prophet here sets forth the reason why God would deal so severely
   and dreadfully with the Idumeans. Had he simply prophesied of their
   destruction, it would have been an important matter; for the Jews might
   have thereby known that their ruin was not chance, but the scourge of
   God; they might have known that they themselves were with others
   chastised by God, and this would have been a useful instruction to
   them: but what brought them the chief consolation was to hear, that
   they were so dear to God that he would undertake the defense of their
   wrongs and avenge them, that he would have a regard for their safety.
   Hence, when they heard that God, because he loved them, would punish
   the Idumeans, it was doubtless an invaluable comfort to them in their
   calamities. To this subject the Prophet now comes.

   For the unjust oppression of thy brother Jacob, etc. The word chms
   chemes, violence, is to be taken passively; as though he said, "See,
   how thou hast acted towards thy brother Jacob." And he calls him his
   brother, not for honor's sake, but, on the contrary, for the purpose of
   showing forth more fully the cruelty of the Idumeans; for consanguinity
   had had no effect in preventing them from raging against their own
   brethren, and as it were against their own bowels. It was therefore a
   proof of barbarous inhumanity, that the Idumeans, forgetting their
   common nature, had been so inflamed with hatred against their own
   brethren: for, as it is well known, they had descended from the same
   common father, Abraham, and also from Isaac, and had the symbol of
   circumcision. The Idumeans indeed professed that they were the
   descendants of Abraham, and were God's peculiar people. Since then God
   had made his covenant with their common father Isaac, and since they
   had equally retained circumcision, which was the seal of that covenant,
   how did it happen, that the Idumeans conducted themselves so cruelly
   towards their brethren? We hence see, that the name of brother in this
   clause -- for the oppression of thy brother Jacob, is mentioned for the
   purpose of enhancing their crime.

   As then, he says, thou hast been so violent against thy brother, cover
   thee shall reproach, and forever shalt thou be cut off. He intimates
   that the calamity would not be only for a time as in the case of
   Israel, but that the Lord would execute such a punishment as would
   prove that the Idumeans were aliens to him; for God in chastising his
   Church ever observes certain limits, as he never forgets his covenant.
   He proves indeed that the Idumeans were not his people, however much
   they might falsely boast that they were the children of Abraham, and
   make claim to the sign of circumcision; for they were professedly
   enemies, and had entirely departed from all godliness: it was then no
   wonder that their circumcision, which they had impiously profaned, was
   made no account of. But he afterwards more fully and largely unfolds
   the same thing.

   In the day, he says, in which thou didst stand on the opposite side".
   But the Idumeans might have made this objection, "Why dost thou accuse
   us for having violently oppressed our brother? for we were not the
   cause why they were destroyed: they had a quarrel with the Assyrians,
   we labored to protect our own interest in the midst of these
   disturbances; we sought peace with the Assyrians, and if necessity so
   compelled us, that ought not to be ascribed to us as a crime or blame."
   In this way the Idumeans might have made a defense: but the Prophet
   dissipates all such pretenses by saying, In the day in which thou didst
   stand on the opposite side, in the day in which strangers took away his
   substance, and aliens entered his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem --
   were not thou there? Even thou were as one of them. Now this is
   emphatically introduced -- Even thou or, thou also; (Tu etiam) for the
   Prophet exhibits it here as a hateful omen: "It was no wonder that the
   Assyrians and Chaldeans shed the blood of thy brethren, for they were
   enemies, they were foreigners, they were a very distant people: but
   thou, who were of the same blood, thou, whom the bond of religion ought
   to have restrained, and further, even thou, who oughtest by the very
   claims of vicinity either to have helped thy brethren, or at least to
   have condoled with them -- yea, thou were so cruel as to have been as
   one of his enemies: this surely can by no means be endured."

   We now perceive what the Prophet meant by saying, In the day in which
   thou didst stand on the opposite side: it is then as it were, an
   explanation of the former sentence, lest the Idumeans should make a
   false excuse by objecting that they had not been violent against their
   brethren. It was indeed the worst oppression, when they stood over
   against them; though they were not armed they yet took pleasure in a
   spectacle so mournful; besides they not only were idle spectators of
   the calamity of their brethren but were also as it were a part of their
   enemies. "Hast thou then not been as one of them?" I shall not proceed
   farther now.

   Prayer

   Grant Almighty God, that as thou hast once received us under thy
   protection, and hast promised that our salvation would be so much cared
   for by thee, that whatever Satan and the whole world may contrive, thou
   wilt yet keep us safe and secure, -- O grant, that being endued with
   perseverance, we may remain within our borders, and be not carried away
   here and there either by craft or by wicked counsels; but be thou
   pleased to keep us in genuine integrity, that being protected by thy
   help, we may, by experience, find that true which thou declarest in thy
   word, that they who call on thee in truth shall ever know thee to be
   propitious to them: and since thou hast already made open to us an
   access to thee in the person of thy only -- begotten Son, O grant, that
   we the sheep, may rely on him as our shepherd, and resignedly abide
   under his protection until we be removed from all dangers into that
   eternal rest, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy Son
   Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Obadiah 12-14

   12. But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the
   day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced
   over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither
   shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

   12. Et non aspicias in die fratris tui, in die alientationis ejus, et
   ne gaudeas super filiis Jehudah die exitii corum, et ne magnifices os
   tuum in die afflictionis (hoc est, ne magnifice loquaris.)

   13. Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the
   day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their
   affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their
   substance in the day of their calamity;

   13. Ne intres in portam populi mei die exitii eorum, ne aspicias etiam
   tu in afflictione ejus, (in malo ejus,) in die exitii ejus, et ne
   extendas (manum subaudiendum est) in substantiam ejus in die exitii
   ejus;

   14. Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those
   of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those
   of his that did remain in the day of distress.

   14. Et ne stes super exitum (vel, lacerationem, confractionem,) ad
   perdendum eos qui evaserint, et ne tradas (vel, concludas) residuos
   ejus in dic afflictionis.


   The Prophet enumerates here the kinds of cruelty which the Idumeans
   exercised towards the Church of God, the children of Abraham, their own
   kindred. But he speaks by way of prohibition; it is then a
   personification, by which the Prophet introduces God as the speaker, as
   though he taught and admonished them on the duties of human kindness.
   Engraven, indeed, on their hearts ought all these to have been, on
   account of which he now reproaches them; for by forgetting humanity
   they had departed from everything right which nature requires. God
   indeed did not commence by instructing or teaching the Idumeans what
   were their duties; but the Prophet reminds them of things which must
   have been well known to them, and were beyond all dispute true.

   Hence he says, Thou shouldest not look on in the day of thy brother, in
   the day of his alienation. The day of Judah he calls that in which God
   visited him: so the day of Jerusalem is called the day of calamity.
   Thou shouldest not then look on: we know in what sense this verb, to
   look on, is usually taken in Scripture; it is applied to men, when they
   lie in wait, or very anxiously desire anything, or rejoice at what they
   witness. The Prophet no doubt takes it metaphorically for taking
   delight in the misery of the chosen people; for, shortly after, he
   repeats the same word. Thou shouldest not then look on in the day of
   thy brother, even in the day of his alienation Some take another sense;
   but I approve of their opinion, who regard this alienation as meaning
   exile; at the same time, they give not the reason for this metaphor,
   which is this, -- that such a change then took place in the people,
   that they put on a new appearance. It was then alienation, when God
   wholly abolished the glory of the kingdom of Judah, and when he took
   away all his favors, so that the appearance of the people became
   deformed. In the day then of his alienation, that is, when the Lord
   stripped him of his ancient dignity.

   Thou shouldest not rejoice, he says, over the children of Judah, in the
   day of their destruction, that is of their ruin; "thou shouldest not
   make thy mouth great in the day of affliction". We now perceive what
   the Prophet means. Though indeed he seems here to show to the Idumeans
   their duty, he yet reproves them for having neglected all the laws of
   humanity, and of having been carried away by their own pride and
   cruelty. It hence follows that they were worthy of that dreadful
   vengeance which he has already mentioned. In case then the Idumeans
   complained that God dealt too severely with them, the Prophet here
   reminds them, that they in many ways sought such a ruin for themselves,
   -- How so? "Were not thou delighted with the calamity of thy brother?
   Didst not thou laugh when Judah was distressed? And didst not thou
   speak loftily in ridicule? Was this outrageousness to be endured? Can
   the Lord now spare thee, as thou hast been so cruel towards thy
   brother?" And he repeats the name of brother, for the crime was the
   more atrocious, as it has been already said, as they showed no regard
   for those of their own blood. But the Prophet often mentions either
   affliction, or ruin, or calamity, or evils, or adversity; for it is a
   feeling naturally implanted in us, that when one is distressed, we are
   touched with pity; even when we see our enemies lie prostrate on the
   ground, our hatred and anger are extinguished, or at least are abated:
   and all who see even their enemies ill-treated, become, as it were,
   other men, that is, they put off the anger with which they were
   previously inflamed. As then this is what is common almost to all men,
   it appears that the Idumeans must have been doubly and treble
   barbarous, when they rejoiced at the calamity of their brethren, and
   took pleasure in a spectacle so sad and mournful, and even spoke
   proudly, and jeered the miserable Jews; for this, as we have said, is
   the meaning of the words, to make great the mouth.

   It follows, Thou shouldest not enter the gates of my people in the day
   of their destruction, nor shouldest thou look on in their calamity.
   Probably the Idumeans had made an irruption in company with the
   Assyrians and Chaldeans, when they ought to have remained at home, and
   there to lament the slaughter of their brethren. For if I cannot save
   my friend from death or from a calamity, I shall yet withdraw myself,
   for I could not bear to look on: but were I constrained to look on my
   friend, and be not able to succor him in his necessity, I should rather
   close my eyes; for there is in the eyes, we know, the tenderest
   sympathy. As then the Idumeans willingly went forth and entered
   Jerusalem with the enemies, it was hence evident that they were no
   better than wild beasts. Thou shouldest not then, he says, enter the
   gates of my people in the day of slaughter, nor shouldest thou
   especially then, look on. He again repeats gm 'th gam ate, thou also,
   or, especially thou: "If other neighbors do this, yet thou shouldest
   abstain, for thou art of the same blood; if thou can't not bring help,
   show at least some token of grief and of sympathy: but as thou
   willingly and gladly lookest on their calamities, it is quite evident
   that there is not in thee a particle of right feeling."

   He afterwards adds, Thou shouldest not stretch forth thy hand to his
   substance. Here he accuses the Idumeans of having been implicated in
   taking the spoils with other enemies, as though he said, "Ye have not
   only suffered your brethren to be pillaged, but ye became robbers
   yourselves. Ye ought to have felt sorrow in seeing them distressed by
   foreign enemies; but ye have plundered with them, and enriched
   yourselves with spoils; this certainly is by no means to be endured."

   It follows, And thou shouldest not stand on the going forth. The word
   phrq perek signifies to break, to dissipate, to rend; hence phrq perek,
   as a noun, in Hebrew means rending and breaking. Therefore some take it
   metaphorically for a place where two ways meet, when one road is cut or
   divided into two. When the two meet then there is a going forth by two
   ways; hence they take phrq, perek, for such a place. But we may simply
   take it for the rending of the people. Though I am certainly pleased
   with the first explanation, yet I do not confine the word to that
   meaning; and I prefer the idea of going forth, as it harmonizes better
   with the context: Thou hast stood then on the going forth; and for what
   purpose? To destroy those who had escaped, and to stop or to deliver up
   his remaining captives in the day of affliction. In short, the Prophet
   means that the Idumeans occupied all the ways, to intercept the
   miserable exiles, to whom flight was the only way of safety.

   As then the miserable Jews tried by winding outlets to provide for
   their own safety, the Prophet says that they were intercepted by the
   Idumeans, lest any of them should escape, and that they were stopped,
   that afterwards they might be slain by their enemies. Inasmuch as the
   Assyrians and the Chaldeans were a people far remote from Judea, it is
   probable that the roads were unknown to them, and that they were afraid
   of being entrapped; but the Idumeans, who were familiarly acquainted
   with all their roads, could stand at all the outlets. Some give the
   following explanation, but it is too frigid: Thou shouldest not stand
   for the rending of thy brethren, that is, thou should not stand still,
   but strive to extend a helping hand to the distressed: but this, as I
   have said, is too frigid and strained. Thou shouldest not then stand on
   the going forth of the roads to destroy We now see what the Prophet had
   in view; to destroy, he says, and whom did they destroy? Even those who
   had already escaped. Expressly then is pointed out here the cruelty to
   which I have referred, that the Idumeans were not contented with the
   ruin of the city, and the great slaughter which had been made; but in
   case any had stealthily escaped, they occupied the outlets of the
   roads, that they might not flee away: and the same thing is meant when
   he adds, that all were betrayed or stopped who had remained alive in
   the day of affliction.

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning; -- that the Idumeans could not
   complain that God was too severe with them, when he reduced them to
   nothing, because they had given examples of extreme cruelty towards
   their own brethren, and at a time when their calamities ought to have
   obliterated all hatred and old enmities, as it is usually the case even
   with men the most alienated from one another. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 15

   15. For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast
   done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine
   own head.

   15. Quia propinquus dies Jehovae super omnes gentes; sicut fecisti fiet
   tibi; merces tua revertetur in caput tuum.


   By saying that the day of Jehovah was nigh upon all nations, the
   Prophet may be regarded as reasoning from the greater to the less: "If
   God will not spare other nations, how canst thou escape his hand?" In a
   like manner does Jeremiah speak in chapter 49, (Jeremiah 49:12) he
   addresses the Idumeans in these words, Behold, they shall drink of the
   cup, who have not been by judgment condemned to drink; and shalt thou
   not taste? by drinking thou shalt drink to the very dregs. He shows
   then that the Idumeans deserved a double vengeance; for if indeed they
   were compared with the Assyrians and Chaldeans, the fault of the latter
   would appear small: the Chaldeans might pretend some causes for the
   war, they were aliens, they were, in short, professed enemies; but the
   Idumeans were neighbors and kindred. The same thing might be also said
   of other nations. But the words may be explained in a simpler manner;
   and that is, that God would not only take vengeance on one or two
   nations, but on all. "See," he says, "a change will take place not only
   in one corner, but in the whole world. The Lord will thus show that he
   is the judge of the whole earth. Hence it follows, that the Idumeans
   also must render an account, for God has resolved to execute judgment
   on all nations; no one whatever shall be passed by."

   Behold, then, nigh is the day of Jehovah. We have said that the time in
   which Obadiah prophesied is unknown to us. But it is no matter of
   wonder that he declares that nigh is the day of Jehovah; for the Lord
   hastens not after the manner of men; but, at the same time, he knows
   his own seasons; and this is ever accomplished, that when the ungodly
   think themselves to be at rest, then sudden destruction overtakes them.

   He draws this conclusion, As thou hast done, so shall it be done to
   thee. There seems, however, to be here an implied comparison between
   the chastisement of the chosen people and the punishment which shall be
   inflicted on other nations. When the Idumeans saw that the kingdom of
   Israel and of Judah was trodden under foot, they thought that the
   children of Abraham were thus punished because they had despised their
   own Prophets, because they had become immoral and perverse in the
   extreme. Thus they exempted themselves and others from punishment. Now
   the Prophet declares that God had been the judge of his people, but
   that he is also the judge of the whole world, and that this would
   quickly be made evident. When, therefore, he says, that nigh was the
   day of Jehovah, he had, I have no doubt, a regard, as I have already
   said, to the chastisement of the Church; as though he said, "As God has
   proved himself to be one who justly punishes sins with respect to
   Israel and Judah; so also at length he will ascend his tribunal to
   judge all the nations; no one, therefore, shall escape punishment. All
   then in their different conditions shall be constrained to give an
   account of their actions, for the Lord will spare none: and though he
   has begun with his Church and his own house, yet there will come
   afterwards the suitable time to take vengeance, when he will extend his
   hand to punish all heathen nations." This, seems to me to be the real
   meaning.

   Rightly then does he conclude, As then thou hast done, it shall be done
   to thee: "Think not that thou shalt be unpunished for having gone
   against thy brother. It was God's purpose to exhibit an example of his
   severity towards others, while he spared thee; but thou hast abused his
   forbearance; for thou mightest have remained quiet at home: the Lord
   will then repay thee." And then he subjoins, Thy reward shall recoil,
   or return, on thine own head Here the Prophet announces what Christ
   also says

   With what measure any one measures, it shall be repaid to him,'
   (Matthew 7:2.)

   This sentence is worthy of being noticed: for when God leaves the
   innocent to the will of the ungodly, they think that they may do
   whatever they please with impunity, as though they were the
   executioners of God. As then they become thus insolent when the Lord
   spares them, let us take notice of what the Prophet says here, -- that
   a reward is prepared for every one, and that whatever cruelty the
   ungodly may exercise, it shall be returned on their own heads. It
   follows --

   Obadiah 16

   16. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
   heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall
   swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.

   16. Quia sicuti bibistis super montem sanctum meum, bibent omnes gentes
   jugiter, bibent (inquam) et sorbebunt; et erunt quasi non sint.


   Here Obadiah proceeds farther and says, that God would revenge the
   wrongs done to his Church. The declaration in the last verse was
   general, "Behold, on all the nations the day of Jehovah is nigh; as
   then thou hast done, God will repay thee:" but now he shows that this
   would be, because God purposed to defend his own servants, (clientes --
   clients;) and as they had been cruelly treated, he would become the
   avenger of their wrongs; As then ye have drunk on my holy mountain,
   etc. The Prophet, I have no doubt, taking a part for the whole,
   included in the word drink their triumphs and rejoicings. As then ye
   have rejoiced on my holy mountain, so also all the nations shall drink
   and continue their excess; they shall drink up, so that ye shall
   utterly perish. But the Prophet appears to me evidently to add here a
   proof of their avariciousness. He had shortly before accused the
   Idumeans of having taken away a part of the spoil, together with the
   foreign nations, when the miserable Jews were plundered. So also, he
   says now, Ye have drunk, in token of triumph and rejoicing.

   Ye have then drunk wine on my holy mountain: now drink shall all the
   nations This latter drinking is to be taken in a sense different from
   the former. What then? Drink they shall, and drink up, that is, "They
   shall consume all your substance." And he afterwards adds, And drink
   they shall continually; and they shall be as though they had not been,
   that is they shall not cease to eat and to drink until they shall
   consume whatever is among you. He then intimates that the Idumeans, who
   had enriched themselves with the spoils of their brethren, and who had
   also kept feastings in token of their joy on the holy mountain, would
   hereafter be the food of others, for all the nations would drink, and
   drink them up To drink then here is the same as to consume. It follows,
   (for I am under the necessity of finishing this prophecy today, and
   time, I hope, will allow me) --

   Obadiah 17

   17. But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
   holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

   17. Et in monte Sion erit evasio, et erit sanctitas (nempe mons ipse;)
   et possidebit domus Jacob possessiones suas (alii vertunt, eos a quibus
   possidebantur.


   Here the Prophet promises deliverance to the Jews; for other
   consolations would have been of no great moment, had they, who then
   were perishing, no hope of being some time restored to safety. The Jews
   might indeed have objected, and said, "What is it to us, though the
   Lord may avenge our wrongs? Should the Idumeans be destroyed for our
   sake, what profit will that be to us? We are in the meantime destroyed
   and have no hope of deliverance." The Prophet here meets this
   objection, and says, In mount Zion shall be escape Though then the
   Idumeans had attempted to intercept all outlets, as it has been before
   mentioned, yet God promises here that there would be an escape in mount
   Zion: he says not, from mount Zion, but in the very mountain. What does
   this mean? even that God would restore those who might seem then to be
   lost. Then Obadiah clearly promises that there would be a restoration
   of the Church.

   But we are taught in this place, that the punishment, by which the Lord
   chastises his people for their sins, is ever for a time. Whenever then
   God inflicts wounds on his Church, prepared at the same time is the
   remedy; for God designs not, nor does he suffer, that his own people
   should be wholly lost. This we may learn from the Prophet's words, when
   he says, that there would be escape in Zion. And it was no ordinary
   comfort for the Jews to know, that even in their extreme decay, there
   remained for them some hope of deliverance, and that the people, who
   might appear at the time to be extinct, would yet be saved, and
   preserved alive, as though they arose from the dead.

   He says that mount Zion would be holiness or holy, by which he means
   that God would be mindful of his covenant. As then he had chosen mount
   Zion where he would be worshipped, the Prophet intimates that God's
   name was not there involved presumptuously or in vain. Inasmuch as God
   had chosen this mount for himself, it was holy; for God is said to have
   profaned the land and the temple, when he forsook them and delivered
   them up into the hands of enemies. So also now when the Prophet says,
   that mount Zion would be holy, it is the same as though he had said,
   that God would have a care for this mountain, because he had once
   consecrated it to himself, and designed it to be his own habitation.
   The cause then is put here for its effect. He had said, that the Jews
   would survive, how much soever like the lost and the dead they might
   for a time be, -- How could such a thing be? The reason is this, --
   mount Zion shall be holy: it was a dreadful profanation of mount Zion
   when the temple was destroyed, when the holy vessels were taken away by
   the Babylonians, when, in short, the enemies showed there every kind of
   insolence. But when the Lord restored his people, when the altar was
   built again, and sacrifices were offered, then mount Zion recovered its
   holiness, that is, God manifested that the grace of his election had
   not been abolished, for he had again sanctified mount Zion, and thus
   designed it to be preserved safe. Holy then shall be mount Zion Were
   any one disposed to refine more on the Prophet's words, he might say,
   that it is evidently the manner of our salvation that is intended, when
   God is said to sanctify or govern us by his Spirit: but the Prophet, I
   have no doubt, has regard here simply to the election of God.

   And the house of Jacob shall again possess his own possessions, that is
   whatever God has given as an heritage to the children of Abraham, he
   will restore to them when they return from exile. If any one prefers to
   take possessions to be those of Edom, I do not object. But yet I think
   that the real meaning of the Prophet is, that when the children of
   Israel should return from exile, God would restore to them their
   ancient country, that they might possess whatever had been promised to
   their father Abraham. He means then, by their possessions, the whole
   land, which came by lot into the possession of the chosen people, as it
   had been promised to Abraham. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 18

   18. And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a
   flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in
   them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the
   house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken it

   18. Et erit domus Jacob ignis, et domus Joseph in flammam (flamma, ut
   respondeat,) et domus Esau erit palea; et ardebunt in ipsis et
   consument (vorabunt) eos; et non erit quidquam residuum domui Esau,
   quia Jehova loquutus est.


   Here again the Prophet meets a doubt, which might come into the mind of
   each of them; for the Idumeans were flourishing, and their condition
   was independent, when the Israelites as well as the Jews were led into
   exile, and Jerusalem with its temple was destroyed. They might under
   such circumstances despair; but the Prophet shows, that though for a
   time the house of Jacob seemed to be dead, yet a fire would be kindled,
   which would consume the Idumeans, though they were then proud of their
   power and their wealth, and also of the prosperous issue of the victory
   over the Jews, for they had been enriched, and well as the Assyrians,
   by the overthrow of their brethren. A similar mode of speaking Isaiah
   also adopts; though he directs his discourse, not to the Idumeans, but
   to others, yet his manner of speaking is the same when he says, that
   God, the light of Israel, would be a fire and a flame to consume the
   wicked, (Isaiah 29:6.)

   But this was fulfilled, when the Lord avenged the cruelty of Edom,
   though the Jews were then in exile and could not move a finger, when
   they were without arms, yea, when they were miserable slaves: the
   Idumeans were even then consumed, by what fire? how was this burning
   kindled? Even then the house of Jacob and the house of Joseph were like
   a fire and a flame The cause of this ruin, it is true, did not
   immediately appear to the Idumeans: but we must here look to the
   purpose of God. Why did God with so much severity punish the Idemeans?
   Because he intended by this example to show how much he loved his
   Church. Since then their cruelty was the cause of ruin to the Idumeans,
   rightly does the prophet say, that the house of Jacob and the house of
   Joseph would be like a fire and a flame to consume the Idumeans. And it
   was not a small solace to the miserable exiles, when they understood,
   that they were still regarded by God in their depressed condition.
   Inasmuch then as they were exposed to the reproach and ridicule of all,
   it pleased God to testify that they were the objects of his care, and
   that he would, for their sake, destroy whole nations even those who
   then gloried in their power. We now then see why the Prophet adopted
   this figurative language. By the house of Joseph, he means as we have
   said elsewhere the kingdom of Israel; he mentions a part for the whole.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Obadiah 19-20

   19. And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of
   the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of
   Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead

   19..Et possidebunt meridiem montis Esau, et planietiem Philistim, et
   possidebunt agros Ephraim et agros Samariae; et Benjamin possidebit
   Gilead.

   20. And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
   possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity
   of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the
   south.

   20. Et migratio exercitus hujus filiorum Israel, quod Chananaeorum fuit
   usque ad Zerphath (vel, qui sunt in Chananaeis,) et migratio Jerusalem,
   quod in Sepharad, possidebunt (in quam) urbes Australes (vel,
   meridionales.) [76]


   The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, -- that God would not only
   gather the remnants of his people from the Babylonian exile, but would
   restore the exiles, that they might rule far and wide, and that their
   condition might be better than it was before: for the Prophet, as I
   think, directs the attention to the first blessing of God, which had
   been deposited in the hand of Abraham. God had promised to the
   posterity of Abraham the whole land from Euphrates to the sea. Now this
   land had never been possessed by the children of Abraham. This
   happened, as it is well known, through their sloth and ingratitude.
   David in his time enlarged the borders; but yet he only made those
   tributaries whom God had commanded to be destroyed. So this blessing
   had never been fulfilled, because the people put a hindrance in the
   way. The Prophet now, speaking of the restoration of the Church, tells
   the people, who would return from exile, that they were to occupy the
   country which had been promised to their fathers as though he said,
   "There will come to you a full and complete inheritance."

   Now it is certain that this prophecy has never been completed: we know
   that but a small portion of the land was possessed by the Jews. What
   then are we to understand by this prophecy? It does unquestionably
   appear that the Prophet speaks here of the kingdom of Christ; and we
   know that the Church was then really restored, and that the Jews not
   only recovered their former state from which they had fallen, but that
   their kingdom was increased: for how great became the splendor of the
   kingdom and of the temple under Christ? This then is what the Prophet
   now means, when he promises to the Jews the heritage which they had
   lost; yea, God then enlarged the borders of Judea. Hence he shows that
   they should not only be restored to their former condition, but that
   the kingdom would be increased in splendor and wealth, when Christ
   should come. Let us now run over the words.

   Possess then shall they the south of the mount of Esau. The space was
   no doubt great: even when David reigned, the Jews did not possess that
   part or south portion of mount Seir. Then the Prophet, as I have said,
   shows that the borders of the kingdom would be more extensive than they
   had been. And the plain, he says, of the Philistines On that side also
   the Lord would cause that the Jews would extend farther than their
   kingdom. And possess they shall the fields of Ephraim Here I will not
   spend much labor in describing the land: but it is enough for us to
   understand that the design of the Prophet was to show, that the state
   of the people after their exile would be far more splendid than it had
   been before, even under the reign of David. What he means by Gilead is
   not very clear: but it is not probable that mount Gilead is referred to
   here, which was not far distant from the tribe of Benjamin, but rather
   that a town or some place distant from that part, and not included in
   their portion, is pointed out.

   He afterwards adds, And the migrations of this host of the children of
   Israel, etc. There is here an obscurity in the words. The Hebrews by
   Canaan mean the Illyrians as well as Germans, and also the Gauls: for
   they say, that the migration, which shall be dispersed in Gaul, and in
   Germany, and in these far regions, shall possess the southern cities.
   Now by Zarephath they understand Spain. But we know, as we have
   elsewhere said, that the Jews are very bold in their glosses: for they
   are not ashamed to trifle and to blend frivolous things; and they
   assert this as though it were evident from history, and easily found
   out. Thus they prattle about things unknown to them, and this they do
   without any reason or discrimination. The Prophet, I doubt not, means
   here that all those territories, which had been formerly promised to
   the children of Abraham, would come into their possession when the Lord
   would send his Christ, not only to restore what had fallen, but also to
   render the state of the people in every way blessed. The import of the
   whole then is, that the Jews shall not only recover what they had lost,
   but what had not hitherto been given them to possess: all this the Lord
   would bestow on them when Christ came. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] The rendering of the first of these two verses is materially
   different from our version. There are difficulties here which are
   considerable. Our version in the first part follows Septuagint; and
   others have followed the same, such as Newcome and Henderson, though
   Junius and Tremulius and Dathius have rendered it materially the same
   with Calvin, and certainly more in consistency with the Hebrew text.
   The following may be considered as a literal version of the whole
   verse: -- 19. And they shall inherit the south, the mount of Esau,
   And the plain, even that of the Philistines,
   And they shall inherit the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria,
   And of Benjamin, even Gilead. The word "to possess" does not convey the
   meaning of yrs, which means to inherit, or to possess by inheritance,
   as Junius and Tremelius render it -- haereditario jure possidebunt --
   "They shall possess by an hereditary right." And this exactly
   corresponds with Calvin's explanation. Though our version follows the
   Septuagint in the two first lines, it yet departs from it the two last.
   But the 20^th verse is the most difficult. "Captivity" is more properly
   "migration" or transmigration, as Calvin renders it. Then follow the
   words, hchl-chzh lvky ysr'l, literally, in my view, "the beginning,
   this, to the children of Israel." So the Septuagint takes the word
   hchl, as meaning "beginning," and not "host:" it wants the v except in
   three copies, and it always has this, when it means a host. I propose
   the following translation: -- And the migration, which commenced with
   the children of Israel,
   Shall inherit what the Canaanites had as far as Sarephath;
   And the migration from Jerusalem, which are in Saphrad,
   The cities of the south. The latter verse is a fuller explanation of
   the former; and, as is the case commonly in Hebrew, when two things
   previously mentioned are referred to, the order is reversed, the last
   particular is mentioned first, so it is here. The verb "inherit" is in
   the last clause in Hebrew; but the idiom of our language requires it to
   be in the first. -- Ed.

   Obadiah 21

   21. And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
   Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.

   21. Et ascendent servatores in montem Sion, ad judicandum montem Esau;
   et erit Jehovae regnum.


   Here the Prophet says, that there are in God's hand ministers, the
   labor of whom he employs to preserve his own people. He alludes here, I
   have no doubt, to the history of the judges. We indeed know that the
   people of Israel were often so distressed, that their deliverance was
   almost incredible; and that yet they were also delivered in such a way
   as to have made it evident that the hand of God had appeared from
   heaven. Since this then was well known to the Jews, the Prophet here
   reminds them that God had still in his hand redeemers, whenever it
   might please him to gather his people. God then shall send preservers,
   even as he did send them formerly to your fathers. They had indeed
   found true by experience what the Prophet says here, not only once, but
   more than ten times. This then ought to have served much to confirm
   this prophecy.

   Ascend then shall they who will judge the mount of Esau, -- who, being
   endued with the power of God and his authority, will execute judgment
   on mount Seir and on the whole nation, and will avenge the cruelty
   which Edom had exercised towards the children of Abraham.

   But this passage shows, that Christ came not to be the minister of our
   deliverance and salvation in an ordinary way, but that he became our
   savior in a special manner; so that he stands alone in that capacity:
   and this is a very strong argument against the Jews. They confess that
   the Messiah would be the Redeemer of his people, but they ascribe this
   office to him in a general way, as they do to David and other kings.
   But it certainly appears from this passage, that the Messiah would not
   be of the common class, for saviors would be under him as his
   ministers. This the Jews dare not to deny, though they grumble: for it
   would be absurd that he should be one of their number. Since then he
   was sent to be a Redeemer and Savior in a way different from others, it
   follows that he is not man only, but that he is the Author of
   salvation. It would indeed be easy to reply, "Why do you speak to us of
   many redeemers? Do you not hope for one Savior? If God will commit this
   office to many in an equal degree, why are there so many glorious
   promises respecting the Messiah? Why are we ever reminded of him alone?
   Why is he alone set forth to us as the ground of our salvation?" It
   hence certainly appears that Christ is to be distinguished from all
   others, and that others are saviors under his authority; and such were
   the apostles, and such are all at this day, the labor and ministry of
   whom God employs to defend and support his Church.

   Now he adds, Jehovah's shall be the kingdom. But as it is certain, that
   it was God's purpose to rule among his people after having restored
   them, in no other way than by the power of Christ, the Prophet, by
   saying that the kingdom of Christ would be Jehovah's, means, that it
   would be really divine, and more illustrious than if he had employed
   the labor of men. But two things must be here observed by us, -- that
   God himself really rules in the person of Christ, -- and that it is the
   legitimate mode of ruling the Church, that God alone should preside,
   and hold alone the chief power. Hence it follows, that when God does
   not appear as the only King, all things are in confusion, without any
   order. Now God is not called a King by way of an empty distinction: but
   then only is he regarded a King in reality, when all submit themselves
   to him, when they are ruled by his word; in short, when all creatures
   become silent in his presence. To God then belongs the kingdom. We
   hence see that the Church has no existence, where the word of God does
   not so prevail in its authority, as to keep down whatever height there
   is in men, and to bring them under the yoke, so that all may depend on
   God alone, that all may look up to him, and that he may have all in
   subjection to himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so scattered in our pilgrimage in
   this world, that even a dreadful spectacle is presented to our eyes,
   when we see thy Church so miserably rent asunder, O grant, that being
   endued with the real power of thy Spirit, and gathered into one, we may
   so cultivate brotherly kindness among ourselves, that each may strive
   to help another, and at the same time keep our eyes fixed on Christ
   Jesus; and though hard contests may await us, may we yet be under his
   care and protection, and so exercise patience, that having finished our
   warfare, we may at last enjoy that blessed rest, which thou hast
   promised to us, and which is laid up for us in heaven, and which has
   also been purchased for us by the blood of Christ thy Son, one Lord.
   Amen.

   A Translation of

   Calvin's Version of

   The Prophecies of Joel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 1

   1 The word of Jehovah which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.

   2 Hear this, ye the aged; And give ear, al ye inhabitants of the land;
   Hath this been in your days, Or in the days of your fathers?

   3 This to your children declare, And your children to their children,
   And their children to the next generation, --

   4 "The residue of the locust hath the chafer eaten, "The residue of the
   chafer hath the cankerworm eaten, "The residue of the cankerworm hath
   the caterpillar eaten."

   5 Awake ye drunkards, and weep; Howl ye all who drink wine for the new
   wine; For cut off it is from your mouth.

   6 Verily a nation came up over my land, Strong and without number: Its
   teeth the teeth the teeth of a lion, And its jaw-bones those of a young
   lion:

   7 It exposed my vine to desolation, And my fig-tree to the stripping of
   the bark; By denuding it denuded it and cast it away, White have been
   made its branches.--

   8 Lament as a young woman, girded with sackcloth, For the husband of
   her youth.

   9 Cut off is offering and libation From the house of Jehovah; Mourn do
   the priests, the ministers of Jehovah;

   10 Wasted is the field, mourn does the land; For laid waste is the
   corn, Dried up is the wine, destroyed is the oil.

   11 Be ashamed, ye husbandmen, howl, ye vinedressers, On account of the
   wheat and the barley; For perished has the harvest of the field,

   12 The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree is destroyed; The
   pomegranate, the palm also and the apple tree,-- All the trees of the
   field have dried up: Verily dried up is joy among the children of men!

   13 Be girded and lament, ye priests; Howl ye ministers of the altar;
   Come, spend the night in sackcloth, Ye ministers of my God; For
   withheld from the house of your God Is offering and a libation:

   14 Sanctify a fast, call an assembly, Gather the elders, all the
   inhabitants of the land, Into the house of Jehovah your God, And cry ye
   to Jehovah.--

   15 Alas the day! For nigh is the day of Jehovah, And as a desolation
   from the Almighty it will come.

   16 Has not the meat before your eyes been cut off, Joy and gladness
   from the house of our God?

   17 Rotted have the grains under the clods, Desolate are the granaries,
   Pulled down have been the barns, For dried up has the corn.

   18 How has the beast groaned! Confounded are the herds of oxen! For
   wanting to them are pastures; The flocks of sheep are also desolate.

   19 To thee Jehovah will I cry; For the fire hath consumed the pastures
   of the desert, And the flame hath burnt all the trees of the field:

   20 The beasts of the field will also cry to thee; For dried up have the
   streams of waters, For the fire hath consumed the pastures of the
   desert.

   Chapter 2

   1 Sound ye the trumpet in Zion, And cry aloud on my holy mountain: Let
   all the inhabitants of the land tremble; For coming is the day of
   Jehovah, for nigh it is,--

   2 A day of darkness and thick darkness, A day of cloudiness and of
   obscurity, Like the dawn expanding over the mountains,-- A people,
   great and strong, The like of them has not been from the beginning, Nor
   after them shall be for many generations;

   3 Before them, a devouring fire, And after them, a flame, shall burn;
   Like the garden of Eden the land before them, And after them, a desert
   of solitude; And so there will be no escape from them:

   4 As the appearance of horses, their appearance, And as horsemen they
   will run;

   5 As the sound of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, As
   the sound of the flame of fire devouring the stubble, As a strong
   people prepared for battle;

   6 Their face will the people dread, All faces will gather blackness;

   7 As giants will they run here and there, As men of war will they
   ascend the wall, And each in his ways will proceed, And they shall not
   stay their goings;

   8 No one will thrust his brother, Every one in his way will march on;
   On the sword shall they fall, and shall not be wounded;

   9 Though the city shall they go, over the wall shall they run, Into
   houses shall they climb, Into the windows shall they enter like a
   thief:

   10 Before them shall tremble the earth, And in anguish shall be the
   heavens, The sun and moon shall be darkened, And the stars shall
   withdraw their brightness;

   11 And Jehovah will utter his voice before his army, For very great
   will be his camp. For strong is he who doeth his word; For great will
   be the day of Jehovah, And very terrible, and who will endure it?

   12 But even now, saith Jehovah, Turn to me with your whole heart, And
   with fasting, and weeping, and mourning;

   13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, And turn to Jehovah your
   God; For he is propitious and merciful, Slow to wrath, and abundant in
   goodness, And will repent of the evil:

   14 Who knows, whether he will return and repent, And leave behind him a
   blessing-- An offering and a libation to Jehovah your God?

   15 Sound ye the trumpet in Zion, Sanctify a fast, proclaim a meeting,

   16 Gather the people, sanctify the assembly, Bring together the aged,
   gather the children And those suckling the breasts; And let the
   bridegroom come forth from his recess, And the bride from her chamber;

   17 Between the porch and the altar let the priests, The ministers of
   Jehovah, weep and say,-- "Be propitious, Jehovah, to thy people, "And
   give not thy heritage to reproach, "That the nations should rule over
   them; "Why should they say among the people, "Where is their God?'"

   18 Then jealous will Jehovah be for his land, And he will be propitious
   to his people;

   19 And Jehovah will answer, and say to his people: [77] "Behold, I will
   send to you corn, and wine, and oil, "And ye shall be satisfied with
   them; "And I will make you no more a reproach among the nations;

   20 "And the Northlander will I remove far from you, "And drive him to a
   desert and dry land, "With his face to the eastern sea, "And his rear
   to the hindmost sea; "And ascend shall his ill savor, "And ascend shall
   his rottenness; "For high hath he exalted himself to do his purpose."

   21 Fear not, thou land; exult and rejoice; For Jehovah hath high
   exalted himself to do his purpose:

   22 Fear not, ye beasts of the fields; For grow shall the pastures of
   the desert, For the tree shall bring forth its fruit, The fig-tree and
   the vine shall yield their substance:

   23 And ye children of Zion, exult, And rejoice in Jehovah your God; For
   he will give you rain in due measure, And make to come down for you the
   showering rain, And the rain in the first month;

   24 And filled shall the floors be with corn, And overflow shall the
   vats with wine and oil;

   25 And I will restore years to you For those which the locust hath
   eaten, The chafer, and the caterpillar,-- My great army, which I sent
   to you:

   26 And eating, ye shall eat and satisfy yourselves, And shall praise
   the name of Jehovah your God, Because he hath dealt wondrously with
   you; And ashamed shall not my people be for ever.

   27 And ye shall know that in the midst of Israel I am, And that I
   Jehovah am your God, and none else; And ashamed shall not my people be
   forever.

   28 And shall it be afterwards, That I will pour my Spirit on all flesh,
   And prophesy shall your sons and your daughters, And your old men shall
   dreams dream, And your young men shall visions see;

   29 And also on servants and maid-servants Will I in those days pour my
   spirit:

   30 And I will set prodigies in heaven and on earth,-- Blood and fire,
   and columns of mist;

   31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, The moon into blood, Before
   it comes--the day of Jehovah, great and terrible:

   32 Then it shall be, that whosoever shall call On the name of Jehovah,
   shall be delivered; For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem Shall be
   deliverance, as Jehovah hath promised, And for the residue whom Jehovah
   shall call.

   Chapter 3

   1 For, behold in those days, and at that time, When I shall restore the
   captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will then gather all the nations,
   and bring them down to the valley of Jehosaphat; And I will there
   contend with them, For my people and for my heritage Israel; Because
   they have scattered them among the nations,

   2 And divided my land, and on my people cast lots, And have given a boy
   for a harlot, And have sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.

   3 And yet, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the
   borders of Palestine? Will ye recompense return to me?

   4 Now if ye repay me with this, Quickly--suddenly will I return Your
   recompense on your own head.

   5 Because ye have taken away my silver and my gold, And my desirable
   things have removed to your temples,

   6 And have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem To
   the children of the Grecians, That ye might drive them far from their
   own borders;--

   7 Behold, I will raise them from the place to which ye have sold them,
   And will return your recompense on your head;

   8 For I will sell your sons and your daughters to the children of
   Judah, And they shall sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation; For
   thus hath Jehovah spoken.

   9 Publish this among the nations, Proclaim a war, rouse the strong, Let
   them come, let them ascend, all the men of war:

   10 Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning-hooks into
   spears; Let the weak say, "I am strong."

   11 Assemble and come all ye nations, Assemble all around; There will
   Jehovah lay prostrate all thy valiant ones.

   12 Awake let the nations, and ascend to the valley of Jehosaphat; For
   there will I sit to judge all the nations around.

   13 Put forth the sickle, for ripened has the harvest; Come, go down,
   for full is the wine-press, Overflowing are the vats, For multiplied
   has their wickedness.

   14 Nations! Nations! In the valley of the sledge; For nigh is Jehovah's
   day in the valley of the sledge: The sun and the moon shall be
   darkened, And the stars shall withdraw their brightness;

   15 And Jehovah from Zion shall roar, And from Jerusalem shall utter his
   voice, And tremble shall the heavens and the earth;

   16 But Jehovah will be a hope to his people, And a strength to the
   children of Israel:

   17 Then ye shall know that I Jehovah am your God, Dwelling in Zion, the
   mount of my holiness; And Jerusalem shall be holiness, And aliens shall
   pass through it no more.

   18 And it shall be in that day, That distill new wine shall the
   mountains, And the hills shall cause milk to run down, And all the
   rivers of Judah shall send forth waters; A fountain also from the house
   of Jehovah shall go forth, And it shall water the valley of Shittim.

   19 Egypt shall be a solitude, And Edom shall be a desert of solitude,
   For the outrage done to the children of Judah, Because they shed
   innocent blood in their own land:

   20 But Judah shall forever safely dwell, And Jerusalem shall be from
   age to age; And I will cleanse their blood which I have not cleansed,
   And Jehovah shall dwell in Zion.

   of Calvin's Version

   of The Prophecies of Amos.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 1

   1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds at Tekos, which he saw
   concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the
   days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before
   the earthquake; and he said,--

   2 Jehovah from Zion will roar, And from Jerusalem will he utter his
   voice; And perish shall the habitations of shepherds, And wither shall
   the top of Carmel.

   3 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Damascus, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to it; (157) Because they have threshed
   Gilead with iron wains:

   4 And I will send fire into the house of Hazael, And it shall devour
   the palaces of Benhadad;

   5 And I will break in pieces the bar of Damascus, And cut off the
   inhabitant from the plain of Aven, And the holder of the scepter from
   the house of Eden; And removed shall be the people of Syria to Kir,
   saith Jehovah.

   6 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,
   I will not be propitious to it; For they carried away a complete
   captivity, To shut them up in Edom:

   7 And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, And it shall devour its
   palaces;

   8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, And the holder of the
   scepter from Ascalon; And I will turn my hand against Ekron, And perish
   shall the remnants of the Philistines, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

   9 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to it; For they have shut up a complete
   captivity in Edom, And have not remembered the covenant of brethren:

   10 And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, And it shall devour its
   palaces.

   11 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Edom, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to it; For he pursued with the sword his
   own brother, And destroyed his own compassions; And raged continually
   has his anger, And his wrath has he kept perpetually:

   12 And I will send a fire on Teman, And it shall devour the palaces of
   Bozrah.

   13 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of the children o
   Ammon, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have
   rent the pregnant women of Gilead, That they might extend their own
   borders:

   14 And I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah, And it shall devour
   its palaces, With clamor in the day of battle, With whirlwind in the
   day of tempest;

   15 And pass shall its king into captivity, He and his princes together,
   saith Jehovah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 2

   1 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,
   I will not be propitious to him; For he burnt the bones of the king of
   Edom into ashes:

   2 And I will send a fire on Moab, And it shall devour the palaces of
   Kirioth; And die in a tumult shall Moab, With shouting, at the sound of
   the trumpet;

   3 And I will cut off the judge from the midst of him, And with him all
   his princes will I slay, saith Jehovah.

   4 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Judah, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have despised the law
   of Jehovah, And his statutes have they not kept; And to go astray have
   their lies made them, After which their fathers walked:

   5 And I will send a fire on Judah, And it shall devour the palaces of
   Jerusalem.

   6 Thus saith Jehovah,-- For three transgressions of Israel, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have sold the just for
   silver, and the poor for shoes;

   7 Panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the needy, They turn
   aside the way of the miserable; The son and his father enter in into
   the same maid, So that they profane my holy name;

   8 And on pledged garments they lie near every altar, And the wine of
   the condemned they drink In the house of their god.

   9 Yet I exterminated the Amorite before their face, Whose tallness was
   like the tallness of cedars, And who was strong like the oak; And I
   destroyed his fruit above and his root beneath;

   10 And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, And led you in the
   desert forty years, That you might possess the land of the Amorite;

   11 And I raised up Prophets from your sons, And from your youths,
   Nazarites;-- Have I not done all this, O children of Israel, saith
   Jehovah:

   12 But to the Nazarites have ye quaffed wine; And on my Prophets have
   ye laid a command, Saying, "Ye shall not prophesy."

   13 Behold, I am fast bound under you, (196) As a wagon is bound, which
   is full of sheaves.--

   14 Perish shall flight from the swift, And the valiant shall not
   confirm his strength, And the strong shall not deliver his life,

   15 And the holder of the bow shall not stand, And the swift on foot
   shall not escape, Nor shall he who mounts a horse save his life;

   16 Yea, the strong of heart, among the valiant, Shall flee away naked
   in that day, saith Jehovah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 3

   1 Hear ye this word which Jehovah pronounces Against you, children of
   Israel--against the whole family, Which I brought up from the land of
   Egypt, saying,--

   2 "Only you have I known of all the families of the earth, "I will
   therefore visit on you all your iniquities."

   3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

   4 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young
   lion roar in his den, when nothing is taken?

   5 Will a bird fall into a snare on the ground without a fowler? Will a
   fowler take up his snare from the ground before he catches?

   6 Shall a trumpet sound in a city, and the people tremble not? Shall
   there be an evil in a city, which Jehovah hath not done?

   7 For nothing will the Lord Jehovah do, Except he has revealed his
   secret to his servants the Prophets.

   8 The lion hath roared, who would not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath
   spoken, who would not prophesy?

   9 Publish in the palaces of Ashdod, And in the palaces of the land of
   Egypt, and say,-- "Assemble ye on the mountains of Samaria, "And see
   the great tumults within it, "And the oppressions in the midst of it."

   10 And they know not how to do right, saith Jehovah,-- Treasuring up
   the fruit of robbery and plunder in their palaces.

   11 Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah,-- Lo, an adversary! And one
   around the land! And he will take from thee thy strength, And plundered
   shall be thy palaces.

   12 Thus saith Jehovah,-- As when a shepherd snatches from the mouth of
   a lion Two legs and the extreme part of the ear, So shall be rescued
   the children of Israel, Who dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed,
   And in Damascus on a couch.

   13 Hear ye and testify to the house of Israel, Saith the Lord Jehovah,
   the God of hosts,--

   14 That in the day in which I shall visit upon him the sins of Israel,
   I will also visit the altars of Bethel; And broken shall be the horns
   of the altar, And they shall fall to the ground;

   15 And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house, And perish
   shall the houses of ivory, And come to an end shall the great houses,
   saith Jehovah.

   Chapter 4

   1 Hear this word, ye cows of Bashan, Which are on the mountain of
   Samaria, Which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, Which say to
   their masters, "Bring, and we shall drink."

   2 Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by his sanctuary, That, lo, in the days
   are coming on you, That he will take you away by a hook, And your
   residue by a fishing-hook;

   3 And through the breaches shall ye go out, Each one over against her;
   And ye shall cast yourselves down from the palace, saith Jehovah.

   4 Go ye to Bethel and transgress, And in Gilgal transgress still more,
   And bring, in the morning, your sacrifices, In the third year, your
   tithes,

   5 And burn incense with the leaven of thanks-offering. And publish
   voluntary offerings, proclaim them; For so it hath pleased you, O
   children of Israel, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

   6 But I even gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And want
   of bread in all your borders; Yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah:

   7 I also withheld from you the rain, When as yet there were three
   months to the harvest; And I rained on one city, And on another city I
   made it not to rain; One part was rained upon, And the part where it
   rained not dried up;

   8 And there came two and three cities to one city, To drink water, and
   were not satisfied; Yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah:

   9 I smote you with the east wind and mildew; Your large gardens and
   your vineyards, (236) And your fig-trees and your olives the chafer
   devoured; Yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah:

   10 I sent on to you the plague after the manner of Egypt; I smote with
   the sword your strong men, And led captive your horses; I made to
   ascend the stench of your camps even to your nostrils; Yet ye turned
   not to me, saith Jehovah:

   11 I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And ye were as
   a brand snatched from the burning; Yet ye turned not to me, saith
   Jehovah.

   12 Therefore thus will I do to thee, Israel, And because I will do this
   to thee, Prepare thyself to meet thy God, Israel.

   13 For, behold he who formed the mountains, Who created the spirit, Who
   declares to man what is his thought, Who makes the dawn and the
   darkness, Who walks on the high places of the earth,-- Jehovah, God of
   Hosts, is his name.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 5

   1 Hear ye this word which I raise upon you, Even a lamentation, O house
   of Israel.

   2 Fallen is the virgin of Israel, and she will rise no more; Left is
   she on her land, none is there to raise her up.

   3 For thus saith the Lord Jehovah,-- The city from which went forth a
   thousand, There will remain in it a hundred; And that from which it
   went forth a hundred, There will remain ten to the house of Israel.

   4 For thus saith Jehovah to the house of Israel,-- Seek ye me, and ye
   shall live;

   5 And seek not Bethel, and to Gilgal go not, And pass not over to
   Beersheba; [78] For Gilgal by migrating shall migrate, And Bethel shall
   be as nothing:

   6 Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live, Lest he advance as a fire on the
   house of Joseph, And devour it, and there be none to quench it in
   Bethel.

   7 They turn judgment into wormwood, And righteousness they cast on the
   ground.--

   8 He who made Pleiades and Orion, (261) Who turns darkness into
   morning, And darkens the day into night, Who calls the waters of the
   sea, And pours them on the face of the earth,-- Jehovah is his name;

   9 Who strengthens a waster against the strong, And against a fortress
   shall a waster ascend. (263)

   10 They hate in the gate a reprover, And the speaker of right they
   abominate.

   11 As ye have trodden the poor under foot, (266) And a burden of corn
   have taken from him, Houses of hewn stone shall ye build, But ye shall
   not dwell in them; And pleasant vineyards shall ye plant, But ye shall
   not drink their wine;

   12 For I know your many iniquities, and your mighty sins; Oppressors of
   the just! And takers of ransom! And the poor in the gate they turn
   aside.

   13 Therefore the prudent at that time will be silent, For an evil time
   it is. (270)

   14 Seek ye good, and not evil, that ye may live; And so Jehovah, the
   God of Hosts, Will be with you, as ye have said.

   15 Hate evil, and love good, And set up judgment in the gate; It may
   be, that Jehovah, the God of Hosts, Will show mercy to the remnants of
   Joseph.

   16 Therefore Jehovah, the God of Hosts, the Lord, saith,-- In all the
   streets of concourse shall be lamentation, And in all the highways
   shall they say, "Woe! Woe!" (279) And they shall call the husbandman to
   mourning, And lamentation shall be to all skillful in mourning;

   17 And in all the vineyards shall be lamentation; For I will pass
   through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.

   18 Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah! What will this be to
   you? The day of Jehovah will be darkness and not light;

   19 As when one flees before a lion, and a bear meets him; Or comes to
   his house, and leans with his hand on a wall, And a serpent bites him.

   20 Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light? And thick
   darkness and no brightness?

   21 I hate, I abhor your festal-days, And I will not smell at your
   solemnities;

   22 Verily, when ye offer me your burnt-offerings and your gifts, I will
   not count them acceptable; And the peace offering of your fat things I
   will not regard.

   23 Take away from me the number of thy songs, And the harmony of the
   lyres; I will not hear them:

   24 And run down as waters shall judgment, And righteousness as an
   impetuous torrent. (292)

   25 Have ye offered to me sacrifices and an oblation In the desert for
   forty years, O house of Israel?

   26 But ye bore Sicuth, your king, and Chion, Your images, the stars
   being your gods; Which ye made for yourselves. (295)

   27 To migrate therefore I will make you beyond Damascus, Saith Jehovah,
   the God of Hosts is his name.

   Chapter 6

   1 Woe to the secure in Zion, And to the confident on the mount of
   Samaria; (302) Which have been renowned from the beginning of the
   nations; And entered in into them has the house of Israel.

   2 Pass ye over into Calneh and see, Go hence to Hamath the great, And
   come down to Gath of the Philistines, Are they better than these
   kingdom? Is their border larger than your border?

   3 Woe to you who drive far off the evil day, And draw nigh the throne
   of violence;

   4 Who lie down on beds of ivory, And extend themselves on their
   couches; Who eat lambs from the flock, And calves from the midst of the
   stall;

   5 Who sing to the sound of the harp, And like David invent instruments
   of music;

   6 Who drink wine in bowls, And with the chief ointments anoint
   themselves, And grieve not for the bruising of Joseph.

   7 They shall now therefore emigrate at the head of the emigrants, And
   come shall the mourning of those who extend themselves. (312)

   8 Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by himself, Saith Jehovah, the God of
   hosts,-- Abhor do I the excellency of Jacob, And his palaces I regard
   with hatred, And I will deliver up the city and its fullness.

   9 And it shall be, that when there shall remain Ten men together in one
   house, they shall die:

   10 And take him shall one's uncle and burn him, In order to take away
   his bones from the house, And shall say to him who shall be at the
   sides of the house, "Is there yet any one with thee?" And he will say,
   "There is an end;" Then he shall say, "Be silent, For it is not for us
   to remember the name of Jehovah."

   11 For, behold, Jehovah commands, And he will smite the great house
   with confusions, And the small house with fissures.

   12 Will horses run on a rock? Will it be ploughed by oxen? For to gall
   have ye turned judgment, And the fruit of righteousness to hemlock;

   13 Ye rejoice in a thing of nought, ye say,-- Have we not in our own
   strength Raised up for ourselves horns?

   14 Behold, I will surely raise against you a nation, O house of Israel,
   saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: And they shall straighten you from the
   entrance of Hamath to the river of the plain.

   Chapter 7

   1 Thus hath the Lord Jehovah showed me,-- Even lo, he formed locusts
   when grass began to grow, And, lo, it was the grass after the cuttings
   of the king:

   2 And it was, after they had finished to eat, That I then said, "Lord
   Jehovah, spare, I pray; Who will restore Israel, for he is small?"

   3 Jehovah repented of this; "It shall not be," said Jehovah.

   4 Thus hath the Lord Jehovah showed me,-- Even lo, the Lord Jehovah
   called to contend by fire; And it devoured the great deep and their
   portion:

   5 And I said, "Lord Jehovah, cease, I pray; Who will restore Israel,
   for he is small?

   6 Jehovah repented of this; "This also shall not be," said the Lord
   Jehovah.

   7 Thus hath he showed me,-- Even lo, the Lord stood on a plumbline
   wall, And in his hand a plumbline,

   8 And Jehovah said to me, "What seest thou, Amos?" And I said, "A
   plumbline:" Then said the Lord, "Behold, I shall set A plumbline in the
   midst of my people Israel; I will no longer pass by them:

   9 And destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, And overthrown shall
   be the sanctuaries of Israel, And I shall rise up against the house of
   Jeroboam with the sword."

   10 Then sent Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, To Jeroboam, king of
   Israel, saying,-- "Conspired against thee has Amos In the midst of the
   house of Israel; The land cannot bear all his words:

   11 For thus saith Amos,-- By the sword shall Jeroboam die, And Israel,
   by migrating, shall migrate from their own land.'"

   12 Amaziah said also to Amos,-- "Seer, go, flee into the land of Judah,
   And there eat bread, and there prophesy:

   13 But in Bethel, prophesy no more; For it is the king's sanctuary, and
   the house of the kingdom."

   14 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah,-- "No Prophet was I, nor
   was I a Prophet's son, For a shepherd I was, and a gatherer of
   sycamores:

   15 But Jehovah took me from after the sheep, And Jehovah said to me,--
   Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'

   16 And now hear the word of Jehovah, thou who sayest,-- Prophesy not
   concerning Israel, And speak not concerning the house of Isaac:'

   17 Therefore thus saith Jehovah,-- Thy wife in the city shall be
   prostituted, And thy sons and thy daughters shall by the sword fall,
   And thy land shall by a line be divided, And thou in a polluted land
   shalt die, And Israel, by migrating, shall migrate from their own
   land."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 8

   1 Thus hath the Lord Jehovah showed me,-- Even lo, a basket of
   summer-fruit;

   2 And he said, "What seest thou, Amos?" And I said, "A basket of
   summer-fruit." Then Jehovah said to me,-- "Come has the end of my
   people Israel, I will no more pass by them."

   3 And howlings shall be the songs of the temple In that day, saith the
   Lord Jehovah; Many a dead body, in every place, Shall be cast down in
   silence. (362)

   4 Hear this, ye who swallow up the poor, And exterminate the needy of
   the land, saying,--

   5 "When will pass the new moon, that we may sell corn? And the Sabbath,
   that we may bring out wheat, And lesson the ephah, and increase the
   shekel, And turn one side the deceitful balances?

   6 That we may buy with silver the poor, And the needy for shoes, And
   sell the refuse of corn."

   7 Sworn hath Jehovah by the excellency of Jacob, "I shall not forget
   any of their works."

   8 Shall not the land be for this in a tumult, And every one who dwells
   in it mourn? Yea, heave up as a river shall the whole of it, (371) And
   it shall be driven and sunk as by the river of Egypt.

   9 And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, That I will
   cause the sun to set at noon, And will darken the land in a clear day;

   10 I will also turn your festal-days to mourning, And all your songs to
   lamentation; And to come up on all loins will I make sackcloth, And
   upon every head, baldness; And I will set her as in mourning for an
   only son, And her posterity as in the day of bitterness. (375)

   11 Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, When I shall send a
   famine on the land, Not the famine of bread, nor thirst for waters, But
   for hearing the words of Jehovah;

   12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, And from the south to the
   east shall they run, To seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find
   it:

   13 And in that day shall faint, The fair virgins and young men, for
   thirst;

   14 Who swear by the sin of Samaria, and who say,-- "Live does thy God,
   O Dan, And live does the way of Beersheba;" And they shall fall and
   rise again no more.

   Chapter 9

   1 I saw the Lord standing on the altar, and he said,-- "Smite the
   lintel, and moved shall be the pillars, And strike the head of them
   all; And the rest of them with the sword shall I slay: Flee from them
   shall not he who fleeth, And escape from them shall not he who
   escapeth: (385)

   2 If they dig to hell, thence my hand shall bring them out; And if they
   ascend to heaven, I will thence draw them down;

   3 And if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, There will I search
   for and draw them forth; And if they be hid from my eyes in the bottom
   of the sea, I will there command the serpent to bite them;

   4 And if they go to captivity before their enemies, I will there
   command the sword to slay them; Yea, I will set my eyes on them For
   evil, and not for good."

   5 And the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, will smite the land, And it will
   tremble, and mourn shall all who dwell in it; And heave up like a river
   shall the whole of it, And it shall be sunk as by the river of Egypt.--

   6 He who builds his ascendings in the heavens, And founds his jointings
   on the earth, Who calls the waters of the sea, And pours them on the
   face of the earth,-- Jehovah is his name. (392-3)

   7 Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians to me? O house of
   Israel, saith Jehovah; Did I not make Israel to ascend from Egypt, And
   the Philistines from Cappadocia, And the Syrians from Kir?

   8 Behold, the eyes of Jehovah are on every wicked kingdom; And I will
   destroy it from the face of the earth; Except that by destroying I
   shall not destroy The house of Jacob! Saith Jehovah.

   9 For, behold, I will command, And I shall shake the house of Israel
   among all nations, As wheat is shaken in a sieve, And fall shall not a
   grain on the ground:

   10 By the sword shall die all the wicked of my people, Who say, "Draw
   near and overtake us Shall not, for our sake, the evil."

   11 In that day I will raise up the tent of David, That is fallen, and I
   will fence in its breaches, And its ruins will I raise up; And I will
   build it as in ancient days;

   12 That possess they may the remnants of Edom, And all the nations on
   whom my name shall be called, Saith Jehovah, the doer of this.

   13 Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That meet shall the
   plowman the reaper, And the treader of grapes the bearer of seed; And
   distill shall the mountains sweet wine, And all the hills shall flow
   down with milk

   14 And I will restore the captivity of my people Israel; And they shall
   build wasted cities, and dwell in them; They shall plant vineyards, and
   drink their wine; They shall make gardens, and eat their fruit:

   15 And I will plant them in their own land, And they shall be plucked
   up no more From their own land, which I have given to them, Saith
   Jehovah, thy God.

   CHAPTER 1.

   1 The vision of Obadiah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah against Edom,-- A
   rumor have we heard from Jehovah, And a messenger to the nations has
   been sent,--(423) "Arise ye, and we shall arise against her to battle."

   2 Lo, small have I set thee among the nations, Despised greatly wert
   thou: (425)

   3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, Who dwellest in the
   clefts of the rock: "Who shall draw me down to the ground?"

   4 If thou shouldst rise high as the eagle, And if among the clouds thou
   shouldest set thy nest, Thence shall I draw thee down, saith Jehovah.

   5 Have thieves come to thee, or night-robbers? How hast thou been
   reduced to silence? Have they not stolen what sufficed them? Have
   vintagers come to thee? Have they not left some clusters?--

   6 How much sought out have been the things of Esau, And thoroughly
   searched his hidden places!

   7 To the border have they driven thee, All the men of thy confederacy;
   Deceived thee, prevailed against thee, have they, The men who were at
   peace with thee; The men who did eat thy bread Have set a wound under
   thee:-- There is in him no understanding!

   8 Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, Destroy the wise from Edom,
   And understanding from the mount of Esau? Yea, broken down shall be thy
   valiant ones, O Teman,

   9 So that cut off shall be every man, From the mount of Esau by
   slaughter.

   10 For the oppression of thy brother Jacob, Cover thee shall reproach,
   And thou shalt be cut off forever.

   11 In the day when thou didst stand on the other side, In the day when
   aliens took away his substance, And foreigners entered his gates, And
   on Jerusalem did cast lots, Even thou wert as one of them.

   12 But thou shouldest not look on the day of thy brother, In the day of
   his alienation; Nor shouldest rejoice over the children of Judah, In
   the day of their destruction; Nor speak with thy mouth proud things, In
   the day of distress;

   13 Nor shouldest thou enter the gate of my people, In the day of their
   destruction; Nor look on him, especially thou, in his distress, In the
   day of his destruction; Nor stretch thy hand to his substance, In the
   day of his destruction:

   14 Nor shouldest thou stand on the outlets, To destroy those who were
   escaping; Nor deliver up his remnants in the day of distress.

   15 Seeing that near is the day of Jehovah on all nations, As thou hast
   done, it shall be done to thee, Thy reward shall be returned on thine
   own head;

   16 For as ye have drunk on my holy mountain, Drink shall all nations
   continually; They shall drink and drink up; And they shall be as though
   they never had been.

   17 But in mount Zion shall be deliverance, And Zion shall be holiness;
   And possess shall the house of Jacob their own possessions:

   18 The house of Jacob shall be also a fire, And the house of Joseph a
   flame, And the house of Esau shall be chaff; And kindled they shall be
   among them, and consume them; And no remnant shall be to the house of
   Esau; For thus hath Jehovah spoken.

   19 They shall also possess the south of the mount of Esau, And the
   plain, even that of the Philistines; And they shall possess the fields
   of Ephraim And the fields of Samaria, And Benjamin shall possess
   Gilead:

   20 And the emigrants of this host of the children of Israel Shall
   possess the land of the Canaanites to Zarephath; And the emigrants of
   Jerusalem, what is in Sepharad, Even the southern cities: (451)

   21 And ascend shall saviors to mount Zion, To judge the mount of Esau;
   And Jehovah's shall be the kingdom.

   Addenda

   to

   HOSea

   Hosea. 1:2, Take to thee a wife, etc., Whether the marriage of the
   Prophet was a real transaction or not, has been a subject much
   controverted by the learned. Bishop Horsley, in his Introduction to his
   New Translation of Hosea, defends, with his usual ability, the opinion
   that it was a real marriage. Dr. Henderson, in his work on the Minor
   Prophets, takes the same view. The strongest point in favor of the
   opposite sentiment, that it was a kind of a parabolic representation,
   is the command, similar to this, which is given to the Prophet in the
   third chapter; and to this Calvin especially alludes. Though the latter
   command is similar, yet it materially differs in many circumstances;
   and the design of the transaction is wholly different.

   The reason for what is commanded is given in both instances. The first
   marriage was to represent the defection of this people from God,
   because "by wantoning the land had grown wanton, that it did not follow
   Jehovah." The second contract (for it was no marriage) was to set forth
   "the love of Jehovah towards the children of Israel."

   There seems to be no ground for the opinion, that the first wife,
   Gomer, is "the woman" mentioned in the third chapter, who, having been
   repudiated for her incontinence, was again to be restored. The dowry
   which the Prophet is said to have given for her, according to the usual
   manner of those times, clearly shows that it was a new engagement, and
   not the renewal of a former union. What Dr. Henderson states in favor
   of what he thinks to have been a reunion, seems to be of no force. The
   command, he says, is different; it is not "take," but "love." The
   evident reason for this difference is, that it was no marriage but a
   contract for marriage, as the sequel evidently proves: he "bought" her,
   she was to "abide" for him, she was not to be for another, and he
   promised to be for her.

   The evident design of the first marriage, whether real or not, was to
   represent the state of the people at that time, in their idolatry, and
   the ruinous consequences of that idolatry. The evident design of what
   is recorded in the third chapter, as Calvin states at large, was to set
   forth the dealings of God with the people during their exile. As the
   latter transaction bears much the appearance of a parable, we may
   reasonably conclude that the first was of the same character.

   It may be added, that Marckius, who wrote largely and learnedly on the
   Minor Prophets, maintains that "children of wantonness," or of
   fornications, do not mean spurius children, but those addicted to
   wantonness; as in the case of the mother, who was not called a woman of
   fornications because of her birth, but of her lewd conduct. The
   children, then, were thus called prospectively; that is, with regard to
   what they would be. Now, if this be true as to the children, the
   question may be asked, Was not this also the case with the mother; that
   is, was she not called prospectively "a wife of fornications?" This
   would certainly be a corrector emblem of the state of the people, who
   had become idolaters, after God as it were married them, or entered
   into covenant with them.

   Hosea. 1:6, I will take them away, In confirmation of the note on this
   place, the following texts are adduced: -- Genesis 18:26; 50:17; Exodus
   23:21; Numbers 14:19; Joshua 24:19; Psalm 25:18; 99:8; Isaiah 2:9.
   These are all the instances in which the verb ns' is followed by l,
   without an objective case: and it means invariably to forgive, and not
   to take away. And the last text in Isaiah has nearly the very words of
   this passage, vl'-ts' lhm, "and forgive them not."

   Hosea. 2:11, Her new moon, etc., It is the character of poetry to use
   the singular number in a collective sense; her new moon, not her new
   moons. Several instances of this we meet with in this chapter: "her
   vine and her fig-tree" -- "her ear-ring and her chain" -- "the bird of
   heaven and the reptile of the earth," -- all these, though in the
   singular number, are to be understood as including multiplicity. Calvin
   retains this poetic character of the original. It would have been
   better if it had been retained in all translations.

   Hosea 3:4, Without a statue, etc., "If I may offer a conjecture
   concerning the difference between these idolatrous statues and
   teraphim, I would say, that the statues were of large dimensions, set
   up in public, as objects of popular adoration, [as crucifixes, etc., in
   Popish countries:] the teraphim were of a smaller size, and for
   different purposes; kept in the most secret recesses of the temples or
   consecrated chapels, for magical rites, and rarely, if ever, exposed to
   public view.

   "Thus, since it appears that both the statue and the teraphim of Hosea
   were impliments of idolatry, no doubt can remain, that the ephod, which
   is mentioned between the two, is to be understood of the idolatrous
   ephod, not that which belonged to the holy vestments of the high
   priest. As it is put between the statue and the teraphim, it may seem,
   that it may be connected with either: connected with the statue, it
   will denote the robe with which the idol was clothed: connected with
   the teraphim, the ephod of the priest of the teraphim. And in this
   connection (to which, indeed, the structure of the sentence in the
   original seems to point in preference) I would choose to take it. For
   thus we shall have idolatry described by the three principal features
   in its external appearance, -- the statue, the public object of popular
   adoration, -- the teraphim, the images of the more secret rites of
   incantation, -- and the sorcerer, or heirophant, conduction the
   ceremonies, and propounding to the consultors of the oracle the answers
   he pretended to receive, represented by the ephod, the most remarkable
   of his robes of office." -- Bishop Horsely

   Hosea 4:8, To iniquity they lift up the heart of each, Probably the
   words are not correctly rendered according to the exposition given by
   Calvin. As he explains As to iniquity, would be perhaps the best
   rendering; for his comment is, "that the priests lifted up the soul of
   each by relieving their consciences by soothing words of flattery."
   However true this may have been, yet the meaning of this sentence is, I
   believe, what I have stated in a note. The rendering I have given
   removes the anomalies of persons which Calvin notices. The persons who
   did eat or feed on the sin of the people were evidently the priests,
   and they were those who raised or lifted up the heart or mind of the
   people. The affix, their, to iniquity, refers to the priests, and the
   affix, his, to the heart or mind, refers to the people, and ought to be
   rendered, their, in our language. Some copies have their appended to
   the word, nphsm; but this, I have no doubt, has been an attempt, as in
   other instances, to correct what appeared to be an anomaly. Dr.
   Henderson renders the line, "And long for their iniquity," and adds in
   a note, that ns' nphs, to lift up the animal soul for anything, means
   to lust after it, long or have a strong desire for it. It has no doubt
   this meaning; but it means also, to raise up, or guide, or direct the
   soul, including the mind, the attention, and affections, to an object.
   The phrase is included, with all its accompaniments, the verb, an
   objective case, and the proposition 'l or 'ly, in the following
   sentence, nphsy 's' 'lyk yhvh, To thee, Jehovah, my soul I lift up,'
   Psalm 25:1. See Psalm 86:4

   Hosea 4:18, Putrid is become their drink, Newcome reads, "He is gone
   after their wine," that is, of idols. But this rendering cannot be
   admitted, as it gives a sense to sr which it nowhere has. Horsley
   renders thus, -- "Their strong drink is vapid;" and has this note, --
   The allusion is to libations made with wine grown dead or turning sour.
   The image represents the want of all spirit of piety in their acts of
   worship, and the unacceptableness of such worship before God: which is
   alleged as a reason for the determination expressed in the preceding
   clause, to give Ephraim up to his own ways. "Leave him to himself,"
   says God to the Prophet, "his pretended devotions are all false and
   hypocritical, I desire none of them." Henderson's rendering is new, but
   seems unsuitable to the text, -- "When their carousal is over, they
   indulge in lewdness." What appears to comport best with the words and
   with the context, is what is given by Dathius, "compotationes eos
   seduxerunt," -- drinkings have seduced them. He takes sr in a causative
   sense. Then the literal version of sr sv'm would be, "Turned them
   aside, or seduced them, has their strong drink." Drunkenness was
   ascribed to them in verse 11. If this be the meaning, then we have in
   this verse three of the prevailing sins of the people -- drunkenness --
   fornication, that is idolatry -- and bribery.

   With regard to the remaining portion of the verse, both Newcome and
   Henderson have taken such liberties in clipping and in changing the
   order of the words, that their versions are wholly inadmissible. Where
   there is a meaning, and a striking one too, this liberty is by no means
   to be allowed. Horsley's version substantially agrees with that of
   Calvin; and it is this, "Given up to lasciviousness, greedy of gain, (O
   shame!) are her great men." The parethetic expression, "O shame!" had
   been previously suggested by Drusius. "For a long time," says the
   Bishop, "I thought myself original and single in this way of rendering:
   but I have the satisfaction to find, that the learned Drusius was
   before me in it. He renders thus,' -- Scortando scortati sunt, amant
   date (O dedecus) protedctores ejus.'" This is certainly a very literal
   rendering of the original, --

   hznh hznv
   'hvv hvv qlzn mgnyh

   Wantoning they have become wanton,
   Bring ye,' (O shame!) do her protectors love.


   Hosea 5:1, A net expanded over Tabor, Striking are the words of Bishop
   Horsley in connection with this passage, -- "The toils and nets are
   whatever, in the external form of idolatry, was calculated to captivate
   the minds of men; magnificent temples, stately altars, images richly
   adorned, the gaiety of festivals, the pomp, and in many instances, even
   the horror of public rites."

   Hosea 6:5, Thy judgments, etc., Henderson thinks that judgments here
   are to be viewed in the sense of punishments, and that "thy judgments"
   mean those alluded to and deserved by Ephraim. That this mode of
   speaking is not unusual in Hebrew, is no doubt true. But the word here
   used, commonly rendered judgments, is one of very wide meaning. It
   signifies not only the sentence pronounced on the criminal, but also
   the sentence pronounced by God as to what is right or wrong. The latter
   is very frequently its meaning. Moses speaks of statutes and judgments,
   msphtym, which the Israelites were to "do," or observe and keep,
   (Deuteronomy 4:14.) The Psalmist prays God to teach him his judgments,
   (Psalm 119:108.) Hence precepts, as Horsley renders it, suitably
   express the meaning. Then "thy" means given to thee, revealed and
   communicated to thee. The expression, "thy judgments," admits then no
   doubt of either of these two meanings. The question is, which of the
   two is the most suitable to the rest of the sentence, and to the
   context? To compare inflicted judgments to light going forth, appears
   not certainly very appropriate; but when the clear teaching of God's
   word as to what is right, and just, and equitable, is compared to
   out-spreading light, there is a striking suitableness. And then the
   context seems to favor this view.

   Hosea 6:9, By consent, etc., Newcome, Horsley, and others, render the
   line thus, "A company of priests murder in the way to Shechem," taking
   skmh, a shoulder, taken figuratively for consent, as the name of a
   place. But by this rendering they change the order of the words: drk,
   the way, is before the verb to murder, and cannot be construed "in the
   way to Shechem." Besides, the following line confirms the rendering of
   Calvin; for what they are said to do is zmh, a device, a conceived
   wickedness, or a concerted scheme, which seems to imply a consent.

   Hosea 6:11, Judah also did set a plant for thee There is much
   difference in the meaning attached to this line. The foregoing is
   certainly its most literal rendering, except that for "plant" some
   would substitute "harvest:" but the word means both. In all other
   versions there is something that seems forced. Some then disjoin the
   next line from this, and connect it with the first verse of the
   following chapter, and mainly because they cannot see its meaning as
   connected with this. Now it appears to me, that by this arrangement a
   confusion is introduced. It must be borne in mind that this section
   commences in verse 4, in which both Ephraim and Judah are mentioned:
   but, in the next chapter, Israel or Ephraim is alone spoken of
   throughout. Hence, to begin the next chapter by introducing Judah,
   which is evidently meant by "my people," while the whole chapter refers
   only to Ephraim, is certainly not to produce order, but rather
   disorder. The connection of the line with the preceding one is, in my
   view, made sufficiently clear by Calvin, -- that while God was
   restoring, or endeavoring to restore, the captivity, the dispersed
   state of his people, (for many of them were taken captives by the
   neighboring nations long before their final captivity,) -- while God
   was doing this, Judah was engaged in setting the plant of idolatry in
   the land; and he is said to do this "for thee," that is, for Ephraim,
   to further as it were, and assist Ephraim in his idolatry.

   The Prophet is supposed to allude to what is recorded in 2 Chronicles
   28. And there we see Jewish captives restored, and Ahaz, the king of
   Judah, was at the same time introducing idolatry into the land: he was
   making, as it were, a large plantation; for he made "molten images,"
   and "sacrificed to the gods of Damascus."

   Hosea 9:8, The watchmen of Ephraim, etc. The objection to this, because
   Ephraim is not in construction in the original with watchman, is not
   valid; for the latter word is a participle, and used as a personal
   noun, as is often the case in Hebrew. Literally, it is, "He who
   watcheth Ephraim." The rendering of Henderson is far-fetched, and
   irrelevant, as there is nothing in the context which justifies it. It
   is this, -- "Ephraim expecteth help from my God." To translate tszphh,
   "expecteth help," is without any example. The references, Psalm 5:3,
   and Lamentations 4:17, do not bear out the meaning. Besides, the common
   usage in Hebrew is, when a participle is employed as a verb to express
   the present time, the auxiliary verb being understood, that it follows
   the nominative case, and does not precede it as here. It is quite clear
   that the "watchman" and "the Prophet" is the same, and that he is
   described "as a snare of the fowler in all his ways." The only
   difficulty is in the words, n-'lhy, "with my God." If not construed
   with Prophet, as I have proposed in my note, it may be appended to the
   first line, and m may be rendered "before," or, "in the presence of,"
   as in 1 Samuel 2:21, where it is said that Samuel grew m-yhvh, "before
   Jehovah." Grotius suggests that m here may be taken for people; and so
   it may, for the punctuists alone have made it especially a preposition.
   Then it would be, "the people of my God," a designation of Ephraim
   according to God's adoption and their own profession, notwithstanding
   their idolatry. The meaning still would be nearly the same, for the
   false prophet, as well as the people, professed God's name, and claimed
   to be a Prophet before God: and by this means especially were the
   people deluded. Satan is never so dangerous as when he pretends to be
   an angel of light -- a servant of God, and an advocate of idolatry -- a
   Prophet in the presence of God, and a fowler to catch men, and to draw
   them into superstition.

   Hosea 10:4, Judgment grows up, etc. Though I gave in a note a view of
   this sentence different from that of Calvin, yet on looking on the
   original, I find that the order of the words favors his view. Rendered
   according to the order of the words it is this, --

   And germinate like wormwood does judgment on the furrows of the field.

   By Judgment Calvin means religious conduct; I take it to be the
   administration of justice; but Dr. Henderson, with Grotius and others,
   considers it to be punishment, inflicted on the people, which seems not
   suitable either to the comparison or to the context. Newcome's
   explanation is, "In these times of confusion, judgment has changed its
   nature, and has become destructive." The passage in Amos 6:12, seems to
   determine the meaning here. "Judicium hic accipio pro impia
   gubernatione principum Israelis, maximè in jure dicendo: quae judicia,
   cum deberent esse salutaria et grata, acerba et amara fiunt et
   hominibus perniciosa." -- Rivetus, quoted by Poole.

   Hosea 10:9, There they stood. It ought, perhaps, to be, "There they
   have stood, (steterunt;") that is, they have continued the same,
   perverse and corrupt. Horsley says, "They stood;" that is, the
   Israelites set themselves in array for the attack: which, in this
   connection, seems to have no meaning. Henderson considers the
   Gibeonites to be meant, "There they remain," that is, the same in
   character as at this day: but this view, no less than the former, seems
   foreign to the context.

   In the next line Newcome and Boothroyd, with several others, following
   the conjecture of Hobigant, without the countenance of any MS., guided
   only by a hint given in the Septuagint, make a considerable alteration.
   They separate the end of the ninth verse, and join it to the beginning
   of the tenth. The dismembered line and the newly-formed one are thus
   given, --

   "Did not the war overtake them in Gilbeah?
   I came against the sons of iniquity and chastised them."

   The first word in verse 10 is changed; v'ty is put for v'vty. Both
   Horsley and Henderson very justly reject this emendation.

   Hosea 10:15, Thus shall Bethel do to you, Horsley gives the same
   rendering. Newcome, on the mere authority of the Septuagint, changes
   the whole sentence, "Thus shall it be done unto you, O house of
   Israel." No less frigid and inconsistent with the words in Hebrew is
   the version of Henderson, "Thus shall he act towards you at Bethel."
   The comment of Calvin shows the remarkably striking import of this
   sentence.

   Hosea 11:7, To him on high they call them, etc. Rivetus, as quoted in
   Poole's Syn., gives a very different rendering of this clause. In
   commenting on the Vulgate, which has this version -- "Jugum autem
   impontur eis simul, quod non auferetur -- but a yoke will be laid on
   them together, which shall not be taken away," Rivetus says, that
   nothing opposes this meaning, except that the Hebrews say that l here
   does not mean a yoke, but the high one, that is, God. But the same
   word, without the v, which it commonly has, when it means a yoke,
   occurs in verse 4: and there seems to be a allusion here to what is
   said there; as there is in the verb yqr' to what is expressed in verse
   2. The yoke is considered to be that of captivity. God called them by
   his prophets to himself, as it is said in the second verse; they turned
   away from God, yet God continued his kindness, and when they were
   distressed, he raised up the yoke, that is, relieved them: but now,
   they being bent on defection, he threatens them with subjugation to a
   foreign power, and withdraws every hope of relief. Taking this view, we
   might render the words thus, --

   Therefore to the yoke he will call them together;
   He will not raise it up;

   Or, as Rivetus proposes,

   None will raise it up.

   Not only is this a literal rendering, but it fits in remarkably with
   the following as well as with the previous context. The exclamation
   which follows naturally flows from this denunciation of judgment. The
   version of Newcome is somewhat like this, but not so literal nor so
   suitable to the context, --

   And though they call on him together because of the yoke,
   he will not raise it.


   Hosea 11:10, 11, After Jehovah shall they walk, etc Calvin differs from
   most, if not from all, commentators, as to the meaning of these two
   verses. It is said that Jehovah "will roar as a lion." This roaring
   will cause trembling, -- to whom? Most say, to the children of Israel;
   but Calvin says, to their enemies. But in order to avoid the evident
   incongruity of applying trembling to the Israelites, the meaning of
   hastening has been given to the verb chrd, which it is said to have
   only here and in 2 Kings 4:13, its general import being that of
   trembling or shaking with fear. The Septuagint favors this latter idea,
   ekstesontai -- shall be astounded; and "children from the west" is
   rendered tekna udaton -- children of the waters, or, according to
   another copy, huioi thalasses -- sons of the sea. The Israelites were
   not thus designated, but their enemies. But no doubt the last clause
   has occasioned this mistake, which, according to our version, is, "I
   will place them in their houses;" which may be rendered, "I will cause
   them to sit still on (that is, the top of roof of) their houses:" for
   it is not in, but on, l. The flat roofs of the east were places to
   which people in fear would likely betake themselves.

   Bishop Horsley has here a beautiful disquisition on the progress of the
   Gospel; he takes roaring for preaching, a singular notion. "The
   roaring," he says, "is unquestionably the sound of the Gospel. Jehovah
   himself shall roar: the should shall begin to be uttered by the voice
   of the incarnate God himself. The first effect shall be, that children
   shall come fluttering from the west, a new race of children, converts
   of the Gentiles, chiefly from the western quarters of the world; --
   afterwards the natural Israel shall hurry from all the regions of their
   dispersion, and be settled in their own dwellings," etc., etc. Though
   all this is very fine, it has nothing to do with this passage. Speaking
   of this roaring being applied to the preaching of the Gospel, Calvin
   says, "This and the like are refinements of which I think the Prophet
   never thought.

   Hosea 11:12, But Judah as yet rules with his God, etc. Notwithstanding
   what modern critics have said on this verse, the rendering of Calvin,
   which as to the first line is adopted by Horsley, seems to most
   natural, and the most literal. Newcome mangles the whole text, assisted
   by the Septuagint, the Syriac, and Arabic versions, and the Vulgate.
   Henderson, following Dathius, Boothroyd, and others, affixes a new idea
   to rd, supported, as they say, by the following texts: Jeremiah 2:31;
   Genesis 27:40; and Psalm 55:2. There are no other examples, except that
   the word occurs, as it is thought, in the form of a noun in
   Lamentations 1:7; 3:19. Now, in none of these places is there anything
   decisive in favor of the meaning attached in the following version, --

   "And as for Judah he is still inconstant with God."

   It is said that the word includes the ideas of being unfaithful,
   rebelling, wandering at large. Much stronger and clearer examples must
   be adduced before this meaning can be received. It is always suspicious
   when anything doubtful or far-fetched is brought forward to explain a
   text. The meaning of ruling with or before God, as explained by Calvin
   and by others, such as Rivetus, seems quite satisfactory, and obviates
   the difficulty felt by Dathius and others, and which obviously induced
   them to seek a new interpretation.

   With regard to the other line, And together with the saints he is
   faithful, I find no improvement, but otherwise.

   Newcome's version of the whole verse is this, --

   "Ephraim hath compassed me about with falsehood,
   And the house of Israel and of Judah with deceit;
   But hereafter they shall come down a people of God,
   Even a faithful people of saints."

   Henderson's is the following, --

   "Ephraim hath encompassed me with falsehood,
   And the house of Israel with deceit;
   And as for Judah, he is still inconstant with God,
   Even with the faithful holy ones."

   So various become versions, when once a license is taken with the text,
   or with the current meaning of the words. Junius and Tremelius agree
   with Calvin, except as to time, the past tense is adopted. The last two
   lines are thus given, --

   "Quando Jehudah adhuc dominabatur cum Deo forti,
   Et cum sanctis fidelis erat."

   The whole verse, according to this version, is as follows, --

   "Surround me did the Ephraimites with falsehood,
   And with guile, the house of Israel;
   When Judah as yet ruled with God,
   And with the saints was faithful."

   By referring to past times, the objection as to the condition of Judah,
   he being at that time much given to superstition and idolatry, though
   still adhering to the outward form of true worship, is to a great
   extent removed. But the remarks of Calvin on this point seem
   sufficient.

   Hosea 12:8, In all my labors, etc. Newcome's version is very different,
   he having been led astray, as usual, by the Septuagint, --

   "All his labors shall not be found profitable unto him,
   For the iniquity wherewith he hath sinned."

   Horsley's rendering is nearly as far from the Original as this -- "All
   my labors procured not for me what may expiate iniquity." Henderson's
   version is a paraphrase, but materially agrees with that of Calvin, --

   "In none of my labors am I chargeable with guilt."

   What he considers the literal rendering is this -- "With respect to all
   my efforts, they shall not find attaching to me iniquity which is sin."
   Perhaps the words may admit of a still more literal rendering -- "All
   my labors shall not be found to be an iniquity to me, that is a sin."

   Hosea 12:11, Is there iniquity in Gilead? There is considerable
   difficulty connected with this passage, and, indeed, with the whole of
   this chapter, from the eighth verse to the end. The main drift is
   evidently what is stated by Calvin, and in this most commentators
   agree. It was clearly the design of the Prophet, in alluding to Jacob
   and his history, to prove the ingratitude and to beat down the pride of
   Ephraim. But still, to connect the whole together in a continuous
   narrative, is no easy task. On this very line there is a great variety.
   Grotius reads, "Si in Galaade idolum fuit;" Junius and Tremelius, "An
   in Gilhade iniquitas?" Horsley, "Was there idolatry in Gilead?"
   Newcome, "Verily, in Gilead there is iniquity;" and Henderson, "Verily,
   Gilead is iniquitous."

   It appears that Gilead was at this time destroyed; for what is said in
   2 Kings 15:29, was evidently previous to the time of Hosea. It is there
   stated that the king of Assyria had taken Gilead, with other cities,
   and carried the inhabitants captive to Assyria. [79] The reference,
   then, to Gilead, must have been to its former state. Gilgal being still
   in the possession of Israel, its state at that time is described. This
   shows that Grotius and Horsley are more correct than Calvin, Newcome,
   and Henderson. Gilead is evidently introduced as an instance of the
   effects of idolatry, and the folly of Israel is exposed in continuing
   the same idolatry at Gilgal. That I may attempt to exhibit the whole
   passage from verse eighth to the end, in a connected form, I submit to
   the reader the following version, --

   8. Canaan is he! [80] In his hand are the balances of deceit;
   He loves to oppress:

   9. Yet Ephraim says, "Surely I am become rich,
   I have found substance for myself;
   In all my labors they will not find against me
   An iniquity that is a sin."

   10. But I, Jehovah, thy God from the land of Egypt,
   Will yet make thee to dwell in tents,
   As in the days of meeting: [81]

   11. Thus have I spoken by the prophets,
   When I had visions multiplied,
   And by the prophets showed similitudes.

   12. If Gilead has been iniquitous, (literally, iniquity;)
   Surely vain have they become in Gilgal;
   They sacrifice oxen, yea their altars
   Are like the heaps on the furrows of the field.

   13. When Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
   Then Israel served for a wife,
   And for a wife he kept sheep;
   By a prophet also did Jehovah bring Israel from Egypt,
   And by a prophet was he preserved.

   14. Yet Ephraim has caused the bitterest provocation:
   But his blood on himself shalt be left,
   And his reproach will his Lord return to him.


   Hosea 13:2, Who sacrifices men, etc. Henderson, after mentioning
   several authors for and against this rendering, strengthens his own,
   which agrees with our common version, by referring to a rule of syntax
   laid down by Gesenius; but that rule refers to adjectives and to
   passive participles, according to the instances given, and not to
   participles, as in the present case, in an active form. The words here
   are literally "the sacrificers of men," which certainly can never mean
   the men who sacrifice. The words are not in apposition but in regimine.
   We have in Deuteronomy 18:3, hzvch zvchy, "the sacrificers of the
   sacrifice," a phrase similar to the present.

   Hosea 13:14, From the power of the grave would I redeem thee, etc. The
   conditional form is adopted by Grotius and others, but disapproved by
   Horsley, Newcome, and Henderson. When we consider what precedes this
   verse, and what follows it, the condition seems the most suitable. Then
   the expression, "repentance is hid from my eyes," appears more
   consistent with a threatening than with a promise, especially as the
   threatening is continued in the next verse. To repent of evil, and not
   of good, is the phrase usually found in the Old Testament. It is true
   that Paul makes use of the expression with regard to the gifts of God,
   (Romans 11:29,) but the context here seems to favor the other notion.

   Hosea 14:2, Bring good. Horsley reads, "Accept the good;" Newcome, "Let
   us receive good;" Henderson, "Graciously receive us." [82] The words
   are vqch-tvv, literally, "and receive," or "bring good." The verb means
   simply to "take'" but then it is used to express taking for one's self
   in the sense of receiving, and taking for another in the sense of
   bringing. Naaman said to Elisha, qch n' vrkh, "Take," or "receive, I
   pray, a blessing," 2 Kings 5:15; and Jacob said to Joseph, qchm-n' 'ly,
   "Take," or "bring them, I pray, to me," Genesis 48:9. See also Genesis
   15:9; 2 Kings 2:20. So the meaning may be either that given by Horsley
   or by Calvin; and as the latter is more consonant with this passage,
   and does not blend in sense, as the former does, with the next clause
   in the verse, it ought to be preferred. But the Bishop's note must be
   added, -- "Take away all iniquity, i.e., Take away entirely the sinful
   principle within us. Take away the carnal heart of the old Adam. Create
   in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. And
   then, when we are thus begotten again unto holiness by thy Spirit,
   accept the good, accept as good, what, so regenerate, we shall be
   enabled to perform." All this is perfectly true; but the former part is
   not an explanation of the text; for to take away sin does not mean the
   renewal of the heart, but the forgiveness of sin. Though they be two
   gracious acts which go together, they are yet wholly separate and
   distinct; and to confound them may lead to serious mistakes.

   The same verb is used at the beginning of the verse, Take, or bring
   with you words. As they were to bring words of confession and prayer,
   so God is solicited to bring good; and to bring good very suitably
   follows the taking away of iniquity; and then follows the gratitude
   that is required.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] "Do ye think there was more iniquity in the Gileadites, that are
   already carried away captive, than in you? Surely the rest of Israel is
   in the same case; they all lie open to the same judgement. ... They
   sacrifice to their idols in Gilgal also." -- Bishop Hall, quoted by
   Scott.

   [80] "God says to the Prophet, Instead of turning to me and keeping to
   the works of charity and justice, he is a mere heathen huckster. Thou
   hast miscalled him Jacob; he is Canaan; not Jacob, the godly, the heir
   of the promise; [but] Canaan, the cheat, the sone of the curse." --
   Bishop Horsely.

   [81] This refers to the meeting or assembling of the people in the
   wilderness to the tabernacle. The tabernacle was called 'chl mvr, the
   tabernacle of meeting, the very word used here. See Exod. 25:22; 30:36.
   But if mvr yty designate the days of the annual feast of the
   tabernacles, yet they must be viewed here, as Scott says, with
   reference only to the manner in which they lived in the wilderness.

   [82] The Doctor says, that Horsely is wrong in his philogy in this
   instance, and adds, that mvk is used adverbially. No instance is given;
   and it is difficult to find one. Let it be adduced, and then the
   philogical accurateness of this rendering shall be allowed. The fact
   is, that in Hebrew very few words of this kind are taken adverbially:
   the language deals very sparingly in adverbs. -- Ed

   ADDenda to Joel

   Joel 1:4, The residue of the locusts, etc. "A comparison," says Dr.
   Henderson, "of the different passages in which these names occur,
   renders it more than probable that they are here employed by the
   Prophet, not with any reference to the species into which the locusts
   may be scientifically divided, but to designate four successive swarms,
   according to certain destructive qualities, by which, as a genus of
   insects, they are distinguished, and thereby to heighten the terror
   which this description was intended to produce."

   Mercerius, as quoted in Poli Syn., tells us, that almost all divines,
   both ancient and modern, understood this narrative of the locusts
   allegorically; and it appears that, according to some, they designate
   the four incursions of the Chaldeans into the land, that is, by
   Tiglathpileser, Shalmanezer, Sennacherib, and Nebuchadnezzar; or,
   according to Cyril, by Shalmanezer, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, and the
   Romans; or, according to Jerome, the four empires which successively
   ruled over the Jews, the first locust representing the Chaldeans, --
   the second, the Medes and Persians, -- the third, the Macedonians, --
   and the fourth, the Romans. But these are hallucinations and not
   expositions. Much more appropriate is the opinion stated and approved
   by Henderson, that in this chapter Joel describes a devastation of the
   country by natural locusts; and that in the second he predicts a
   devastation by the Assyrians in a language highly metaphorical,
   borrowed in some measure from the scene described here; and this is
   exactly the view of Calvin.

   Joel 2:12, But even now, etc. Our version, "Therefor also now," is not
   so emphatical as that of Calvin. The full meaning has been perceived by
   Newcome, "Yet even now," though omitted by Henderson, whose rendering
   is, "Now therefore," which comes short of our common version.

   Joel 2:13, For he is propitious, etc. It is of great importance that
   this declaration of what God is should be correctly rendered. Newcome's
   version is the same with our common translation. Henderson's is
   different; it is this, --

   "For he is pitiful and compassionate,
   Long-suffering and of great mercy,
   And repenteth of the evil."

   The first, chnvn, is not "pitiful," but gracious, benevolent,
   propitious, gratuitously kind, favorable to the undeserving; it comes
   from chn, to show favor or kindness; and the last letter being doubled,
   it may be rendered, very kind, or very gracious. The second is rchvm,
   which more properly means pitiful, but rightly rendered,
   "compassionate," rather than "merciful," as in our version. The third,
   'rk 'phym, is better expressed by "slow to anger," or to wrath, than by
   "long-suffering." The fourth is, rv-chsd, much, or abundant in
   goodness: the word chsd is sometimes rendered mercy, but not properly;
   it means overflowing goodness, or exuberant benevolence. Adam Clarke
   has given an accurate description of these terms: -- "gracious -- good
   and benevolent in his own nature, -- merciful -- pitying and forgiving,
   -- slow to anger -- not easily provoked to punish, -- of great kindness
   -- exuberant goodness to all them who return to him."

   Joel 2:14, who knows, etc. Henderson has been very felicitous in his
   version of this line, --

   "Who knoweth? He may turn and repent."

   It is an instance of the potential or subjunctive meaning of the future
   tense in Hebrew; which is the case probably much oftener than what is
   generally thought. But not so felicitous is the rendering of chvsh, in
   verse 17, by "Have pity." The meaning of the verb is, no doubt to
   spare, as it is rendered, I believe, uniformly in our version. It may
   be seen in connection with two other verbs, which include the ideas of
   pity and sympathy, in Jeremiah 13:14; 21:7

   Joel 2:20, For high hath he exalted himself to do his purpose. Both
   Newcome and Henderson retain the common version, only the former reads,
   "Though," instead of "because he hath done great things." ky hgdyl
   lsvt, "For he made himself great in (or, by) doing," or, "Became great
   in doing." It is the greatness of the doer that is set forth, rather
   than of the things done. Henderson very justly observes, that those
   words "convey the idea of moral agency, and can with no propriety be
   interpreted of the locusts." Exactly the same words are adopted in the
   next verse in reference to God.

   Joel 2:25, My great army, etc. Newcome says, "We have here a key to the
   grand and beautiful description which runs through these two chapters."
   He considered that the Prophet is to be understood throughout "as
   foretelling a plague of locusts." But this can be no key to such an
   interpretation, for what is said in this verse coalesces much better
   with the other view. On the supposition that there had been locusts, as
   related in the first chapter, and that the Prophet threatens a heavier
   judgment in this, which could only be prevented by repentance, to which
   he exhorts them, it appears most appropriate for him to say, that not
   only "the Northlander," of whose invasion he had spoken, would be
   driven away and destroyed, but that also the devastations already
   produced by the locusts would be repaired. So far then is this verse
   from being a key to the proposed interpretation, that it is much more
   suitable to the other.

   Joel 2:30, And I will set prodigies, etc. Calvin extends the range of
   these prodigies beyond what most commentators do. They are viewed by
   most as those prodigies, recorded even by the historian Josephus, which
   preceded the overthrow of the city and the temple by the Romans, when
   the whole kingdom, in a civil and ecclesiastical sense, was completely
   abolished. The day of the Lord, as mentioned here, has therefore been
   regarded as the day or time when this awful calamity happened to the
   Jews: but Calvin regards it as the day of final judgment. There is no
   doubt much truth in what he says about prodigies or awful judgments
   ever accompanying the gospel, not as its effects, but as visitations
   for unbelief, and willful and malicious opposition to it. There is much
   in the history of the world in confirmation of what he advances. The
   determinate suppression of the gospel by those who had opportunity of
   knowing it, or the evident depravation of it either by the influence of
   infidelity or of superstition, have often been visited in this world
   with awful judgments, such as wars and political disturbances.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Addenda to AMOS

   Amos 2:7, Who pant, etc. Our common version is the literal one, which
   is followed by Henderson, but altered for the worse by Newcome, who was
   led astray by Hobigant and the Septuagint. Not only are the words
   inverted, but a change is made in the verb, without the authority of
   any MS. It is a strong mode of expression to set forth the extreme
   cruelty and avariciousness of the persons referred to. "They even
   begrudged them," as Henderson observes, "the small quantity of dust
   they had cast on their heads in token of mourning:" or, as Parkhurst
   says, They "longed to see the poor and miserable still more wretched: a
   most diabolical character surely!" To cast dust on the head was then
   customary in seasons of great distress. See Job 2:12; Ezekiel 27:30;
   and 2 Samuel 13:19

   Amos 3:5, Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth without a fowler?
   etc. Newcome, with whom Henderson materially agrees, renders this verse
   differently, --

   "Can a bird fall into a snare upon the earth,
   Where no gin is set for him?
   Will a snare spring from the ground,
   When it hath not taken anything?"

   The comparison is more appropriate according to the version of Calvin;
   and the probability is that it is the right one. The word mvqs,
   rendered, "gin" by Newcome, as it is in our version, is considered by
   Henderson as redundant; and this very circumstance creates a suspicion
   that the passage is not rightly understood. This word is often rendered
   in our version "snare," but it means more properly the act, ensnaring,
   than the instrument, snare: and it may be considered here a Hiphil
   participle -- "he who ensnares," or, "the ensnarer." It is rendered
   hixeutes, a bird catcher by the Septuagint. Then the two following
   lines will admit naturally of Calvin's rendering, and there will be no
   need of having recourse to Henderson's "elastic snare," or to Adam
   Clarke's "spring-trap," neither of which is, I believe, intended by the
   word phch, which signifies a snare spread out, or an expanded net. See
   Job 18:9; Psalm 140:5; 142:3

   Amos 4:3, And ye shall cast yourselves down from the palace. This
   difficult line is variously rendered. Dathius renders it, "To Amenia
   shall ye be led away;" Newcome, following Houbigant, who always mends
   the text, "And I will cast it forth, and will utterly destroy it;"
   Henderson, "Ye shall be even thrown out of the palace;" and Horsley,
   following Parkhurst, "And ye shall be thrown into the shambles." The
   whole difficulty lies in the word hhrmvnh, found only here. The idea of
   shambles agrees well with the context, in which cows are mentioned.
   Parkhurst, after Schultens, derives it from hrm, not found in Hebrew as
   a verb, but it means in Arabic, "to cut into small pieces." Hence as a
   noun, hrmvn seems to denote the place in which meat is thus cut. The h,
   as Parkhurst observes, is evidently radical, as it is preceded by h
   servile. This appears to be the best solution of the difficulty.

   Amos 4:5, And burn incense, etc. The word for incense is not in the
   form of a verb. Both Houbigant and Horsley take it here not a verb but
   a noun: but their transpositions are by no means necessary. The latter
   part of the fourth verse, and the whole of this, I would render thus,
   --

   And bring, in the morning, your sacrifices,
   In the third year, your tithes,

   5. And incense with the leaven of thank-offering,
   Yea, publish vows, proclaim them;
   For thus ye love to do, O children of Israel,
   Saith the Lord Jehovah.


   Amos 5:24, And run down, etc.,

   "But judgment shall come rolling on like waters,
   And justice like a resistless torrent.

   "That is, the irresistible judgment and justice of God shall come upon
   those hypocrites like an inundation, and sweep them away like a
   torrent." -- Horsley.

   Amos 6:1, which have been renowned, etc. Various are the expositions of
   this and the following line. Newcome's version overleaps the rule of
   grammar, --

   "That are named after the chief of the nations,
   And to them the house of Israel resort."

   The explanation is this, -- "They call themselves, not after their
   religious ancestors, but after the chief of the idolatrous nations,
   with whom they intermarry contrary to their law." How foreign to
   everything in the context is this! Henderson's rendering is more like a
   version of the original, --

   "The distinguished men of the first of nations,
   To whom the house of Israel come."

   He considers that the chief persons of the Hebrew nation are here
   spoken of, to whom the house of Israel, the community, came for
   judgment: and this has little to do with the context. Horsley seems to
   have given the most literal version, and the most suitable to this
   place, --

   "Marking out the first of the nations,
   Go unto them, O house of Israel.

   And then the Prophet mentions in the next who these nations were, "Pass
   over," he says, "into Calneh," etc. So that this distich is connected
   with the following verses. For nqvy, one copy of Kennicott has nqvv,
   "Mark ye out," or, notice; this would make the line complete. Though
   the Septuagint here goes much astray, yet it gives the verb used here
   in the third person plural: and that person in Hebrew is the same as
   the second person plural of the imperative.

   Amos 9:12, That possess they may, etc. Both this and the preceding
   verse are quoted, in Acts 15:16, 17, not literally, but mainly from the
   Septuagint, which differs considerably in words, but not in sense, from
   the Hebrew. Newcome, with the view of producing a verbal agreement, has
   changed and altered the Hebrew text without the authority of a single
   MS. This is rightly disapproved both by Adam Clarke and Henderson. The
   former says, "We must dismiss all these conjectural emendations, and
   take the Hebrew text as we find it. That it speaks of the conversion of
   the Jews in gospel times, we have the authority of the New Testament;
   and if we cannot make the words, as they stand there, entirely to agree
   with the words here, the subject is not affected by it."
